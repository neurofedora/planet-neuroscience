	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: ZnT2 is an electroneutral proton-coupled vesicular antiporter displaying an apparent stoichiometry of two protons per zinc ion</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/sRZv0HVI_Gw/article</link>

Zinc is a vital trace element crucial for the proper function of some 3,000 cellular proteins. Specifically, zinc is essential for key physiological processes including nucleic acid metabolism, regulation of gene expression, signal transduction, cell division, immune- and nervous system functions, wound healing, and apoptosis. Consequently, impairment of zinc homeostasis disrupts key cellular functions resulting in various human pathologies. Mammalian zinc transport proceeds via two transporter families ZnT and ZIP. However, the detailed mechanism of action of ZnT2, which is responsible for vesicular zinc accumulation and zinc secretion into breast milk during lactation, is currently unknown. Moreover, although the putative coupling of zinc transport to the proton gradient in acidic vesicles has been suggested, it has not been conclusively established. Herein we modeled the mechanism of action of ZnT2 and demonstrated both computationally and experimentally, using functional zinc transport assays, that ZnT2 is indeed a proton-coupled zinc antiporter. Bafilomycin A1, a specific inhibitor of vacuolar-type proton ATPase (V-ATPase) which alkalizes acidic vesicles, abolished ZnT2-dependent zinc transport into intracellular vesicles. Moreover, using LysoTracker Red and Lyso-pHluorin, we further showed that upon transient ZnT2 overexpression in intracellular vesicles and addition of exogenous zinc, the vesicular pH underwent alkalization, presumably due to a proton-zinc antiport; this phenomenon was reversed in the presence of TPEN, a specific zinc chelator. Finally, based on computational energy calculations, we propose that ZnT2 functions as an antiporter with a stoichiometry of 2H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; ion. Hence, ZnT2 is a proton motive force-driven, electroneutral vesicular zinc exchanger, concentrating zinc in acidic vesicles on the expense of proton extrusion to the cytoplasm.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/sRZv0HVI_Gw&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Identification of pathways associated with chemosensitivity through network embedding</title>

Basal gene expression levels have been shown to be predictive of cellular response to cytotoxic treatments. However, such analyses do not fully reveal complex genotype- phenotype relationships, which are partly encoded in highly interconnected molecular networks. Biological pathways provide a complementary way of understanding drug response variation among individuals. In this study, we integrate chemosensitivity data from a large-scale pharmacogenomics study with basal gene expression data from the CCLE project and prior knowledge of molecular networks to identify specific pathways mediating chemical response. We first develop a computational method called PACER, which ranks pathways for enrichment in a given set of genes using a novel network embedding method. It examines a molecular network that encodes known gene-gene as well as gene-pathway relationships, and determines a vector representation of each gene and pathway in the same low-dimensional vector space. The relevance of a pathway to the given gene set is then captured by the similarity between the pathway vector and gene vectors. To apply this approach to chemosensitivity data, we identify genes whose basal expression levels in a panel of cell lines are correlated with cytotoxic response to a compound, and then rank pathways for relevance to these response-correlated genes using PACER. Extensive evaluation of this approach on benchmarks constructed from databases of compound target genes and large collections of drug response signatures demonstrates its advantages in identifying compound-pathway associations compared to existing statistical methods of pathway enrichment analysis. The associations identified by PACER can serve as testable hypotheses on chemosensitivity pathways and help further study the mechanisms of action of specific cytotoxic drugs. More broadly, PACER represents a novel technique of identifying enriched properties of any gene set of interest while also taking into account networks of known gene-gene relationships and interactions.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/ZzNZeiRYbRM&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: An agent-based model of dengue virus transmission shows how uncertainty about breakthrough infections influences vaccination impact projections</title>

Prophylactic vaccination is a powerful tool for reducing the burden of infectious diseases, due to a combination of direct protection of vaccinees and indirect protection of others via herd immunity. Computational models play an important role in devising strategies for vaccination by making projections of its impacts on public health. Such projections are subject to uncertainty about numerous factors, however. For example, many vaccine efficacy trials focus on measuring protection against disease rather than protection against infection, leaving the extent of breakthrough infections (i.e., disease ameliorated but infection unimpeded) among vaccinees unknown. Our goal in this study was to quantify the extent to which uncertainty about breakthrough infections results in uncertainty about vaccination impact, with a focus on vaccines for dengue. To realistically account for the many forms of heterogeneity in dengue virus (DENV) transmission, which could have implications for the dynamics of indirect protection, we used a stochastic, agent-based model for DENV transmission informed by more than a decade of empirical studies in the city of Iquitos, Peru. Following 20 years of routine vaccination of nine-year-old children at 80% coverage, projections of the proportion of disease episodes averted varied by a factor of 1.76 (95% CI: 1.54–2.06) across the range of uncertainty about breakthrough infections. This was equivalent to the range of vaccination impact projected across a range of uncertainty about vaccine efficacy of 0.268 (95% CI: 0.210–0.329). Until uncertainty about breakthrough infections can be addressed empirically, our results demonstrate the importance of accounting for it in models of vaccination impact.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/95Qqs3pfPg8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Circuit Dysfunction in SOD1-ALS Model First Detected in Sensory Feedback Prior to Motor Neuron Degeneration Is Alleviated by BMP Signaling</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/12/2347?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a devastating neurodegenerative disease for which the origin and underlying cellular defects are not fully understood. Although motor neuron degeneration is the signature feature of ALS, it is not clear whether motor neurons or other cells of the motor circuit are the site of disease initiation. To better understand the contribution of multiple cell types in ALS, we made use of a &lt;i&gt;Drosophila Sod1&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;G85R&lt;/sup&gt; knock-in model, in which all cells harbor the disease allele. End-stage &lt;i&gt;dSod1&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;G85R&lt;/sup&gt; animals of both sexes exhibit severe motor deficits with clear degeneration of motor neurons. Interestingly, earlier in &lt;i&gt;dSod1&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;G85R&lt;/sup&gt; larvae, motor function is also compromised, but their motor neurons exhibit only subtle morphological and electrophysiological changes that are unlikely to cause the observed decrease in locomotion. We analyzed the intact motor circuit and identified a defect in sensory feedback that likely accounts for the altered motor activity of &lt;i&gt;dSod1&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;G85R&lt;/sup&gt;. We found cell-autonomous activation of bone morphogenetic protein signaling in proprioceptor sensory neurons which are critical for the relay of the contractile status of muscles back to the central nerve cord, completely rescues early-stage motor defects and partially rescue late-stage motor function to extend lifespan. Identification of a defect in sensory feedback as a potential initiating event in ALS motor dysfunction, coupled with the ability of modified proprioceptors to alleviate such motor deficits, underscores the critical role that nonmotor neurons play in disease progression and highlights their potential as a site to identify early-stage ALS biomarkers and for therapeutic intervention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; At diagnosis, many cellular processes are already disrupted in the amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) patient. Identifying the initiating cellular events is critical for achieving an earlier diagnosis to slow or prevent disease progression. Our findings indicate that neurons relaying sensory information underlie early stage motor deficits in a &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; knock-in model of ALS that best replicates gene dosage in familial ALS (fALS). Importantly, studies on intact motor circuits revealed defects in sensory feedback before evidence of motor neuron degeneration. These findings strengthen our understanding of how neural circuit dysfunctions lead to neurodegeneration and, coupled with our demonstration that the activation of bone morphogenetic protein signaling in proprioceptors alleviates both early and late motor dysfunction, underscores the importance of considering nonmotor neurons as therapeutic targets.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Regulatory T Cells and Their Derived Cytokine, Interleukin-35, Reduce Pain in Experimental Autoimmune Encephalomyelitis</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/12/2326?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Sensory problems such as neuropathic pain are common and debilitating symptoms in multiple sclerosis (MS), an autoimmune inflammatory disorder of the CNS. Regulatory T (Treg) cells are critical for maintaining immune homeostasis, but their role in MS-associated pain remains unknown. Here, we demonstrate that Treg cell ablation is sufficient to trigger experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) and facial allodynia in immunized female mice. In EAE-induced female mice, adoptive transfer of Treg cells and spinal delivery of the Treg cell cytokine interleukin-35 (IL-35) significantly reduced facial stimulus-evoked pain and spontaneous pain independent of disease severity and increased myelination of the facial nociceptive pathway. The effects of intrathecal IL-35 therapy were Treg-cell dependent and associated with upregulated IL-10 expression in CNS-infiltrating lymphocytes and reduced monocyte infiltration in the trigeminal afferent pathway. We present evidence for a beneficial role of Treg cells and IL-35 in attenuating pain associated with EAE independently of motor symptoms by decreasing neuroinflammation and increasing myelination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Pain is a highly prevalent symptom affecting the majority of multiple sclerosis (MS) patients and dramatically affects overall health-related quality of life; however, this is a research area that has been largely ignored. Here, we identify for the first time a role for regulatory T (Treg) cells and interleukin-35 (IL-35) in suppressing facial allodynia and facial grimacing in animals with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). We demonstrate that spinal delivery of Treg cells and IL-35 reduces pain associated with EAE by decreasing neuroinflammation and increasing myelination independently of motor symptoms. These findings increase our understanding of the mechanisms underlying pain in EAE and suggest potential treatment strategies for pain relief in MS.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Optogenetic Stimulation of the Superior Colliculus Confers Retinal Neuroprotection in a Mouse Glaucoma Model</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/12/2313?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Glaucoma is characterized by a progressive loss of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) in the eye, which ultimately results in visual impairment or even blindness. Because current therapies often fail to halt disease progression, there is an unmet need for novel neuroprotective therapies to support RGC survival. Various research lines suggest that visual target centers in the brain support RGC functioning and survival. Here, we explored whether increasing neuronal activity in one of these projection areas could improve survival of RGCs in a mouse glaucoma model. Prolonged activation of an important murine RGC target area, the superior colliculus (SC), was established via a novel optogenetic stimulation paradigm. By leveraging the unique channel kinetics of the stabilized step function opsin (SSFO), protracted stimulation of the SC was achieved with only a brief light pulse. SSFO-mediated collicular stimulation was confirmed by immunohistochemistry for the immediate-early gene c-Fos and behavioral tracking, which both demonstrated consistent neuronal activity upon repeated stimulation. Finally, the neuroprotective potential of optogenetic collicular stimulation was investigated in mice of either sex subjected to a glaucoma model and a 63% reduction in RGC loss was found. This work describes a new paradigm for optogenetic collicular stimulation and a first demonstration that increasing target neuron activity can increase survival of the projecting neurons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Despite glaucoma being a leading cause of blindness and visual impairment worldwide, no curative therapies exist. This study describes a novel paradigm to reduce retinal ganglion cell (RGC) degeneration underlying glaucoma. Building on previous observations that RGC survival is supported by the target neurons to which they project and using an innovative optogenetic approach, we increased neuronal activity in the mouse superior colliculus, a main projection target of rodent RGCs. This proved to be efficient in reducing RGC loss in a glaucoma model. Our findings establish a new optogenetic paradigm for target stimulation and encourage further exploration of the molecular signaling pathways mediating retrograde neuroprotective communication.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Distinct Neural Mechanisms of Spatial Attention and Expectation Guide Perceptual Inference in a Multisensory World</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/12/2301?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Spatial attention (i.e., task-relevance) and expectation (i.e., signal probability) are two critical top-down mechanisms guiding perceptual inference. Spatial attention prioritizes processing of information at task-relevant locations. Spatial expectations encode the statistical structure of the environment. An unresolved question is how the brain allocates attention and forms expectations in a multisensory environment, where task-relevance and signal probability over space can differ across sensory modalities. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging in human participants (female and male) to investigate whether the brain encodes task-relevance and signal probability over space separately or interactively across sensory modalities. In a novel multisensory paradigm, we manipulated spatial attention and expectation selectively in audition and assessed their effects on behavioral and neural responses to auditory and visual stimuli. Our results show that both auditory and visual stimuli increased activations in a right-lateralized frontoparietal system, when they were presented at locations that were task-irrelevant in audition. Yet, only auditory stimuli increased activations in the medial prefrontal cortex when presented at expected locations and in audiovisual and frontoparietal cortices signaling a prediction error when presented at unexpected locations. This dissociation in multisensory generalization for attention and expectation effects shows that the brain controls attentional resources interactively across the senses but encodes the statistical structure of the environment as spatial expectations independently for each sensory system. Our results demonstrate that spatial attention and expectation engage partly overlapping neural systems via distinct mechanisms to guide perceptual inference in a multisensory world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; In our natural environment the brain is exposed to a constant influx of signals through all our senses. How does the brain allocate attention and form spatial expectations in this multisensory environment? Because observers need to respond to stimuli regardless of their sensory modality, they may allocate attentional resources and encode the probability of events jointly across the senses. This psychophysics and neuroimaging study shows that the brain controls attentional resources interactively across the senses via a frontoparietal system but encodes the statistical structure of the environment independently for each sense in sensory and frontoparietal areas. Thus, spatial attention and expectation engage partly overlapping neural systems via distinct mechanisms to guide perceptual inference in a multisensory world.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: The Pain of Sleep Loss: A Brain Characterization in Humans</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/12/2291?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Sleep loss increases the experience of pain. However, the brain mechanisms underlying altered pain processing following sleep deprivation are unknown. Moreover, it remains unclear whether ecologically modest night-to-night changes in sleep, within an individual, confer consequential day-to-day changes in experienced pain. Here, we demonstrate that acute sleep deprivation amplifies pain reactivity within human (male and female) primary somatosensory cortex yet blunts pain reactivity in higher-order valuation and decision-making regions of the striatum and insula cortex. Consistent with this altered neural signature, we further show that sleep deprivation expands the temperature range for classifying a stimulus as painful, specifically through a lowering of pain thresholds. Moreover, the degree of amplified reactivity within somatosensory cortex following sleep deprivation significantly predicts this expansion of experienced pain across individuals. Finally, outside of the laboratory setting, we similarly show that even modest nightly changes in sleep quality (increases and decreases) within an individual determine consequential day-to-day changes in experienced pain (decreases and increases, respectively). Together, these data provide a novel framework underlying the impact of sleep loss on pain and, furthermore, establish that the association between sleep and pain is expressed in a night-to-day, bidirectional relationship within a sample of the general population. More broadly, our findings highlight sleep as a novel therapeutic target for pain management within and outside the clinic, including circumstances where sleep is frequently short yet pain is abundant (e.g., the hospital setting).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Are you experiencing pain? Did you have a bad night of sleep? This study provides underlying brain and behavioral mechanisms explaining this common co-occurrence. We show that sleep deprivation enhances pain responsivity within the primary sensing regions of the brain's cortex yet blunts activity in other regions that modulate pain processing, the striatum and insula. We further establish that even subtle night-to-night changes in sleep in a sample of the general population predict consequential day-to-day changes in pain (bidirectionally). Considering the societal rise in chronic pain conditions in lock-step with the decline in sleep time through the industrial world, our data support the hypothesis that these two trends may not simply be co-occurring but are significantly interrelated.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: The Ventral Midline Thalamus Mediates Hippocampal Spatial Information Processes upon Spatial Cue Changes</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/12/2276?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The ventral midline thalamus, consisting of the reuniens and rhomboid nuclei (RE/Rh), is a thalamic structure interconnected with the limbic systems including the hippocampus. Recently, many studies have revealed that this structure plays distinctive roles in spatial learning and memory in collaboration with hippocampal functions. However, what aspects of spatial information process are influenced by the RE/Rh is not clearly known. To elucidate the roles of RE/Rh in spatial information processing and its effects on hippocampal activity, specifically with the manipulation of spatial contents, we measured hippocampal-dependent spatial memory performance and hippocampal place cell activities after RE/Rh lesion using male C57BL/6J &lt;font face=&quot;arial,helvetica&quot;&gt;x&lt;/font&gt; 129/SvJae hybrid mice. We found that the lesion altered the behavioral aptitude in recognizing locational changes of an object. Furthermore, CA1 place cells in the lesion group showed different spatial representation patterns in recognizing the environment with cue locational changes compared with the control group. Interestingly, the patterns of CA1 place cells in recognizing the same environment previously visited were not disrupted in the lesion group compared with the control group. These findings demonstrate that the ventral midline thalamus (RE/Rh) is important in recognizing the spatial relationships, especially when spatial rearrangement of cue position was introduced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The ventral midline thalamic nuclei (reuniens and rhomboid) interact with the hippocampus to influence various cognitive functions requiring spatial memories, yet what aspects of spatial information process are influenced by these nuclei is not clearly known. Here, we reveal that these nuclei play a crucial role in modulating hippocampal properties only with locational rearrangement of cues, not with the familiar arrangement. These nuclei are distinctively involved in cue-dependent spatial information processes of CA1 place cells. In particular, we suggest that these nuclei modulate spatial information processing on discrete components, especially when the spatial cue relationship is modified.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Sensory Representations Supporting Memory Specificity: Age Effects on Behavioral and Neural Discriminability</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/12/2265?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Older adults' difficulty in distinguishing between old and new information contributes to memory decline, which may occur because older adults are less likely than young adults to retrieve specific sensory details necessary to distinguish between similar items. In male and female human subjects, the present study measured the extent of age differences in the specificity of memory representations using a false memory paradigm in which studied items were linked to retrieval items at multiple levels of similarity. Older adults showed poorer behavioral discrimination than young adults, driven primarily by false recognition of lures that differed from targets only in perceptual details. Patterns of activation across several regions within ventral visual cortex could be used to distinguish between targets and lures when they differed in both perceptual details and a semantic label. However, of ventral visual regions, only signals in the midline occipital cortex could be used to distinguish targets from lures when they differed only in perceptual details. Although there was an overall age deficit for this neural discrimination in this region, the positive relationship between neural and behavioral discriminability did not differ across age groups. In contrast, age moderated the relationship between neural and behavioral discriminability in lateral occipital and fusiform cortices, suggesting that activation patterns within these regions represent different types of information in each age group. Therefore, the quality of perceptual signals is a key contributor to memory discrimination across age groups, with evidence that age differences in the nature of representations emerges outside early visual cortex.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Age-related memory decline is due in part to older adults' difficulties in discriminating between old and new information. We tested whether this deficit arises from lack of specificity in the sensory representations underlying older adults' recognition judgments. Using pattern classification analyses in ventral visual cortices, we found that signals in a region early in the visual stream could distinguish between targets and lures at the highest level of similarity. The discriminability of targets and lures in this region was positively related to behavioral discriminability across age groups despite an overall age deficit in classification accuracy. Together, results showed that older adults' memory deficits are related to reduced discriminability of cognitive processes (old/new recognition) in portions of visual cortex.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Errors in Action Timing and Inhibition Facilitate Learning by Tuning Distinct Mechanisms in the Underlying Decision Process</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/12/2251?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Goal-directed behavior requires integrating action selection processes with learning systems that adapt control using environmental feedback. These functions are known to intersect at a common neural substrate with multiple known targets of plasticity (the cortico-basal ganglia-thalamic network), suggesting that feedback signals have a multifaceted impact on future decisions. Using a hybrid of accumulation-to-bound decision models and reinforcement learning, we modeled the performance of humans in a stop signal task where participants (N 75: 37 males, 38 females) learned the prior distribution of the timing of a stop signal through trial-and-error feedback. Changes in the drift rate of the action execution process were driven by errors in action timing, whereas adaptation in the boundary height served to increase caution following failed stops. These findings highlight two interactive learning mechanisms for adapting the control of goal-directed actions based on dissociable dimensions of feedback error.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Many complex behavioral goals rely on the ability to regulate the timing of action execution while also maintaining enough control to cancel actions in response to &quot;Stop&quot; cues in the environment. Here we examined how these fundamental components of behavior become tuned to the control demands of the environment by combining principles of reinforcement learning with accumulation-to-bound models. Model fits to behavioral data in an adaptive stop signal task revealed two adaptive mechanisms: (1) timing error-related changes in the rate of the execution signal; and (2) an increase in the execution boundary after failed stops. These findings demonstrate unique effects of timing and control errors on the underlying mechanisms of control, the rate and threshold of accumulating action signals.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Dorsal Horn Gastrin-Releasing Peptide Expressing Neurons Transmit Spinal Itch But Not Pain Signals</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/12/2238?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP) is a spinal itch transmitter expressed by a small population of dorsal horn interneurons (GRP neurons). The contribution of these neurons to spinal itch relay is still only incompletely understood, and their potential contribution to pain-related behaviors remains controversial. Here, we have addressed this question in a series of experiments performed in &lt;i&gt;GRP::cre&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;GRP::eGFP&lt;/i&gt; transgenic male mice. We combined behavioral tests with neuronal circuit tracing, morphology, chemogenetics, optogenetics, and electrophysiology to obtain a more comprehensive picture. We found that GRP neurons form a rather homogeneous population of central cell-like excitatory neurons located in lamina II of the superficial dorsal horn. Multicolor high-resolution confocal microscopy and optogenetic experiments demonstrated that GRP neurons receive direct input from MrgprA3-positive pruritoceptors. Anterograde HSV-based neuronal tracing initiated from GRP neurons revealed ascending polysynaptic projections to distinct areas and nuclei in the brainstem, midbrain, thalamus, and the somatosensory cortex. Spinally restricted ablation of GRP neurons reduced itch-related behaviors to different pruritogens, whereas their chemogenetic excitation elicited itch-like behaviors and facilitated responses to several pruritogens. By contrast, responses to painful stimuli remained unaltered. These data confirm a critical role of dorsal horn GRP neurons in spinal itch transmission but do not support a role in pain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Dorsal horn gastrin-releasing peptide neurons serve a well-established function in the spinal transmission of pruritic (itch) signals. A potential role in the transmission of nociceptive (pain) signals has remained controversial. Our results provide further support for a critical role of dorsal horn gastrin-releasing peptide neurons in itch circuits, but we failed to find evidence supporting a role in pain.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Voltage-Dependent Membrane Properties Shape the Size But Not the Frequency Content of Spontaneous Voltage Fluctuations in Layer 2/3 Somatosensory Cortex</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/12/2221?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Under awake and idling conditions, spontaneous intracellular membrane voltage is characterized by large, synchronous, low-frequency fluctuations. Although these properties reflect correlations in synaptic inputs, intrinsic membrane properties often indicate voltage-dependent changes in membrane resistance and time constant values that can amplify and help to generate low-frequency voltage fluctuations. The specific contribution of intrinsic and synaptic factors to the generation of spontaneous fluctuations, however, remains poorly understood. Using visually guided intracellular recordings of somatosensory layer 2/3 pyramidal cells and interneurons in awake male and female mice, we measured the spectrum and size of voltage fluctuation and intrinsic cellular properties at different voltages. In both cell types, depolarizing neurons increased the size of voltage fluctuations. Amplitude changes scaled with voltage-dependent changes in membrane input resistance. Because of the small membrane time constants observed in both pyramidal cells and interneuron cell bodies, the low-frequency content of membrane fluctuations reflects correlations in the synaptic current inputs rather than significant filtering associated with membrane capacitance. Further, blocking synaptic inputs minimally altered somatic membrane resistance and time constant values. Overall, these results indicate that spontaneous synaptic inputs generate a low-conductance state in which the amplitude, but not frequency structure, is influenced by intrinsic membrane properties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; In the absence of sensory drive, cortical activity in awake animals is associated with self-generated and seemingly random membrane voltage fluctuations characterized by large amplitude and low frequency. Partially, these properties reflect correlations in synaptic input. Nonetheless, neurons express voltage-dependent intrinsic properties that can potentially influence the amplitude and frequency of spontaneous activity. Using visually guided intracellular recordings of cortical neurons in awake mice, we measured the voltage dependence of spontaneous voltage fluctuations and intrinsic membrane properties. We show that voltage-dependent changes in membrane resistance amplify synaptic activity, whereas the frequency of voltage fluctuations reflects correlations in synaptic inputs. Last, synaptic activity has a small impact on intrinsic membrane properties in both pyramidal cells and interneurons.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Representation of Auditory Motion Directions and Sound Source Locations in the Human Planum Temporale</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/12/2208?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The ability to compute the location and direction of sounds is a crucial perceptual skill to efficiently interact with dynamic environments. How the human brain implements spatial hearing is, however, poorly understood. In our study, we used fMRI to characterize the brain activity of male and female humans listening to sounds moving left, right, up, and down as well as static sounds. Whole-brain univariate results contrasting moving and static sounds varying in their location revealed a robust functional preference for auditory motion in bilateral human planum temporale (hPT). Using independently localized hPT, we show that this region contains information about auditory motion directions and, to a lesser extent, sound source locations. Moreover, hPT showed an axis of motion organization reminiscent of the functional organization of the middle-temporal cortex (hMT+/V5) for vision. Importantly, whereas motion direction and location rely on partially shared pattern geometries in hPT, as demonstrated by successful cross-condition decoding, the responses elicited by static and moving sounds were, however, significantly distinct. Altogether, our results demonstrate that the hPT codes for auditory motion and location but that the underlying neural computation linked to motion processing is more reliable and partially distinct from the one supporting sound source location.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Compared with what we know about visual motion, little is known about how the brain implements spatial hearing. Our study reveals that motion directions and sound source locations can be reliably decoded in the human planum temporale (hPT) and that they rely on partially shared pattern geometries. Our study, therefore, sheds important new light on how computing the location or direction of sounds is implemented in the human auditory cortex by showing that those two computations rely on partially shared neural codes. Furthermore, our results show that the neural representation of moving sounds in hPT follows a &quot;preferred axis of motion&quot; organization, reminiscent of the coding mechanisms typically observed in the occipital middle-temporal cortex (hMT+/V5) region for computing visual motion.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Conditional Inactivation of Pen-2 in the Developing Neocortex Leads to Rapid Switch of Apical Progenitors to Basal Progenitors</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/12/2195?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The transition of apical progenitors (APs) to basal progenitors (BPs) is an important neurogenic process during cortical expansion. Presenilin enhancer 2 (Pen-2, also named as Psenen) is a key subunit of -secretase and has been implicated in neurodevelopmental disease. However, it remains unknown how Pen-2 may regulate the maintenance of APs. To address this question, we generated a conditional KO (cKO) mouse in which Pen-2 is specifically inactivated in neural progenitor cells in the telencephalon. Both male and female embryos were used. We show that &lt;i&gt;Pen-2&lt;/i&gt; cKO cortices display remarkable depletion of Aps, but transient increase on BPs, compared with controls. We demonstrate that the proliferation rate of APs or BPs is not changed, but the switch of APs to BPs is dramatically accelerated in &lt;i&gt;Pen-2&lt;/i&gt; cKO cortices. Molecular analyses reveal decreased levels of Hes1 and Hes5 but increased levels of Ngn2 and NeuroD1 in &lt;i&gt;Pen-2&lt;/i&gt; KO cells. We report that expression of Notch1 intracellular domain in &lt;i&gt;Pen-2&lt;/i&gt; cKO cortices restores the population of APs and BPs. In summary, these findings highlight a central role of the Notch signaling in Pen-2-dependent maintenance of neural stem cells in the developing neocortex.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Presenilin enhancer 2 (Pen-2) has been implicated in neurodevelopmental disease. However, mechanisms by which Pen-2 regulates cortical development are not understood. In this study, we generated neural progenitor cell-specific &lt;i&gt;Pen-2&lt;/i&gt; conditional KO mice. We observe depletion of apical progenitors and transiently increased the number of basal progenitors in the developing neocortex of Pen-2 mutant mice. Mechanistic analyses reveal decreased levels of Hes1 and Hes5, but increased levels of neurogenic transcription factors in Pen-2 mutant cortices, compared with controls. We demonstrate that reintroduction of Notch intracellular domain into mutant mice restores the population of apical progenitors to basal progenitors. The above findings strongly suggest that the Pen-2-Notch pathway plays an essential role in the maintenance of neural stem cells during cortical development.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Selective Estrogen Receptor Modulators Enhance CNS Remyelination Independent of Estrogen Receptors</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/12/2184?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A significant unmet need for patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) is the lack of U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved remyelinating therapies. We have identified a compelling remyelinating agent, bazedoxifene (BZA), a European Medicines Agency (EMA)-approved (and FDA-approved in combination with conjugated estrogens) selective estrogen receptor (ER) modulator (SERM) that could move quickly from bench to bedside. This therapy stands out as a tolerable alternative to previously identified remyelinating agents and other candidates within this family. Using an unbiased high-throughput screen, with subsequent validation in both murine and human oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) and coculture systems, we find that BZA enhances differentiation of OPCs into functional oligodendrocytes. Using an &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; murine model of focal demyelination, we find that BZA enhances OPC differentiation and remyelination. Of critical importance, we find that BZA acts independently of its presumed target, the ER, in both &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; systems. Using a massive computational data integration approach, we independently identify six possible candidate targets through which SERMs may mediate their effect on remyelination. Of particular interest, we identify EBP (encoding 3β-hydroxysteroid-8,7-isomerase), a key enzyme in the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway, which was previously implicated as a target for remyelination. These findings provide valuable insights into the implications for SERMs in remyelination for MS and hormonal research at large.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Therapeutics targeted at remyelination failure, which results in axonal degeneration and ultimately disease progression, represent a large unmet need in the multiple sclerosis (MS) population. Here, we have validated a tolerable European Medicines Agency-approved (U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved in combination with conjugated estrogens) selective estrogen receptor (ER) modulator (SERM), bazedoxifene (BZA), as a potent agent of oligodendrocyte precursor cell (OPC) differentiation and remyelination. SERMs, which were developed as nuclear ER-α and ER-β agonists/antagonists, have previously been implicated in remyelination and neuroprotection, following a heavy focus on estrogens with underwhelming and conflicting results. We show that nuclear ERs are not required for SERMs to mediate their potent effects on OPC differentiation and remyelination &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; and highlight EBP, an enzyme in the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway that could potentially act as a target for SERMs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Light-Activated ROS Production Induces Synaptic Autophagy</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/12/2163?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The regulated turnover of synaptic vesicle (SV) proteins is thought to involve the ubiquitin-dependent tagging and degradation through endo-lysosomal and autophagy pathways. Yet, it remains unclear which of these pathways are used, when they become activated, and whether SVs are cleared en masse together with SV proteins or whether both are degraded selectively. Equally puzzling is how quickly these systems can be activated and whether they function in real-time to support synaptic health. To address these questions, we have developed an imaging-based system that simultaneously tags presynaptic proteins while monitoring autophagy. Moreover, by tagging SV proteins with a light-activated ROS generator, Supernova, it was possible to temporally control the damage to specific SV proteins and assess their consequence to autophagy-mediated clearance mechanisms and synaptic function. Our results show that, in mouse hippocampal neurons of either sex, presynaptic autophagy can be induced in as little as 5–10 min and eliminates primarily the damaged protein rather than the SV en masse. Importantly, we also find that autophagy is essential for synaptic function, as light-activated damage to, for example, Synaptophysin only compromises synaptic function when autophagy is simultaneously blocked. These data support the concept that presynaptic boutons have a robust highly regulated clearance system to maintain not only synapse integrity, but also synaptic function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The real-time surveillance and clearance of synaptic proteins are thought to be vital to the health, functionality, and integrity of vertebrate synapses and are compromised in neurodegenerative disorders, yet the fundamental mechanisms regulating these systems remain enigmatic. Our analysis reveals that presynaptic autophagy is a critical part of a real-time clearance system at synapses capable of responding to local damage of synaptic vesicle proteins within minutes and to be critical for the ongoing functionality of these synapses. These data indicate that synapse autophagy is not only locally regulated but also crucial for the health and functionality of vertebrate presynaptic boutons.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Layer-specific connectivity revealed by diffusion-weighted functional MRI in the rat thalamocortical pathway. (arXiv:1903.08133v1 [physics.med-ph])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1903.08133</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Investigating neural activity from a global brain perspective in-vivo has
been in the domain of functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) over the
past few decades. The intricate neurovascular couplings that govern fMRI's
blood-oxygenation-level-dependent (BOLD) functional contrast are invaluable in
mapping active brain regions, but they also entail significant limitations,
such as non-specificity of the signal to active foci. Diffusion-weighted
functional MRI (dfMRI) with relatively high diffusion-weighting strives to
ameliorate this shortcoming as it offers functional contrasts more intimately
linked with the underlying activity. Insofar, apart from somewhat smaller
activation foci, dfMRI's contrasts have not been convincingly shown to offer
significant advantages over BOLD, and its contrasts relied on significant
modelling. Here, we study whether dfMRI could offer a better representation of
neural activity in the thalamocortical pathway compared to its (spin-echo (SE))
BOLD counterpart. Using high-end forepaw stimulation experiments in the rat at
9.4 T, and with significant sensitivity enhancements due to the use of
cryocoils, we show for the first time that dfMRI signals exhibit layer
specificity, and, additionally, display signals in areas devoid of SE-BOLD
responses. We find that dfMRI signals in the thalamocortical pathway cohere
with each other, namely, dfMRI signals in the ventral posterolateral (VPL)
thalamic nucleus cohere specifically with layers IV and V in the somatosensory
cortex. These activity patterns are much better correlated (compared with
SE-BOLD signals) with literature-based electrophysiological recordings in the
cortex as well as thalamus. All these findings suggest that dfMRI signals
better represent the underlying neural activity in the pathway. In turn, this
may entail significant implications towards a much more specific and accurate
(...)

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1903.07885</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The human brain copes with sensory uncertainty in accordance with Bayes'
rule. However, it is unknown how the brain makes predictions in the presence of
parameter uncertainty. Here, we tested whether and how humans take parameter
uncertainty into account in a regression task. Participants extrapolated a
parabola from a limited number of noisy points, shown on a computer screen. The
quadratic parameter was drawn from a prior distribution, unknown to the
observers. We tested whether human observers take full advantage of the given
information, including the likelihood function of the observed points and the
prior distribution of the quadratic parameter. We compared human performance
with Bayesian regression, which is the (Bayes) optimal solution to this
problem, and three sub-optimal models, namely maximum likelihood regression,
prior regression and maximum a posteriori regression, which are simpler to
compute. Our results clearly show that humans use Bayesian regression. We
further investigated several variants of Bayesian regression models depending
on how the generative noise is treated and found that participants act in line
with the more sophisticated version.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1903.07783</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Recently, visual encoding and decoding based on functional magnetic resonance
imaging (fMRI) have realized many achievements with the rapid development of
deep network computation. Despite the hierarchically similar representations of
deep network and human vision, visual information flows from primary visual
cortices to high visual cortices and vice versa based on the bottom-up and
top-down manners, respectively. Inspired by the bidirectional information
flows, we proposed a bidirectional recurrent neural network (BRNN)-based method
to decode the categories from fMRI data. The forward and backward directions in
the BRNN module characterized the bottom-up and top-down manners, respectively.
The proposed method regarded the selected voxels of each visual cortex region
(V1, V2, V3, V4, and LO) as one node in the sequence fed into the BRNN module
and combined the output of the BRNN module to decode the categories with the
subsequent fully connected layer. This new method allows the efficient
utilization of hierarchical information representations and bidirectional
information flows in human visual cortices. Experiment results demonstrated
that our method improved the accuracy of three-level category decoding than
other methods, which implicitly validated the hierarchical and bidirectional
human visual representations. Comparative analysis revealed that the category
representations of human visual cortices were hierarchical, distributed,
complementary, and correlative.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1903.07762</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Large-scale armed conflict is a characteristic feature of modern
civilization. The statistics of conflict show remarkable regularities like
power law distributions of fatalities and durations, but these properties have
remained disparate, albeit prominent, features of conflict. We explore a large,
detailed data set of $10^5$ armed conflict reports spanning 20 years across
nearly $10^4$ kilometers. By clustering spatiotemporally proximate events into
conflict avalanches, we show that the number of conflict reports, fatalities,
duration, and geographic extent satisfy consistent scaling relations. The
temporal evolution of conflicts measured by these scaling variables display
emergent symmetry, reflecting self-similarity in the trajectories of conflict
avalanches. Taken together, our measurements describe a system that is distinct
from prevailing explanations of conflict growth such as self-similar forest
fire models. A natural interpretation of our findings is in the language of
criticality, suggesting that armed conflicts are dominated by a low-dimensional
process that scales with physical dimensions in a surprisingly unified and
predictable way.

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/39578</link>
	<content:encoded>Stress granules (SGs) are non-membrane-bound RNA-protein granules that assemble through phase separation in response to cellular stress. Disturbances in SG dynamics have been implicated as a primary driver of neurodegenerative diseases, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD), suggesting the hypothesis that these diseases reflect an underlying disturbance in the dynamics and material properties of SGs. However, this concept has remained largely untestable in available models of SG assembly, which require the confounding variable of exogenous stressors. Here we introduce a light-inducible SG system, termed OptoGranules, based on optogenetic multimerization of G3BP1, which is an essential scaffold protein for SG assembly. In this system, which permits experimental control of SGs in living cells in the absence of exogenous stressors, we demonstrate that persistent or repetitive assembly of SGs is cytotoxic and is accompanied by the evolution of SGs to cytoplasmic inclusions that recapitulate the pathology of ALS-FTD.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: The TMEM106B rs1990621 protective variant is also associated with increased neuronal proportion</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/583286v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Background: In previous studies, we observed decreased neuronal and increased astrocyte proportions in AD cases in parietal brain cortex by using a deconvolution method for bulk RNA-seq. These findings suggested that genetic risk factors associated with AD etiology have a specific effect in the cellular composition of AD brains. The goal of this study is to investigate if there are genetic determinants for brain cell compositions. Methods: Using cell type composition inferred from transcriptome as a disease status proxy, we performed cell type association analysis to identify novel loci related to cellular population changes in disease cohort. We imputed and merged genotyping data from seven studies in total of 1,669 samples and derived major CNS cell type proportions from cortical RNAseq data. We also inferred RNA transcript integrity number (TIN) to account for RNA quality variances. The model we performed in the analysis was: normalized neuronal proportion ~ SNP + Age + Gender + PC1 + PC2 + median TIN. Results: A variant rs1990621 located in the TMEM106B gene region was significantly associated with neuronal proportion (p=6.40x10-07) and replicated in an independent dataset. The association became more significant as we combined both discovery and replication datasets in multi-tissue meta-analysis (p=9.42x10-09) and joint analysis (p=7.66x10-10). This variant is in high LD with rs1990622 (r2 = 0.98) which was previously identified as a protective variant in FTD cohorts. Further analyses indicated that this variant is associated with increased neuronal proportion in participants with neurodegenerative disorders, not only in AD cohort but also in cognitive normal elderly cohort. However, this effect was not observed in a younger schizophrenia cohort with a mean age of death &amp;lt; 65. The second most significant loci for neuron proportion was APOE, which suggested that using neuronal proportion as an informative endophenotype could help identify loci associated with neurodegeneration. Conclusion: This result suggested a common pathway involving TMEM106B shared by aging groups in the present or absence of neurodegenerative pathology may contribute to cognitive preservation and neuronal protection.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/583203v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Recently, long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) were implicated in the etiology of alcohol dependence (AD). As lncRNA provide another layer of complexity to the transcriptome, assessing their expression in the brain is the first critical step towards understanding lncRNA functions in AD. To that end, we profiled the expression of lncRNA and protein coding genes (PCG) in nucleus accumbens (NAc) from 41 subjects with AD and 41 controls. At false discovery rate (FDR) of 5%, we identified 69 and 309 differentially expressed lncRNA and PCG genes, respectively. Using co-expression network analyses, we identified three lncRNA and five PCG modules significantly correlated with AD at Bonferroni adj. p[≤]0.05. To better understand lncRNA functions, we integrated the lncRNA and PCG hubs from the significant AD modules; at FDR of 5%, we identified 3 151 positive and 2 255 negative correlations supporting the functional role of lncRNA in the development of AD. Gene enrichment analysis revealed that PCG significantly correlated with lncRNA are, among others, enriched for neuronal and immune related processes. To highlight the mechanisms, by which genetic variants contribute to AD, we integrated lncRNA and PCG hubs with genome-wide SNP data. At FDR[≤]0.3, we identified 276 expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL), affecting the expression of 20 and 256 lncRNA and PCG hubs, respectively. Our study is the first to profile lncRNA expression in nucleus accumbens in a large postmortem alcohol brain sample and our results may provide novel insights into the regulation of the brain transcriptome across disease.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Neural connectionism is a common theoretical abstraction of biological neural networks and a basis for common artificial neural networks. Yet, it is clear that connectionism abstracts out much of the biological phenomena significant and necessary for many cognitive-driven behaviors, in particular intra-neuronal and inter-neuronal biochemical processes. This paper presents a model which adds an abstraction of these processes to a standard connectionism-based model. Specifically, a sub-system determines the synaptic weights. The resulting network has plastic synapses during non-learning-related behavior, in sharp contrast with most common models in which synapses are fixed outside of a learning-phase. Some synapses introduce plasticity that is causally related with behavior, while in others the plasticity randomly fluctuates, in correspondence with recent data. In this model the memory engram is distributed over the biochemical system, in addition to the synapses. The model yields better performance in memory-related tasks compared to a standard recurrent neural network trained with backpropagation.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/582965v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Synaptotagmin 1 acts as the Ca2+-sensor for synchronous neurotransmitter release; however, the mechanism by which it functions is not understood and is presently a topic of considerable interest. Here we describe measurements on full-length membrane reconstituted synaptotagmin 1 using site-directed spin labeling where we characterize the linker region as well as the cis (vesicle membrane) and trans (cytoplasmic membrane) binding of its two C2 domains. In the full-length protein, the C2A domain does not undergo membrane insertion in the absence of Ca2+; however, the C2B domain will bind to and penetrate in trans to a membrane containing phosphatidylinositol 4,5 bisphosphate (PIP2), even if phosphatidylserine (PS) is present in the cis membrane. In the presence of Ca2+, the Ca2+-binding loops of C2A and C2B both insert into the membrane interface; moreover, C2A preferentially inserts into PS containing bilayers and will bind in a cis configuration to membranes containing PS even if a PIP2 membrane is presented in trans. The data are consistent with a bridging activity for Syt1 where the two domains bind to opposing vesicle and plasma membranes. The failure of C2A to bind membranes in the absence of Ca2+ and the long unstructured segment linking C2A to the vesicle membrane indicates that synaptotagmin 1 could act to significantly shorten the vesicle-plasma membrane distance with increasing levels of Ca2+.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/582908v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Recent studies showed that in the nervous system histone methyltransferase EZH2-mediated trimethylation of histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27me3) acts to regulate neural stem cell proliferation and fate specificity through silencing different gene sets. Here we explored the function of EZH2 in early post-mitotic excitatory neurons by generating a neuronal specific Ezh2 conditional knockout mouse line. The results showed that lack of neuronal EZH2 led to delayed neuronal migration, more complex dendritic arborization, and significantly increased dendritic spine density. RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) experiments comparing control and Ezh2 knockout neurons revealed that neuronal EZH2 regulated genes related to neuronal morphogenesis. In particular, Pak3 was identified as a target gene suppressed by EZH2 and H3K27me3, and expression of dominant negative PAK3 reversed Ezh2 knockout-induced higher dendritic spine density. Lastly, lack of neuronal EZH2 resulted in impaired memory behaviors in adult mice. Our results demonstrated that neuronal EZH2 played important roles in controlling multiple steps of neuronal morphogenesis during development, which had long-lasting effects on cognitive function in adult mice.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/582783v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Information sampling can reduce uncertainty in future decisions but is often costly. To maximize expected gain, people need to balance sampling cost and information gain. Suboptimal information sampling is observed in many core symptoms of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and may be a general impairment in ASD. Here we aimed to understand how autistic traits influence the optimality of information sampling and to identify the particularly affected cognitive processes. Healthy human adults of varying autistic traits performed a probabilistic inference task, where they drew samples sequentially to accumulate evidence for their inference and could stop sampling at any time. Each additional sample would increase the probability of correct inference but also incur a fixed cost. We manipulated the cost and evidence associated with each sample and compared participants' performance to optimal choices. We found that, compared to their peers, participants with high autistic traits had a lower efficiency of winning rewards in the high cost and low evidence condition due to oversampling. Computational modeling of participants' sampling choices revealed two decision stages: When the first stage does not reach the choice of stopping sampling, a second stage is probabilistically involved, which provides a second chance to stop sampling. We found that autistic traits did not influence the choices in either stage but specifically modulated the participant's probability to recruit the second decision stage (&quot;second-thought probability&quot;). In particular, participants with high autistic traits were less flexible in adjusting their second-thought probabilities with the increase of cost. To conclude, high-levels of autistic traits are associated with suboptimal information sampling and such suboptimality implies a failure of adjusting the strategic complexity (with or without second thought) appropriately with sampling cost.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/582775v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Rehabilitation is the most effective treatment for promoting the recovery of motor deficits after stroke. One of the most challenging experimental goals is to unambiguously link brain rewiring to motor recovery prompted by rehabilitative therapy. Here, we investigated which aspects of cortical remodeling are induced by rehabilitation by combining optical imaging and manipulation tools in a mouse model of stroke. We revealed that the stabilization of peri-infarct synaptic contacts fostered by rehabilitation goes along with increased vascular density induced by angiogenesis. Furthermore, we showed the progressive formation of a new motor representation in the peri-infarct area where temporal and spatial features of cortical activation recovered towards pre-stroke condition. In the same animals we observed the reinforcement of inter-hemispheric connectivity after rehabilitation. The present work provides the first evidences that rehabilitation promotes the combined recovery of structural and functional features distinctive of healthy neuronal networks.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/582692v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Increased reticulospinal (RS) function has been observed to cause both positive and negative outcomes in the recovery of motor function after corticospinal lesions such as stroke. Current knowledge of RF function is limited by the lack of accurate, noninvasive methods for measuring RS function. Recent studies suggest that the RS tract may be involved in processing and generating Long Latency Responses (LLRs). LLRs, elicited by applying precisely controlled perturbations, can act as a reliable stimulus to measure LLR-related brainstem function using fMRI with high signal-to-noise ratio. In this paper, we present StretchfMRI, a new technique that enables simultaneous recording of neural and muscular activity during motor responses conditioned by velocity-controlled robotic perturbations, which allows for direct investigation of the neural correlates of LLRs using fMRI. Via preliminary validation experiments, we demonstrate that our technique can reliably elicit and identify LLRs in two wrist muscles--FCR and ECU. Moreover, via a single-subject pilot experiment, we show that the occurrence of an LLR in a flexor and extensor muscle modulates neural activity in distinct regions of the brainstem. The observed somatotopic organization is in agreement with the double reciprocal model of RS function observed in animal models, in which the right medullary and left pontine reticular formation are responsible for control of the motor activity in flexors and extensors, respectively.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/582643v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Over the last decade, artificial neural networks (ANNs), have undergone a revolution, catalyzed in large part by better tools for supervised learning. However, training such networks requires enormous data sets of labeled examples, whereas young animals (including humans) typically learn with few or no labeled examples. This stark contrast with biological learning has led many in the ANN community posit that instead of supervised paradigms, animals must rely instead primarily on unsupervised learning, leading the search for better unsupervised algorithms. Here we argue that much of an animal's behavioral repertoire is not the result of clever learning algorithms--supervised or unsupervised--but arises instead from behavior programs already present at birth. These programs arise through evolution, are encoded in the genome, and emerge as a consequence of wiring up the brain. Specifically, animals are born with highly structured brain connectivity, which enables them learn very rapidly. Recognizing the importance of the highly structured connectivity suggests a path toward building ANNs capable of rapid learning.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/582502v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Post-stroke fatigue (PSF) is a prevalent symptom among stroke patients. Its symptom burden is pervasive, persistent and associated with poor rehabilitation outcomes, though its mechanisms are poorly understood. Many patients with PSF experience cognitive difficulties, but studies aiming to identify cognitive correlates of PSF have been largely inconclusive. In contrast to conventional neuropsychological assessment, computational modeling of behavioral data allows for a dissection of specific cognitive processes associated with group or individual differences in fatigue. With the aim to zero in on the cognitive phenotype of PSF, we fitted a hierarchical drift diffusion model (hDDM) to response time data from Attention Network Test (ANT) obtained from 53 chronic stroke patients. The computational model accurately reconstructed the individual level response time distributions in the different ANT conditions, and hDDM regressions identified an interaction between trial number and fatigue symptoms on non-decision time, intuitively indicating that the cognitive phenotype of fatigue entails an increased vulnerability to sustained attentional effort. These novel results demonstrate the significance of considering the sustained nature of cognitive effort when defining the cognitive phenotype of post-stroke fatigue, and suggest that the use of computational approaches offers a further characterization of the specific processes underlying observed behavioral differences.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/582445v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Action potential-triggered release of neurotransmitters at chemical synapses forms the key basis of communication between two neurons. To quantify the stochastic dynamics of the number of neurotransmitters released, we investigate a model where neurotransmitter-filled vesicles attach to a finite number of docking sites in the axon terminal, and are subsequently released when the action potential arrives. We formulate the model as a Stochastic Hybrid System (SHS) that combines three key noise mechanisms: random arrival of action potentials, stochastic refilling of docking sites, and probabilistic release of docked vesicles. This SHS representation is used to derive exact analytical formulas for the mean and noise (as quantified by Fano factor) in the number of vesicles released per action potential. Interestingly, results show that in relevant parameter regimes, noise in the number of vesicles released is sub-Poissonian at low frequencies, super-Poissonian at intermediate frequencies, and approaches a Poisson limit at high frequencies. In contrast, noise in the number of neurotransmitters in the synaptic cleft is always super-Poissonian, but is lowest at intermediate frequencies. We further investigate changes in these noise properties for non-Poissonian arrival of action potentials, and when the probability of release is frequency dependent. In summary, these results provide the first glimpse into synaptic parameters not only determining the mean synaptic strength, but also shaping its stochastic dynamics that is critical for information transfer between neurons.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: A generic deviance detection principle for cortical On/Off responses, omission response, and mismatch negativity</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/582437v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Neural responses to sudden changes can be observed in many parts of the sensory pathways at different organizational levels. For example, deviants that violate regularity at various levels of abstraction can be observed as simple On/Off responses of individual neurons or as cumulative responses of neural populations. The cortical deviance-related responses supporting different functionalities (e.g. gap detection, chunking, etc.) seem unlikely to arise from different function-specific neural circuits, given the relatively uniform and self-similar wiring patterns across cortical areas and spatial scales. Additionally, reciprocal wiring patterns (with heterogeneous combinations of excitatory and inhibitory connections) in the cortex naturally speak in favor of a generic deviance detection principle. Based on this concept, we propose a network model consisting of reciprocally coupled neural masses as a blueprint of a universal change detector. Simulation examples reproduce properties of cortical deviance-related responses including the On/Off responses, the omitted-stimulus response (OSR), and the mismatch negativity (MMN). We propose that the emergence of change detectors relies on the involvement of disinhibition. The analysis on network connection settings further suggests a supportive effect of synaptic adaptation and a destructive effect of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDA-r) antagonists on change detection. We conclude that the nature of cortical reciprocal wirings gives rise to a whole range of local change detectors supporting the notion of a generic deviance detection principle. Several testable predictions are provided based on the network model. Notably, we predict that the NMDA-r antagonists would generally dampen the cortical Off response, the cortical OSR, and the MMN.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Research into amisulpride use in Alzheimer's disease (AD) implicates blood-brain barrier (BBB) dysfunction in antipsychotic sensitivity. Solute carrier function in AD has not been widely studied. This study tests the hypothesis that organic cation transporters contribute to the BBB delivery of antipsychotics and is disrupted in AD. In vitro BBB studies indicated that [3H]amisulpride and [3H]haloperidol were transported by OCT1. Amisulpride also utilized PMAT. Molecular docking predicted that amisulpride and haloperidol are OCT1, PMAT and MATE1 substrates, and amisulpride is not a P-gp substrate. Amisulpride brain uptake increased in 3xTgAD compared to wildtype mice. PMAT and MATE1 expression was reduced in brain from AD patients compared to controls. The increased sensitivity of AD patients to amisulpride is related to previously unreported changes in OCT1, PMAT and MATE1 function/expression at the BBB. Dose adjustments may be required for drugs that are substrates of these transporters when prescribing for AD patients.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Critical Variables to be Considered when Attempting to Estimate Blood Ethanol Concentrations in Rats from g/kg Exposure Data</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/582361v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Background: In rodent studies of ethanol (EtOH) consumption where blood sample collection does not occur, there is often mention of likely BECs based on prior studies. These studies may vary in dose(s) used, age/sex/species, or administration route. Often, intake studies may presume that binge-levels were achieved without knowing that BECs exceeded 80 mg% (binge threshold). In human studies, estimated BECs (eBECs) have been derived using complex formulas that consider EtOH consumption level and the weight and sex of the individual. Method: Three datasets were used to derive eBECs using a conversion factor (CF) that considers gram (g) of EtOH per kilogram (kg) of animal weight and other variables that may influence BECs such as age, sex, dose, route, vehicle, chronicity, and timing post-exposure. Regression analyses were also conducted for each dataset, building regression models with BEC as the response and other variables in the study specific to each dataset as predictor variables. Results: Dataset1 assessed age, sex and post-injection time point. Both CF and regression analyses determined that different CFs should be used for 10- and 30-min post-administration time points. Dataset2 assessed age, dose, vehicle and post-intubation time point. Depending on the post-intubation time point, several CFs were used to derive eBECs. When weight was not used as a regression variable, data across approaches corresponded, with age differences emerging later in elimination phase. In Dataset3 that used BECs from a repeated intake study, chronic exposure influenced CFs, although regression analysis did not yield similar findings. Conclusions: Although eBECs can be derived, critical variables vary with subject and test conditions and do not always concur with results of regression analyses. Although, not designed to replace assessment of BECs when sample collection is possible, the CF approach may prove useful when estimating BECs in studies where assessments are not feasible.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Instantaneous brain states have consequences for our sensation, perception, and behaviour. Both fluctuations in arousal and in neural desynchronization likely pose perceptually relevant states. However, their relationship and their relative impact on perception is unclear. We here provide evidence that, at the single-trial level in humans, desynchronization in sensory cortex (expressed as time series entropy) and pupil-linked arousal differentially impact optimal perceptual processing. While we recorded electroencephalography (EEG) and pupillometry data, stimuli of a demanding auditory discrimination task were presented into states of high or low desynchronization of auditory cortex via a real-time closed-loop setup. Desynchronization and arousal distinctly influenced stimulus-evoked activity and shaped behaviour displaying an inverted u-shaped relationship: States of intermediate desynchronization elicited minimal response bias and fastest responses, while states of intermediate arousal gave rise to highest response sensitivity. Our results speak to a model in which independent states of global arousal and local desynchronization jointly optimise sensory processing and performance.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/582320v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Creatine (Cr) is a guanidino compound that provides readily-available phosphate pools for the regeneration of spent ATP. The lack of brain Cr causes moderate to severe intellectual disability, language impairment, and epilepsy. The most prevalent cause of Cr deficiency are mutations in the X-linked SLC6A8 (Creatine transporter; CrT) gene, known as CrT deficiency (CTD). There are no current treatments for CTD and the mechanisms that underlie the cognitive deficits are poorly understood. One of the most critical areas that need to be addressed is if Cr is necessary for brain development. To address this concern, the Slc6a8 gene was knocked out in either neonatal (postnatal day (P)5) or adult (P60) mice. The P5 knockout mice showed deficits in the Morris water maze and novel object recognition, while there were no deficits in P60 knockout mice. Interestingly, the P5 knockout mice showed hyperactivity during the dark phase; however, when examining control mice, the effect was due to the administration of tamoxifen from P5-10. Taken together, the results of this study show that Cr is necessary during periods of brain development involved in spatial and object learning. This study also highlights the continued importance of using proper control groups for behavioral testing.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/581876v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>In-scanner head movements can introduce artifacts to MRI images and increase errors in brain-behavior studies. The magnitude of in-scanner head movements varies widely across developmental and clinical samples, making it increasingly difficult to parse out true signal from motion-related noise. Yet, the quantification of structural imaging quality is typically limited to subjective visual assessments and/or proxy measures of motion. It is, however, unknown how direct measures of image quality relate to developmental and behavioral variables, as well as measures of brain morphometrics. To begin to answer this question, we leverage a multi-site dataset of structural MRI images, which includes a range of children and adolescents with varying degrees of psychopathology. We first find that a composite of structural image quality relates to important developmental and behavioral variables (e.g., IQ; clinical diagnoses). Additionally, we demonstrate that even among T1-weighted images which pass visual inspection, variations in image quality impact volumetric derivations of regional gray matter. Image quality was associated with wide-spread variations in gray matter, including in portions of the frontal, parietal, and temporal lobes, as well as the cerebellum.

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/561811v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>The interactions between amygdala and prefrontal cortex are pivotal to many neural processes involved in learning, decision-making, emotion, and social regulation. The broad functional role of amygdala-prefrontal interplay may reflect the diversity of its anatomical connections. Little, however, is known of the structural wiring linking amygdala and prefrontal cortex in humans. Using diffusion imaging techniques, we reconstructed connections between amygdala, anterior temporal and prefrontal cortex in human and macaque brains. First, by studying macaques we were able to assess which aspects of connectivity known from tracer studies could be identified with diffusion imaging. Second, by comparing diffusion imaging results in humans and macaques we were able to estimate amygdala-prefrontal connection patterns in humans and compare them with those in the monkey. We observed a prominent and well-preserved bifurcation of connections between amygdala and frontal lobe into two fiber networks - an amygdalofugal path and an uncinate fascicle path - in both species.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/6/2/ENEURO.0392-18.2019?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;As communication signal properties change, through genetic drift or selective pressure, the sensory systems that receive these signals must also adapt to maintain sensitivity and adaptability in an array of contexts. Shedding light on this process helps us to understand how sensory codes are tailored to specific tasks. In a species of weakly electric fish, &lt;i&gt;Apteronotus albifrons&lt;/i&gt;, we examined the unique neurophysiological properties that support the encoding of electrosensory communication signals that the animal encounters in social exchanges. We compare our findings to the known coding properties of the closely related species &lt;i&gt;Apteronotus leptorhynchus&lt;/i&gt; to establish how these animals differ in their ability to encode their distinctive communication signals. While there are many similarities between these two species, we found notable differences leading to relatively poor coding of the details of chirp structure occurring on high-frequency background beats. As a result, small differences in chirp properties are poorly resolved by the nervous system. We performed behavioral tests to relate &lt;i&gt;A. albifrons&lt;/i&gt; chirp coding strategies to its use of chirps during social encounters. Our results suggest that &lt;i&gt;A. albifrons&lt;/i&gt; does not exchange frequent chirps in a nonbreeding condition, particularly when the beat frequency is high. These findings parallel the mediocre chirp coding accuracy in that they both point to a reduced reliance on frequent and rich exchange of information through chirps during these social interactions. Therefore, our study suggests that neural coding strategies in the CNS vary across species in a way that parallels the behavioral use of the sensory signals.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Electrophysiological Properties of Medium Spiny Neuron Subtypes in the Caudate-Putamen of Prepubertal Male and Female Drd1a-tdTomato Line 6 BAC Transgenic Mice</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/6/2/ENEURO.0016-19.2019?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;The caudate-putamen is a striatal brain region essential for sensorimotor behaviors, habit learning, and other cognitive and premotor functions. The output and predominant neuron of the caudate-putamen is the medium spiny neuron (MSN). MSNs present discrete cellular subtypes that show differences in neurochemistry, dopamine receptor expression, efferent targets, gene expression, functional roles, and most importantly for this study, electrophysiological properties. MSN subtypes include the striatonigral and the striatopallidal groups. Most studies identify the striatopallidal MSN subtype as being more excitable than the striatonigral MSN subtype. However, there is some divergence between studies regarding the exact differences in electrophysiological properties. Furthermore, MSN subtype electrophysiological properties have not been reported disaggregated by biological sex. We addressed these questions using prepubertal male and female Drd1a-tdTomato line 6 BAC transgenic mice, an important transgenic line that has not yet received extensive electrophysiological analysis. We made acute caudate-putamen brain slices and assessed a robust battery of 16 relevant electrophysiological properties using whole-cell patch-clamp recording, including intrinsic membrane, action potential, and miniature EPSC (mEPSC) properties. We found that: (1) MSN subtypes exhibited multiple differential electrophysiological properties in both sexes, including rheobase, action potential threshold and width, input resistance in both the linear and rectified ranges, and mEPSC amplitude; (2) select electrophysiological properties showed interactions between MSN subtype and sex. These findings provide a comprehensive evaluation of mouse caudate-putamen MSN subtype electrophysiological properties across females and males, both confirming and extending previous studies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: Rethinking interhemispheric imbalance as a target for stroke neurorehabilitation</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25452?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patients with chronic stroke have been shown to have failure to release interhemispheric inhibition (IHI) from the intact to the damaged hemisphere before movement execution (premovement IHI). This inhibitory imbalance was found to correlate with poor motor performance in the chronic stage after stroke and has since become a target for therapeutic interventions. The logic of this approach, however, implies that abnormal premovement IHI is causal to poor behavioral outcome and should therefore be present early after stroke when motor impairment is at its worst. To test this idea, in a longitudinal study, we investigated interhemispheric interactions by tracking patients’ premovement IHI for one year following stroke.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We assessed premovement IHI and motor behavior five times over a 1‐year period after ischemic stroke in 22 patients and 11 healthy participants.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We found that premovement IHI was normal during the acute/subacute period and only became abnormal at the chronic stage; specifically, release of IHI in movement preparation worsened as motor behavior improved. In addition, premovement IHI did not correlate with behavioral measures cross‐sectionally, whereas the longitudinal emergence of abnormal premovement IHI from the acute to the chronic stage was inversely correlated with recovery of finger individuation.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These results suggest that interhemispheric imbalance is not a cause of poor motor recovery, but instead might be the consequence of underlying recovery processes. These findings call into question the rehabilitation strategy of attempting to rebalance interhemispheric interactions in order to improve motor recovery after stroke.

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: A case–control–family study of idiopathic rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25435?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To determine the familial aggregation of idiopathic rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (iRBD), neurodegenerative diseases, and related biomarkers.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A total of 404 and 387 first‐degree relatives of 102 patients with iRBD and of 89 controls were recruited, respectively. Among them, 204 and 208 relatives of patients and controls underwent face‐to‐face clinical assessment, whereas 97 and 75 relatives underwent further video‐polysomnographic assessment, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compared with relatives of controls, relatives of patients demonstrated higher levels of RBD features, including chin tonic electromyography activity (mean = 1.5 ± 7.5 vs 0.3 ± 1.0, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.04) and behavioral events (n [weighted %] = 12 [11.3] vs 2 [1.9], adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] = 7.69, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.54–33.33, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.009) during rapid eye movement sleep, probable diagnosis (n [%] = 57 [14.9] vs 20 [4.9], aHR = 3.45, 95% CI = 1.96–6.25, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001), and definite diagnosis (n [weighted %] = 10 [8.4] vs 2 [1.4], aHR = 5.56, 95% CI = 1.16–25.00, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.03). They also had higher risks of Parkinson disease (3.1% vs 0.5%, aHR = 5.88, 95% CI = 1.37–25.00, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.02), dementia (6.9% vs 2.6%, aHR = 2.44, 95% CI = 1.15–5.26, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.02), constipation (8.3% vs 2.4%, adjusted odds ratio = 4.21, 95% CI = 1.34–13.17, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.01), and motor dysfunction (Movement Disorders Society Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale part III motor score, mean = 1.9 ± 3.2 vs 0.9 ± 2.3, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.002). The unaffected relatives of patients demonstrated a higher likelihood ratio of prodromal Parkinson disease (median [interquartile range] = 0.27 [1.19] vs 0.22 [0.51], &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.03).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;iRBD is familially aggregated from isolated features to full‐blown sleep disorder. Relatives of patients carry a higher risk of alpha‐synucleinopathy in terms of neurodegenerative diseases and prodromal markers, suggesting a familial aggregation and staging pathology of alpha‐synucleinopathy.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Subjectivity and complexity of facial attractiveness. (arXiv:1903.07526v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1903.07526</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The origin and meaning of facial beauty represent a longstanding puzzle.
Despite the profuse literature devoted to facial attractiveness, its very
nature, its determinants and the nature of inter-person differences remain
controversial issues. Here we tackle such questions proposing a novel
experimental approach in which human subjects, instead of rating natural faces,
are allowed to efficiently explore the face-space and &quot;sculpt&quot; their favorite
variation of a reference facial image. The results reveal that different
subjects prefer distinguishable regions of the face-space, highlighting the
essential subjectivity of the phenomenon. The different sculpted facial vectors
exhibit strong correlations among pairs of facial distances, characterizing the
underlying universality and complexity of the cognitive processes, leading to
the observed subjectivity.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: An intracellular calcium frequency code model extended to the Riemann zeta function. (arXiv:1903.07394v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1903.07394</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;We have used the Nernst chemical potential treatment to couple the time
domains of sodium and calcium ion channel opening and closing rates to the
spatial domain of the diffusing waves of the travelling calcium ions inside
single cells. The model is plausibly evolvable with respect to the origins of
the molecular components and the scaling of the system from simple cells to
neurons. The mixed chemical potentials are calculated by summing the
concentrations or particle numbers of the two constituent ions which are pure
numbers and thus dimensionless. Chemical potentials are true thermodynamic free
Gibbs/Fermi energies and the forces acting on chemical flows are calculated
from the natural logarithms of the particle numbers or their concentrations.
The mixed chemical potential is converted to the time domain of an action
potential by assuming that the injection of calcium ions accelerates
depolarization in direct proportion to the amplitude of the total charge
contribution of the calcium pulse. We assert that the natural logarithm of the
real component of the imaginary term of any Riemann zeta zero corresponds to an
instantaneous calcium potential. In principle, in a physiologically plausible
fashion, the first few thousand Riemann zeta-zeros can be encoded on this
chemical scale manifested as regulated step-changes in the amplitudes of
naturally occurring calcium current transients. We show that pairs of Zn
channels can form Dirac fences which encode the logarithmic spacings and summed
amplitudes of any pair of Riemann zeros. Remarkably the beat frequencies of the
pairings of the early frequency terms overlap the naturally occurring frequency
modes in vertebrate brains. The equation for the time domain in the biological
model has a similar form to the Riemann zeta function on the half-plane and
mimics analytical continuation on the complex plane.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Reconstructing multiple molecularly defined neurons from individual brains
and across multiple brain regions can reveal organizational principles of the
nervous system. However, high resolution imaging of the whole brain is a
technically challenging and slow process. Recently, oblique light sheet
microscopy has emerged as a rapid imaging method that can provide whole brain
fluorescence microscopy at a voxel size of 0.4 by 0.4 by 2.5 cubic microns. On
the other hand, complex image artifacts due to whole-brain coverage produce
apparent discontinuities in neuronal arbors. Here, we present
connectivity-preserving methods and data augmentation strategies for supervised
learning of neuroanatomy from light microscopy using neural networks. We
quantify the merit of our approach by implementing an end-to-end automated
tracing pipeline. Lastly, we demonstrate a scalable, distributed implementation
that can reconstruct the large datasets that sub-micron whole-brain images
produce.

	<content:encoded>We previously showed that &lt;i&gt;Guy1&lt;/i&gt;, a primary signal expressed from the Y chromosome, is a strong candidate for a male-determining factor that confers female-specific lethality in &lt;i&gt;Anopheles stephensi &lt;/i&gt;(Criscione et al., 2016). Here we present evidence that &lt;i&gt;Guy1&lt;/i&gt; increases X gene expression in &lt;i&gt;Guy1&lt;/i&gt;-transgenic females from two independent lines, providing a mechanism underlying the &lt;i&gt;Guy1&lt;/i&gt;-conferred female lethality. The median level gene expression (MGE) of X-linked genes is significantly higher than autosomal genes in &lt;i&gt;Guy1&lt;/i&gt;-transgenic females while there is no significant difference in MGE between X and autosomal genes in wild type females. Furthermore, &lt;i&gt;Guy1&lt;/i&gt; significantly up-regulates at least 40% of the 996 genes across the X chromosome in transgenic females. &lt;i&gt;Guy1&lt;/i&gt;-conferred female-specific lethality is remarkably stable and completely penetrant. These findings indicate that &lt;i&gt;Guy1&lt;/i&gt; regulates dosage compensation in &lt;i&gt;An. stephensi&lt;/i&gt; and components of dosage compensation may be explored to develop novel strategies to control mosquito-borne diseases.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: latest articles: Dissociation rate compensation mechanism for budding yeast pioneer transcription factors</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/43008</link>
	<content:encoded>Nucleosomes restrict the occupancy of most transcription factors (TF) by reducing binding and accelerating dissociation, while a small group of TFs have high affinities to nucleosome-embedded sites and facilitate nucleosome displacement. To mechanistically understand this process, we investigated two &lt;i&gt;S. cerevisiae &lt;/i&gt;TFs, Reb1 and Cbf1. We show these factors bind their sites within nucleosomes with similar affinities to naked DNA, trapping a partially unwrapped nucleosome without histone eviction. Both the binding and dissociation rates of Reb1 and Cbf1 are significantly slower at the nucleosomal sites relative to DNA, demonstrating that the high affinities are achieved by increasing the dwell time on nucleosomes to compensate for reduced binding. Reb1 also shows slow migration rate in the yeast nuclei. These properties are similar to human pioneer factors (PFs), suggesting the mechanism of nucleosome targeting is conserved from yeast to human.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>This study sought to evaluate the performance of metabolic gestational age estimation models developed in Ontario, Canada in infants born in Bangladesh. Cord and heel prick blood spots were collected in Bangladesh and analyzed at a newborn screening facility in Ottawa, Canada. Algorithm-derived estimates of gestational age and preterm birth were compared to ultrasound-validated estimates. 1036 cord blood and 487 heel prick samples were collected from 1069 unique newborns. The majority of samples (93.2% of heel prick and 89.9% of cord blood) were collected from term infants. When applied to heel prick data, algorithms correctly estimated gestational age to within an average deviation of 1 week overall (root mean square error = 1.07 weeks). Metabolic gestational age estimation provides accurate population-level estimates of gestational age in this data set. Models were effective on data obtained from both heel prick and cord blood, the latter being a more feasible option in low-resource settings.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;i&gt;Plasmodium&lt;/i&gt; parasites possess a protein with homology to Niemann-Pick Type C1 proteins (Niemann-Pick Type C1-Related protein, NCR1). We isolated parasites with resistance-conferring mutations in &lt;i&gt;Plasmodium falciparum&lt;/i&gt; NCR1 (PfNCR1) during selections with three diverse small-molecule antimalarial compounds and show that the mutations are causative for compound resistance. PfNCR1 protein knockdown results in severely attenuated growth and confers hypersensitivity to the compounds. Compound treatment or protein knockdown leads to increased sensitivity of the parasite plasma membrane (PPM) to the amphipathic glycoside saponin and engenders digestive vacuoles (DVs) that are small and malformed. Immuno-electron microscopy and split-GFP experiments localize PfNCR1 to the PPM. Our experiments show that PfNCR1 activity is critically important for the composition of the PPM and is required for DV biogenesis, suggesting PfNCR1 as a novel antimalarial drug target.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/38371</link>
	<content:encoded>Humans can run without falling down, usually despite uneven terrain or occasional pushes. Even without such external perturbations, intrinsic sources like sensorimotor noise perturb the running motion incessantly, making each step variable. Here, using simple and generalizable models, we show that even such small step-to-step variability contains considerable information about strategies used to run stably. Deviations in the center of mass motion predict the corrective strategies during the next stance, well in advance of foot touchdown. Horizontal motion is stabilized by total leg impulse modulations, whereas the vertical motion is stabilized by differentially modulating the impulse within stance. We implement these human-derived control strategies on a simple computational biped, showing that it runs stably for hundreds of steps despite incessant noise-like perturbations or larger discrete perturbations. This running controller derived from natural variability echoes behaviors observed in previous animal and robot studies.</content:encoded>

Here, by tracking immediate early gene expression in vivo, we found that contextual fear extinction training evoked distinct neural ensembles in mouse retrosplenial cortex (RSC). The optogenetic reactivation of these extinction-activated neurons in the RSC was sufficient to suppress a fear response, while the reactivation of conditioning-activated neurons in the same area promoted a fear response. The generation of such an extinction-memory-related neural ensemble was associated with adult neurogenesis, as abolishing newborn neurons in the adult hippocampus via X-ray irradiation eliminated both the extinction-activated neurons in the RSC and the optogenetic-reactivation-induced suppression of contextual fear memory. Therefore, switching from fear to no fear in response to the same context is modulated by the RSC through an extinction-activated neural ensemble, the generation of which might require adult neurogenesis in the hippocampus.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

Here we provide causal evidence for a neural mechanism that acts as a context-dependent arbitrator between both systems. We applied excitatory and inhibitory transcranial direct current stimulation over a region of the left ventrolateral prefrontal cortex previously found to encode the reliability of both learning systems. The opposing neural interventions resulted in a bidirectional shift of control between MB and MF learning. Stimulation also affected the sensitivity of the arbitration mechanism itself, as it changed how often subjects switched between the dominant system over time. Both of these effects depended on varying task contexts that either favored MB or MF control, indicating that this arbitration mechanism is not context-invariant but flexibly incorporates information about current environmental demands.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/582734v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>This study investigated the ability to use feedback for decision making in female college students who binge drink (BD) using the Iowa Gambling Task (IGT) and event-related potentials (ERPs). Twenty-seven binge drinkers and 23 non-binge drinkers (non-BD) were identified based on scores on the Korean version of the Alcohol Use Disorder Test and the Alcohol Use Questionnaire. The IGT consists of four cards, including two cards that result in a net loss, with large immediate gains but greater losses in the long term, and two cards that result in a net gain, with small immediate gains but reduced losses in the long term. Participants were required to choose one card at a time to maximize profit until the end of the task while avoiding losses. The BD group showed a significantly lower total net score than the non-BD group, indicating that the BD group chose more disadvantageous cards. The BD group showed significantly smaller {Delta}FRN amplitudes (difference in amplitudes of feedback-related negativity [FRN] between gain and loss feedback) except in P3. Additionally, {Delta}FRN amplitudes in the fronto-central area were positively correlated with the total net score and net scores for sectors 4 and 5. Thus, total net scores and later performance on the IGT increased as {Delta}FRN amplitudes from the fronto-central area increased. FRN is known to reflect early feedback evaluation employing a bottom-up mechanism, whereas P3 is known to reflect late feedback processing and allocation of attentional resources using a top-down mechanism. These results indicate that college students who binge drink have deficits in early evaluation of positive or negative feedback and that this deficit may be related to decision making deficits.</content:encoded>

We found that species differences in protein expression level was often independent of RNA levels, and more frequent than transcriptomic differences. Low-abundant proteins were more likely to show species-specific expression levels, while proteins expressed at a high level appeared to have evolved under stricter constraints.

The mechanism by which hepatitis C virus (HCV) gains entry into cells is a complex one, involving a broad range of host proteins. Entry is a critical phase of the viral lifecycle, and a potential target for therapeutic or vaccine-mediated intervention. However, the mechanics of HCV entry remain poorly understood. Here we describe a novel computational model of viral entry, encompassing the relationship between HCV and the key host receptors CD81 and SR-B1. We conduct experiments to thoroughly quantify the influence of an increase or decrease in receptor availability upon the extent of viral entry. We use these data to build and parameterise a mathematical model, which we then validate by further experiments. Our results are consistent with sequential HCV-receptor interactions, whereby initial interaction between the HCV E2 glycoprotein and SR-B1 facilitates the accumulation CD81 receptors, leading to viral entry. However, we also demonstrate that a small minority of virus can achieve entry in the absence of SR-B1. Our model estimates the impact of the different obstacles that viruses must surmount to achieve entry; among virus particles attaching to the cell surface, around one third of viruses accumulate sufficient CD81 receptors, of which 4–8% then complete the subsequent steps to achieve productive infection. Furthermore, we make estimates of receptor stoichiometry; in excess of 10 receptors are likely to be required to achieve viral entry. Our model provides a tool to investigate the entry characteristics of HCV variants and outlines a framework for future quantitative studies of the multi-receptor dynamics of HCV entry.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/z-aktaoyIsc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Multipartite viruses replicate through a puzzling evolutionary strategy. Their genome is segmented into two or more parts, and encapsidated in separate particles that appear to propagate independently. Completing the replication cycle, however, requires the full genome, so that a systemic infection of a host requires the concurrent presence of several particles. This represents an apparent evolutionary drawback of multipartitism, while its advantages remain unclear. A transition from monopartite to multipartite viral forms has been described &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; under conditions of high multiplicity of infection, suggesting that cooperation between defective mutants is a plausible evolutionary pathway towards multipartitism. However, it is unknown how the putative advantages that multipartitism might enjoy at the microscopic level affect its epidemiology, or if an explicit advantange is needed to explain its ecological persistence. In order to disentangle which mechanisms might contribute to the rise and fixation of multipartitism, we here investigate the interaction between viral spreading dynamics and host population structure. We set up a compartmental model of the spread of a virus in its different forms and explore its epidemiology using both analytical and numerical techniques. We uncover that the impact of host contact structure on spreading dynamics entails a rich phenomenology of ecological relationships that includes cooperation, competition, and commensality. Furthermore, we find out that multipartitism might rise to fixation even in the absence of explicit microscopic advantages. Multipartitism allows the virus to colonize environments that could not be invaded by the monopartite form, while homogeneous contacts between hosts facilitate its spread. We conjecture that these features might have led to an increase in the diversity and prevalence of multipartite viral forms concomitantly with the expansion of agricultural practices.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/JYfD-zG8_Sk&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Visual pattern detection and discrimination are essential first steps for scene analysis. Numerous human psychophysical studies have modeled visual pattern detection and discrimination by estimating linear templates for classifying noisy stimuli defined by spatial variations in pixel intensities. However, such methods are poorly suited to understanding sensory processing mechanisms for complex visual stimuli such as second-order boundaries defined by spatial differences in contrast or texture. We introduce a novel machine learning framework for modeling human perception of second-order visual stimuli, using image-computable hierarchical neural network models fit directly to psychophysical trial data. This framework is applied to modeling visual processing of boundaries defined by differences in the contrast of a carrier texture pattern, in two different psychophysical tasks: (1) boundary orientation identification, and (2) fine orientation discrimination. Cross-validation analysis is employed to optimize model hyper-parameters, and demonstrate that these models are able to accurately predict human performance on novel stimulus sets not used for fitting model parameters. We find that, like the ideal observer, human observers take a region-based approach to the orientation identification task, while taking an edge-based approach to the fine orientation discrimination task. How observers integrate contrast modulation across orientation channels is investigated by fitting psychophysical data with two models representing competing hypotheses, revealing a preference for a model which combines multiple orientations at the earliest possible stage. Our results suggest that this machine learning approach has much potential to advance the study of second-order visual processing, and we outline future steps towards generalizing the method to modeling visual segmentation of natural texture boundaries. This study demonstrates how machine learning methodology can be fruitfully applied to psychophysical studies of second-order visual processing.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/mXErxRfGs4Q&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

We use stochastic neural field theory to analyze the stimulus-dependent tuning of neural variability in ring attractor networks. We apply perturbation methods to show how the neural field equations can be reduced to a pair of stochastic nonlinear phase equations describing the stochastic wandering of spontaneously formed tuning curves or bump solutions. These equations are analyzed using a modified version of the bivariate von Mises distribution, which is well-known in the theory of circular statistics. We first consider a single ring network and derive a simple mathematical expression that accounts for the experimentally observed bimodal (or M-shaped) tuning of neural variability. We then explore the effects of inter-network coupling on stimulus-dependent variability in a pair of ring networks. These could represent populations of cells in two different layers of a cortical hypercolumn linked via vertical synaptic connections, or two different cortical hypercolumns linked by horizontal patchy connections within the same layer. We find that neural variability can be suppressed or facilitated, depending on whether the inter-network coupling is excitatory or inhibitory, and on the relative strengths and biases of the external stimuli to the two networks. These results are consistent with the general observation that increasing the mean firing rate via external stimuli or modulating drives tends to reduce neural variability.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/YRSKMlstR3Y&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Self-organization of conducting pathways explains electrical wave propagation in cardiac tissues with high fraction of non-conducting cells</title>

Cardiac fibrosis occurs in many forms of heart disease and is considered to be one of the main arrhythmogenic factors. Regions with a high density of fibroblasts are likely to cause blocks of wave propagation that give rise to dangerous cardiac arrhythmias. Therefore, studies of the wave propagation through these regions are very important, yet the precise mechanisms leading to arrhythmia formation in fibrotic cardiac tissue remain poorly understood. Particularly, it is not clear how wave propagation is organized at the cellular level, as experiments show that the regions with a high percentage of fibroblasts (65-75%) are still conducting electrical signals, whereas geometric analysis of randomly distributed conducting and non-conducting cells predicts connectivity loss at 40% at the most (percolation threshold). To address this question, we used a joint &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;-&lt;i&gt;in silico&lt;/i&gt; approach, which combined experiments in neonatal rat cardiac monolayers with morphological and electrophysiological computer simulations. We have shown that the main reason for sustainable wave propagation in highly fibrotic samples is the formation of a branching network of cardiomyocytes. We have successfully reproduced the morphology of conductive pathways in computer modelling, assuming that cardiomyocytes align their cytoskeletons to fuse into cardiac syncytium. The electrophysiological properties of the monolayers, such as conduction velocity, conduction blocks and wave fractionation, were reproduced as well. In a virtual cardiac tissue, we have also examined the wave propagation at the subcellular level, detected wavebreaks formation and its relation to the structure of fibrosis and, thus, analysed the processes leading to the onset of arrhythmias.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/oJ7vIl7BoVg&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To investigate whether high‐frequency oscillations (HFOs) show spatiotemporal propagation and assess the relevance of the earliest oscillations in relation to the seizure onset zone (SOZ) and postsurgical outcome.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We retrospectively investigated the intracerebral electroencephalography (EEG) of patients who became seizure free after subsequent surgery. We marked HFOs during 1 hour of recordings. We calculated the time delay between pairs of channels as the median delay between their HFOs and constructed a time line of the delay of each channel with respect to the earliest channel (first source channel). A network was defined when a temporal order could be established among the channels based on the existence of statistically significant delays.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fifteen patients with good surgical outcome were included. We found ripple networks in all patients, and fast ripple networks in 9. For ripples, first source channels were found in a higher proportion in the SOZ than the rest of the network channels (15 of 27 [56%] versus 93 of 262 [35%]; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.04). For both ripples and fast ripples, first source channels were resected more often that the rest of the network channels (ripples: 13 of 27 [48%] versus 65 of 262 [25%]; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.01; fast ripples: 8 of 9 [89%] versus 17 of 40 [43%]; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.002); channels with the highest rates of ripples and fast ripples were resected in a similar proportion.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These results demonstrate that interictal HFOs are organized in networks and indicate a possible need for the resection of first source channels. However, resecting them is not superior to resecting channels with highest rates of HFOs. Ann Neurol, 2019&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Growing evidence from Alzheimer disease supports a potentially beneficial role of slow‐wave sleep in neurodegeneration. However, the importance of slow‐wave sleep in Parkinson disease is unknown. In 129 patients with Parkinson disease, we retrospectively tested whether sleep slow waves, objectively quantified with polysomnography, relate to longitudinal changes in Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale motor scores. We found that higher accumulated power of sleep slow waves was associated with slower motor progression, particularly of axial motor symptoms, over a mean time of 4.6±2.3 years. This preliminary finding suggests that deeper sleep relates to slower motor progression in Parkinson disease.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>RSS PAP: Transduction of the Geomagnetic Field as Evidenced from Alpha-band Activity in the Human Brain</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0483-18.2019v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Magnetoreception, the perception of the geomagnetic field, is a sensory modality well-established across all major groups of vertebrates and some invertebrates, but its presence in humans has been tested rarely, yielding inconclusive results. We report here a strong, specific human brain response to ecologically-relevant rotations of Earth-strength magnetic fields. Following geomagnetic stimulation, a drop in amplitude of EEG alpha oscillations (8-13 Hz) occurred in a repeatable manner. Termed alpha event-related desynchronization (alpha-ERD), such a response has been associated previously with sensory and cognitive processing of external stimuli including vision, auditory and somatosensory cues. Alpha-ERD in response to the geomagnetic field was triggered only by horizontal rotations when the static vertical magnetic field was directed downwards, as it is in the Northern Hemisphere; no brain responses were elicited by the same horizontal rotations when the static vertical component was directed upwards. This implicates a biological response tuned to the ecology of the local human population, rather than a generic physical effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Biophysical tests showed that the neural response was sensitive to static components of the magnetic field. This rules out all forms of electrical induction (including artifacts from the electrodes) which are determined solely on dynamic components of the field. The neural response was also sensitive to the polarity of the magnetic field. This rules out free-radical 'quantum compass' mechanisms like the cryptochrome hypothesis, which can detect only axial alignment. Ferromagnetism remains a viable biophysical mechanism for sensory transduction and provides a basis to start the behavioral exploration of human magnetoreception.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Although many migrating and homing animals are sensitive to Earth’s magnetic field, most humans are not consciously aware of the geomagnetic stimuli that we encounter in everyday life. Either we have lost a shared, ancestral magnetosensory system, or the system lacks a conscious component with detectable neural activity but no apparent perceptual awareness by us. We found two classes of ecologically-relevant rotations of Earth-strength magnetic fields that produce strong, specific and repeatable effects on human brainwave activity in the EEG alpha band (8-13 Hz); EEG discriminates in response to different geomagnetic field stimuli. Biophysical tests rule out all except the presence of a ferromagnetic transduction element, such as biologically-precipitated crystals of magnetite (Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: latest articles: Complementary networks of cortical somatostatin interneurons enforce layer specific control</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/43696</link>
	<content:encoded>The neocortex is functionally organized into layers. Layer four receives the densest bottom up sensory inputs, while layers 2/3 and 5 receive top down inputs that may convey predictive information. A subset of cortical somatostatin (SST) neurons, the Martinotti cells, gate top down input by inhibiting the apical dendrites of pyramidal cells in layers 2/3 and 5, but it is unknown whether an analogous inhibitory mechanism controls activity in layer 4. Using high precision circuit mapping, in vivo optogenetic perturbations, and single cell transcriptional profiling, we reveal complementary circuits in the mouse barrel cortex involving genetically distinct SST subtypes that specifically and reciprocally interconnect with excitatory cells in different layers: Martinotti cells connect with layers 2/3 and 5, whereas non-Martinotti cells connect with layer 4. By enforcing layer-specific inhibition, these parallel SST subnetworks could independently regulate the balance between bottom up and top down input.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: latest articles: Behavioural and neural signatures of perceptual decision-making are modulated by pupil-linked arousal</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/42541</link>
	<content:encoded>The timing and accuracy of perceptual decision-making is exquisitely sensitive to fluctuations in arousal. Although extensive research has highlighted the role of various neural processing stages in forming decisions, our understanding of how arousal impacts these processes remains limited. Here we isolated electrophysiological signatures of decision-making alongside signals reflecting target selection, attentional engagement and motor output and examined their modulation as a function of tonic and phasic arousal, indexed by baseline and task-evoked pupil diameter, respectively. Reaction times were shorter on trials with lower tonic, and higher phasic arousal. Additionally, these two pupil measures were predictive of a unique set of EEG signatures that together represent multiple information processing steps of decision-making. Finally, behavioural variability associated with fluctuations in tonic and phasic arousal, indicative of neuromodulators acting on multiple timescales, was mediated by its effects on the EEG markers of attentional engagement, sensory processing and the variability in decision processing.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/41720</link>
	<content:encoded>SNAP-25 is an essential component of SNARE complexes driving fast Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-dependent exocytosis. Yet, the functional implications of the tandem-like structure of SNAP-25 are unclear. Here, we have investigated the mechanistic role of the acylated “linker” domain that concatenates the two SNARE motifs within SNAP-25. Refuting older concepts of an inert connector, our detailed structure-function analysis in murine chromaffin cells demonstrates that linker motifs play a crucial role in vesicle priming, triggering, and fusion pore expansion. Mechanistically, we identify two synergistic functions of the SNAP-25 linker: First, linker motifs support t-SNARE interactions and accelerate ternary complex assembly. Second, the acylated N-terminal linker segment engages in local lipid interactions that facilitate fusion triggering and pore evolution, putatively establishing a favorable membrane configuration by shielding phospholipid headgroups and affecting curvature. Hence, the linker is a functional part of the fusion complex that promotes secretion by SNARE interactions as well as concerted lipid interplay.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: latest articles: Consolidation alters motor sequence-specific distributed representations</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/39324</link>
	<content:encoded>FMRI studies investigating the acquisition of sequential motor skills in humans have revealed learning-related functional reorganizations of the cortico-striatal and cortico-cerebellar motor systems accompanied with an initial hippocampal contribution. Yet, the functional significance of these activity level changes remains ambiguous as they convey the evolution of both sequence-specific knowledge and unspecific task ability. Moreover, these changes do not specifically assess the occurrence of learning-related plasticity. To address these issues, we investigated local circuits tuning to sequence-specific information using multivariate distances between patterns evoked by consolidated or newly acquired motor sequences production. The results reveal that representations in dorsolateral striatum, prefrontal and secondary motor cortices are greater when executing consolidated sequences than untrained ones. By contrast, sequence representations in the hippocampus and dorsomedial striatum becomes less engaged. Our findings show, for the first time in humans, that complementary sequence-specific motor representations evolve distinctively during critical phases of skill acquisition and consolidation.</content:encoded>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: The Role of Redox Dysregulation in the Effects of Prenatal Stress on Embryonic Interneuron Migration</title>

	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Maternal stress during pregnancy is associated with increased risk of psychiatric disorders in offspring, but embryonic brain mechanisms disrupted by prenatal stress are not fully understood. Our lab has shown that prenatal stress delays inhibitory neural progenitor migration. Here, we investigated redox dysregulation as a mechanism for embryonic cortical interneuron migration delay, utilizing direct manipulation of pro- and antioxidants and a mouse model of maternal repetitive restraint stress starting on embryonic day 12. Time-lapse, live-imaging of migrating GAD67GFP+ interneurons showed that normal tangential migration of inhibitory progenitor cells was disrupted by the pro-oxidant, hydrogen peroxide. Interneuron migration was also delayed by in utero intracerebroventricular rotenone. Prenatal stress altered glutathione levels and induced changes in activity of antioxidant enzymes and expression of redox-related genes in the embryonic forebrain. Assessment of dihydroethidium (DHE) fluorescence after prenatal stress in ganglionic eminence (GE), the source of migrating interneurons, showed increased levels of DHE oxidation. Maternal antioxidants (&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;N&lt;/span&gt;-acetylcysteine and astaxanthin) normalized DHE oxidation levels in GE and ameliorated the migration delay caused by prenatal stress. Through convergent redox manipula-tions, delayed interneuron migration after prenatal stress was found to critically involve redox dysregulation. Redox biology during prenatal periods may be a target for protecting brain development.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Hyperpolarization-activated cation channels are involved, among other functions, in learning and memory, control of synaptic transmission and epileptogenesis. The importance of the HCN1 and HCN2 isoforms for brain function has been demonstrated, while the role of HCN4, the third major neuronal HCN subunit, is not known. Here we show that HCN4 is essential for oscillatory activity in the thalamocortical (TC) network. HCN4 is selectively expressed in various thalamic nuclei, excluding the thalamic reticular nucleus. HCN4-deficient TC neurons revealed a massive reduction of &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Ih&lt;/span&gt; and strongly reduced intrinsic burst firing, whereas the current was normal in cortical pyramidal neurons. In addition, evoked bursting in a thalamic slice preparation was strongly reduced in the mutant mice probes. HCN4-deficiency also significantly slowed down thalamic and cortical oscillations during active wakefulness. Taken together, these results establish that thalamic HCN4 channels are essential for the production of rhythmic intrathalamic oscillations and determine regular TC oscillatory activity during alert states.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;We previously observed an association between mode of delivery and brain mitochondrial mechanisms in pups. We also showed that mitochondrial processes impact adult behavior. However, no experimental data is available to causally connect mode of delivery with cellular processes of neurons in the cerebral cortex and adult behavior. Here we show that surgical delivery of pups alters mitochondrial dynamics and spine synapses of layer 3 pyramidal neurons of the prefrontal cortex compared to the values of mice delivered vaginally. These alterations in ultrastructure seen in adult mice delivered surgically were associated with the development of behavioral phenotypes resembling those characteristic of animal models of psychiatric illness. This included impaired performance in prepulse inhibition as well as hyperlocomotion in the open field and elevated plus maze tests. Knocking out a mitochondria-related gene, UCP-2, blocked cellular and behavioral adaptations induced by surgical delivery. These results highlight a crucial role for brain mitochondrial adaptations in the process of birth to affect neuronal circuitry in support of normal and altered adult behaviors. Further, these findings were supported with neuroimaging data from human neonates delivered vaginally and surgically, suggesting that the murine findings have human clinical relevance.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;The ability to perceive and exercise control over an outcome is both desirable and beneficial to our well-being. It has been shown that animals and humans alike exhibit behavioral bias towards seeking control and that such bias recruits the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) and striatum. Yet, this bias remains to be quantitatively captured and studied neurally. Here, we employed a behavioral task to measure the preference for control and characterize its neural underpinnings. Participants made a series of binary choices between having control and no-control over a game for monetary reward. The mere presence of the control option evoked activity in the ventral striatum. Importantly, we manipulated the expected value (EV) of each choice pair to extract the pairing where participants were equally likely to choose either option. The difference in EV between the options at this point of equivalence was inferred as the subjective value of control. Strikingly, perceiving control inflated the reward value of the associated option by 30% and this value inflation was tracked by the vmPFC. Altogether, these results capture the subjective value of perceived control inherent in decision making and highlight the role of corticostriatal circuitry in the perception of control.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Individuals with Down syndrome (DS) show high inter-subject variability in cognitive ability and have an ultra-high risk of developing dementia (90% lifetime prevalence). Elucidating factors underlying variability in cognitive function can inform us about intellectual disability (ID) and may improve our understanding of factors associated with later cognitive decline. Increased neuronal inhibition has been posited to contribute to ID in DS. Combining electroencephalography (EEG) with dynamic causal modeling (DCM) provides a non-invasive method for investigating excitatory/inhibitory mechanisms. Resting-state EEG recordings were obtained from 36 adults with DS with no evidence of cognitive decline. Theta–alpha activity (4–13 Hz) was characterized in relation to general cognitive ability (raw Kaufmann’s Brief Intelligence Test second Edition (KBIT-2) score). Higher KBIT-2 was associated with higher frontal alpha peak amplitude and higher theta–alpha band power across distributed regions. Modeling this association with DCM revealed intrinsic self-inhibition was the key network parameter underlying observed differences in 4–13 Hz power in relation to KBIT-2 and age. In particular, intrinsic self-inhibition in right V1 was negatively correlated with KBIT-2. Results suggest intrinsic self-inhibition within the alpha network is associated with individual differences in cognitive ability in adults with DS, and may provide a potential therapeutic target for cognitive enhancement.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;When viewing familiar stimuli (e.g., common words), processing is highly automatized such that it can interfere with the processing of incompatible sensory information. At least two mechanisms may help mitigate this interference. Early selection accounts posit that attentional processes filter out distracting sensory information to avoid conflict. Alternatively, late selection accounts hold that all sensory inputs receive full semantic analysis and that frontal executive mechanisms are recruited to resolve conflict. To test how these mechanisms operate to overcome conflict induced by highly automatized processing, we developed a novel version of the color-word Stroop task, where targets and distractors were simultaneously flickered at different frequencies. We measured the quality of early sensory processing by assessing the amplitude of steady-state visually evoked potentials (SSVEPs) elicited by targets and distractors. We also indexed frontal executive processes by assessing changes in frontal theta oscillations induced by color-word incongruency. We found that target- and distractor-related SSVEPs were not modulated by changes in the level of conflict whereas frontal theta activity increased on high compared to low conflict trials. These results suggest that frontal executive processes play a more dominant role in mitigating cognitive interference driven by the automatic tendency to process highly familiar stimuli.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

Using the selective PDE1 inhibitor Lu AF64196 and biosensors for cyclic nucleotides including a novel biosensor for cGMP, we analyzed the effect of PDE1 on cAMP and cGMP in individual neurones in brain slices from male newborn mice. Release of caged NMDA triggered a transient increase of intracellular calcium, which was associated with a decrease in cAMP and cGMP in medium spiny neurones in the striatum. Lu AF64196 alone did not increase neuronal cyclic nucleotide levels, but blocked the NMDA-induced reduction in cyclic nucleotides indicating that this was mediated by calcium-activated PDE1. Similar effects were observed in the prefrontal cortex and the hippocampus. Upon corelease of dopamine and NMDA, PDE1 was shown to down-regulate the D&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-receptor mediated increase in cAMP. PDE1 inhibition increased long-term potentiation in rat ventral striatum, showing that PDE1 is implicated in the regulation of synaptic plasticity. Overall, our results show that PDE1 reduces cyclic nucleotide signaling in the context of glutamate and dopamine coincidence. This effect could have a therapeutic value for treating brain disorders related to dysfunctions in dopamine neuromodulation.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

We found a rich variety of discharge patterns, ranging from limb-independent cells that discharged several steps in front of the obstacle to step-related cells that discharged either during steps over the obstacle or in the steps leading up to that step. We propose that this population of task-related cells within this region of the PMC contributes to the temporal evolution of a planning process that transforms global information of the presence of an obstacle into the precise spatio-temporal limb adjustment required to negotiate that obstacle.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

Indeed, both prediction and attention have been shown to modulate V1 activity, albeit with fMRI, which has low temporal resolution. This leaves it unclear whether these effects reflect a modulation of the first feedforward sweep of visual information processing and/or later, feedback-related activity. In two experiments, we used electroencephalography and orthogonally manipulated spatial predictions and attention to address this issue. Although clear top-down biases were found, as reflected in pre-stimulus alpha-band activity, we found no evidence for top-down effects on the earliest visual cortical processing stage (&amp;lt;80 ms post-stimulus), as indexed by the amplitude of the C1 event-related potential component and multivariate pattern analyses. These findings indicate that initial visual afferent activity may be impenetrable to top-down influences by spatial prediction and attention.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Acute Inescapable Stress Rapidly Increases Synaptic Energy Metabolism in Prefrontal Cortex and Alters Working Memory Performance</title>

	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Brain energy metabolism actively regulates synaptic transmission and activity. We have previously shown that acute footshock (FS)-stress induces fast and long-lasting functional and morphological changes at excitatory synapses in prefrontal cortex (PFC). Here, we asked whether FS-stress increased energy metabolism in PFC, and modified related cognitive functions. Using positron emission tomography (PET), we found that FS-stress induced a redistribution of glucose metabolism in the brain, with relative decrease of [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]FDG uptake in ventro-caudal regions and increase in dorso-rostral ones. Absolute [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]FDG uptake was inversely correlated with serum corticosterone. Increased specific hexokinase activity was also measured in purified PFC synaptosomes (but not in total extract) of FS-stressed rats, which positively correlated with 2-Deoxy [&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;H] glucose uptake by synaptosomes. In line with increased synaptic energy demand, using an electron microscopy-based stereological approach, we found that acute stress induced a redistribution of mitochondria at excitatory synapses, together with an increase in their volume. The fast functional and metabolic activation of PFC induced by acute stress, was accompanied by rapid and sustained alterations of working memory performance in delayed response to T-maze test. Taken together, the present data suggest that acute stress increases energy consumption at PFC synaptic terminals and alters working memory.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Preterm-born children suffer from neurological and behavioral disorders. Herein, we hypothesized that premature birth and non-maternal care of preterm newborns might disrupt neurobehavioral function, hippocampal dendritic arborization, and dendritic spine density. Additionally, we assessed whether 17β-estradiol (E2) replacement or the TrkB receptor agonist, 7,8-dihydroxyflavone (DHF), would reverse compromised dendritic development and cognitive function in preterm newborns. These hypotheses were tested by comparing preterm (E28.5) rabbit kits cared and gavage-fed by laboratory personnel and term-kits reared and breast-fed by their mother doe at an equivalent postconceptional age. Neurobehavioral tests showed that both premature-birth and formula-feeding with non-maternal care led to increased anxiety behavior, poor social interaction, and lack of novelty preference compared with term-kits. Dendritic branching and number of total or mushroom dendritic spines were reduced in the CA1 field of preterm-kits compared with term controls. While CDC42 and Rac1/2/3 expression levels were lower, RhoA-activity was higher in preterm-kits compared with term controls. Both E2 and DHF treatment reversed prematurity-induced reduction in spine density, reduced total RhoA-GTPase levels, and enhanced cognitive function. Hence, prematurity and non-maternal care result in cognitive deficits, and reduced dendritic arbors and spines in CA1. E2 replacement or DHF treatment might reverse changes in dendritic spines and improve neurodevelopment in premature infants.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Deletion of the KH1 Domain of Fmr1 Leads to Transcriptional Alterations and Attentional Deficits in Rats</title>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhz029/5382208?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is a neurodevelopmental disorder caused by mutations in the &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;FMR1&lt;/span&gt; gene. It is a leading monogenic cause of autism spectrum disorder and inherited intellectual disability and is often comorbid with attention deficits. Most FXS cases are due to an expansion of CGG repeats leading to suppressed expression of fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP), an RNA-binding protein involved in mRNA metabolism. We found that the previously published &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Fmr1&lt;/span&gt; knockout rat model of FXS expresses an &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Fmr1&lt;/span&gt; transcript with an in-frame deletion of exon 8, which encodes for the K-homology (KH) RNA-binding domain, KH1. Notably, 3 pathogenic missense mutations associated with FXS lie in the KH domains. We observed that the deletion of exon 8 in rats leads to attention deficits and to alterations in transcriptional profiles within the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), which map to 2 weighted gene coexpression network modules. These modules are conserved in human frontal cortex and enriched for known FMRP targets. Hub genes in these modules represent potential therapeutic targets for FXS. Taken together, these findings indicate that attentional testing might be a reliable cross-species tool for investigating FXS and identify dysregulated conserved gene networks in a relevant brain region.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

However, it is not yet understood whether brain function is already influenced by Aβ deposition during the very earliest stages of the disease. We therefore investigated associations between [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]Flutemetamol PET, resting-state functional connectivity, gray and white matter structure and cognitive performance in 133 cognitively normal elderly that exhibited normal global Aβ PET levels. [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]Flutemetamol uptake in regions known to accumulate Aβ fibrils early in preclinical AD (i.e., mainly certain parts of the default-mode network) was positively associated with dynamic but not static functional connectivity (&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;r&lt;/span&gt; = 0.77). Dynamic functional connectivity was further related to better cognitive performance (&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;r&lt;/span&gt; = 0.21–0.72). No significant associations were found for Aβ uptake with gray matter volume or white matter diffusivity. The findings demonstrate that the earliest accumulation of Aβ fibrils is associated with increased functional connectivity, which occurs before any structural alterations. The enhanced functional connectivity may reflect a compensatory mechanism to maintain high cognitive performance in the presence of increasing amyloid accumulation during the earliest phases of AD.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Boolean model of growth signaling, cell cycle and apoptosis predicts the molecular mechanism of aberrant cell cycle progression driven by hyperactive &lt;i&gt;PI3K&lt;/i&gt;</title>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Herbert Sizek, Andrew Hamel, Dávid Deritei, Sarah Campbell, Erzsébet Ravasz Regan&lt;/p&gt;

The &lt;i&gt;PI3K&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;AKT&lt;/i&gt; signaling pathway plays a role in most cellular functions linked to cancer progression, including cell growth, proliferation, cell survival, tissue invasion and angiogenesis. It is generally recognized that hyperactive &lt;i&gt;PI3K&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;AKT&lt;/i&gt; are oncogenic due to their boost to cell survival, cell cycle entry and growth-promoting metabolism. That said, the dynamics of &lt;i&gt;PI3K&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;AKT1&lt;/i&gt; during cell cycle progression are highly nonlinear. In addition to negative feedback that curtails their activity, protein expression of &lt;i&gt;PI3K&lt;/i&gt; subunits has been shown to oscillate in dividing cells. The low-&lt;i&gt;PI3K&lt;/i&gt;/low-&lt;i&gt;AKT1&lt;/i&gt; phase of these oscillations is required for cytokinesis, indicating that oncogenic &lt;i&gt;PI3K&lt;/i&gt; may directly contribute to genome duplication. To explore this, we construct a Boolean model of growth factor signaling that can reproduce &lt;i&gt;PI3K&lt;/i&gt; oscillations and link them to cell cycle progression and apoptosis. The resulting modular model reproduces hyperactive &lt;i&gt;PI3K&lt;/i&gt;-driven cytokinesis failure and genome duplication and predicts the molecular drivers responsible for these failures by linking hyperactive &lt;i&gt;PI3K&lt;/i&gt; to mis-regulation of Polo-like kinase 1 (&lt;i&gt;Plk1&lt;/i&gt;) expression late in G2. To do this, our model captures the role of &lt;i&gt;Plk1&lt;/i&gt; in cell cycle progression and accurately reproduces multiple effects of its loss: G2 arrest, mitotic catastrophe, chromosome mis-segregation / aneuploidy due to premature anaphase, and cytokinesis failure leading to genome duplication, depending on the timing of &lt;i&gt;Plk1&lt;/i&gt; inhibition along the cell cycle. Finally, we offer testable predictions on the molecular drivers of &lt;i&gt;PI3K&lt;/i&gt; oscillations, the timing of these oscillations with respect to division, and the role of altered &lt;i&gt;Plk1&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;FoxO&lt;/i&gt; activity in genome-level defects caused by hyperactive &lt;i&gt;PI3K&lt;/i&gt;. Our model is an important starting point for the predictive modeling of cell fate decisions that include &lt;i&gt;AKT1&lt;/i&gt;-driven senescence, as well as the non-intuitive effects of drugs that interfere with mitosis.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/WyFcUBh-Z_Y&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>RSS PAP: Inverted encoding models reconstruct an arbitrary model response, not the stimulus</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0363-18.2019v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Probing how large populations of neurons represent stimuli is key to understanding sensory representations as many stimulus characteristics can only be discerned from population activity and not from individual single-units. Recently, inverted encoding models have been used to produce channel response functions from large spatial-scale measurements of human brain activity that are reminiscent of single-unit tuning functions and have been proposed to assay &quot;population-level stimulus representations&quot; (Sprague et al., 2018a). However, these channel response functions do not assay population tuning. We show by derivation that the channel response function is only determined up to an invertible linear transform. Thus these channel response functions are arbitrary, one of an infinite family and therefore not a unique description of population representation. Indeed, simulations demonstrate that bimodal, even random, channel basis functions can account perfectly well for population responses without any underlying neural response units that are so tuned. However, the approach can be salvaged by extending it to reconstruct the stimulus, not the assumed model. We show that when this is done, even using bimodal and random channel basis functions, a unimodal function peaking at the appropriate value of the stimulus is recovered which can be interpreted as a measure of population selectivity. More precisely, the recovered function signifies how likely any value of the stimulus is, given the observed population response. Whether an analysis is recovering the hypothetical responses of an arbitrary model rather than assessing the selectivity of population representations is not an issue unique to the inverted encoding model and human neuroscience, but a general problem that must be confronted as more complex analyses intervene between measurement of population activity and presentation of data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; We recently showed that inverted encoding models conflate signal to noise ratio with neural tuning width. Sprague and colleagues argued that despite this short falling, inverted encoding models &quot;assay population-level stimulus representations&quot;. However, we show that inverted encoding models reconstruct the model responses, not the stimulus. This is problematic because the model, as we derive here, is only determined up to a linear transform and thus the recovered model responses are only one of an infinite family of equivalent solutions. The approach thus fails to provide a unique assay of population representation. This problem can be circumvented by extending the approach to estimate the probability of different values of the stimulus, thus resulting in an interpretable assay of population representation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Sign Tracking and Goal Tracking Are Characterized by Distinct Patterns of Nucleus Accumbens Activity</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/6/2/ENEURO.0414-18.2019?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;During Pavlovian conditioning, if a cue (e.g., lever extension) predicts reward delivery in a different location (e.g., a food magazine), some individuals will come to approach and interact with the cue, a behavior known as sign tracking (ST), and others will approach the site of reward, a behavior known as goal tracking (GT). In rats, the acquisition of ST versus GT behavior is associated with distinct profiles of dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens (NAc), but it is unknown whether it is associated with different patterns of accumbens neural activity. Therefore, we recorded from individual neurons in the NAc core during the acquisition, maintenance, and extinction of ST and GT behavior. Even though NAc dopamine is specifically important for the acquisition and expression of ST, we found that cue-evoked excitatory responses encode the vigor of both ST and GT behavior. In contrast, among sign trackers only, there was a prominent decrease in reward-related activity over the course of training, which may reflect the decreasing reward prediction error encoded by phasic dopamine. Finally, both behavior and cue-evoked activity were relatively resistant to extinction in sign trackers, as compared with goal trackers, although a subset of neurons in both groups retained their cue-evoked responses. Overall, the results point to the convergence of multiple forms of reward learning in the NAc.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

However, the first histone demethylase (HDM) was identified in 2004, challenging this notion. Since that time, more than 20 HDMs have been identified and characterized, and many have been shown to have critical roles in organismal development, cell fate, and disease. Here, we highlight some of the recent advances in our understanding of the function of HDMs in the context of neuronal development, plasticity, and disease. We focus, in particular, on molecular genetic studies of LSD1, Kdm6b, and Kdm5c that have elucidated both enzymatic and non-enzymatic gene regulatory functions of these HDMs in neurons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;While it is still not possible to describe the neural-level connections of
the human brain, we can map the human connectome with several hundred vertices,
by the application of diffusion-MRI based techniques. In these graphs, the
nodes correspond to anatomically identified gray matter areas of the brain,
while the edges correspond to the axonal fibers, connecting these areas. In our
previous contributions, we have described numerous graph-theoretical phenomena
of the human connectomes. Here we map the frequent complete subgraphs of the
human brain networks: in these subgraphs, every pair of vertices is connected
by an edge. We also examine sex differences in the results. The mapping of the
frequent subgraphs gives robust substructures in the graph: if a subgraph is
present in the 80\% of the graphs, then, most probably, it could not be an
artifact of the measurement or the data processing workflow. We list here the
frequent complete subgraphs of the female and the male braingraphs of 414
subjects, each with 463 nodes, with a frequency threshold of 80\%, and identify
complete subgraphs, which are more frequent in male and female connectomes,
respectively.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The visual system is an intricate network of brain regions that enables us to
recognize the world around us. Despite its abundant lateral and feedback
connections, human object processing is commonly viewed and studied as a
feedforward process. Here, we measure and model the rapid representational
dynamics across multiple stages of the human ventral stream using time-resolved
brain imaging and deep learning. We observe substantial representational
transformations during the first 300 ms of processing within and across
ventral-stream regions. Categorical divisions emerge in sequence, cascading
forward and in reverse across regions, and Granger causality analysis suggests
bidirectional information flow between regions. Finally, recurrent deep neural
network models clearly outperform feedforward models in terms of their ability
to jointly capture the multi-region cortical dynamics. These results establish
that recurrent models are required to understand information processing in the
human ventral stream.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: The Neural Basis and Evolution of Divergent and Convergent Thought. (arXiv:1611.03609v2 [q-bio.NC] UPDATED)</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.03609</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;This chapter takes as its departure point a neural level theory of insight
that arose from studies of the sparse, distributed, content-addressable
architecture of associative memory. It is argued that convergent thought is
most fruitfully characterized in terms of, not the generation of a single
correct solution (as it is conventionally construed), but using concepts in
their most compact form by activating neural cell assemblies that respond to
their most typical properties. This allows them to be deployed in a
conventional manner such that effort is reserved for exploring causal
relationships. Conversely, it is argued that divergent thought is most
fruitfully characterized in terms of, not the generation of multiple solutions
(as it is conventionally construed), but using concepts in a form that is,
albeit expanded, constrained by the situation, by activating neural cell
assemblies that respond to context-specific atypical properties. This allows
them to be deployed in a manner that is conducive to exploring unconventional
yet potentially relevant associations, and unearthing potentially useful
relationships of correlation. Thus, divergent thought can involve as few as one
idea. This proposal is compatible with widespread beliefs that (1) most
creative tasks require not many solutions but one, yet entail both divergent
and convergent thinking, and (2) not all problems with multiple solutions
require creative thinking, and conversely, some problems with single solution
do require creative thought. The chapter discusses how the ability to shift
between convergent and divergent modes of thought may have evolved, and it
concludes with educational and vocational implications.

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/42262</link>
	<content:encoded>In the unfolded protein response (UPR), stress in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) activates a large transcriptional program to increase ER folding capacity. During the budding yeast UPR, Ire1 excises an intron from the &lt;i&gt;HAC1&lt;/i&gt; mRNA and the exon products of cleavage are ligated, and the translated protein induces hundreds of stress-response genes. Using cells with mutations in RNA repair and decay enzymes, we show that phosphorylation of two different &lt;i&gt;HAC1&lt;/i&gt; splicing intermediates is required for their degradation by the 5′→3′ exonuclease Xrn1 to enact opposing effects on the UPR. We also found that ligated but 2′-phosphorylated &lt;i&gt;HAC1&lt;/i&gt; mRNA is cleaved, yielding a decay intermediate with both 5′- and 2′-phosphates at its 5′-end that inhibit 5′→3′ decay and suggesting that Ire1 degrades incompletely processed &lt;i&gt;HAC1&lt;/i&gt;. These decay events expand the scope of RNA-based regulation in the budding yeast UPR and have implications for the control of the metazoan UPR.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/41626</link>
	<content:encoded>Pitch perception is critical for recognizing speech, music and animal vocalizations, but its neurobiological basis remains unsettled, in part because of divergent results across species. We investigated whether species-specific differences exist in the cues used to perceive pitch and whether these can be accounted for by differences in the auditory periphery. Ferrets accurately generalized pitch discriminations to untrained stimuli whenever temporal envelope cues were robust in the probe sounds, but not when resolved harmonics were the main available cue. By contrast, human listeners exhibited the opposite pattern of results on an analogous task, consistent with previous studies. Simulated cochlear responses in the two species suggest that differences in the relative salience of the two pitch cues can be attributed to differences in cochlear filter bandwidths. The results support the view that cross-species variation in pitch perception reflects the constraints of estimating a sound’s fundamental frequency given species-specific cochlear tuning.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/39842</link>
	<content:encoded>Transposable element (TE) activity is repressed in animal gonads by PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) produced by piRNA clusters. Current models in flies propose that germinal piRNA clusters are functionally defined by the maternal inheritance of piRNAs produced during the previous generation. Taking advantage of an inactive, but ready to go, cluster of &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;-element derived transgene insertions in &lt;i&gt;Drosophila melanogaster&lt;/i&gt;, we show here that raising flies at high temperature (29°C) instead of 25°C triggers the stable conversion of this locus from inactive into actively producing functional piRNAs. The increase of antisense transcripts from the cluster at 29°C combined with the requirement of transcription of euchromatic homologous sequences, suggests a role of double stranded RNA in the production of &lt;i&gt;de novo&lt;/i&gt; piRNAs. This report describes the first case of the establishment of an active piRNA cluster by environmental changes in the absence of maternal inheritance of homologous piRNAs.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Andrey V. Dmitriev, Alexander A. Dmitriev, Robert A. Linsenmeier&lt;/p&gt;

Neuronal activity is associated with transmembrane ionic redistribution, which can lead to an osmotic imbalance. Accordingly, activity-dependent changes of the membrane potential are sometimes accompanied by changes in intracellular or extracellular volume. Experimental data that include distributions of ions and volume during neuronal activity are rare and rather inconsistent partly due to the technical difficulty of performing such measurements. However, progress in understanding the interrelations among ions, voltage and volume has been achieved recently by computational modelling, particularly “charge-difference” modelling. In this work a charge-difference computational model was used for further understanding of the specific roles for cations and anions. Our simulations show that without anion conductances the transmembrane movements of cations are always osmotically balanced, regardless of the stoichiometry of the pump or the ratio of Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; conductances. Yet any changes in cation conductance or pump activity are associated with changes of the membrane potential, even when a hypothetically electroneutral pump is used in calculations and K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; conductances are equal. On the other hand, when a Cl&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; conductance is present, the only way to keep the Cl&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;equilibrium potential in accordance with the changed membrane potential is to adjust cell volume. Importantly, this voltage-evoked Cl&lt;sup&gt;—&lt;/sup&gt;dependent volume change does not affect intracellular cation concentrations or the amount of energy that is necessary to support the system. Taking other factors into consideration (i.e. the presence of internal impermeant poly-anions, the activity of cation-Cl&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; cotransporters, and the buildup of intra- and extracellular osmolytes, both charged and electroneutral) adds complexity, but does not change the main principles.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/VHCTEZgTAC4&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Diving behaviour of narwhals is still largely unknown. We use Hidden Markov models (HMMs) to describe the diving behaviour of a narwhal and fit the models to a three-dimensional response vector of maximum dive depth, duration of dives and post-dive surface time of 8,609 dives measured in East Greenland over 83 days, an extraordinarily long and rich data set. Narwhal diving patterns have not been analysed like this before, but in studies of other whale species, response variables have been assumed independent. We extend the existing models to allow for dependence between state distributions, and show that the dependence has an impact on the conclusions drawn about the diving behaviour. We try several HMMs with 2, 3 or 4 states, and with independent and dependent log-normal and gamma distributions, respectively, and different covariates to characterize dive patterns. In particular, diurnal patterns in diving behaviour is inferred, by using periodic B-splines with boundary knots in 0 and 24 hours.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/8xzQ9ROcIkY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>RSS PAP: Plasticity of NMDA Receptors at Ventral Hippocampal Synapses in the Infralimbic Cortex Regulates Cued Fear</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0354-18.2019v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;The medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) processes contextual information from the hippocampus to generate appropriate fear responses. In rodents, one path for sending contextual information to the mPFC is via the direct projections from the ventral hippocampus (vHC) to the infralimbic cortex (IL). Plasticity in the synaptic communication from the vHC to the IL could contribute to the behavioral changes produced by the acquisition and extinction of conditioned fear. To examine this possibility, we used optogenetic stimulation of vHC synapses in brain slices from trained rats. We found that fear acquisition reduced NMDA receptor (NMDAR) currents at vHC synapses onto IL pyramidal neurons. The depression of NMDAR currents reversed more efficiently after extinction in the conditioning context than extinction in a novel context. Moreover, a cohort of animals that exhibited poor extinction retrieval failed to reverse the plasticity induced by fear conditioning. In addition, ex vivo application of brain-derived neurotrophic factor, which is known to simulate extinction in IL, reversed this conditioning-induced plasticity mimicking extinction. Therefore, we have identified a novel mechanism that modulates conditioned fear via changes in NMDAR current at vHC synapses onto IL pyramidal neurons. Disruption of this mechanism could contribute to the abnormal contextual modulation of fear seen in posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Contextual information processing by the medial prefrontal cortex is critical for appropriate behavioral responses. Using optogenetics in brain slices, we found that acquisition of conditioned fear depressed NMDA receptor currents at ventral hippocampal synapses in the infralimbic cortex (IL) and extinction reversed the depression. BDNF could also reverse the conditioning-induced depression mimicking extinction. In contrast, animals with impaired fear extinction recall, a PTSD-like phenotype, failed to reverse the conditioning-induced changes. Our findings suggest that conditioned fear responses are modulated by changes in NMDAR current at ventral hippocampal synapses in IL and suggest a novel mechanism that could contribute to impaired contextual modulation of fear seen in patients with PTSD.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25457?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Phosphomannomutase deficiency (PMM2‐CDG) causes cerebellar syndrome and stroke‐like episodes (SLEs). SLEs are also described in patients with gain‐of‐function mutations in the CaV2.1 channel, for which acetazolamide therapy is suggested. Impairment in N‐glycosylation of CaV2.1 promotes gain‐of‐function effects and may participate in cerebellar syndrome in PMM2‐CDG. AZATAX was designed to establish whether acetazolamide is safe and improves cerebellar syndrome in PMM2‐CDG.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A clinical trial included PMM2‐CDG patients with a 6‐month first‐phase single acetazolamide therapy group, followed by a randomized 5‐week withdrawal phase. Safety was assessed. The primary outcome measure was improvement in the International Cooperative Ataxia Rating Scale (ICARS). Other measures were the Nijmegen Pediatric CDG Rating Scale (NPCRS), a syllable repetition test (PATA test), and cognitive scores.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Twenty‐four patients (mean age 12.3±4.5 years) were included, showing no serious adverse events. Thirteen patients required dose adjustment due to low bicarbonate or asthenia. There were improvements in ICARS (34.9±23.2 vs 40.7±24.8, effect size 1.48, [95%CI 4.0‐7.6]; &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.001), detected at 6 weeks in 18 patients among the 20 responders, in NPCRS ([95%CI 0.3‐1.6]; &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;=0.013) and in PATA test ([95%CI 0.5‐3.0]; &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;=0.006). Acetazolamide improved prothrombin time, factor X, and antithrombin. Clinical severity, epilepsy, and lipodystrophy predicted greater response. The randomized withdrawal phase showed an ICARS worsening in the withdrawal group (effect size 1.46, [95%CI 2.65‐7.52]; &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;=0.001).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AZATAX is the first clinical trial of PMM2‐CDG. Acetazolamide is well tolerated and effective for motor cerebellar syndrome. Its ability to prevent SLEs and its long‐term effects on kidney function should be addressed in future studies.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>eNeuro current issue: The Disease-Associated Chaperone FKBP51 Impairs Cognitive Function by Accelerating AMPA Receptor Recycling</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/6/1/ENEURO.0242-18.2019?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Increased expression of the FK506-binding protein 5 (&lt;i&gt;FKBP5&lt;/i&gt;) gene has been associated with a number of diseases, but most prominently in connection to psychiatric illnesses. Many of these psychiatric disorders present with dementia and other cognitive deficits, but a direct connection between these issues and alterations in &lt;i&gt;FKBP5&lt;/i&gt; remains unclear. We generated a novel transgenic mouse to selectively overexpress &lt;i&gt;FKBP5,&lt;/i&gt; which encodes the FKBP51 protein, in the corticolimbic system, which had no overt effects on gross body weight, motor ability, or general anxiety. Instead, we found that overexpression of FKBP51 impaired long-term depression (LTD) as well as spatial reversal learning and memory, suggesting a role in glutamate receptor regulation. Indeed, FKBP51 altered the association of heat-shock protein 90 (Hsp90) with AMPA receptors, which was accompanied by an accelerated rate of AMPA recycling. In this way, the chaperone system is critical in triage decisions for AMPA receptor trafficking. Imbalance in the chaperone system may manifest in impairments in both inhibitory learning and cognitive function. These findings uncover an unexpected and essential mechanism for learning and memory that is controlled by the psychiatric risk factor &lt;i&gt;FKBP5&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Network Properties Revealed during Multi-Scale Calcium Imaging of Seizure Activity in Zebrafish</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/6/1/ENEURO.0041-19.2019?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Seizures are characterized by hypersynchronization of neuronal networks. Understanding these networks could provide a critical window for therapeutic control of recurrent seizure activity, i.e., epilepsy. However, imaging seizure networks has largely been limited to microcircuits &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; or small &quot;windows&quot; &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. Here, we combine fast confocal imaging of genetically encoded calcium indicator (GCaMP)-expressing larval zebrafish with local field potential (LFP) recordings to study epileptiform events at whole-brain and single-neuron levels &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. Using an acute seizure model (pentylenetetrazole, PTZ), we reliably observed recurrent electrographic ictal-like events associated with generalized activation of all major brain regions and uncovered a well-preserved anterior-to-posterior seizure propagation pattern. We also examined brain-wide network synchronization and spatiotemporal patterns of neuronal activity in the optic tectum microcircuit. Brain-wide and single-neuronal level analysis of PTZ-exposed and 4-aminopyridine (4-AP)-exposed zebrafish revealed distinct network dynamics associated with seizure and non-seizure hyperexcitable states, respectively. Neuronal ensembles, comprised of coactive neurons, were also uncovered during interictal-like periods. Taken together, these results demonstrate that macro- and micro-network calcium motifs in zebrafish may provide a greater understanding of epilepsy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1903.05610</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;With memory encoding reliant on persistent changes in the properties of
synapses, a key question is how can memories be maintained from days to months
or a lifetime given molecular turnover? It is likely that positive feedback
loops are necessary to persistently maintain the strength of synapses that
participate in encoding. Such feedback may occur within signal-transduction
cascades and/or the regulation of translation, and it may occur within specific
subcellular compartments or within neuronal networks. Not surprisingly,
numerous positive feedback loops have been proposed. Some posited loops operate
at the level of biochemical signal transduction cascades, such as persistent
activation of Ca2+/calmodulin kinase II or protein kinase M zeta. Another level
consists of feedback loops involving transcriptional, epigenetic and
translational pathways, and autocrine actions of growth factors such as BDNF.
Finally, at the neuronal network level, recurrent reactivation of cell
assemblies encoding memories is likely to be essential for late maintenance of
memory. These levels are not isolated, but linked by shared components of
feedback loops. Here, we review characteristics of some commonly discussed
feedback loops proposed to underlie the maintenance of memory and long-term
synaptic plasticity, assess evidence for and against their necessity, and
suggest experiments that could further delineate the dynamics of these feedback
loops. We also discuss crosstalk between proposed loops, and ways in which such
interaction can facilitate the rapidity and robustness of memory formation and
storage.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Noisy network attractor models for transitions between EEG microstates. (arXiv:1903.05590v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1903.05590</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The brain is intrinsically organized into large-scale networks that
constantly re-organize on multiple timescales, even when the brain is at rest.
The timing of these dynamics is crucial for sensation, perception, cognition
and ultimately consciousness, but the underlying dynamics governing the
constant reorganization and switching between networks are not yet well
understood. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and
electroencephalography (EEG) provide anatomical and temporal information about
the resting-state networks (RSNs), respectively. EEG microstates are brief
periods of stable scalp topography, and four distinct configurations with
characteristic switching patterns between them are reliably identified at rest.
Microstates have been identified as the electrophysiological correlate of
fMRI-defined RSNs, this link could be established because EEG microstate
sequences are scale-free and have long-range temporal correlations. This
property is crucial for any approach to model EEG microstates. This paper
proposes a novel modeling approach for microstates: we consider nonlinear
stochastic differential equations (SDEs) that exhibit a noisy network attractor
between nodes that represent the microstates. Using a single layer network
between four states, we can reproduce the transition probabilities between
microstates but not the heavy tailed residence time distributions. Introducing
a two layer network with a hidden layer gives the flexibility to capture these
heavy tails and their long-range temporal correlations. We fit these models to
capture the statistical properties of microstate sequences from EEG data
recorded inside and outside the MRI scanner and show that the processing
required to separate the EEG signal from the fMRI machine noise results in a
loss of information which is reflected in differences in the long tail of the
dwell-time distributions.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Effect of Interpopulation Spike-Timing-Dependent Plasticity on Synchronized Rhythms in Neuronal Networks with Inhibitory and Excitatory Populations. (arXiv:1903.05288v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1903.05288</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;We consider clustered small-world networks (SWNs) with two inhibitory (I) and
excitatory (E) populations. This I-E neuronal network has adaptive dynamic I to
E and E to I interpopulation synaptic strengths, governed by interpopulation
spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP). In previous works without STDPs, fast
sparsely synchronized rhythms were found to appear in a range of noise
intensity $D$. Here, by varying $D$, we investigate the effect of
interpopulation STDPs on population states in the I- and the E-populations.
Depending on values of $D$, long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term
depression (LTD) for population-averaged values of saturated interpopulation
synaptic strengths are found to occur, and they make effects on the degree of
population synchronization. In a broad region of intermediate $D$, the degree
of good synchronization (with higher spiking measure) becomes decreased, while
in a region of large $D$, the degree of bad synchronization (with lower spiking
measure) gets increased. Consequently, in each I- or E-population, the
synchronization degree becomes nearly the same in a wide range of $D$. This
kind of &quot;equalization effect&quot; is found to occur via cooperative interplay
between the average occupation and pacing degrees of synchronized rhythms. Such
equalization effect is much more enhanced in the presence of combined I to E
and E to I STDPs when compared with the case of individual I to E or E to I
STDP. We note that the equalization effect in interpopulation synaptic
plasticity is in contrast to the Matthew (bipolarization) effect in
intrapopulation (I to I and E to E) synaptic plasticity where good (bad)
synchronization gets better (worse). Moreover, emergences of LTP and LTD of
interpopulation synaptic strengths are intensively investigated via a
microscopic method based on the distributions of time delays between the pre-
and the post-synaptic spike times.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Twenty-five years ago, Dunkelmann and Radons (1994) proposed that neural
networks should self-organize to a critical state. In models, criticality
offers a number of computational advantages. Thus this hypothesis, and in

avalanche of research, with thousands of studies referring to it. Nonetheless,
experimental results are still contradictory. How is it possible, that a
hypothesis has attracted active research for decades, but nonetheless remains
controversial? We discuss the experimental and conceptual controversy, and then
present a parsimonious solution that (i) unifies the contradictory experimental
results, (ii) avoids disadvantages of a critical state, and (iii) enables
rapid, adaptive tuning of network properties to task requirements.

Using both in vitro and in silico approaches, we studied the effect of key parameters, such as actin density, ADF/Cofilin concentration and network width on the network length. In the presence of ADF/Cofilin, networks reached equilibrium and became treadmilling. At the trailing edge, the network disintegrated into large fragments. A mathematical model predicts the network length as a function of width, actin and ADF/Cofilin concentrations. Local depletion of ADF/Cofilin by binding to actin is significant, leading to wider networks growing longer. A single rate of breaking network nodes, proportional to ADF/Cofilin density and inversely proportional to the square of the actin density, can account for the disassembly dynamics. Selective disassembly of heterogeneous networks by ADF/Cofilin controls steering during motility. Our results establish general principles on how the dynamic steady state of actin network emerges from biochemical and structural feedbacks.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: latest articles: Inadequate BiP availability defines endoplasmic reticulum stress</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/41168</link>
	<content:encoded>How endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress leads to cytotoxicity is ill-defined. Previously we showed that HeLa cells readjust homeostasis upon proteostatically driven ER stress, triggered by inducible bulk expression of secretory immunoglobulin M heavy chain (μ&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;) thanks to the unfolded protein response (UPR; Bakunts et al., 2017). Here we show that conditions that prevent that an excess of the ER resident chaperone (and UPR target gene) BiP over µ&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; is restored lead to µ&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;-driven proteotoxicity, i.e. abrogation of HRD1-mediated ER-associated degradation (ERAD), or of the UPR, in particular the ATF6α branch. Such conditions are tolerated instead upon removal of the BiP-sequestering first constant domain (C&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;1) from µ&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;. Thus, our data define proteostatic ER stress to be a specific consequence of inadequate BiP availability, which both the UPR and ERAD redeem.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: latest articles: H3K9me3 is required for inheritance of small RNAs that target a unique subset of newly evolved genes</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/40448</link>
	<content:encoded>In &lt;i&gt;Caenorhabditis elegans&lt;/i&gt;, RNA interference (RNAi) responses can transmit across generations via small RNAs. RNAi inheritance is associated with Histone-3-Lysine-9 tri-methylation (H3K9me3) of the targeted genes. In other organisms, maintenance of silencing requires a feed-forward loop between H3K9me3 and small RNAs. Here, we show that in &lt;i&gt;C. elegans&lt;/i&gt; not only is H3K9me3 unnecessary for inheritance, the modification’s function depends on the identity of the RNAi-targeted gene. We found an asymmetry in the requirement for H3K9me3 and the main worm H3K9me3 methyltransferases, SET-25 and SET-32. Both methyltransferases promote heritable silencing of the foreign gene &lt;i&gt;gfp&lt;/i&gt;, but are dispensable for silencing of the endogenous gene &lt;i&gt;oma-1&lt;/i&gt;. Genome-wide examination of heritable endogenous small interfering RNAs (endo-siRNAs) revealed that endo-siRNAs that depend on SET-25 and SET-32 target newly acquired and highly H3K9me3 marked genes. Thus, ‘repressive’ chromatin marks could be important specifically for heritable silencing of genes which are flagged as ‘foreign’, such as &lt;i&gt;gfp&lt;/i&gt;.</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: A spatio-temporal individual-based network framework for West Nile virus in the USA: Spreading pattern of West Nile virus</title>

West Nile virus (WNV)—a mosquito-borne arbovirus—entered the USA through New York City in 1999 and spread to the contiguous USA within three years while transitioning from epidemic outbreaks to endemic transmission. The virus is transmitted by vector competent mosquitoes and maintained in the avian populations. WNV spatial distribution is mainly determined by the movement of residential and migratory avian populations. We developed an individual-level heterogeneous network framework across the USA with the goal of understanding the long-range spatial distribution of WNV. To this end, we proposed three distance dispersal kernels model: 1) exponential—short-range dispersal, 2) power-law—long-range dispersal in all directions, and 3) power-law biased by flyway direction —long-range dispersal only along established migratory routes. To select the appropriate dispersal kernel we used the human case data and adopted a model selection framework based on approximate Bayesian computation with sequential Monte Carlo sampling (ABC-SMC). From estimated parameters, we find that the power-law biased by flyway direction kernel is the best kernel to fit WNV human case data, supporting the hypothesis of long-range WNV transmission is mainly along the migratory bird flyways. Through extensive simulation from 2014 to 2016, we proposed and tested hypothetical mitigation strategies and found that mosquito population reduction in the infected states and neighboring states is potentially cost-effective.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/9rfZ0tOoEtc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: Cholinergic system changes of falls and freezing of gait in Parkinson's disease</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25430?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Postural instability and gait difficulties (PIGDs) represent debilitating disturbances in Parkinson's disease (PD). Past acetylcholinesterase positron emission tomography (PET) imaging studies implicate cholinergic changes as significant contributors to PIGD features. These studies were limited in quantification of striatal cholinergic synapse integrity. Vesicular acetylcholine transporter (VAChT) PET ligands are better suited for evaluation of high binding areas. We examined associations between regional VAChT expression and freezing of gait (FoG) and falls.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ninety‐four PD subjects underwent clinical assessment and VAChT ([&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]FEOBV) PET.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thirty‐five subjects (37.2%) reported a history of falls, and 15 (16%) had observed FoG. Univariate volume‐of‐interest analyses demonstrated significantly reduced thalamic (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.0016) VAChT expression in fallers compared to nonfallers. VAChT expression was significantly reduced in the striatum (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.0012) and limbic archicortex (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.004) in freezers compared to nonfreezers. Whole‐brain voxel‐based analyses of FEOBV PET complemented these findings and showed more granular changes associated with falling history, including the right visual thalamus (especially the right lateral geniculate nucleus [LGN]), right caudate nucleus, and bilateral prefrontal regions. Freezers had prominent VAChT expression reductions in the bilateral striatum, temporal, and mesiofrontal limbic regions.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our findings confirm and extend on previous PET findings of thalamic cholinergic deficits associated with falling history and now emphasize right visual thalamus complex changes, including the right LGN. FoG status is associated with reduced VAChT expression in striatal cholinergic interneurons and the limbic archicortex. These observations suggest different cholinergic systems changes underlying falls and FoG in PD. Ann Neurol, 2019&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>RSS PAP: Perceived target range shapes human sound-localization behavior</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0111-18.2019v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;The auditory system relies on binaural differences and spectral pinna cues to localize sounds in azimuth and elevation. However, the acoustic input can be unreliable, due to uncertainty about the environment, and neural noise. A possible strategy to reduce sound-location uncertainty is to integrate the sensory observations with sensorimotor information from previous experience, to infer where sounds are more likely to occur. We investigated whether and how human sound localization performance is affected by the spatial distribution of target sounds, and changes thereof. We tested three different open-loop paradigms, in which we varied the spatial range of sounds in different ways. For the narrowest ranges, target-response gains were highly idiosyncratic and deviated from an optimal gain predicted by error-minimization; in the horizontal plane the deviation typically consisted of a response overshoot. Moreover, participants adjusted their behavior by rapidly adapting their gain to the target range, both in elevation and in azimuth, yielding behavior closer to optimal for larger target ranges. Notably, gain changes occurred without any exogenous feedback about performance. We discuss how the findings can be explained by a sub-optimal model in which the motor-control system reduces its response error across trials to within an acceptable range – rather than strictly minimizing the error.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance statement&lt;/b&gt; Sensory observations can be noisy, leading to uncertainty in perceptual inferences and variable estimation errors. Theoretically, to reduce uncertainty, sensory information could be integrated with knowledge from prior experience, and with feedback about one’s own response behavior. Here we show, that for a basic and accurate sensorimotor task such as sound localization, humans indeed rely on perceived experience in the absence of exogenous feedback, as they rapidly changed their response sensitivity to experimental variations in the spatial distribution of targets. We argue that the auditory system reduces its estimated localization error close to its expected minimum across trials, allowing for idiosyncratic sub-optimal target response gains.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: LDB1 Is Required for the Early Development of the Dorsal Telencephalon and the Thalamus</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/6/1/ENEURO.0356-18.2019?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;LIM domain binding protein 1 (LDB1) is a protein cofactor that participates in several multiprotein complexes with transcription factors that regulate mouse forebrain development. Since &lt;i&gt;Ldb1&lt;/i&gt; null mutants display early embryonic lethality, we used a conditional knockout strategy to examine the role of LDB1 in early forebrain development using multiple Cre lines. Loss of &lt;i&gt;Ldb1&lt;/i&gt; from E8.75 using Foxg1Cre caused a disruption of midline boundary structures in the dorsal telencephalon. While this Cre line gave the expected pattern of recombination of the floxed &lt;i&gt;Ldb1&lt;/i&gt; locus, unexpectedly, standard Cre lines that act from embryonic day (E)10.5 (Emx1Cre) and E11.5 (NesCre) did not show efficient or complete recombination in the dorsal telencephalon by E12.5. Intriguingly, this effect was specific to the &lt;i&gt;Ldb1&lt;/i&gt; floxed allele, since three other lines including floxed Ai9 and mTmG reporters, and a floxed &lt;i&gt;Lhx2&lt;/i&gt; line, each displayed the expected spatial patterns of recombination. Furthermore, the incomplete recombination of the floxed &lt;i&gt;Ldb1&lt;/i&gt; locus using NesCre was limited to the dorsal telencephalon, while the ventral telencephalon and the diencephalon displayed the expected loss of &lt;i&gt;Ldb1&lt;/i&gt;. This permitted us to examine the requirement for LDB1 in the development of the thalamus in a context wherein the cortex continued to express &lt;i&gt;Ldb1&lt;/i&gt;. We report that the somatosensory VB nucleus is profoundly shrunken upon loss of LDB1. Our findings highlight the unusual nature of the &lt;i&gt;Ldb1&lt;/i&gt; locus in terms of recombination efficiency, and also report a novel role for LDB1 during the development of the thalamus.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Long-Term, Targeted Delivery of GDNF from Encapsulated Cells Is Neuroprotective and Reduces Seizures in the Pilocarpine Model of Epilepsy</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/11/2144?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Neurotrophic factors are candidates for treating epilepsy, but their development has been hampered by difficulties in achieving stable and targeted delivery of efficacious concentrations within the desired brain region. We have developed an encapsulated cell technology that overcomes these obstacles by providing a targeted, continuous, &lt;i&gt;de novo&lt;/i&gt; synthesized source of high levels of neurotrophic molecules from human clonal ARPE-19 cells encapsulated into hollow fiber membranes. Here we illustrate the potential of this approach for delivering glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) directly to the hippocampus of epileptic rats. &lt;i&gt;In vivo&lt;/i&gt; studies demonstrated that bilateral intrahippocampal implants continued to secrete GDNF that produced high hippocampal GDNF tissue levels in a long-term manner. Identical implants robustly reduced seizure frequency in the pilocarpine model. Seizures were reduced rapidly, and this effect increased in magnitude over 3 months, ultimately leading to a reduction of seizures by 93%. This effect persisted even after device removal, suggesting potential disease-modifying benefits. Importantly, seizure reduction was associated with normalized changes in anxiety and improved cognitive performance. Immunohistochemical analyses revealed that the neurological benefits of GDNF were associated with the normalization of anatomical alterations accompanying chronic epilepsy, including hippocampal atrophy, cell degeneration, loss of parvalbumin-positive interneurons, and abnormal neurogenesis. These effects were associated with the activation of GDNF receptors. All in all, these results support the concept that the implantation of encapsulated GDNF-secreting cells can deliver GDNF in a sustained, targeted, and efficacious manner, paving the way for continuing preclinical evaluation and eventual clinical translation of this approach for epilepsy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Epilepsy is one of the most common neurological conditions, affecting millions of individuals of all ages. These patients experience debilitating seizures that frequently increase over time and can associate with significant cognitive decline and psychiatric disorders that are generally poorly controlled by pharmacotherapy. We have developed a clinically validated, implantable cell encapsulation system that delivers high and consistent levels of GDNF directly to the brain. In epileptic animals, this system produced a progressive and permanent reduction (&amp;gt;90%) in seizure frequency. These benefits were accompanied by improvements in cognitive and anxiolytic behavior and the normalization of changes in CNS anatomy that underlie chronic epilepsy. Together, these data suggest a novel means of tackling the frequently intractable neurological consequences of this devastating disorder.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: MicroRNA-1224 Splicing CircularRNA-Filip1l in an Ago2-Dependent Manner Regulates Chronic Inflammatory Pain via Targeting Ubr5</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/11/2125?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Dysfunctions of gene transcription and translation in the nociceptive pathways play the critical role in development and maintenance of chronic pain. Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are emerging as new players in regulation of gene expression, but whether and how circRNAs are involved in chronic pain remain elusive. We showed here that complete Freund's adjuvant-induced chronic inflammation pain significantly increased circRNA-Filip1l (filamin A interacting protein 1-like) expression in spinal neurons of mice. Blockage of this increase attenuated complete Freund's adjuvant-induced nociceptive behaviors, and overexpression of spinal circRNA-Filip1l in naive mice mimicked the nociceptive behaviors as evidenced by decreased thermal and mechanical nociceptive threshold. Furthermore, we found that mature circRNA-Filip1l expression was negatively regulated by miRNA-1224 via binding and splicing of precursor of circRNA-Filip1l (pre-circRNA-Filip1l) in the Argonaute-2 (&lt;i&gt;Ago2&lt;/i&gt;)-dependent manner. Increase of spinal circRNA-Filip1l expression resulted from the decrease of miRNA-1224 expression under chronic inflammation pain state. miRNA-1224 knockdown or &lt;i&gt;Ago2&lt;/i&gt; overexpression induced nociceptive behaviors in naive mice, which was prevented by the knockdown of spinal circRNA-Filip1l. Finally, we demonstrated that a ubiquitin protein ligase E3 component &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;-recognin 5 (&lt;i&gt;Ubr5&lt;/i&gt;), validated as a target of circRNA-Filip1l, plays a pivotal role in regulation of nociception by spinal circRNA-Filip1l. These data suggest that miRNA-1224-mediated and Ago2-dependent modulation of spinal circRNA-Filip1l expression regulates nociception via targeting &lt;i&gt;Ubr5&lt;/i&gt;, revealing a novel epigenetic mechanism of interaction between miRNA and circRNA in chronic inflammation pain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; circRNAs are emerging as new players in regulation of gene expression. Here, we found that the increase of circRNA-Filip1l mediated by miRNA-1224 in an Ago2-dependent way in the spinal cord is involved in regulation of nociception via targeting &lt;i&gt;Ubr5&lt;/i&gt;. Our study reveals a novel epigenetic mechanism of interaction between miRNA and circRNA in chronic inflammation pain.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

In response to altered neuronal energy state, mitochondria adapt to enable energy homeostasis and nervous system function. This adaptation, also called mitochondrial plasticity, can be observed as alterations in the form, function and position. The primary site of energy consumption in neurons is localized at the synapse, where mitochondria are critical for both pre- and postsynaptic functions. In this review, we will discuss molecular mechanisms regulating mitochondrial plasticity at the synapse and how they contribute to information processing within neurons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: Shared polygenic risk and causal inferences in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis</title>

	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To identify shared polygenic risk and causal associations in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Linkage disequilibrium score regression and Mendelian randomization were applied in a large‐scale, data‐driven manner to explore genetic correlations and causal relationships between &amp;gt;700 phenotypic traits and ALS. Exposures consisted of publicly available genome‐wide association studies (GWASes) summary statistics from &lt;i&gt;MR Base&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;LD‐hub&lt;/i&gt;. The outcome data came from the recently published ALS GWAS involving 20,806 cases and 59,804 controls. Multivariate analyses, genetic risk profiling, and Bayesian colocalization analyses were also performed.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have shown, by linkage disequilibrium score regression, that ALS shares polygenic risk genetic factors with a number of traits and conditions, including positive correlations with smoking status and moderate levels of physical activity, and negative correlations with higher cognitive performance, higher educational attainment, and light levels of physical activity. Using Mendelian randomization, we found evidence that hyperlipidemia is a causal risk factor for ALS and localized putative functional signals within loci of interest.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, we have developed a public resource (&lt;a href=&quot;https://lng-nia.shinyapps.io/mrshiny&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Link to external resource&quot;&gt;https://lng-nia.shinyapps.io/mrshiny&lt;/a&gt;) which we hope will become a valuable tool for the ALS community, and that will be expanded and updated as new data become available. Shared polygenic risk exists between ALS and educational attainment, physical activity, smoking, and tenseness/restlessness. We also found evidence that elevated low‐desnity lipoprotein cholesterol is a causal risk factor for ALS. Future randomized controlled trials should be considered as a proof of causality.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In this study, we examined the potential causal effect of smoking on amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) using the Project MinE data involving 12,577 patients with ALS and 23,475 controls in a Mendelian randomization (MR) framework. The MR approach has the potential to investigate a causal relationship between a risk factor and a disease, avoiding confounding and information bias that often present in conventional epidemiological studies. We found that smokers had a higher risk of ALS compared to never smokers. Our study thus provides evidence for a causal relationship between smoking and ALS.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Emergence of Brain Rhythms: Model Interpretation of EEG Data. (arXiv:1903.04576v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1903.04576</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Electroencephalography (EEG) monitors ---by either intrusive or noninvasive
electrodes--- time and frequency variations and spectral content of voltage
fluctuations or waves, known as brain rhythms, which in some way uncover
activity during both rest periods and specific events in which the subject is
under stimulus. This is a useful tool to explore brain behavior, as it
complements imaging techniques that have a poorer temporal resolution. We here
approach the understanding of EEG data from first principles by studying a
networked model of excitatory and inhibitory neurons which generates a variety
of comparable waves. In fact, we thus reproduce $\alpha$, $\beta,$ $\gamma$ and
other rhythms as observed by EEG, and identify the details of the respectively
involved complex phenomena, including a precise relationship between an input
and the collective response to it. It ensues the potentiality of our model to
better understand actual mind mechanisms and its possible disorders, and we
also describe kind of stochastic resonance phenomena which locate main
qualitative changes of mental behavior in (e.g.) humans. We also discuss the
plausible use of these findings to design deep learning algorithms to detect
the occurence of phase transitions in the brain and to analyse its
consequences.

	<link>https://www.cell.com/trends/neurosciences/fulltext/S0166-2236(19)30019-0?rss=yes</link>
	<content:encoded>To understand subjective evaluation of an option, various disciplines have quantified the interaction between reward and effort during decision making, producing an estimate of economic utility, namely the subjective ‘goodness’ of an option. However, variables that affect utility of an option also influence the vigor of movements toward that option. For example, expectation of reward increases speed of saccadic eye movements, whereas expectation of effort decreases this speed. These results imply that vigor may serve as a new, real-time metric with which to quantify subjective utility, and that the control of movements may be an implicit reflection of the brain’s economic evaluation of the expected outcome.</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Synaptic plasticity onto inhibitory neurons as a mechanism for ocular dominance plasticity</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/2HjERBCZGPc/article</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Jacopo Bono, Claudia Clopath&lt;/p&gt;

Ocular dominance plasticity is a well-documented phenomenon allowing us to study properties of cortical maturation. Understanding this maturation might be an important step towards unravelling how cortical circuits function. However, it is still not fully understood which mechanisms are responsible for the opening and closing of the critical period for ocular dominance and how changes in cortical responsiveness arise after visual deprivation. In this article, we present a theory of ocular dominance plasticity. Following recent experimental work, we propose a framework where a reduction in inhibition is necessary for ocular dominance plasticity in both juvenile and adult animals. In this framework, two ingredients are crucial to observe ocular dominance shifts: a sufficient level of inhibition as well as excitatory-to-inhibitory synaptic plasticity. In our model, the former is responsible for the opening of the critical period, while the latter limits the plasticity in adult animals. Finally, we also provide a possible explanation for the variability in ocular dominance shifts observed in individual neurons and for the counter-intuitive shifts towards the closed eye.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/2HjERBCZGPc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Evaluating the future consequences of actions is achievable by simulating a mental search tree into the future. Expanding deep trees, however, is computationally taxing. Therefore, machines and humans use a plan-until-habit scheme that simulates the environment up to a limited depth and then exploits habitual values as proxies for consequences that may arise in the future. Two outstanding questions in this scheme are “in which directions the search tree should be expanded?”, and “when should the expansion stop?”. Here we propose a principled solution to these questions based on a speed/accuracy tradeoff: deeper expansion in the appropriate directions leads to more accurate planning, but at the cost of slower decision-making. Our simulation results show how this algorithm expands the search tree effectively and efficiently in a grid-world environment. We further show that our algorithm can explain several behavioral patterns in animals and humans, namely the effect of time-pressure on the depth of planning, the effect of reward magnitudes on the direction of planning, and the gradual shift from goal-directed to habitual behavior over the course of training. The algorithm also provides several predictions testable in animal/human experiments.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/CETQ5A5g_oA&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Spike burst-pause dynamics of Purkinje cells regulate sensorimotor adaptation</title>

Cerebellar Purkinje cells mediate accurate eye movement coordination. However, it remains unclear how oculomotor adaptation depends on the interplay between the characteristic Purkinje cell response patterns, namely tonic, bursting, and spike pauses. Here, a spiking cerebellar model assesses the role of Purkinje cell firing patterns in vestibular ocular reflex (VOR) adaptation. The model captures the cerebellar microcircuit properties and it incorporates spike-based synaptic plasticity at multiple cerebellar sites. A detailed Purkinje cell model reproduces the three spike-firing patterns that are shown to regulate the cerebellar output. Our results suggest that pauses following Purkinje complex spikes (bursts) encode transient disinhibition of targeted medial vestibular nuclei, critically gating the vestibular signals conveyed by mossy fibres. This gating mechanism accounts for early and coarse VOR acquisition, prior to the late reflex consolidation. In addition, properly timed and sized Purkinje cell bursts allow the ratio between long-term depression and potentiation (LTD/LTP) to be finely shaped at mossy fibre-medial vestibular nuclei synapses, which optimises VOR consolidation. Tonic Purkinje cell firing maintains the consolidated VOR through time. Importantly, pauses are crucial to facilitate VOR phase-reversal learning, by reshaping previously learnt synaptic weight distributions. Altogether, these results predict that Purkinje spike burst-pause dynamics are instrumental to VOR learning and reversal adaptation.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/yPKm5tnZcuc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Different Inhibitory Interneuron Cell Classes Make Distinct Contributions to Visual Contrast Perception</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/6/1/ENEURO.0337-18.2019?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;While recent work has revealed how different inhibitory interneurons influence responses of cortical neurons to sensory stimuli, little is known about their distinct contributions to sensory perception. Here, we optogenetically activated different genetically defined interneurons [parvalbumin (PV), somatostatin (SST), vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP)] in visual cortex (V1) of mice working at threshold in a contrast increment detection task. The visual stimulus was paired with optogenetic stimulation to assess how enhancing V1 inhibitory neuron activity during visual processing altered task performance. PV or SST activation impaired, while VIP stimulation improved, contrast increment detection. The impairment produced by PV or SST activation persisted over several weeks of testing. In contrast, mice learned to reliably detect VIP activation in the absence of any natural visual stimulus. Thus, different inhibitory signals make distinct contributions to visual contrast perception.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: The Thalamus Regulates Retinoic Acid Signaling and Development of Parvalbumin Interneurons in Postnatal Mouse Prefrontal Cortex</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/6/1/ENEURO.0018-19.2019?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;GABAergic inhibitory neurons in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) play crucial roles in higher cognitive functions. Despite the link between aberrant development of PFC interneurons and a number of psychiatric disorders, mechanisms underlying the development of these neurons are poorly understood. Here we show that the retinoic acid (RA)-degrading enzyme CYP26B1 (cytochrome P450 family 26, subfamily B, member 1) is transiently expressed in the mouse frontal cortex during postnatal development, and that medial ganglionic eminence (MGE)-derived interneurons, particularly in parvalbumin (PV)-expressing neurons, are the main cell type that has active RA signaling during this period. We found that frontal cortex-specific &lt;i&gt;Cyp26b1&lt;/i&gt; knock-out mice had an increased density of PV-expressing, but not somatostatin-expressing, interneurons in medial PFC, indicating a novel role of RA signaling in controlling PV neuron development. The initiation of &lt;i&gt;Cyp26b1&lt;/i&gt; expression in neonatal PFC coincides with the establishment of connections between the thalamus and the PFC. We found that these connections are required for the postnatal expression of &lt;i&gt;Cyp26b1&lt;/i&gt; in medial PFC. In addition to this region-specific role in postnatal PFC that regulates RA signaling and PV neuron development, the thalamocortical connectivity had an earlier role in controlling radial dispersion of MGE-derived interneurons throughout embryonic neocortex. In summary, our results suggest that the thalamus plays multiple, temporally separate roles in interneuron development in the PFC.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: Gene therapy improves brain white matter in aromatic l‐amino acid decarboxylase deficiency</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25467?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Children with aromatic &lt;span class=&quot;smallCaps&quot;&gt;l&lt;/span&gt;‐amino acid decarboxylase (AADC) deficiency suffer from severe motor dysfunction. Restoration of dopamine levels in the putamen by gene therapy has led to significant improvement in motor function. This study explored brain structure changes in patients.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brain diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) were performed before and 12 months after gene therapy. Whole‐brain tract‐specific analysis was performed to assess white matter microstructural integrity.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the eight patients (1.67 to 8.42 years of age) enrolled in the study, gene therapy did not affect macroscopic structure. DTI prior to gene therapy revealed lower total mean fractional anisotropy (FA) values in the patients than in the age‐matched pretreatment controls (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.017, median difference = −0.0136, 95% confidence interval [CI] [−0.0319, −0.0126]). After gene therapy, total mean FA increased (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.012, median difference = 0.0211, 95% CI [0.0094, 0.0456]) and the values in the patients were not different from the age‐matched posttreatment controls. The increase in total mean FA after gene therapy in the patients was correlated with their increase in motor score (R = 0.846; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.008), but was inversely correlated with their ages at the time of gene therapy (R = −0.754; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.031). The corticospinal tracts, and the thalamic radiation and callosal fibers involving motor function, improved after gene therapy.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Improvement in the microstructural integrity of white matter tracts is associated with the improvement in motor function following gene therapy.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: Association between Perihematomal Cerebral Blood Volume and Intracerebral Hemorrhage Expansion: a CT Perfusion Study</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25466?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We investigated whether CT perfusion can identify intracerebral hemorrhage patients at high risk of hematoma growth (HG). A total of 155 subjects underwent CT perfusion on admission. Variables associated with log‐transformed absolute HG were explored with multivariable linear regression. Perihematomal cerebral blood volume (CBV) was inversely associated with HG (B=‐0.20,p&amp;lt;0.001), independently from blood pressure, ICH volume and other confounders. This association was not dose‐dependent and only very low CBV (&amp;lt;1.4 mL/100g) was significantly associated with HG (B=0.25,p&amp;lt;0.001).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, reduced perihematomal CBV is associated with HG, suggesting a potential role of the perihematomal region in the pathophysiology of hematoma enlargement.&lt;/p&gt;

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1903.04476</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;We introduce Continual Learning via Neural Pruning (CLNP), a new method aimed
at lifelong learning in fixed capacity models based on neuronal model
sparsification. In this method, subsequent tasks are trained using the inactive
neurons and filters of the sparsified network and cause zero deterioration to
the performance of previous tasks. In order to deal with the possible
compromise between model sparsity and performance, we formalize and incorporate
the concept of graceful forgetting: the idea that it is preferable to suffer a
small amount of forgetting in a controlled manner if it helps regain network
capacity and prevents uncontrolled loss of performance during the training of
future tasks. CLNP also provides simple continual learning diagnostic tools in
terms of the number of free neurons left for the training of future tasks as
well as the number of neurons that are being reused. In particular, we see in
experiments that CLNP verifies and automatically takes advantage of the fact
that the features of earlier layers are more transferable. We show empirically
that CLNP leads to significantly improved results over current weight
elasticity based methods.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Labeler-hot Detection of EEG Epileptic Transients. (arXiv:1903.04337v1 [cs.LG])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1903.04337</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Preventing early progression of epilepsy and so the severity of seizures
requires effective diagnosis. Epileptic transients indicate the ability to
develop seizures but humans easily overlook such brief events in an
electroencephalogram (EEG) what compromises patient treatment. Traditionally,
training of the EEG event detection algorithms has relied on ground truth
labels, obtained from the consensus of the majority of labelers. In this work,
we go beyond labeler consensus on EEG data. Our event descriptor integrates EEG
signal features with one-hot encoded labeler category that is a key to improved
generalization performance. Notably, boosted decision trees take advantage of
singly-labeled but more varied training sets. Our quantitative experiments show
the proposed labeler-hot epileptic event detector consistently outperforms a
consensus-trained detector and maintains confidence bounds of the detection.
The results on our infant EEG recordings suggest datasets can gain higher event
variety faster and thus better performance by shifting available human effort
from consensus-oriented to separate labeling when labels include both, the
event and the labeler category.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Despite a rise in the use of &quot;learning by doing&quot; pedagogical methods in
praxis, little is known as to why these methods may improve learning outcomes.
This is surprising given that an increased mechanistic knowledge of learning by
doing-based improvements has the potential to speed up the development of
evidence-based teaching practices. Here we use neuroscience methods and a
gesture-enriched foreign language (L2) vocabulary learning paradigm to
adjudicate between opposing predictions of two neuroscientific learning
theories. We demonstrate that sensory brain regions associated with the
processing of gesture-related stimulus information causally contribute to
performance benefits following gesture-enriched L2 vocabulary learning. Sensory
brain responses benefitted both short- and long-term learning outcomes, as well
as the learning of both concrete and abstract words. These findings suggest
that responses within specialized visual sensory cortices precipitate
sensorimotor-based learning benefits. Such a mechanism could play a role in
comparatively effortless native language learning and may be key for
accelerating L2 proficiency in adults.

Understanding the principles by which agents interact with both complex environments and each other is a key goal of decision neuroscience. However, most previous studies have used experimental paradigms in which choices are discrete (and few), play is static, and optimal solutions are known. Yet in natural environments, interactions between agents typically involve continuous action spaces, ongoing dynamics, and no known optimal solution. Here, we seek to bridge this divide by using a “penalty shot” task in which pairs of monkeys competed against each other in a competitive, real-time video game. We modeled monkeys’ strategies as driven by stochastically evolving goals, onscreen positions that served as set points for a control model that produced observed joystick movements. We fit this goal-based dynamical system model using approximate Bayesian inference methods, using neural networks to parameterize players’ goals as a dynamic mixture of Gaussian components. Our model is conceptually simple, constructed of interpretable components, and capable of generating synthetic data that capture the complexity of real player dynamics. We further characterized players’ strategies using the number of change points on each trial. We found that this complexity varied more across sessions than within sessions, and that more complex strategies benefited offensive players but not defensive players. Together, our experimental paradigm and model offer a powerful combination of tools for the study of realistic social dynamics in the laboratory setting.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/8EQny46_S5o&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Growth rate is a near-universal selective pressure across microbial species. High growth rates require hundreds of metabolic enzymes, each with different nonlinear kinetics, to be precisely tuned within the bounds set by physicochemical constraints. Yet, the metabolic behaviour of many species is characterized by simple relations between growth rate, enzyme expression levels and metabolic rates. We asked if this simplicity could be the outcome of optimisation by evolution. Indeed, when the growth rate is maximized—in a static environment under mass-conservation and enzyme expression constraints—we prove mathematically that the resulting optimal metabolic flux distribution is described by a limited number of subnetworks, known as Elementary Flux Modes (EFMs). We show that, because EFMs are the minimal subnetworks leading to growth, a small active number automatically leads to the simple relations that are measured. We find that the maximal number of flux-carrying EFMs is determined only by the number of imposed constraints on enzyme expression, not by the size, kinetics or topology of the network. This minimal-EFM extremum principle is illustrated in a graphical framework, which explains qualitative changes in microbial behaviours, such as overflow metabolism and co-consumption, and provides a method for identification of the enzyme expression constraints that limit growth under the prevalent conditions. The extremum principle applies to all microorganisms that are selected for maximal growth rates under protein concentration constraints, for example the solvent capacities of cytosol, membrane or periplasmic space.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/DEY-lhs5fHw&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Manipulating the dynamics of neural systems through targeted stimulation is a frontier of research and clinical neuroscience; however, the control schemes considered for neural systems are mismatched for the unique needs of manipulating neural dynamics. An appropriate control method should respect the variability in neural systems, incorporating moment to moment “input” to the neural dynamics and behaving based on the current neural state, irrespective of the past trajectory. We propose such a controller under a nonlinear state-space feedback framework that steers one dynamical system to function as through it were another dynamical system entirely. This “myopic” controller is formulated through a novel variant of a model reference control cost that manipulates dynamics in a short-sighted manner that only sets a target trajectory of a single time step into the future (hence its myopic nature), which omits the need to pre-calculate a rigid and computationally costly neural feedback control solution. To demonstrate the breadth of this control’s utility, two examples with distinctly different applications in neuroscience are studied. First, we show the myopic control’s utility to probe the causal link between dynamics and behavior for cognitive processes by transforming a winner-take-all decision-making system to operate as a robust neural integrator of evidence. Second, an unhealthy motor-like system containing an unwanted beta-oscillation spiral attractor is controlled to function as a healthy motor system, a relevant clinical example for neurological disorders.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/6oinXWRforY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Drug resistance in breast cancer cell populations has been shown to arise through phenotypic transition of cancer cells to a drug-tolerant state, for example through epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition or transition to a cancer stem cell state. However, many breast tumors are a heterogeneous mixture of cell types with numerous epigenetic states in addition to stem-like and mesenchymal phenotypes, and the dynamic behavior of this heterogeneous mixture in response to drug treatment is not well-understood. Recently, we showed that plasticity between differentiation states, as identified with intracellular markers such as cytokeratins, is linked to resistance to specific targeted therapeutics. Understanding the dynamics of differentiation-state transitions in this context could facilitate the development of more effective treatments for cancers that exhibit phenotypic heterogeneity and plasticity. In this work, we develop computational models of a drug-treated, phenotypically heterogeneous triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cell line to elucidate the feasibility of differentiation-state transition as a mechanism for therapeutic escape in this tumor subtype. Specifically, we use modeling to predict the changes in differentiation-state transitions that underlie specific therapy-induced changes in differentiation-state marker expression that we recently observed in the HCC1143 cell line. We report several statistically significant therapy-induced changes in transition rates between basal, luminal, mesenchymal, and non-basal/non-luminal/non-mesenchymal differentiation states in HCC1143 cell populations. Moreover, we validate model predictions on cell division and cell death empirically, and we test our models on an independent data set. Overall, we demonstrate that changes in differentiation-state transition rates induced by targeted therapy can provoke distinct differentiation-state aggregations of drug-resistant cells, which may be fundamental to the design of improved therapeutic regimens for cancers with phenotypic heterogeneity.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/DT3PsYmnYd0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Centrosome amplification (CA) is a common feature of human tumours and a promising target for cancer therapy. However, CA’s pan-cancer prevalence, molecular role in tumourigenesis and therapeutic value in the clinical setting are still largely unexplored. Here, we used a transcriptomic signature (CA20) to characterise the landscape of CA-associated gene expression in 9,721 tumours from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). CA20 is upregulated in cancer and associated with distinct clinical and molecular features of breast cancer, consistently with our experimental CA quantification in patient samples. Moreover, we show that CA20 upregulation is positively associated with genomic instability, alteration of specific chromosomal arms and C&amp;gt;T mutations, and we propose novel molecular players associated with CA in cancer. Finally, high CA20 is associated with poor prognosis and, by integrating drug sensitivity with drug perturbation profiles in cell lines, we identify candidate compounds for selectively targeting cancer cells exhibiting transcriptomic evidence for CA.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/-C_Yq4jH6sA&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Disease‐associated proteins are thought to propagate along neuronal processes in neurodegenerative diseases. To detect disease‐associated prion protein (PrP&lt;sup&gt;Sc&lt;/sup&gt;) in the vagus nerve in different forms and molecular subtypes of Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease (CJD), we applied 3 different anti‐PrP antibodies. We screened the vagus nerve in 162 sporadic and 30 genetic CJD cases. Four of 31 VV‐2 type sporadic CJD and 7 of 30 genetic CJD cases showed vagal PrP&lt;sup&gt;Sc&lt;/sup&gt; immunodeposits with distinct morphology. Thus, PrP&lt;sup&gt;Sc&lt;/sup&gt; in CJD affects the vagus nerve analogously to α‐synuclein in Parkinson disease.

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: Homocysteine and small vessel stroke: A mendelian randomization analysis</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25440?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trials of B vitamin therapy to lower blood total homocysteine (tHcy) levels for prevention of stroke are inconclusive. Secondary analyses of trial data and epidemiological studies suggest that tHcy levels may be particularly associated with small vessel stroke (SVS). We assessed whether circulating tHcy and B vitamin levels are selectively associated with SVS, but not other stroke subtypes, using Mendelian randomization.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We used summary statistics data for single‐nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with tHcy (n = 18), folate (n = 3), vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; (n = 1), and vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; (n = 14) levels, and the corresponding data for stroke from the MEGASTROKE consortium (n = 16,952 subtyped ischemic stroke cases and 404,630 noncases).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Genetically predicted tHcy was associated with SVS, with an odds ratio of 1.34 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.13–1.58; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 6.7 × 10&lt;sup&gt;–4&lt;/sup&gt;) per 1 standard deviation (SD) increase in genetically predicted tHcy levels, but was not associated with large artery or cardioembolic stroke. The association was mainly driven by SNPs at or near the &lt;i&gt;MTHFR&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;MUT&lt;/i&gt; genes. The odds ratios of SVS per 1 SD increase in genetically predicted folate and vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; levels were 0.49 (95% CI, 0.34–0.71; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 1.3 × 10&lt;sup&gt;–4&lt;/sup&gt;) and 0.70 (95% CI, 0.52–0.94; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.02), respectively. Genetically higher vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; levels were not associated with any stroke subtype.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These findings suggest that any effect of homocysteine‐lowering treatment in preventing stroke will be confined to the SVS subtype. Whether genetic variants at or near the &lt;i&gt;MTHFR&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;MUT&lt;/i&gt; genes influence SVS risk through pathways other than homocysteine levels and downstream effects require further investigation.

	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Degenerative cerebellar ataxias (DCAs) affect up to 1 in 5,000 people worldwide, leading to incoordination, tremor, and falls. Loss of Purkinje cells, nearly universal across DCAs, dysregulates the dentatothalamocortical network. To address the paucity of treatment strategies, we developed an electrical stimulation‐based therapy for DCAs targeting the dorsal dentate nucleus.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We tested this therapeutic strategy in the Wistar Furth &lt;i&gt;shaker&lt;/i&gt; rat model of Purkinje cell loss resulting in tremor and ataxia. We implanted &lt;i&gt;shaker&lt;/i&gt; rats with stimulating electrodes targeted to the dorsal dentate nucleus and tested a spectrum of frequencies ranging from 4 to 180 Hz.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stimulation at 30 Hz most effectively reduced motor symptoms. Stimulation frequencies over 100 Hz, commonly used for Parkinsonism and essential tremor, worsened incoordination, while frequencies within the tremor physiologic range may worsen tremor.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretations&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Low‐frequency deep cerebellar stimulation may provide a novel strategy for treating motor symptoms of degenerative cerebellar ataxias.&lt;/p&gt;

While much effort has been devoted to understanding the capacity and role for local protein synthesis in dendrites and spines, local mRNA translation in mature axons, projecting over distances up to a meter, has received much less attention. Also, little is known about the spatio-temporal dynamics of axonal and dendritic gene expression as function of mRNA abundance, protein synthesis and degradation. Here, we summarize key recent findings that have shaped our knowledge of the precise location of local protein production and discuss unique strategies used by neurons to shape presynaptic and postsynaptic proteomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded>

Both proteins play critical roles during the development of the nervous system and may also regulate stimuli-driven transcription and plasticity in postmitotic neurons. The multiplicity of functions, substrates, and molecular partners, together with the redundancy and singularity of the two KAT3 paralogs, define a complex cat’s cradle of relationships.

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: Divergent Patterns of TDP‐43 and Tau Pathologies in Primary Progressive Aphasia</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25465?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To measure &lt;i&gt;postmortem&lt;/i&gt; burden of frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) with TDP‐43 (FTLD‐TDP) or tau (FTLD‐Tau) proteinopathy across hemispheres in primary progressive aphasia (PPA) using digital histopathology, and identify clinicopathological correlates of these distinct proteinopathies.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an autopsy cohort of PPA (FTLD‐TDP=13, FTLD‐Tau=14), we analyzed laterality and regional distribution of &lt;i&gt;postmortem&lt;/i&gt; pathology, quantified using a validated digital histopathological approach, in available brain tissue from up to eight cortical regions bilaterally. We related digital pathology to &lt;i&gt;antemortem&lt;/i&gt; structural neuroimaging and specific clinical language features.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Postmortem&lt;/i&gt; cortical pathology was left‐lateralized in both FTLD‐TDP (beta=‐0.15,SE=0.05,p=0.007) and FTLD‐Tau (beta=‐0.09,SE=0.04,p=0.015), but the degree of lateralization decreased with greater overall dementia severity before death (beta=‐8.18,SE=3.22,p=0.015). Among five core pathology regions sampled, we found greatest pathology in left orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) in FTLD‐TDP, which was greater than in FTLD‐Tau (F=47.07,df=1,17,p&amp;lt;0.001), and in left mid‐frontal cortex (MFC) in FTLD‐Tau, which was greater than in FTLD‐TDP (F=19.34,df=1,16,p&amp;lt;0.001). &lt;i&gt;Postmortem&lt;/i&gt; pathology was inversely associated with &lt;i&gt;antemortem&lt;/i&gt; MRI cortical thickness (beta=‐0.04,SE=0.01,p=0.007) in regions matching autopsy sampling. Irrespective of PPA syndromic variant, single‐word comprehension impairment was associated with greater left OFC pathology (t=‐3.72,df=10.72,p=0.004), while nonfluent speech with greater left MFC pathology (t=‐3.62,df=12.00,p=0.004) among the five core pathology regions.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In PPA, FTLD‐TDP and FTLD‐Tau have divergent anatomic distributions of left‐lateralized &lt;i&gt;postmortem&lt;/i&gt; pathology that relate to &lt;i&gt;antemortem&lt;/i&gt; structural imaging and distinct language deficits. While other brain regions may be implicated in neural networks supporting these complex language measures, our observations may eventually help to improve &lt;i&gt;antemortem&lt;/i&gt; diagnosis of neuropathology in PPA.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>eNeuro current issue: A Neuron-Optimized CRISPR/dCas9 Activation System for Robust and Specific Gene Regulation</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/6/1/ENEURO.0495-18.2019?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;CRISPR-based technology has provided new avenues to interrogate gene function, but difficulties in transgene expression in post-mitotic neurons has delayed incorporation of these tools in the central nervous system (CNS). Here, we demonstrate a highly efficient, neuron-optimized dual lentiviral CRISPR-based transcriptional activation (CRISPRa) system capable of robust, modular, and tunable gene induction and multiplexed gene regulation across several primary rodent neuron culture systems. CRISPRa targeting unique promoters in the complex multi-transcript gene brain-derived neurotrophic factor (&lt;i&gt;Bdnf&lt;/i&gt;) revealed both transcript- and genome-level selectivity of this approach, in addition to highlighting downstream transcriptional and physiological consequences of &lt;i&gt;Bdnf&lt;/i&gt; regulation. Finally, we illustrate that CRISPRa is highly efficient &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;, resulting in increased protein levels of a target gene in diverse brain structures. Taken together, these results demonstrate that CRISPRa is an efficient and selective method to study gene expression programs in brain health and disease.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>RSS PAP: Selectively inhibiting the median preoptic nucleus attenuates angiotensin II and hyperosmotic-induced drinking behavior and vasopressin release in adult male rats</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0473-18.2019v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;The median preoptic nucleus (MnPO) is a putative integrative region that contributes to body fluid balance. Activation of the MnPO can influence thirst but it is not clear how these responses are linked to body fluid homeostasis. We used Designer Receptors Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs (DREADDs) to determine the role of the MnPO in drinking behavior and vasopressin release in response to peripheral angiotensin II (ANG II) or 3% hypertonic saline in adult male Sprague-Dawley rats (250-300g). Rats were anesthetized with isoflurane and stereotaxically injected with an inhibitory DREADD (rAAV5-CaMKIIa-hM4D(G&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;)-mCherry) or control (rAAV5-CaMKIIa-mCherry) virus in the MnPO. After 2 weeks’ recovery, a subset of rats were used for extracellular recordings to verify functional effects of ANG II or hyperosmotic challenges in MnPO slice preparations. Remaining rats were used in drinking behavior studies. Each rat was administered either 10mg/kg of exogenous clozapine-N-oxide (CNO) to inhibit DREADD-expressing cells or vehicle ip followed by a test treatment with either 2mg/kg ANG II or 3% hypertonic saline (1mL/100g bw) sc, twice per week for two separate treatment weeks. CNO-induced inhibition during either test treatment significantly attenuated drinking responses compared to vehicle treatments and controls. Brain tissue processed for cFos immunohistochemistry showed decreased expression with CNO-induced inhibition during either test treatment in the MnPO and downstream nuclei compared to controls. CNO-mediated inhibition significantly attenuated treatment-induced increases in plasma vasopressin compared to controls. The results indicate inhibition of CaMKIIa-expressing MnPO neurons significantly reduces drinking and vasopressin release in response to ANG II or hyperosmotic challenge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; The MnPO is an important regulatory center that influences thirst, cardiovascular and neuroendocrine function. Activation of different MnPO neuronal populations can inhibit or stimulate water intake. However, the role of the MnPO and its pathway-specific projections during ANG II and hyperosmotic challenges still have not yet been fully elucidated. These studies directly address this by using DREADDs to acutely and selectively inhibit pathway-specific MnPO neurons, and uses techniques that measure changes at the protein, neuronal, and overall physiological and behavioral level. More importantly, we have been able to demonstrate that physiological challenges related to extracellular (ANG II) or cellular (hypertonic saline) dehydration activate MnPO neurons that may project to different parts of the hypothalamus.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>RSS PAP: FGF-23-deficiency impairs hippocampal-dependent cognitive function</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0469-18.2019v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Fibroblast growth factor receptor and α-Klotho transduce fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF-23) signaling in renal tubules to maintain systemic phosphate/Vitamin D homeostasis. Mice deficient for either the ligand, FGF-23, or the co-receptor, Klotho, are phenocopies with both showing rapid and premature development of multiple aging-like abnormalities. Such similarity in phenotype, suggests that FGF-23 and Klotho have co-dependent systemic functions. Recent reports revealed inverse central nervous system effects of Klotho deficiency or Klotho overexpression on hippocampal synaptic, neurogenic, and cognitive functions. However, it is unknown whether FGF-23 deficiency effects function of the hippocampus. We report that, similar to Klotho-deficient mice, FGF-23-deficient mice develop dose-dependent, hippocampal-dependent cognitive impairment. However, FGF-23-deficient brains had no gross structural or developmental defects, no change in hippocampal synaptic plasticity, and only minor impairment to postnatal hippocampal neurogenesis. Together these data provide evidence that FGF-23 deficiency impairs hippocampal-dependent cognition but otherwise results in a brain phenotype that is distinct from the KL-deficient mouse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Although FGF-23 is reportedly expressed by the brain, it has no known brain function. In the periphery, kidney transduction of FGF-23 signaling is required for proper phosphate, calcium and Vitamin D homeostasis. Recent reports show that Klotho, the obligate FGF-23 co-receptor, is required for multiple hippocampal activities. If Klotho-deficient brain effects are the result of disrupted FGF-23 signaling, similar phenotypes may occur under conditions of FGF-23 deficiency. Herein, studies were undertaken to determine whether FGF-23-deficient mice show impairment of the same hippocampal functions, as a first step toward investigating whether FGF-23 is the mechanism by which Klotho effects brain function. Our data show that FGF-23 is only required for normal hippocampal-dependent cognition suggesting that FGF-23 may effect the brain uniquely.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>RSS PAP: Phase Coherent Currents underlying neocortical seizure-like state transitions</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0426-18.2019v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;In the epileptic brain, phase amplitude cross frequency coupling (CFC) features have been used to objectively classify seizure-related states, and the inter-seizure state has been demonstrated as being random, in contrast to the seizure state being predictable; however, the excitatory and inhibitory networks underlying their dynamics remain unclear. Therefore, the objectives of this study are to classify the dynamics of seizure sub-states labeling seizure-like event (SLE) onset and termination intervals using CFC features and to obtain their underlying excitatory/inhibitory cellular correlates. SLEs were induced in mouse neocortical brain slices using a low-magnesium perfusate, and were recorded in layer II/III using simultaneous local field potential and whole cell voltage clamp electrodes. Classification of onset and termination of SLE transitions was investigated using CFC features in conjunction with an unsupervised 2-state hidden Markov model (HMM). Gamma distributions of their durations indicated that both are predictable. Furthermore, omitting 4Hz from the HMM classifier switched both SLE sub-states from statistically deterministic to random without changing the dynamics of the SLE state. These results were generalized to 4-AP induced SLEs and human seizure traces. Only during these sub-states, both excitatory and inhibitory currents coupled with the field. Where excitatory currents phase locked to a broad range of frequencies between 1 and 12Hz, inhibitory currents dominantly phase locked at 4Hz. We conclude that inhibition underlies the predictability of neocortical CFC-defined SLE transition sub-states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; To date, the underlying excitatory and inhibitory bases of objectively identified seizure sub-states have not been determined. Here we identify these sub-states using phase amplitude cross frequency coupling features. This is tested in both human and rodent seizure models. Then, using simultaneous field and whole cell recordings in a mouse model, we investigate the potential for explaining seizure sub-state dynamics from interactions of the excitatory and inhibitory currents with local field network activity. We found that the frequency ranges at which these currents are coherent with field oscillations have a dramatic effect on the predictability of seizure state sub-states. Such information is critical for identifying the mechanisms underlying the dynamics of epileptic seizures.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0370-18.2019v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Hilar mossy cells in the dentate gyrus (DG) shape the firing and function of the hippocampal circuit. However, the neural circuitry providing afferent input to mossy cells is incompletely understood, and little is known about the development of these inputs. Thus, we used whole-cell recording and laser scanning photostimulation (LSPS) to characterize the developmental trajectory of local excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs to mossy cells in the mouse hippocampus. Hilar mossy cells were targeted by visualizing non-red fluorescent cells in the dentate hilus of GAD2-Cre; Ai9 mice, which expressed tdTomato in GAD+ neurons, and were confirmed by post hoc morphological characterization. Our results show that at postnatal days 6-7 (P6-7), mossy cells received more excitatory input from neurons in the proximal CA3 versus those in the DG. In contrast, at P13-14 and P21-28, the largest source of excitatory input originated in DG cells, while the strength of CA3 and hilar inputs declined. A developmental trend was also evident for inhibitory inputs. Overall inhibitory input at P6-7 was weak, while inhibitory inputs from the DG cell layer and the hilus predominated at P13-14 and P21-28. The strength of local DG excitation and inhibition to mossy cells peaked at P13-14 and decreased slightly in older P21-28 mice. Together, these data provide new detailed information on the development of local synaptic connectivity of mossy cells, and suggests mechanisms through which developmental changes in local circuit inputs to hilar mossy cells shape their physiology and vulnerability to injury during postnatal periods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance statement&lt;/b&gt; Mossy cells of the dentate gyrus (DG) have been implicated in hippocampal circuits regulating pattern separation, an important function attributed to the DG. However, physiological inputs regulating mossy cell activity are incompletely understood. Here, we show that sources of both excitatory and inhibitory inputs arise developmentally. Our results suggest that excitatory inputs from the DG and local inhibitory inputs are well-positioned to powerfully sculpt receptive fields in mature mossy cells.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>RSS PAP: Brain region-specific gene signatures revealed by distinct astrocyte subpopulations unveil links to glioma and neurodegenerative diseases</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0288-18.2019v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Currently, there are no effective treatments for glioma or for neurodegenerative diseases due, in part, to our limited understanding of the pathophysiology and cellular heterogeneity of these diseases. Mounting evidence suggests that astrocytes play an active role in the pathogenesis of these diseases by contributing to a diverse range of pathophysiological states. In a previous study, five molecularly distinct astrocyte subpopulations from three different brain regions were identified. To further delineate the underlying diversity of these populations, we obtained mouse brain region-specific gene signatures for both protein-coding and long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) and found that these astrocyte subpopulations are endowed with unique molecular signatures across diverse brain regions. Additional gene set and single-sample enrichment analyses revealed that gene signatures of different subpopulations are differentially correlated with glioma tumors that harbor distinct genomic alterations. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that links transcriptional profiles of astrocyte subpopulations with glioma genomic mutations. Furthermore, our results demonstrated that subpopulations of astrocytes in select brain regions are associated with specific neurodegenerative diseases. Overall, the present study provides a new perspective for understanding the pathophysiology of glioma and neurodegenerative diseases and highlights the potential contributions of diverse astrocyte populations to normal, malignant, and degenerative brain functions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Mounting evidence suggests that astrocytes play an active role in disease pathogenesis by contributing to a diverse range of pathophysiological states. The present study identifies new layers of astrocyte diversity and new correlations between distinct astrocyte subpopulations and disease states. Understanding the heterogeneity of astrocytes in different physiological conditions and diseases will provide new avenues for improved diagnostics and therapeutics targeting specific astrocyte subpopulations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>RSS PAP: Choice-Related Activity during Visual Slant Discrimination in Macaque CIP but Not V3A</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0248-18.2019v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Creating three-dimensional (3D) representations of the world from two-dimensional retinal images is fundamental to visually guided behaviors including reaching and grasping. A critical component of this process is determining the 3D orientation of objects. Previous studies have shown that neurons in the caudal intraparietal area (CIP) of the macaque monkey represent 3D planar surface orientation (i.e., slant and tilt). Here we compare the responses of neurons in areas V3A (which is implicated in 3D visual processing and which precedes CIP in the visual hierarchy) and CIP to 3D oriented planar surfaces. We then examine whether activity in these areas correlates with perception during a fine slant discrimination task in which monkeys report if the top of a surface is slanted towards or away from them. Although we find that V3A and CIP neurons show similar sensitivity to planar surface orientation, significant choice-related activity during the slant discrimination task is rare in V3A but prominent in CIP. These results implicate both V3A and CIP in the representation of 3D surface orientation, and suggest a functional dissociation between the areas based on slant-related choice signals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Surface orientation perception is fundamental to visually guided behaviors such as reaching, grasping, and navigation. Previous studies implicate the caudal intraparietal area (CIP) in the representation of 3D surface orientation. Here we show that responses to 3D oriented planar surfaces are similar in CIP and V3A, which precedes CIP in the cortical hierarchy. However, we also find a qualitative distinction between the two areas: only CIP neurons show robust choice-related activity during a fine visual orientation discrimination task.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>RSS PAP: Electrophysiological properties of medium spiny neuron subtypes in the caudate-putamen of prepubertal male and female Drd1a-tdTomato line 6 BAC transgenic mice</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0016-19.2019v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;The caudate-putamen is a striatal brain region essential for sensorimotor behaviors, habit learning, and other cognitive and premotor functions. The output and predominant neuron of the caudate-putamen is the medium spiny neuron (MSN). MSNs present discrete cellular subtypes that show differences in neurochemistry, dopamine receptor expression, efferent targets, gene expression, functional roles, and most importantly for this study, electrophysiological properties. MSN subtypes include the striatonigral and the striatopallidal groups. Most studies identify the striatopallidal MSN subtype as being more excitable than the striatonigral MSN subtype. However, there is some divergence between studies regarding the exact differences in electrophysiological properties. Furthermore, MSN subtype electrophysiological properties have not been reported disaggregated by biological sex. We addressed these questions using prepubertal male and female Drd1a-tdTomato line 6 BAC transgenic mice, an important transgenic line that has not yet received extensive electrophysiological analysis. We made acute caudate-putamen brain slices and assessed a robust battery of 16 relevant electrophysiological properties using whole-cell patch clamp recording, including intrinsic membrane, action potential, and miniature excitatory postsynaptic current (mEPSC) properties. We found that: (1) MSN subtypes exhibited multiple differential electrophysiological properties in both sexes, including rheobase, action potential threshold and width, input resistance in both the linear and rectified ranges, and mEPSC amplitude; (2) select electrophysiological properties showed interactions between MSN subtype and sex. These findings provide a comprehensive evaluation of mouse caudate-putamen MSN subtype electrophysiological properties across females and males, both confirming and extending previous studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; The findings presented here provide the most comprehensive evaluation of the electrophysiological properties of caudate-putamen medium spiny neuron (MSN) subtypes ever performed in a single study, both in terms of electrophysiological metrics and animal sex. These data selectively confirm, diverge from, and extend the findings of previous studies, providing a firm foundation upon which to pursue future studies of caudate-putamen MSNs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Structural Associations of Cortical Contrast and Thickness in First Episode Psychosis</title>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhz040/5371084?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;There is growing evidence that psychosis is characterized by brain network abnormalities. Analyzing morphological abnormalities with T1-weighted structural MRI may be limited in discovering the extent of deviations in cortical associations. We assess whether structural associations of either cortical white–gray contrast (WGC) or cortical thickness (CT) allow for a better understanding of brain structural relationships in first episode of psychosis (FEP) patients. Principal component and structural covariance analyses were applied to WGC and CT derived from T1-weighted MRI for 116 patients and 88 controls, to explore sets of brain regions that showed group differences, and associations with symptom severity and cognitive ability in patients. We focused on 2 principal components: one encompassed primary somatomotor regions, which showed trend-like group differences in WGC, and the second included heteromodal cortices. Patients’ component scores were related to general psychopathology for WGC, but not CT. Structural covariance analyses with WGC revealed group differences in pairwise correlations across widespread brain regions, mirroring areas derived from PCA. More group differences were uncovered with WGC compared with CT. WGC holds potential as a proxy measure of myelin from commonly acquired T1-weighted MRI and may be sensitive in detecting systems-level aberrations in early psychosis, and relationships with clinical/cognitive profiles.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Spatial Patterns of Brain Activity Preferentially Reflecting Transient Pain and Stimulus Intensity</title>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhz026/5371085?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;How pain emerges in the human brain remains an unresolved question. Neuroimaging studies have suggested that several brain areas subserve pain perception because their activation correlates with perceived pain intensity. However, painful stimuli are often intense and highly salient; therefore, using both intensity- and saliency-matched control stimuli is crucial to isolate pain-selective brain responses. Here, we used these intensity/saliency-matched painful and non-painful stimuli to test whether pain-selective information can be isolated in the functional magnetic resonance imaging responses elicited by painful stimuli. Using two independent datasets, multivariate pattern analysis was able to isolate features distinguishing the responses triggered by (1) intensity/saliency-matched painful versus non-painful stimuli, and (2) high versus low-intensity/saliency stimuli regardless of whether they elicit pain. This indicates that neural activity in the so-called “pain matrix” is functionally heterogeneous, and part of it carries information related to both painfulness and intensity/saliency. The response features distinguishing these aspects are spatially distributed and cannot be ascribed to specific brain structures.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

Targeted DamID (TaDa) is proving invaluable in identifying the genome-wide binding sites of chromatin-associated proteins &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt;, without fixation, cell isolation, or immunoprecipitation. The simplicity and efficiency of the technique have led to an ever-expanding TaDa toolbox. These tools enable profiling of gene expression and chromatin accessibility, as well as the identification of the genome-wide binding sites of chromatin complexes, transcription factors and RNAs. Here, we review these new developments, with particular emphasis on the use of TaDa in studying neuronal specification.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>The occurrence of wake-like electroencephalography (EEG) traces during rapid-eye movement sleep (REM) has intrigued scientists for decades. A recent study by Bergel et al. (Nat. Commun. 2018;9;5364) imaged brain-wide hemodynamics in rats during wakefulness and sleep. The findings suggest that brain energy expenditure is highest during REM because of heightened theta and gamma activity.</content:encoded>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Foxg1 Directly Represses Dbx1 to Confine the POA and Subsequently Regulate Ventral Telencephalic Patterning</title>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhz037/5370812?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;During early development, signaling centers, such as the cortical hem and the preoptic area (POA), are critical for telencephalic patterning. However, the mechanisms underlying the maintenance of signal centers are poorly understood. Here, we report that the transcription factor &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Foxg1&lt;/span&gt; is required to confine the POA, a resource of &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Sonic Hedgehog&lt;/span&gt; (&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Shh)&lt;/span&gt; that is pivotal for ventral telencephalic development. Cell-specific deletion of &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Foxg1&lt;/span&gt; achieved by crossing &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Foxg1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;fl/fl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; with &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Dbx1-cre&lt;/span&gt; or &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Nestin-CreER&lt;/span&gt; combined with tamoxifen induction results in a dramatic expansion of the POA accompanied by the significantly increased activity of the &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Shh&lt;/span&gt; signaling pathway. Ventral pattern formation was severely impaired. Moreover, we demonstrated that &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Foxg1&lt;/span&gt; directly represses &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Dbx1&lt;/span&gt; to restrict the POA. Furthermore, we found that the ventral pallium was expanded, which might also contribute to the observed patterning defects. These findings will improve our understanding of the maintenance of signal centers and help to elucidate the mechanisms underlying ventral telencephalic patterning.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: HuR in the Medial Prefrontal Cortex is Critical for Stress-Induced Synaptic Dysfunction and Depressive-Like Symptoms in Mice</title>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhz036/5370740?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Chronic stress has been observed to increase the risk of developing depression and induce neuronal alterations of synaptic plasticity, yet the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we found that the ubiquitously expressed RNA-binding protein HuR was up-regulated in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) of mice following chronic stress. In adult mice, AAV-Cre-mediated knockout of HuR in the mPFC prevented anxiety-like and depression-like behaviors induced by chronic stress. HuR was also required for the stress-induced dendritic spine loss and synaptic transmission deficits. Moreover, &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;HuR&lt;/span&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;flox/flox&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Nex-Cre&lt;/span&gt; mice, which induce HuR loss of function from embryonic development, exhibited enhanced synaptic functions. Notably, we ascertained RhoA signaling to be regulated by HuR and involved in the modulation of structural synaptic plasticity in response to chronic stress. Our results demonstrate HuR is a critical modulator for the regulation of stress-induced synaptic plasticity alterations and depression, providing a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of depressive disorders.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>
