	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.09693</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;We have proposed orthogonal-Pad\'e activation functions, which are trainable
activation functions and show that they have faster learning capability and
improves the accuracy in standard deep learning datasets and models. Based on
our experiments, we have found two best candidates out of six orthogonal-Pad\'e
activations, which we call safe Hermite-Pade (HP) activation functions, namely
HP-1 and HP-2. When compared to ReLU, HP-1 and HP-2 has an increment in top-1
accuracy by 5.06% and 4.63% respectively in PreActResNet-34, by 3.02% and 2.75%
respectively in MobileNet V2 model on CIFAR100 dataset while on CIFAR10 dataset
top-1 accuracy increases by 2.02% and 1.78% respectively in PreActResNet-34, by
2.24% and 2.06% respectively in LeNet, by 2.15% and 2.03% respectively in
Efficientnet B0.

	<title>arXiv: Quantitative Biology: Neurons and Cognition: Implementing Permutations in the Brain and SVO Frequencies of Languages. (arXiv:2106.09639v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.09639</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The subject-verb-object (SVO) word order prevalent in English is shared by
about $42\%$ of world languages. Another $45\%$ of all languages follow the SOV
order, $9\%$ the VSO order, and fewer languages use the three remaining
permutations. None of the many extant explanations of this phenomenon take into
account the difficulty of implementing these permutations in the brain. We
propose a plausible model of sentence generation inspired by the recently
proposed Assembly Calculus framework of brain function. Our model results in a
natural explanation of the uneven frequencies. Estimating the parameters of
this model yields predictions of the relative difficulty of dis-inhibiting one
brain area from another. Our model is based on the standard syntax tree, a
simple binary tree with three leaves. Each leaf corresponds to one of the three
parts of a basic sentence. The leaves can be activated through lock and unlock
operations and the sequence of activation of the leaves implements a specific
word order. More generally, we also formulate and algorithmically solve the
problems of implementing a permutation of the leaves of any binary tree, and of
selecting the permutation that is easiest to implement on a given binary tree.

	<title>arXiv: Quantitative Biology: Neurons and Cognition: Predicting cognitive scores with graph neural networks through sample selection learning. (arXiv:2106.09408v1 [cs.LG])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.09408</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Analyzing the relation between intelligence and neural activity is of the
utmost importance in understanding the working principles of the human brain in
health and disease. In existing literature, functional brain connectomes have
been used successfully to predict cognitive measures such as intelligence
quotient (IQ) scores in both healthy and disordered cohorts using machine
learning models. However, existing methods resort to flattening the brain
connectome (i.e., graph) through vectorization which overlooks its topological
properties. To address this limitation and inspired from the emerging graph
neural networks (GNNs), we design a novel regression GNN model (namely RegGNN)
for predicting IQ scores from brain connectivity. On top of that, we introduce
a novel, fully modular sample selection method to select the best samples to
learn from for our target prediction task. However, since such deep learning
architectures are computationally expensive to train, we further propose a
\emph{learning-based sample selection} method that learns how to choose the
training samples with the highest expected predictive power on unseen samples.
For this, we capitalize on the fact that connectomes (i.e., their adjacency
matrices) lie in the symmetric positive definite (SPD) matrix cone. Our results
on full-scale and verbal IQ prediction outperforms comparison methods in autism
spectrum disorder cohorts and achieves a competitive performance for
neurotypical subjects using 3-fold cross-validation. Furthermore, we show that
our sample selection approach generalizes to other learning-based methods,
which shows its usefulness beyond our GNN architecture.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;We present a brief review of power laws and correlation functions as measures
of criticality and the relation between them. By comparing phenomenology from
rain, brain and the forest fire model we discuss the relevant features of
self-organisation to the vicinity about a critical state. We conclude that
organisation to a region of extended correlations and approximate power laws
may be behaviour of interest shared between the three considered systems.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Generative neural networks are able to mimic intricate probability
distributions such as those of handwritten text, natural images, etc. Since
their inception several models were proposed. The most successful of these were
based on adversarial (GAN), auto-encoding (VAE) and maximum mean discrepancy
(MMD) relatively complex architectures and schemes. Surprisingly, a very simple
architecture (a single feed-forward neural network) in conjunction with an
obvious optimization goal (Kullback_Leibler divergence) was apparently
overlooked. This paper demonstrates that such a model (denoted SGN for its
simplicity) is able to generate samples visually and quantitatively competitive
as compared with the fore-mentioned state of the art methods.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.09296</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Learning to classify time series with limited data is a practical yet
challenging problem. Current methods are primarily based on hand-designed
feature extraction rules or domain-specific data augmentation. Motivated by the
advances in deep speech processing models and the fact that voice data are
univariate temporal signals, in this paper, we propose Voice2Series (V2S), a
novel end-to-end approach that reprograms acoustic models for time series
classification, through input transformation learning and output label mapping.
Leveraging the representation learning power of a large-scale pre-trained
speech processing model, on 30 different time series tasks we show that V2S
either outperforms or is tied with state-of-the-art methods on 20 tasks, and
improves their average accuracy by 1.84%. We further provide a theoretical
justification of V2S by proving its population risk is upper bounded by the
source risk and a Wasserstein distance accounting for feature alignment via
reprogramming. Our results offer new and effective means to time series
classification.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Pruning the weights of randomly initialized neural networks plays an
important role in the context of lottery ticket hypothesis. Ramanujan et al.
(2020) empirically showed that only pruning the weights can achieve remarkable
performance instead of optimizing the weight values. However, to achieve the
same level of performance as the weight optimization, the pruning approach
requires more parameters in the networks before pruning and thus more memory
space. To overcome this parameter inefficiency, we introduce a novel framework
to prune randomly initialized neural networks with iteratively randomizing
weight values (IteRand). Theoretically, we prove an approximation theorem in
our framework, which indicates that the randomizing operations are provably
effective to reduce the required number of the parameters. We also empirically
demonstrate the parameter efficiency in multiple experiments on CIFAR-10 and
ImageNet.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The rapidly evolving field of Artificial Intelligence necessitates automated
approaches to co-design neural network architecture and neural accelerators to
maximize system efficiency and address productivity challenges. To enable joint
optimization of this vast space, there has been growing interest in
differentiable NN-HW co-design. Fully differentiable co-design has reduced the
resource requirements for discovering optimized NN-HW configurations, but fail
to adapt to general hardware accelerator search spaces. This is due to the
existence of non-synthesizable (invalid) designs in the search space of many
hardware accelerators. To enable efficient and realizable co-design of
configurable hardware accelerators with arbitrary neural network search spaces,
we introduce RHNAS. RHNAS is a method that combines reinforcement learning for
hardware optimization with differentiable neural architecture search. RHNAS
discovers realizable NN-HW designs with 1.84x lower latency and 1.86x lower
energy-delay product (EDP) on ImageNet and 2.81x lower latency and 3.30x lower
EDP on CIFAR-10 over the default hardware accelerator design.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.09153</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Inspired by natural evolution, evolutionary search algorithms have proven
remarkably capable due to their dual abilities to radiantly explore through
diverse populations and to converge to adaptive pressures. A large part of this
behavior comes from the selection function of an evolutionary algorithm, which
is a metric for deciding which individuals survive to the next generation. In
deceptive or hard-to-search fitness landscapes, greedy selection often fails,
thus it is critical that selection functions strike the correct balance between
gradient-exploiting adaptation and exploratory diversification. This paper
introduces Sel4Sel, or Selecting for Selection, an algorithm that searches for
high-performing neural-network-based selection functions through a
meta-evolutionary loop. Results on three distinct bitstring domains indicate
that Sel4Sel networks consistently match or exceed the performance of both
fitness-based selection and benchmarks explicitly designed to encourage
diversity. Analysis of the strongest Sel4Sel networks reveals a general
tendency to favor highly novel individuals early on, with a gradual shift
towards fitness-based selection as deceptive local optima are bypassed.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.09104</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Non-Volatile Memories (NVMs) such as Resistive RAM (RRAM) are used in
neuromorphic systems to implement high-density and low-power analog synaptic
weights. Unfortunately, an RRAM cell can switch its state after reading its
content a certain number of times. Such behavior challenges the integrity and
program-once-read-many-times philosophy of implementing machine learning
inference on neuromorphic systems, impacting the Quality-of-Service (QoS).
Elevated temperatures and frequent usage can significantly shorten the number
of times an RRAM cell can be reliably read before it becomes absolutely
necessary to reprogram. We propose an architectural solution to extend the read
endurance of RRAM-based neuromorphic systems. We make two key contributions.
First, we formulate the read endurance of an RRAM cell as a function of the
programmed synaptic weight and its activation within a machine learning
workload. Second, we propose an intelligent workload mapping strategy
incorporating the endurance formulation to place the synapses of a machine
learning model onto the RRAM cells of the hardware. The objective is to extend
the inference lifetime, defined as the number of times the model can be used to
generate output (inference) before the trained weights need to be reprogrammed
on the RRAM cells of the system. We evaluate our architectural solution with
machine learning workloads on a cycle-accurate simulator of an RRAM-based
neuromorphic system. Our results demonstrate a significant increase in
inference lifetime with only a minimal performance impact.

	<title>Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience: Oscillatory Activity in Mouse Lemur Primary Motor Cortex During Natural Locomotor Behavior</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2021.655980</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In arboreal environments, substrate orientation determines the biomechanical strategy for postural maintenance and locomotion. In this study, we investigated possible neuronal correlates of these mechanisms in an ancestral primate model, the gray mouse lemur. We conducted telemetric recordings of electrocorticographic activity in left primary motor cortex of two mouse lemurs moving on a branch-like small-diameter pole, fixed horizontally, or vertically. Analysis of cortical oscillations in high β (25–35 Hz) and low γ (35–50 Hz) bands showed stronger resting power on horizontal than vertical substrate, potentially illustrating sensorimotor processes for postural maintenance. Locomotion on horizontal substrate was associated with stronger event-related desynchronization than vertical substrate, which could relate to locomotor adjustments and/or derive from differences in baseline activity. Spectrograms of cortical activity showed modulation throughout individual locomotor cycles, with higher values in the first than second half cycle. However, substrate orientation did not significantly influence these variations. Overall, these results confirm that specific cortical mechanisms are solicited during arboreal locomotion, whereby mouse lemurs adjust cortical activity to substrate orientation during static posture and locomotion, and modulate this activity throughout locomotor cycles.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Riboflavin Inhibits Histamine-Dependent Itch by Modulating Transient Receptor Potential Vanilloid 1 (TRPV1)</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2021.643483</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Riboflavin, also known as vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, isfound in foods and is used as a dietary supplement. Its deficiency (also called ariboflavinosis) results in some skin lesions and inflammations, such as stomatitis, cheilosis, oily scaly skin rashes, and itchy, watery eyes. Various therapeutic effects of riboflavin, such as anticancer, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-nociceptive effects, are well known. Although some studies have identified the clinical effect of riboflavin on skin problems, including itch and inflammation, its underlying mechanism of action remains unknown. In this study, we investigated the molecular mechanism of the effects of riboflavin on histamine-dependent itch based on behavioral tests and electrophysiological experiments. Riboflavin significantly reduced histamine-induced scratching behaviors in mice and histamine-induced discharges in single-nerve fiber recordings, while it did not alter motor function in the rotarod test. In cultured dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons, riboflavin showed a dose-dependent inhibitory effect on the histamine- and capsaicin-induced inward current. Further tests wereconducted to determine whether two endogenous metabolites of riboflavin, flavin mononucleotide (FMN) and flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD), have similar effects to those of riboflavin. Here, FMN, but not FAD, significantly inhibited capsaicin-induced currents and itching responses caused by histamine. In addition, in transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1)-transfected HEK293 cells, both riboflavin and FMN blocked capsaicin-induced currents, whereas FAD did not. These results revealed that riboflavin inhibits histamine-dependent itch by modulating TRPV1 activity. This study will be helpful in understanding how riboflavin exerts antipruritic effects and suggests that it might be a useful drug for the treatment of histamine-dependent itch.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Integrative Neuroscience: The Paraventricular Thalamus as a Critical Node of Motivated Behavior via the Hypothalamic-Thalamic-Striatal Circuit</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnint.2021.706713</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In this review, we highlight evidence that supports a role for the paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus (PVT) in motivated behavior. We include a neuroanatomical and neurochemical overview, outlining what is known of the cellular makeup of the region and its most prominent afferent and efferent connections. We discuss how these connections and distinctions across the anterior-posterior axis correspond to the perceived function of the PVT. We then focus on the hypothalamic-thalamic-striatal circuit and the neuroanatomical and functional placement of the PVT within this circuit. In this regard, the PVT is ideally positioned to integrate information regarding internal states and the external environment and translate it into motivated actions. Based on data that has emerged in recent years, including that from our laboratory, we posit that orexinergic (OX) innervation from the lateral hypothalamus (LH) to the PVT encodes the incentive motivational value of reward cues and thereby alters the signaling of the glutamatergic neurons projecting from the PVT to the shell of the nucleus accumbens (NAcSh). The PVT-NAcSh pathway then modulates dopamine activity and resultant cue-motivated behaviors. As we and others apply novel tools and approaches to studying the PVT we will continue to refine the anatomical, cellular, and functional definitions currently ascribed to this nucleus and further elucidate its role in motivated behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.689723</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Parkinson’s disease (PD) is characterized by alpha-synuclein misfolding with subsequent intraneuronal amyloid formation and accumulation, low grade neuroinflammatory changes, and selective neurodegeneration. Available evidence suggests that the pathology usually begins in the gut and olfactory mucosa, spreading to the brain via the vagus and olfactory nerves, by a prion-like mechanism. A causal relationship has not been established, but gut dysbiosis is prevalent in PD and may lead to intestinal inflammation and barrier dysfunction. Additionally, epidemiological data indicate a link between inflammatory bowel diseases and PD. Calprotectin and zonulin are markers of intestinal inflammation and barrier permeability, respectively. We evaluated their serum and fecal levels in 22 patients with sporadic PD and 16 unmatched healthy controls. Mean calprotectin was higher in PD, both in serum (14.26 mcg/ml ± 4.50 vs. 5.94 mcg/ml ± 3.80, p = 0.0125) and stool (164.54 mcg/g ± 54.19 vs. 56.19 mcg/g ± 35.88, p = 0.0048). Mean zonulin was also higher in PD serum (26.69 ng/ml ± 3.55 vs. 19.43 ng/ml ± 2.56, p = 0.0046) and stool (100.19 ng/ml ± 28.25 vs. 37.3 ng/ml ± 13.26, p = 0.0012). Calprotectin was above the upper reference limit in 19 PD serums and 6 controls (OR = 10.56, 95% CI = 2.17–51.42, p = 0.0025) and in 20 PD stool samples and 4 controls (OR = 30, 95% CI = 4.75–189.30, p = 0.000045). Increased zonulin was found only in the stool samples of 8 PD patients. Despite the small sample size, our findings are robust, complementing and supporting other recently published results. The relation between serum and fecal calprotectin and zonulin levels and sporadic PD warrants further investigation in larger cohorts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Rabbit PrP Is Partially Resistant to in vitro Aggregation Induced by Different Biological Cofactors</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.689315</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Prion diseases have been described in humans and other mammals, including sheep, goats, cattle, and deer. Since mice, hamsters, and cats are susceptible to prion infection, they are often used to study the mechanisms of prion infection and conversion. Mammals, such as horses and dogs, however, do not naturally contract the disease and are resistant to infection, while others, like rabbits, have exhibited low susceptibility. Infection involves the conversion of the cellular prion protein (PrP&lt;sup&gt;C&lt;/sup&gt;) to the scrapie form (PrP&lt;sup&gt;Sc&lt;/sup&gt;), and several cofactors have already been identified as important adjuvants in this process, such as glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), lipids, and nucleic acids. The molecular mechanisms that determine transmissibility between species remain unclear, as well as the barriers to transmission. In this study, we examine the interaction of recombinant rabbit PrP&lt;sup&gt;C&lt;/sup&gt; (RaPrP) with different biological cofactors such as GAGs (heparin and dermatan sulfate), phosphatidic acid, and DNA oligonucleotides (A1 and D67) to evaluate the importance of these cofactors in modulating the aggregation of rabbit PrP and explain the animal’s different degrees of resistance to infection. We used spectroscopic and chromatographic approaches to evaluate the interaction with cofactors and their effect on RaPrP aggregation, which we compared with murine PrP (MuPrP). Our data show that all cofactors induce RaPrP aggregation and exhibit pH dependence. However, RaPrP aggregated to a lesser extent than MuPrP in the presence of any of the cofactors tested. The binding affinity with cofactors does not correlate with these low levels of aggregation, suggesting that the latter are related to the stability of PrP at acidic pH. The absence of the N-terminus affected the interaction with cofactors, influencing the efficiency of aggregation. These findings demonstrate that the interaction with polyanionic cofactors is related to rabbit PrP being less susceptible to aggregation in vitro and that the N-terminal domain is important to the efficiency of conversion, increasing the interaction with cofactors. The decreased effect of cofactors in rabbit PrP likely explains its lower propensity to prion conversion.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.682259</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Currently there are approximately 291,000 people suffering from a spinal cord injury (SCI) in the United States. SCI is associated with traumatic changes in mobility and neuralgia, as well as many other long-term chronic health complications, including metabolic disorders, diabetes mellitus, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, osteoporosis, and elevated inflammatory markers. Due to medical advances, patients with SCI survive much longer than previously. This increase in life expectancy exposes them to novel neurological complications such as memory loss, cognitive decline, depression, and Alzheimer’s disease. In fact, these usually age-associated disorders are more prevalent in people living with SCI. A common factor of these disorders is the reduction in hippocampal neurogenesis. Inflammation, which is elevated after SCI, plays a major role in modulating hippocampal neurogenesis. While there is no clear consensus on the mechanism of the decline in hippocampal neurogenesis and cognition after SCI, we will examine in this review how SCI-induced inflammation could modulate hippocampal neurogenesis and provoke age-associated neurological disorders. Thereafter, we will discuss possible therapeutic options which may mitigate the influence of SCI associated complications on hippocampal neurogenesis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.682110</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Psychosis disorders share overlapping symptoms and are characterized by a wide-spread breakdown in functional brain integration. Although neuroimaging studies have identified numerous connectivity abnormalities in affective and non-affective psychoses, whether they have specific or unique connectivity abnormalities, especially within the early stage is still poorly understood. The early phase of psychosis is a critical period with fewer chronic confounds and when treatment intervention may be most effective. In this work, we examined whole-brain functional network connectivity (FNC) from both static and dynamic perspectives in patients with affective psychosis (PAP) or with non-affective psychosis (PnAP) and healthy controls (HCs). A fully automated independent component analysis (ICA) pipeline called “Neuromark” was applied to high-quality functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data with 113 early-phase psychosis patients (32 PAP and 81 PnAP) and 52 HCs. Relative to the HCs, both psychosis groups showed common abnormalities in static FNC (sFNC) between the thalamus and sensorimotor domain, and between subcortical regions and the cerebellum. PAP had specifically decreased sFNC between the superior temporal gyrus and the paracentral lobule, and between the cerebellum and the middle temporal gyrus/inferior parietal lobule. On the other hand, PnAP showed increased sFNC between the fusiform gyrus and the superior medial frontal gyrus. Dynamic FNC (dFNC) was investigated using a combination of a sliding window approach, clustering analysis, and graph analysis. Three reoccurring brain states were identified, among which both psychosis groups had fewer occurrences in one antagonism state (state 2) and showed decreased network efficiency within an intermediate state (state 1). Compared with HCs and PnAP, PAP also showed a significantly increased number of state transitions, indicating more unstable brain connections in affective psychosis. We further found that the identified connectivity features were associated with the overall positive and negative syndrome scale, an assessment instrument for general psychopathology and positive symptoms. Our findings support the view that subcortical-cortical information processing is disrupted within five years of the initial onset of psychosis and provide new evidence that abnormalities in both static and dynamic connectivity consist of shared and unique features for the early affective and non-affective psychoses.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Seizures and Interictal Epileptiform Activity in the Rat Collagenase Model for Intracerebral Hemorrhage</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.682036</link>
	<content:encoded>Aims&lt;p&gt;Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is a known risk factor for the development of acute symptomatic as well as late unprovoked seizures. The underlying pathophysiology of post-ICH seizures is incompletely understood and there are no reliable predictive biomarkers. An animal model to study post-ICH seizures is currently lacking. The aim of this study was to investigate (1) the occurrence of seizures and interictal epileptiform activity in the ICH rat collagenase model using long-term video-EEG monitoring (VEM) and (2) whether seizure occurrence was associated with interictal epileptiform activity and histological features.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;Male Sprague-Dawley rats were implanted with epidural electrodes. After 1 week of baseline VEM, collagenase was injected in left striatum to induce an ICH. VEM was continued for 180 days to assess the occurrence of post-ICH seizures and interictal epileptiform activity (spikes and epileptiform discharges). At the end of the experiment, animals were euthanized for histological characterization of the hemorrhagic lesion, using cresyl violet, Prussian blue and immunofluorescence staining.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Acute symptomatic seizures occurred in 4/12 animals between 46 and 80 h after ICH induction. Late unprovoked seizures were present in 2/12 animals and started at 90 and 103 days post-ICH. Animals with late unprovoked seizures did not have acute symptomatic seizures. All electrographic seizures were accompanied by clear behavioral changes. Interictal spikes and epileptiform discharges were observed in all animals but occurred more frequently in rats with late seizures (p = 0.019 and p &amp;lt; 0.001, respectively). Animals with acute symptomatic seizures had more extended hemorrhagic lesions and hemosiderin deposits in the piriform cortex.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;Both acute symptomatic and late unprovoked seizures were observed in the rat collagenase model. Interictal epileptiform activity was more frequently seen in animals with late seizures. Rats with acute symptomatic seizures showed more extensive lesions and hemosiderin deposits in the piriform cortex. This model could be used to further explore possible biomarkers for epileptogenesis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Squalamine and Its Derivatives Modulate the Aggregation of Amyloid-β and α-Synuclein and Suppress the Toxicity of Their Oligomers</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.680026</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The aberrant aggregation of proteins is a key molecular event in the development and progression of a wide range of neurodegenerative disorders. We have shown previously that squalamine and trodusquemine, two natural products in the aminosterol class, can modulate the aggregation of the amyloid-β peptide (Aβ) and of α-synuclein (αS), which are associated with Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases. In this work, we expand our previous analyses to two squalamine derivatives, des-squalamine and α-squalamine, obtaining further insights into the mechanism by which aminosterols modulate Aβ and αS aggregation. We then characterize the ability of these small molecules to alter the physicochemical properties of stabilized oligomeric species in vitro and to suppress the toxicity of these aggregates to varying degrees toward human neuroblastoma cells. We found that, despite the fact that these aminosterols exert opposing effects on Aβ and αS aggregation under the conditions that we tested, the modifications that they induced to the toxicity of oligomers were similar. Our results indicate that the suppression of toxicity is mediated by the displacement of toxic oligomeric species from cellular membranes by the aminosterols. This study, thus, provides evidence that aminosterols could be rationally optimized in drug discovery programs to target oligomer toxicity in Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.676220</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The human pupil behavior has gained increased attention due to the discovery of the intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells and the afferent pupil control path’s role as a biomarker for cognitive processes. Diameter changes in the range of 10&lt;sup&gt;–2&lt;/sup&gt; mm are of interest, requiring reliable and characterized measurement equipment to accurately detect neurocognitive effects on the pupil. Mostly commercial solutions are used as measurement devices in pupillometry which is associated with high investments. Moreover, commercial systems rely on closed software, restricting conclusions about the used pupil-tracking algorithms. Here, we developed an open-source pupillometry platform consisting of hardware and software competitive with high-end commercial stereo eye-tracking systems. Our goal was to make a professional remote pupil measurement pipeline for laboratory conditions accessible for everyone. This work’s core outcome is an integrated cross-platform (macOS, Windows and Linux) pupillometry software called PupilEXT, featuring a user-friendly graphical interface covering the relevant requirements of professional pupil response research. We offer a selection of six state-of-the-art open-source pupil detection algorithms (Starburst, Swirski, ExCuSe, ElSe, PuRe and PuReST) to perform the pupil measurement. A developed 120-fps pupillometry demo system was able to achieve a calibration accuracy of 0.003 mm and an averaged temporal pupil measurement detection accuracy of 0.0059 mm in stereo mode. The PupilEXT software has extended features in pupil detection, measurement validation, image acquisition, data acquisition, offline pupil measurement, camera calibration, stereo vision, data visualization and system independence, all combined in a single open-source interface, available at https://github.com/openPupil/Open-PupilEXT.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Key Intrinsic Connectivity Networks for Individual Identification With Siamese Long Short-Term Memory</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.660187</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) analysis, many studies have been conducted on inter-subject variability as well as intra-subject reproducibility. These studies indicate that fMRI could have unique characteristics for individuals. In this study, we hypothesized that the dynamic information during 1 min of fMRI was unique and repetitive enough for each subject, so we applied long short-term memory (LSTM) using initial time points of dynamic resting-state fMRI for individual identification. Siamese network is used to obtain robust individual identification performance without additional learning on a new dataset. In particular, by adding a new structure called region of interest–wise average pooling (RAP), individual identification performance could be improved, and key intrinsic connectivity networks (ICNs) for individual identification were also identified. The average performance of individual identification was 97.88% using the test dataset in eightfold cross-validation analysis. Through the visualization of features learned by Siamese LSTM with RAP, ICNs spanning the parietal region were observed as the key ICNs in identifying individuals. These results suggest the key ICNs in fMRI could represent individual uniqueness.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.629297</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Pericytes are perivascular multipotent cells located on capillaries. Although pericytes are discovered in the nineteenth century, recent studies have found that pericytes play an important role in maintaining the blood—brain barrier (BBB) and regulating the neurovascular system. In the neurovascular unit, pericytes perform their functions by coordinating the crosstalk between endothelial, glial, and neuronal cells. Dysfunction of pericytes can lead to a variety of diseases, including stroke and other neurological disorders. Recent studies have suggested that pericytes can serve as a therapeutic target in ischemic stroke. In this review, we first summarize the biology and functions of pericytes in the central nervous system. Then, we focus on the role of dysfunctional pericytes in the pathogenesis of ischemic stroke. Finally, we discuss new therapies for ischemic stroke based on targeting pericytes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroinformatics: 3D Segmentation of Perivascular Spaces on T1-Weighted 3 Tesla MR Images With a Convolutional Autoencoder and a U-Shaped Neural Network</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fninf.2021.641600</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;We implemented a deep learning (DL) algorithm for the 3-dimensional segmentation of perivascular spaces (PVSs) in deep white matter (DWM) and basal ganglia (BG). This algorithm is based on an autoencoder and a U-shaped network (U-net), and was trained and tested using T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data from a large database of 1,832 healthy young adults. An important feature of this approach is the ability to learn from relatively sparse data, which gives the present algorithm a major advantage over other DL algorithms. Here, we trained the algorithm with 40 T1-weighted MRI datasets in which all “visible” PVSs were manually annotated by an experienced operator. After learning, performance was assessed using another set of 10 MRI scans from the same database in which PVSs were also traced by the same operator and were checked by consensus with another experienced operator. The Sorensen-Dice coefficients for PVS voxel detection in DWM (resp. BG) were 0.51 (resp. 0.66), and 0.64 (resp. 0.71) for PVS cluster detection (volume threshold of 0.5 within a range of 0 to 1). Dice values above 0.90 could be reached for detecting PVSs larger than 10 mm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; and 0.95 for PVSs larger than 15 mm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. We then applied the trained algorithm to the rest of the database (1,782 individuals). The individual PVS load provided by the algorithm showed a high agreement with a semi-quantitative visual rating done by an independent expert rater, both for DWM and for BG. Finally, we applied the trained algorithm to an age-matched sample from another MRI database acquired using a different scanner. We obtained a very similar distribution of PVS load, demonstrating the interoperability of this algorithm.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Did My Hand Move in a Mirror? Body Ownership Induced by the Mirror Hand Illusion</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.684873</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Although the illusion that the mirror image of a hand or limb could be recognized as a part of one’s body behind the mirror, the effect of adding tactile stimulation to this illusion remains unknown. We, therefore, examined how the timing of tactile stimulation affects the induction of body ownership on the mirror image. Twenty-one healthy, right-handed participants (mean age = 23.0 ± 1.0 years, no medical history of neurological and/or psychiatric disorders) were enrolled and a crossover design was adopted in this study. Participants’ right and left hands were placed on the front and back sides of the mirror, respectively, then they were asked to keep looking at their right hand in the mirror. All participants experienced two experiments; one was with tactile stimulation that was synchronized with the movement of a mirror image (synchronous condition), and the other one was with tactile stimulation that was not synchronized (asynchronous condition). The qualitative degree of body ownership for the mirrored hand was evaluated by a questionnaire. Proprioceptive drift (PD), an illusory shift of the felt position of the real hand toward the mirrored hand was used for quantitative evaluation of body ownership and measured at “baseline,” “immediately after stimulation,” “2 min after stimulation,” and “4 min after stimulation.” The results of the questionnaire revealed that some items of body ownership rating were higher in the synchronous condition than in the asynchronous condition (p &amp;lt; 0.05). We found that PD occurred from immediately after to 4 min after stimulation in both conditions (p &amp;lt; 0.01) and there was no difference in the results between the conditions. From the dissociation of these results, we interpreted that body ownership could be elicited by different mechanisms depending on the task demand. Our results may contribute to the understanding of the multisensory integration mechanism of visual and tactile stimulation during mirror illusion induction.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation Over the Right Posterior Superior Temporal Sulcus Promotes the Feature Discrimination Processing</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.663789</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Attention is the dynamic process of allocating limited resources to the information that is most relevant to our goals. Accumulating studies have demonstrated the crucial role of frontal and parietal areas in attention. However, the effect of posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS) in attention is still unclear. To address this question, in this study, we measured transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS)-induced event-related potentials (ERPs) to determine the extent of involvement of the right pSTS in attentional processing. We hypothesized that TMS would enhance the activation of the right pSTS during feature discrimination processing. We recruited 21 healthy subjects who performed the dual-feature delayed matching task while undergoing single-pulse sham or real TMS to the right pSTS 300 ms before the second stimulus onset. The results showed that the response time was reduced by real TMS of the pSTS as compared to sham stimulation. N270 amplitude was reduced during conflict processing, and the time-varying network analysis revealed increased connectivity between the frontal lobe and temporo-parietal and occipital regions. Thus, single-pulse TMS of the right pSTS enhances feature discrimination processing and task performance by reducing N270 amplitude and increasing connections between the frontal pole and temporo-parietal and occipital regions. These findings provide evidence that the right pSTS facilitates feature discrimination by accelerating the formation of a dynamic network.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Training-of-Trainers Neuroscience and Mental Health Teacher Education in Liberia Improves Self-Reported Support for Students</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.653069</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Education programs have been central to reestablishing social norms, rebuilding public educational institutions, and addressing public attitudes toward mental illness in Liberia following a protracted civil war and the Ebola epidemic. The aim of this study was to determine if a program combining an understanding of neuroscience with mental health literacy content could increase teachers’ awareness of students’ mental health issues and produce changes in teacher attitudes and classroom practices. A tiered Training-of-Trainers approach was employed. The first workshop trained 24 Liberian secondary science teachers in the neurobiology of learning, memory, emotions, stress and adolescent brain development. A Leadership Team formed from eight of the Tier I participants then adapted the curriculum, added in more mental health literacy content and led four Tier II workshops and four follow-up Refresher sessions. Participants completed a neuroscience knowledge test and surveys assessing stigma, general perceptions of people with mental illness, and burnout. A subset of Tier II teachers participated in a structured interview at the Refresher time point. Teachers in both tiers acquired basic neuroscience knowledge. Tier I, but not Tier II teachers significantly improved their surveyed attitudes toward people with mental illness. No changes were found in overall teacher burnout. Despite these survey results, the interviewed Tier II teachers self-reported behavioral changes in how they approached their teaching and students in their classrooms. Interviewees described how they now understood social and emotional challenges students might be experiencing and recognized abnormal behaviors as having a biopsychosocial basis. Teachers reported reduced use of verbal and corporal punishment and increased positive rewards systems, such as social and emotional support for students through building relationships. Refresher discussions concurred with the interviewees. In contrast to previous teacher mental health literacy programs which did not bring about a change in helping behaviors, this pilot program may have been successful in changing teacher knowledge and self-reported behaviors, improving teacher–student relationships and decreasing harsh discipline. The combination of basic neuroscience concepts with training on how to recognize mental health issues and refer students should be investigated further as a strategy to promote teacher mental health literacy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.624617</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The mismatch negativity (MMN), an electrophysiological response to an oddball auditory stimulus, is related to reading ability in many studies. There are conflicting findings regarding exactly how the MMN relates to risk or actual diagnosis of dyslexia/reading impairment, perhaps due to the heterogeneity of abilities in children with reading impairment. In this study, 166 English-speaking kindergarten children oversampled for dyslexia risk completed behavioral assessments and a speech-syllable MMN paradigm. We examined how early and late MMN mean amplitude and laterality were related to two established predictors of reading ability: phonological awareness (PA) and rapid automatized naming (RAN). In bootstrapped group analyses, late MMN amplitude was significantly greater in children with typical PA ability than low PA ability. In contrast, laterality of the early and late MMN was significantly different in children with low versus typical RAN ability. Continuous analyses controlling for child age, non-verbal IQ, and letter and word identification abilities showed the same associations between late MMN amplitude with PA and late MMN laterality with RAN. These findings suggest that amplitude of the MMN may relate to phonological representations and ability to manipulate them, whereas MMN laterality may reflect differences in brain processes that support automaticity needed for reading.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.617596</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The present study aimed to examine whether the effect of acute aerobic exercise on inhibitory control of children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is moderated by exercise intensity. Using a within-subjects design, 25 children with ADHD completed a flanker task with concurrent collection of electroencephalography (EEG) data after three different intensities of treadmill running. The results showed that low- and moderate-intensity exercises resulted in shorter reaction times (RTs) relative to vigorous-intensity exercise during the incompatible condition of the flanker task regardless of task congruency. A P3 congruency effect was observed following low- and vigorous-intensity exercises but not after moderate-intensity exercise. The mean alpha power, a measure of cortical arousal, increased following low- and moderate-intensity exercises but decreased following vigorous-intensity exercise. In addition, the change in arousal level after moderate-intensity exercise was negatively correlated with RT during incompatible flanker tasks. The current findings suggest that children with ADHD have better inhibitory control following both low- and moderate-intensity exercises relative to vigorous aerobic exercise, which could be characterized by an optimal state of cortical arousal.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.585533</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Objective: To evaluate whether a common polymorphism (Val66Met) in the gene for brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)—a gene thought to influence plasticity—contributes to inter-individual variability in responses to continuous theta-burst stimulation (cTBS), and explore whether variability in stimulation-induced plasticity among Val66Met carriers relates to differences in stimulation intensity (SI) used to probe plasticity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Motor evoked potentials (MEPs) were collected from 33 healthy individuals (11 Val66Met) prior to cTBS (baseline) and in 10 min intervals immediately following cTBS for a total of 30 min post-cTBS (0 min post-cTBS, 10 min post-cTBS, 20 min post cTBS, and 30 min post-cTBS) of the left primary motor cortex. Analyses assessed changes in cortical excitability as a function of BDNF (Val66Val vs. Val66Met) and SI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: For both BDNF groups, MEP-suppression from baseline to post-cTBS time points decreased as a function of increasing SI. However, the effect of SI on MEPs was more pronounced for Val66Met vs. Val66Val carriers, whereby individuals probed with higher vs. lower SIs resulted in paradoxical cTBS aftereffects (MEP-facilitation), which persisted at least 30 min post-cTBS administration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: cTBS aftereffects among BDNF Met allele carriers are more variable depending on the SI used to probe cortical excitability when compared to homozygous Val allele carriers, which could, to some extent, account for the inconsistency of previously reported cTBS effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Significance: These data provide insight into the sources of cTBS response variability, which can inform how best to stratify and optimize its use in investigational and clinical contexts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience: Computational Evidence for a Competitive Thalamocortical Model of Spikes and Spindle Activity in Rolandic Epilepsy</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2021.680549</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Rolandic epilepsy (RE) is the most common idiopathic focal childhood epilepsy syndrome, characterized by sleep-activated epileptiform spikes and seizures and cognitive deficits in school age children. Recent evidence suggests that this disease may be caused by disruptions to the Rolandic thalamocortical circuit, resulting in both an abundance of epileptiform spikes and a paucity of sleep spindles in the Rolandic cortex during non-rapid eye movement sleep (NREM); electrographic features linked to seizures and cognitive symptoms, respectively. The neuronal mechanisms that support the competitive shared thalamocortical circuitry between pathological epileptiform spikes and physiological sleep spindles are not well-understood. In this study we introduce a computational thalamocortical model for the sleep-activated epileptiform spikes observed in RE. The cellular and neuronal circuits of this model incorporate recent experimental observations in RE, and replicate the electrophysiological features of RE. Using this model, we demonstrate that: (1) epileptiform spikes can be triggered and promoted by either a reduced NMDA current or h-type current; and (2) changes in inhibitory transmission in the thalamic reticular nucleus mediates an antagonistic dynamic between epileptiform spikes and spindles. This work provides the first computational model that both recapitulates electrophysiological features and provides a mechanistic explanation for the thalamocortical switch between the pathological and physiological electrophysiological rhythms observed during NREM sleep in this common epileptic encephalopathy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.690894</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The benefits of transplanting cultured Schwann cells (SCs) for the treatment of spinal cord injury (SCI) have been systematically investigated in experimental animals since the early 1990s. Importantly, human SC (hSC) transplantation for SCI has advanced to clinical testing and safety has been established via clinical trials conducted in the USA and abroad. However, multiple barriers must be overcome to enable accessible and effective treatments for SCI patients. This review presents available information on hSC transplantation for SCI with the intention to uncover gaps in our knowledge and discuss areas for future development. To this end, we introduce the historical progression of the work that supports existing and prospective clinical initiatives and explain the reasons for the choice of hSCs while also addressing their limitations as cell therapy products. A search of the relevant literature revealed that rat SCs have served as a preclinical model of reference since the onset of investigations, and that hSC transplants are relatively understudied, possibly due to the sophisticated resources and expertise needed for the traditional processing of hSC cultures from human nerves. In turn, we reason that additional experimentation and a reexamination of the available data are needed to understand the therapeutic value of hSC transplants taking into consideration that the manufacturing of the hSCs themselves may require further development for extended uses in basic research and clinical settings.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Poly (ADP-ribose) Interacts With Phosphorylated α-Synuclein in Post Mortem PD Samples</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.704041</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Poly (ADP-ribose) (PAR) is a negatively charged polymer that is biosynthesized by Poly (ADP-ribose) Polymerase-1 (PARP-1) and regulates various cellular processes. Alpha-synuclein (αSyn) is an intrinsically disordered protein (IDP) that has been directly implicated with driving the onset and progression of Parkinson’s disease (PD). The mechanisms by which α-synuclein (αSyn) elicits its neurotoxic effects remain unclear, though it is well established that the main components of Lewy bodies (LBs) and Lewy neurites (LNs) in PD patients are aggregated hyperphosphorylated (S129) forms of αSyn (pαSyn). In the present study, we used immunofluorescence-based assays to explore if PARP-1 enzymatic product (PAR) promotes the aberrant cytoplasmic accumulation of pαSyn. We also performed quantitative measurements using in situ proximity ligation assays (PLA) on a transgenic murine model of α-synucleinopathy (M83-SNCA&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt;A53T) and post mortem PD/PDD patient samples to characterize PAR–pαSyn interactions. Additionally, we used bioinformatic approaches and site-directed mutagenesis to identify PAR-binding regions on αSyn. In summary, our studies show that PAR–pαSyn interactions are predominantly observed in PD-relevant transgenic murine models of αSyn pathology and post mortem PD/PDD patient samples. Moreover, we confirm that the interactions between PAR and αSyn involve electrostatic forces between negatively charged PAR and lysine residues on the N-terminal region of αSyn.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: APP, PSEN1, and PSEN2 Variants in Alzheimer’s Disease: Systematic Re-evaluation According to ACMG Guidelines</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.695808</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The strategies of classifying APP, PSEN1, and PSEN2 variants varied substantially in the previous studies. We aimed to re-evaluate these variants systematically according to the American college of medical genetics and genomics and the association for molecular pathology (ACMG-AMP) guidelines. In our study, APP, PSEN1, and PSEN2 variants were collected by searching Alzforum and PubMed database with keywords “PSEN1,” “PSEN2,” and “APP.” These variants were re-evaluated based on the ACMG-AMP guidelines. We compared the number of pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants of APP, PSEN1, and PSEN2. In total, 66 APP variants, 323 PSEN1 variants, and 63 PSEN2 variants were re-evaluated in our study. 94.91% of previously reported pathogenic variants were re-classified as pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants, while 5.09% of them were variants of uncertain significance (VUS). PSEN1 carried the most prevalent pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants, followed by APP and PSEN2. Significant statistically difference was identified among these three genes when comparing the number of pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants (P &amp;lt; 2.2 × 10&lt;sup&gt;–16&lt;/sup&gt;). Most of the previously reported pathogenic variants were re-classified as pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants while the others were re-evaluated as VUS, highlighting the importance of interpreting APP, PSEN1, and PSEN2 variants with caution according to ACMG-AMP guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: ADVIAN: Alzheimer's Disease VGG-Inspired Attention Network Based on Convolutional Block Attention Module and Multiple Way Data Augmentation</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.687456</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Aim: Alzheimer's disease is a neurodegenerative disease that causes 60–70% of all cases of dementia. This study is to provide a novel method that can identify AD more accurately.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: We first propose a VGG-inspired network (VIN) as the backbone network and investigate the use of attention mechanisms. We proposed an Alzheimer's Disease VGG-Inspired Attention Network (ADVIAN), where we integrate convolutional block attention modules on a VIN backbone. Also, 18-way data augmentation is proposed to avoid overfitting. Ten runs of 10-fold cross-validation are carried out to report the unbiased performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: The sensitivity and specificity reach 97.65 ± 1.36 and 97.86 ± 1.55, respectively. Its precision and accuracy are 97.87 ± 1.53 and 97.76 ± 1.13, respectively. The F1 score, MCC, and FMI are obtained as 97.75 ± 1.13, 95.53 ± 2.27, and 97.76 ± 1.13, respectively. The AUC is 0.9852.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: The proposed ADVIAN gives better results than 11 state-of-the-art methods. Besides, experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of 18-way data augmentation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Comparative Effectiveness of Interventions for Global Cognition in Patients With Mild Cognitive Impairment: A Systematic Review and Network Meta-Analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.653340</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Background: There is a lack of study comprehensively comparing the effects of all existing types of interventions on global cognition among patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aims: To conduct a network meta-analysis to evaluate the effectiveness of different types of interventions in improving global cognition among MCI patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) assessing the effects of pharmacological or non-pharmacological interventions on the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) in MCI patients were included. Two authors independently screened the studies and extracted the data. Random-effects network meta-analysis was used to synthesize the data. Results were summarized as mean difference (MD) and corresponding 95% CIs of MMSE in forest plots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Fifty RCTs with 5,944 MCI patients met the inclusion criteria and 49 were included in the network meta-analysis. Compared with the control group, cognition-based intervention (MD = 0.80, 95% CI 0.04–1.57), physical exercise (MD = 1.92, 95% CI 1.19–2.64), combined physical exercise and cognition-based intervention (MD = 1.86, 95% CI 0.60–3.12), and antioxidants (MD = 0.94, 95% CI 0.04–1.83) had positive effects on MMSE in participants with MCI. There was no significant difference between all other interventions included and the control group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: This study suggested that cognition-based intervention, physical exercise, combined physical exercise and cognition-based intervention, and antioxidants could be among the most effective interventions on global cognition in older adults with MCI. The availability, acceptability, and cost-effectiveness of interventions should also be taken into consideration when selecting interventions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Registration: PROSPERO CRD42020171985.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Simultaneously controlling COVID-19 epidemics and limiting economic and societal impacts presents a difficult challenge, especially with limited public health budgets. Testing, contact tracing, and isolating/quarantining is a key strategy that has been used to reduce transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19 and other pathogens. However, manual contact tracing is a time-consuming process and as case numbers increase a smaller fraction of cases’ contacts can be traced, leading to additional virus spread. Delays between symptom onset and being tested (and receiving results), and a low fraction of symptomatic cases being tested and traced can also reduce the impact of contact tracing on transmission. We examined the relationship between increasing cases and delays and the pathogen reproductive number R&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;, and the implications for infection dynamics using deterministic and stochastic compartmental models of SARS-CoV-2. We found that R&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt; increased sigmoidally with the number of cases due to decreasing contact tracing efficacy. This relationship results in accelerating epidemics because R&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt; initially increases, rather than declines, as infections increase. Shifting contact tracers from locations with high and low case burdens relative to capacity to locations with intermediate case burdens maximizes their impact in reducing R&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt; (but minimizing total infections may be more complicated). Contact tracing efficacy decreased sharply with increasing delays between symptom onset and tracing and with lower fraction of symptomatic infections being tested. Finally, testing and tracing reductions in R&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt; can sometimes greatly delay epidemics due to the highly heterogeneous transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2. These results demonstrate the importance of having an expandable or mobile team of contact tracers that can be used to control surges in cases. They also highlight the synergistic value of high capacity, easy access testing and rapid turn-around of testing results, and outreach efforts to encourage symptomatic cases to be tested immediately after symptom onset.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/qiGNt_DK1WU&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: SDImpute: A statistical block imputation method based on cell-level and gene-level information for dropouts in single-cell RNA-seq data</title>

The single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technologies obtain gene expression at single-cell resolution and provide a tool for exploring cell heterogeneity and cell types. As the low amount of extracted mRNA copies per cell, scRNA-seq data exhibit a large number of dropouts, which hinders the downstream analysis of the scRNA-seq data. We propose a statistical method, SDImpute (Single-cell RNA-seq Dropout Imputation), to implement block imputation for dropout events in scRNA-seq data. SDImpute automatically identifies the dropout events based on the gene expression levels and the variations of gene expression across similar cells and similar genes, and it implements block imputation for dropouts by utilizing gene expression unaffected by dropouts from similar cells. In the experiments, the results of the simulated datasets and real datasets suggest that SDImpute is an effective tool to recover the data and preserve the heterogeneity of gene expression across cells. Compared with the state-of-the-art imputation methods, SDImpute improves the accuracy of the downstream analysis including clustering, visualization, and differential expression analysis.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/HUPLdU61RI0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Yeh, Sylvia K. Plevritis, Jeanne S. Mandelblatt, for the Breast Working Group of the Cancer Intervention and Surveillance Modeling Network (CISNET) &lt;/p&gt;

Since 2000, the National Cancer Institute’s Cancer Intervention and Surveillance Modeling Network (CISNET) modeling teams have developed and applied microsimulation and statistical models of breast cancer. Here, we illustrate the use of collaborative breast cancer multilevel systems modeling in CISNET to demonstrate the flexibility of systems modeling to address important clinical and policy-relevant questions. Challenges and opportunities of future systems modeling are also summarized. The 6 CISNET breast cancer models embody the key features of systems modeling by incorporating numerous data sources and reflecting tumor, person, and health system factors that change over time and interact to affect the burden of breast cancer. Multidisciplinary modeling teams have explored alternative representations of breast cancer to reveal insights into breast cancer natural history, including the role of overdiagnosis and race differences in tumor characteristics. The models have been used to compare strategies for improving the balance of benefits and harms of breast cancer screening based on personal risk factors, including age, breast density, polygenic risk, and history of Down syndrome or a history of childhood cancer. The models have also provided evidence to support the delivery of care by simulating outcomes following clinical decisions about breast cancer treatment and estimating the relative impact of screening and treatment on the United States population. The insights provided by the CISNET breast cancer multilevel modeling efforts have informed policy and clinical guidelines. The 20 years of CISNET modeling experience has highlighted opportunities and challenges to expanding the impact of systems modeling. Moving forward, CISNET research will continue to use systems modeling to address cancer control issues, including modeling structural inequities affecting racial disparities in the burden of breast cancer. Future work will also leverage the lessons from team science, expand resource sharing, and foster the careers of early stage modeling scientists to ensure the sustainability of these efforts.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/R5smLGeS-Sk&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Effectively designing and evaluating public health responses to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic requires accurate estimation of the prevalence of COVID-19 across the United States (US). Equipment shortages and varying testing capabilities have however hindered the usefulness of the official reported positive COVID-19 case counts. We introduce four complementary approaches to estimate the cumulative incidence of symptomatic COVID-19 in each state in the US as well as Puerto Rico and the District of Columbia, using a combination of excess influenza-like illness reports, COVID-19 test statistics, COVID-19 mortality reports, and a spatially structured epidemic model. Instead of relying on the estimate from a single data source or method that may be biased, we provide multiple estimates, each relying on different assumptions and data sources. Across our four approaches emerges the consistent conclusion that on April 4, 2020, the estimated case count was 5 to 50 times higher than the official positive test counts across the different states. Nationally, our estimates of COVID-19 symptomatic cases as of April 4 have a likely range of 2.3 to 4.8 million, with possibly as many as 7.6 million cases, up to 25 times greater than the cumulative confirmed cases of about 311,000. Extending our methods to May 16, 2020, we estimate that cumulative symptomatic incidence ranges from 4.9 to 10.1 million, as opposed to 1.5 million positive test counts. The proposed combination of approaches may prove useful in assessing the burden of COVID-19 during resurgences in the US and other countries with comparable surveillance systems.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/s1IFpuDJwGg&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

More than 1.6 million Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) tests were administered daily in the United States at the peak of the epidemic, with a significant focus on individual treatment. Here, we show that objective-driven, strategic sampling designs and analyses can maximize information gain at the population level, which is necessary to increase situational awareness and predict, prepare for, and respond to a pandemic, while also continuing to inform individual treatment. By focusing on specific objectives such as individual treatment or disease prediction and control (e.g., via the collection of population-level statistics to inform lockdown measures or vaccine rollout) and drawing from the literature on capture–recapture methods to deal with nonrandom sampling and testing errors, we illustrate how public health objectives can be achieved even with limited test availability when testing programs are designed a priori to meet those objectives.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/ioJn_S3Md0o&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Biology: Comprehensive glycoproteomics shines new light on the complexity and extent of glycosylation in archaea</title>

Glycosylation is one of the most complex posttranslational protein modifications. Its importance has been established not only for eukaryotes but also for a variety of prokaryotic cellular processes, such as biofilm formation, motility, and mating. However, comprehensive glycoproteomic analyses are largely missing in prokaryotes. Here, we extend the phenotypic characterization of &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-glycosylation pathway mutants in &lt;i&gt;Haloferax volcanii&lt;/i&gt; and provide a detailed glycoproteome for this model archaeon through the mass spectrometric analysis of intact glycopeptides. Using in-depth glycoproteomic datasets generated for the wild-type (WT) and mutant strains as well as a reanalysis of datasets within the Archaeal Proteome Project (ArcPP), we identify the largest archaeal glycoproteome described so far. We further show that different &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-glycosylation pathways can modify the same glycosites under the same culture conditions. The extent and complexity of the &lt;i&gt;Hfx&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;volcanii N&lt;/i&gt;-glycoproteome revealed here provide new insights into the roles of &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-glycosylation in archaeal cell biology.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/3LiSINPzrjQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Biology: Response thresholds alone cannot explain empirical patterns of division of labor in social insects</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~3/7Frc4eP-AYw/article</link>

The effects of heterogeneity in group composition remain a major hurdle to our understanding of collective behavior across disciplines. In social insects, division of labor (DOL) is an emergent, colony-level trait thought to depend on colony composition. Theoretically, behavioral response threshold models have most commonly been employed to investigate the impact of heterogeneity on DOL. However, empirical studies that systematically test their predictions are lacking because they require control over colony composition and the ability to monitor individual behavior in groups, both of which are challenging. Here, we employ automated behavioral tracking in 120 colonies of the clonal raider ant with unparalleled control over genetic, morphological, and demographic composition. We find that each of these sources of variation in colony composition generates a distinct pattern of behavioral organization, ranging from the amplification to the dampening of inherent behavioral differences in heterogeneous colonies. Furthermore, larvae modulate interactions between adults, exacerbating the apparent complexity. Models based on threshold variation alone only partially recapitulate these empirical patterns. However, by incorporating the potential for variability in task efficiency among adults and task demand among larvae, we account for all the observed phenomena. Our findings highlight the significance of previously overlooked parameters pertaining to both larvae and workers, allow the formulation of theoretical predictions for increasing colony complexity, and suggest new avenues of empirical study.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/7Frc4eP-AYw&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Biology: Erythrocyte adenosine A2B receptor prevents cognitive and auditory dysfunction by promoting hypoxic and metabolic reprogramming</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~3/JKRydZnMyQc/article</link>

Reisz, George Edwards III, Fred A. Perreira, Rodney E. Kellems, Claudio Soto, Angelo D’Alessandro, Yang Xia&lt;/p&gt;

Hypoxia drives aging and promotes age-related cognition and hearing functional decline. Despite the role of erythrocytes in oxygen (O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) transport, their role in the onset of aging and age-related cognitive decline and hearing loss (HL) remains undetermined. Recent studies revealed that signaling through the erythrocyte adenosine A2B receptor (ADORA2B) promotes O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; release to counteract hypoxia at high altitude. However, nothing is known about a role for erythrocyte ADORA2B in age-related functional decline. Here, we report that loss of murine erythrocyte–specific ADORA2B (e&lt;i&gt;Adora2b&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−/−&lt;/sup&gt;) accelerates early onset of age-related impairments in spatial learning, memory, and hearing ability. &lt;i&gt;eAdora2b-/-&lt;/i&gt; mice display the early aging-like cellular and molecular features including the proliferation and activation of microglia and macrophages, elevation of pro-inflammatory cytokines, and attenuation of hypoxia-induced glycolytic gene expression to counteract hypoxia in the hippocampus (HIP), cortex, or cochlea. Hypoxia sufficiently accelerates early onset of cognitive and cochlear functional decline and inflammatory response in e&lt;i&gt;Adora2b&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−/−&lt;/sup&gt; mice. Mechanistically, erythrocyte ADORA2B-mediated activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and bisphosphoglycerate mutase (BPGM) promotes hypoxic and metabolic reprogramming to enhance production of 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate (2,3-BPG), an erythrocyte-specific metabolite triggering O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; delivery. Significantly, this finding led us to further discover that murine erythroblast ADORA2B and BPGM mRNA levels and erythrocyte BPGM activity are reduced during normal aging. Overall, we determined that erythrocyte ADORA2B–BPGM axis is a key component for anti-aging and anti-age–related functional decline.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/JKRydZnMyQc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Convolutional neural networks for visual recognition require large amounts of
training samples and usually benefit from data augmentation. This paper
proposes PatchMix, a data augmentation method that creates new samples by
composing patches from pairs of images in a grid-like pattern. These new
samples' ground truth labels are set as proportional to the number of patches
from each image. We then add a set of additional losses at the patch-level to
regularize and to encourage good representations at both the patch and image
levels. A ResNet-50 model trained on ImageNet using PatchMix exhibits superior
transfer learning capabilities across a wide array of benchmarks. Although
PatchMix can rely on random pairings and random grid-like patterns for mixing,
we explore evolutionary search as a guiding strategy to discover optimal
grid-like patterns and image pairing jointly. For this purpose, we conceive a
fitness function that bypasses the need to re-train a model to evaluate each
choice. In this way, PatchMix outperforms a base model on CIFAR-10 (+1.91),
CIFAR-100 (+5.31), Tiny Imagenet (+3.52), and ImageNet (+1.16) by significant
margins, also outperforming previous state-of-the-art pairwise augmentation
strategies.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The objective of this study is to derive functional networks for the autism

model together and to classify ASD and typically developing (TD) participants
using the functional connectivity calculated from the derived functional

resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) data. We
downloaded a total of 120 training samples, including 58 ASD and 62 TD
participants, which were obtained from the public repository: Autism Brain
Imaging Data Exchange I (ABIDE I). Our methodology and results have five main
parts. First, we utilize a group ICA model to extract functional networks from
the ASD group and rank the top 20 regions of interest (ROIs). Second, we
utilize a dictionary learning model to extract functional networks from the ASD
group and rank the top 20 ROIs. Third, we merged the 40 selected ROIs from the
two models together as the ASD functional networks. Fourth, we generate three
corresponding masks based on the 20 selected ROIs from group ICA, the 20 ROIs
selected from dictionary learning, and the 40 combined ROIs selected from both.
Finally, we extract ROIs for all training samples using the above three masks,
and the calculated functional connectivity was used as features for ASD and TD
classification. The classification results showed that the functional networks
derived from ICA and dictionary learning together outperform those derived from
a single ICA model or a single dictionary learning model.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;With neural architecture search methods gaining ground on manually designed
deep neural networks -even more rapidly as model sophistication escalates-, the
research trend shifts towards arranging different and often increasingly
complex neural architecture search spaces. In this conjuncture, delineating
algorithms which can efficiently explore these search spaces can result in a
significant improvement over currently used methods, which, in general,
randomly select the structural variation operator, hoping for a performance
gain. In this paper, we investigate the effect of different variation operators
in a complex domain, that of multi-network heterogeneous neural models. These
models have an extensive and complex search space of structures as they require
multiple sub-networks within the general model in order to answer to different
output types. From that investigation, we extract a set of general guidelines,
whose application is not limited to that particular type of model, and are
useful to determine the direction in which an architecture optimization method
could find the largest improvement. To deduce the set of guidelines, we
characterize both the variation operators, according to their effect on the
complexity and performance of the model; and the models, relying on diverse
metrics which estimate the quality of the different parts composing it.

neural ODEs, and showing how these quantified properties allow in turn to
recursively construct stable networks of networks in a systematic fashion. The
results can also be used to stably combine recurrent networks and physical
systems with quantified contraction properties. Similarly, they may be applied
to modular computational models of cognition.

	<title>arXiv: Computer Science: Neural and Evolutionary Computing: A Spiking Neural Network for Image Segmentation. (arXiv:2106.08921v1 [cs.NE])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.08921</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;We seek to investigate the scalability of neuromorphic computing for computer
vision, with the objective of replicating non-neuromorphic performance on
computer vision tasks while reducing power consumption. We convert the deep
Artificial Neural Network (ANN) architecture U-Net to a Spiking Neural Network
(SNN) architecture using the Nengo framework. Both rate-based and spike-based
models are trained and optimized for benchmarking performance and power, using
a modified version of the ISBI 2D EM Segmentation dataset consisting of
microscope images of cells. We propose a partitioning method to optimize
inter-chip communication to improve speed and energy efficiency when deploying
multi-chip networks on the Loihi neuromorphic chip. We explore the advantages
of regularizing firing rates of Loihi neurons for converting ANN to SNN with
minimum accuracy loss and optimized energy consumption. We propose a percentile
based regularization loss function to limit the spiking rate of the neuron
between a desired range. The SNN is converted directly from the corresponding
ANN, and demonstrates similar semantic segmentation as the ANN using the same
number of neurons and weights. However, the neuromorphic implementation on the
Intel Loihi neuromorphic chip is over 2x more energy-efficient than
conventional hardware (CPU, GPU) when running online (one image at a time).
These power improvements are achieved without sacrificing the task performance
accuracy of the network, and when all weights (Loihi, CPU, and GPU networks)
are quantized to 8 bits.

	<title>Experimental Brain Research: The effects of socioeconomic status and situational power on self-other processing in the automatic imitation task</title>
	<link>http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s00221-021-06152-2</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Previous work using physiological measures has shown that socioeconomic status and social power both influence the degree to which people are attuned to the actions of others. However, it is unclear whether such effects on brain activity translate into behaviourally significant outcomes. Here, we examined differences in automatic imitation between individuals varying in SES and power from the local community population. The automatic imitation task involves participants making actions in response to a symbolic cue while simultaneously being exposed to an action that is incongruent or congruent with the cued response. Patterns of interference in reaction time and error rate reveal the extent to which a person is susceptible to influence from the actions of other—what we refer to as “the degree of social attunement”. We found that individuals from low SES backgrounds and those in the low power priming group exhibited more interference than individuals from high SES backgrounds and those in the high power priming group. However, we did not observe an interaction between chronic status and the power group. We discuss our results in relation to broader behavioural patterns exhibited by individuals at varying levels of a social structure.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Synaptic Neuroscience: Maturation of Heterogeneity in Afferent Synapse Ultrastructure in the Mouse Cochlea</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsyn.2021.678575</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Auditory nerve fibers (ANFs) innervating the same inner hair cell (IHC) may have identical frequency tuning but different sound response properties. In cat and guinea pig, ANF response properties correlate with afferent synapse morphology and position on the IHC, suggesting a causal structure-function relationship. In mice, this relationship has not been fully characterized. Here we measured the emergence of synaptic morphological heterogeneities during maturation of the C57BL/6J mouse cochlea by comparing postnatal day 17 (p17, ∼3 days after hearing onset) with p34, when the mouse cochlea is mature. Using serial block face scanning electron microscopy and three-dimensional reconstruction we measured the size, shape, vesicle content, and position of 70 ribbon synapses from the mid-cochlea. Several features matured over late postnatal development. From p17 to p34, presynaptic densities (PDs) and post-synaptic densities (PSDs) became smaller on average (PDs: 0.75 to 0.33; PSDs: 0.58 to 0.31 μm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) and less round as their short axes shortened predominantly on the modiolar side, from 770 to 360 nm. Membrane-associated synaptic vesicles decreased in number from 53 to 30 per synapse from p17 to p34. Anatomical coupling, measured as PSD to ribbon distance, tightened predominantly on the pillar side. Ribbons became less spherical as long-axes lengthened only on the modiolar side of the IHC, from 372 to 541 nm. A decreasing gradient of synaptic ribbon size along the modiolar-pillar axis was detected only at p34 after aligning synapses of adjacent IHCs to a common reference frame (median volumes in nm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; × 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;: modiolar 4.87; pillar 2.38). The number of ribbon-associated synaptic vesicles scaled with ribbon size (range 67 to 346 per synapse at p34), thus acquiring a modiolar-pillar gradient at p34, but overall medians were similar at p17 (120) and p34 (127), like ribbon surface area (0.36 vs. 0.34 μm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;). PD and PSD morphologies were tightly correlated to each other at individual synapses, more so at p34 than p17, but not to ribbon morphology. These observations suggest that PDs and PSDs mature according to different cues than ribbons, and that ribbon size may be more influenced by cues from the IHC than the surrounding tissue.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Synaptic Neuroscience: Visualizing Synaptic Multi-Protein Patterns of Neuronal Tissue With DNA-Assisted Single-Molecule Localization Microscopy</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsyn.2021.671288</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The development of super-resolution microscopy (SRM) has widened our understanding of biomolecular structure and function in biological materials. Imaging multiple targets within a single area would elucidate their spatial localization relative to the cell matrix and neighboring biomolecules, revealing multi-protein macromolecular structures and their functional co-dependencies. SRM methods are, however, limited to the number of suitable fluorophores that can be imaged during a single acquisition as well as the loss of antigens during antibody washing and restaining for organic dye multiplexing. We report the visualization of multiple protein targets within the pre- and postsynapse in 350–400 nm thick neuronal tissue sections using DNA-assisted single-molecule localization microscopy (SMLM). In a single labeling step, antibodies conjugated with short DNA oligonucleotides visualized multiple targets by sequential exchange of fluorophore-labeled complementary oligonucleotides present in the imaging buffer. This approach avoids potential effects on structural integrity when using multiple rounds of immunolabeling and eliminates chromatic aberration, because all targets are imaged using a single excitation laser wavelength. This method proved robust for multi-target imaging in semi-thin tissue sections with a lateral resolution better than 25 nm, paving the way toward structural cell biology with single-molecule SRM.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Synaptic Plasticity and Oscillations in Alzheimer’s Disease: A Complex Picture of a Multifaceted Disease</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2021.696476</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Brain plasticity is widely accepted as the core neurophysiological basis of memory and is generally defined by activity-dependent changes in synaptic efficacy, such as long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD). By using diverse induction protocols like high-frequency stimulation (HFS) or spike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP), such crucial cognition-relevant plastic processes are shown to be impaired in Alzheimer’s disease (AD). In AD, the severity of the cognitive impairment also correlates with the level of disruption of neuronal network dynamics. Currently under debate, the named amyloid hypothesis points to amyloid-beta peptide 1–42 (Aβ42) as the trigger of the functional deviations underlying cognitive impairment in AD. However, there are missing functional mechanistic data that comprehensively dissect the early subtle changes that lead to synaptic dysfunction and subsequent neuronal network collapse in AD. The convergence of the study of both, mechanisms underlying brain plasticity, and neuronal network dynamics, may represent the most efficient approach to address the early triggering and aberrant mechanisms underlying the progressive clinical cognitive impairment in AD. Here we comment on the emerging integrative roles of brain plasticity and network oscillations in AD research and on the future perspectives of research in this field.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Phosphorylation and O-GlcNAcylation of the PHF-1 Epitope of Tau Protein Induce Local Conformational Changes of the C-Terminus and Modulate Tau Self-Assembly Into Fibrillar Aggregates</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2021.661368</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Phosphorylation of the neuronal microtubule-associated Tau protein plays a critical role in the aggregation process leading to the formation of insoluble intraneuronal fibrils within Alzheimer’s disease (AD) brains. In recent years, other posttranslational modifications (PTMs) have been highlighted in the regulation of Tau (dys)functions. Among these PTMs, the O-β-linked N-acetylglucosaminylation (O-GlcNAcylation) modulates Tau phosphorylation and aggregation. We here focus on the role of the PHF-1 phospho-epitope of Tau C-terminal domain that is hyperphosphorylated in AD (at pS396/pS404) and encompasses S400 as the major O-GlcNAc site of Tau while two additional O-GlcNAc sites were found in the extreme C-terminus at S412 and S413. Using high resolution NMR spectroscopy, we showed that the O-GlcNAc glycosylation reduces phosphorylation of PHF-1 epitope by GSK3β alone or after priming by CDK2/cyclin A. Furthermore, investigations of the impact of PTMs on local conformation performed in small peptides highlight the role of S404 phosphorylation in inducing helical propensity in the region downstream pS404 that is exacerbated by other phosphorylations of PHF-1 epitope at S396 and S400, or O-GlcNAcylation of S400. Finally, the role of phosphorylation and O-GlcNAcylation of PHF-1 epitope was probed in in-vitro fibrillization assays in which O-GlcNAcylation slows down the rate of fibrillar assembly while GSK3β phosphorylation stimulates aggregation counteracting the effect of glycosylation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Broad Influence of Mutant Ataxin-3 on the Proteome of the Adult Brain, Young Neurons, and Axons Reveals Central Molecular Processes and Biomarkers in SCA3/MJD Using Knock-In Mouse Model</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2021.658339</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3/MJD) is caused by CAG expansion mutation resulting in a long polyQ domain in mutant ataxin-3. The mutant protein is a special type of protease, deubiquitinase, which may indicate its prominent impact on the regulation of cellular proteins levels and activity. Yet, the global model picture of SCA3 disease progression on the protein level, molecular pathways in the brain, and neurons, is largely unknown. Here, we investigated the molecular SCA3 mechanism using an interdisciplinary research paradigm combining behavioral and molecular aspects of SCA3 in the knock-in ki91 model. We used the behavior, brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and brain tissue examination to correlate the disease stages with brain proteomics, precise axonal proteomics, neuronal energy recordings, and labeling of vesicles. We have demonstrated that altered metabolic and mitochondrial proteins in the brain and the lack of weight gain in Ki91 SCA3/MJD mice is reflected by the failure of energy metabolism recorded in neonatal SCA3 cerebellar neurons. We have determined that further, during disease progression, proteins responsible for metabolism, cytoskeletal architecture, vesicular, and axonal transport are disturbed, revealing axons as one of the essential cell compartments in SCA3 pathogenesis. Therefore we focus on SCA3 pathogenesis in axonal and somatodendritic compartments revealing highly increased axonal localization of protein synthesis machinery, including ribosomes, translation factors, and RNA binding proteins, while the level of proteins responsible for cellular transport and mitochondria was decreased. We demonstrate the accumulation of axonal vesicles in neonatal SCA3 cerebellar neurons and increased phosphorylation of SMI-312 positive adult cerebellar axons, which indicate axonal dysfunction in SCA3. In summary, the SCA3 disease mechanism is based on the broad influence of mutant ataxin-3 on the neuronal proteome. Processes central in our SCA3 model include disturbed localization of proteins between axonal and somatodendritic compartment, early neuronal energy deficit, altered neuronal cytoskeletal structure, an overabundance of various components of protein synthesis machinery in axons.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: DeepNavNet: Automated Landmark Localization for Neuronavigation</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.670287</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Functional neurosurgery requires neuroimaging technologies that enable precise navigation to targeted structures. Insufficient image resolution of deep brain structures necessitates alignment to a brain atlas to indirectly locate targets within preoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. Indirect targeting through atlas-image registration is innately imprecise, increases preoperative planning time, and requires manual identification of anterior and posterior commissure (AC and PC) reference landmarks which is subject to human error. As such, we created a deep learning-based pipeline that consistently and automatically locates, with submillimeter accuracy, the AC and PC anatomical landmarks within MRI volumes without the need for an atlas. Our novel deep learning pipeline (DeepNavNet) regresses from MRI scans to heatmap volumes centered on AC and PC anatomical landmarks to extract their three-dimensional coordinates with submillimeter accuracy. We collated and manually labeled the location of AC and PC points in 1128 publicly available MRI volumes used for training, validation, and inference experiments. Instantiations of our DeepNavNet architecture, as well as a baseline model for reference, were evaluated based on the average 3D localization errors for the AC and PC points across 311 MRI volumes. Our DeepNavNet model significantly outperformed a baseline and achieved a mean 3D localization error of 0.79 ± 0.33 mm and 0.78 ± 0.33 mm between the ground truth and the detected AC and PC points, respectively. In conclusion, the DeepNavNet model pipeline provides submillimeter accuracy for localizing AC and PC anatomical landmarks in MRI volumes, enabling improved surgical efficiency and accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Identifying Internet Addiction and Evaluating the Efficacy of Treatment Based on Functional Connectivity Density: A Machine Learning Study</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.665578</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Although mounting neuroimaging studies have greatly improved our understanding of the neurobiological mechanism underlying internet addiction (IA), the results based on traditional group-level comparisons are insufficient in guiding individual clinical practice directly. Specific neuroimaging biomarkers are urgently needed for IA diagnosis and the evaluation of therapy efficacy. Therefore, this study aimed to develop support vector machine (SVM) models to identify IA and assess the efficacy of cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) based on unbiased functional connectivity density (FCD). Resting-state fMRI data were acquired from 27 individuals with IA before and after 8-week CBT sessions and 30 demographically matched healthy controls (HCs). The discriminative FCDs were computed as the features of the support vector classification (SVC) model to identify individuals with IA from HCs, and the changes in these discriminative FCDs after treatment were further used as features of the support vector regression (SVR) model to evaluate the efficacy of CBT. Based on the informative FCDs, our SVC model successfully differentiated individuals with IA from HCs with an accuracy of 82.5% and an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.91. Our SVR model successfully evaluated the efficacy of CBT using the FCD change ratio with a correlation efficient of 0.59. The brain regions contributing to IA classification and CBT efficacy assessment were the left inferior frontal cortex (IFC), middle frontal cortex (MFC) and angular gyrus (AG), the right premotor cortex (PMC) and middle cingulate cortex (MCC), and the bilateral cerebellum, orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and superior frontal cortex (SFC). These findings confirmed the FCDs of hyperactive impulsive habit system, hypoactive reflecting system and sensitive interoceptive reward awareness system as potential neuroimaging biomarkers for IA, which might provide objective indexes for the diagnosis and efficacy evaluation of IA.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Changes of Regional Neural Activity Homogeneity in Preclinical Alzheimer’s Disease: Compensation and Dysfunction</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.646414</link>
	<content:encoded>Introduction&lt;p&gt;Subjective cognitive decline (SCD) is the preclinical stage of Alzheimer’s disease and may develop into amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI). Finding suitable biomarkers is the key to accurately identifying SCD. Previous resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) studies on SCD patients showed functional connectivity disorders. Our goal was to explore whether local neurological homogeneity changes in SCD patients, the relationship between these changes and cognitive function, and similarities of neurological homogeneity changes between SCD and aMCI patients.&lt;/p&gt;Materials and Methods&lt;p&gt;37 cases of the healthy control (HC) group, 39 cases of the SCD group, and 28 cases of the aMCI group were included. Participants underwent rs-fMRI examination and a set of neuropsychological test batteries. Regional homogeneity (ReHo) was calculated and compared between groups. ReHo values were extracted from meaningful regions in the SCD group, and the correlation between ReHo values with the performance of neuropsychological tests was analyzed.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Our results showed significant changes in the ReHo among groups. In the SCD group compared with the HC group, part of the parietal lobe, frontal lobe, and occipital lobe showed decreased ReHo, and the temporal lobe, part of the parietal lobe and the frontal lobe showed increased ReHo. The increased area of ReHo was negatively correlated with the decreased area, and was related to decrease on multiple neuropsychological tests performance. Simultaneously, the changed areas of ReHo in SCD patients are similar to aMCI patients, while aMCI group’s neuropsychological test performance was significantly lower than that of the SCD group.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;There are significant changes in local neurological homogeneity in SCD patients, and related to the decline of cognitive function. The increase of neurological homogeneity in the temporal lobe and adjacent area is negatively correlated with cognitive function, reflecting compensation for local neural damage. These changes in local neurological homogeneity in SCD patients are similar to aMCI patients, suggesting similar neuropathy in these two stages. However, the aMCI group’s cognitive function was significantly worse than that of the SCD group, suggesting that this compensation is limited. In summary, regional neural activity homogeneity may be a potential biomarker for identifying SCD and measuring the disease severity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Low-Expressing Synucleinopathy Mouse Models Based on Oligomer-Forming Mutations and C-Terminal Truncation of α-Synuclein</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.643391</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;α-synuclein (αSyn) is the main protein component of Lewy bodies, intracellular inclusions found in the brain of Parkinson’s disease (PD) patients. Neurotoxic αSyn species are broadly modified post-translationally and, in patients with genetic forms of PD, carry genetically encoded amino acid substitutions. Mutations and C-terminal truncation can increase αSyn oligomerization and fibrillization. Although several genetic mouse models based on αSyn mutations and/or truncations exist, there is still a lack of mouse models for synucleinopathies not relying on overexpression. We report here two synucleinopathy mouse models, which are based on a triple alanine to proline mutation and a C-terminal truncation of αSyn, but do not overexpress the mutant protein when compared to the endogenous mouse protein. We knocked hαSyn&lt;sup&gt;TP&lt;/sup&gt; or hαSyn&lt;sup&gt;Δ119&lt;/sup&gt; (h stands for “human”) into the murine αSyn locus. hαSyn&lt;sup&gt;TP&lt;/sup&gt; is a structure-based mutant with triple alanine to proline substitutions that favors oligomers, is neurotoxic and evokes PD-like symptoms in Drosophila melanogaster. hαSyn&lt;sup&gt;Δ119&lt;/sup&gt; lacks 21 amino acids at the C-terminus, favors fibrillary aggregates and occurs in PD. Knocking-in of hαSyn&lt;sup&gt;TP&lt;/sup&gt; or hαSyn&lt;sup&gt;Δ119&lt;/sup&gt; into the murine αSyn locus places the mutant protein under the control of the endogenous regulatory elements while simultaneously disrupting the mαSyn gene. Mass spectrometry revealed that hαSyn&lt;sup&gt;TP&lt;/sup&gt; and hαSyn&lt;sup&gt;Δ119&lt;/sup&gt; mice produced 12 and 10 times less mutant protein, compared to mαSyn in wild type mice. We show phenotypes in 1 and 1.5 years old hαSyn&lt;sup&gt;TP&lt;/sup&gt; and hαSyn&lt;sup&gt;Δ119&lt;/sup&gt; mice, despite the lower levels of hαSyn&lt;sup&gt;TP&lt;/sup&gt; and hαSyn&lt;sup&gt;Δ119&lt;/sup&gt; expression. Direct comparison of the two mouse models revealed many commonalities but also aspects unique to each model. Commonalities included strong immunoactive state, impaired olfaction and motor coordination deficits. Neither model showed DAergic neuronal loss. Impaired climbing abilities at 1 year of age and a deviant gait pattern at 1.5 years old were specific for hαSyn&lt;sup&gt;Δ119&lt;/sup&gt; mice, while a compulsive behavior was exclusively detected in hαSyn&lt;sup&gt;TP&lt;/sup&gt; mice starting at 1 year of age. We conclude that even at very moderate levels of expression the two αSyn variants evoke measurable and progressive deficiencies in mutant mice. The two transgenic mouse models can thus be suitable to study αSyn-variant-based pathology in vivo and test new therapeutic approaches.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Naturalistic stimuli such as movies, music, and spoken and written stories elicit strong emotions and allow brain imaging of emotions in close-to-real-life conditions. Emotions are multi-component phenomena: relevant stimuli lead to automatic changes in multiple functional components including perception, physiology, behavior, and conscious experiences. Brain activity during naturalistic stimuli reflects all these changes, suggesting that parsing emotion-related processing during such complex stimulation is not a straightforward task. Here, I review affective neuroimaging studies that have employed naturalistic stimuli to study emotional processing, focusing especially on experienced emotions. I argue that to investigate emotions with naturalistic stimuli, we need to define and extract emotion features from both the stimulus and the observer.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Dual Task Effects on Speed and Accuracy During Cognitive and Upper Limb Motor Tasks in Adults With Stroke Hemiparesis</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.671541</link>
	<content:encoded>Background&lt;p&gt;Adults with stroke need to perform cognitive–motor dual tasks during their day-to-day activities. However, they face several challenges owing to their impaired motor and cognitive functions.&lt;/p&gt;Objective&lt;p&gt;This case-controlled pilot study investigates the speed and accuracy tradeoffs in adults with stroke while performing cognitive–upper limb motor dual tasks.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;Ten adults with stroke and seven similar-aged controls participated in this study. The participants used a robotic arm for the single motor task and participated in either the serial sevens (S7) or the controlled oral word association test (COWAT) for single-cognitive task. For the dual task, the participants performed the motor and cognitive components simultaneously. Their speed and accuracy were measured for the motor and cognitive tasks, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Two-sample t-statistics indicated that the participants with stroke exhibited a lower motor accuracy in the cross task than in the circle task. The cognitive speed and motor accuracy registered by the subjects with stroke in the dual task significantly decreased. There was a negative linear correlation between motor speed and accuracy in the subjects with stroke when the COWAT task was performed in conjunction with the cross task (ρ = −0.6922, p = 0.0388).&lt;/p&gt;Conclusions&lt;p&gt;This study proves the existence of cognitive–upper limb motor interference in adults with stroke while performing dual tasks, based on the observation that their performance during one or both dual tasks deteriorated compared to that during the single task. Both speed and accuracy were complementary parameters that may indicate clinical effectiveness in motor and cognitive outcomes in individuals with stroke.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Glial Cell Line-Derived Neurotrophic Factor Family Ligands, Players at the Interface of Neuroinflammation and Neuroprotection: Focus Onto the Glia</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.679034</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Well-known effects of neurotrophic factors are related to supporting the survival and functioning of various neuronal populations in the body. However, these proteins seem to also play less well-documented roles in glial cells, thus, influencing neuroinflammation. This article summarizes available data on the effects of glial cell line derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) family ligands (GFLs), proteins providing trophic support to dopaminergic, sensory, motor and many other neuronal populations, in non-neuronal cells contributing to the development and maintenance of neuropathic pain. The paper also contains our own limited data describing the effects of small molecules targeting GFL receptors on the expression of the satellite glial marker IBA1 in dorsal root ganglia of rats with surgery- and diabetes-induced neuropathy. In our experiments activation of GFLs receptors with either GFLs or small molecule agonists downregulated the expression of IBA1 in this tissue of experimental animals. While it can be a secondary effect due to a supportive role of GFLs in neuronal cells, growing body of evidence indicates that GFL receptors are expressed in glial and peripheral immune system cells. Thus, targeting GFL receptors with either proteins or small molecules may directly suppress the activation of glial and immune system cells and, therefore, reduce neuroinflammation. As neuroinflammation is considered to be an important contributor to the process of neurodegeneration these data further support research efforts to modulate the activity of GFL receptors in order to develop disease-modifying treatments for neurodegenerative disorders and neuropathic pain that target both neuronal and glial cells.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroanatomy: Self-Regulation of Cerebral Metabolism and Its Neuroprotective Effect After Hypoxic-Ischemic Injury: Evidence From 1H-MRS</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnana.2021.672412</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H-MRS technology can be used to non-invasively detect the content of cerebral metabolites, to assess the severity of hypoxic-ischemic (HI) injury, and to predict the recovery of compromised neurological function. However, changes to the cerebral self-regulation process after HI are still unclear. This study investigated the changes in cerebral metabolites and the potential relationship with the number of neurons and neural stem/progenitor cells (NSPC) using &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H-MRS, and finally clarifies the self-regulation of cerebral metabolism and neuroprotection after HI injury. Newborn Yorkshire pigs (28 males, 1.0–1.5 kg) aged 3–5 days were used for the HI model in this study. The pigs were randomly divided into the HI group (n = 24) and the control group (n = 4), then the experimental group was subdivided according to different recovery time after HI into the following groups: 0–2 h (n = 4), 2–6 h (n = 4), 6–12 h (n = 4), 12–24 h (n = 4), 24–48 h (n = 4), and 48–72 h (n = 4). Following the HI timepoints, &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H-MRS scans were performed and processed using LCModel software, and brain tissue was immunohistochemically stained for Nestin and NeuN. Immunofluorescence staining of creatine phosphokinase-BB (CK-BB), N-acetylaspartylglutamate synthetase (NAAGS), glutamate carboxypeptidase II (GCP-II), glutamate-cysteine ligase catalytic subunit (GCLC), glutathione synthase (GS), and excitatory amino acid carrier 1 (EAAC1) was then performed. The &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H-MRS results showed that cerebral N-acetylaspartylglutamate (NAAG), glutathione (GSH), and creatine (Cr) content reached their peaks at 12–24 h, which was consistent with the recovery time of hippocampal NSPCs and neurons, indicating a potential neuroprotective effect of NAAG, GSH, and Cr after HI injury.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Long-Term Increase in Cholesterol Is Associated With Better Cognitive Function: Evidence From a Longitudinal Study</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.691423</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Background: Higher visit-to-visit cholesterol has been associated with cognitive decline. However, the association between long-term increase or decrease in cholesterol and cognitive decline remains unclear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: A total of 4,915 participants aged ≥45 years with normal cognition in baseline were included. The participants were divided into four groups, namely low–low, low–high, high–low, and high–high, according to the diagnostic thresholds of total cholesterol (TC), non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (NHDL-C), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) after 4 years of follow-up. Cognitive function was assessed by episodic memory and mental intactness. Binary logistic regression was used to analyse the association of cholesterol variation with cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Among the participants, 979 (19.9%) experienced global cognitive decline. The odds ratio (OR) of global cognitive and memory function decline were remarkably lower in participants in the low–high NHDL-C group than those in the low–low group [OR and 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.50 [0.26–0.95] for global cognitive decline, 0.45 [0.25–0.82] for memory function decline]. The lower OR was also significant in females (OR [95% CI]: 0.38 [0.17–0.87] for global cognitive decline; 0.44 [0.19–0.97] for memory function decline) and participants without cardiovascular disease (OR [95% CI]: 0.31 [0.11–0.87] for global cognitive decline; 0.34 [0.14–0.83] for memory function decline). The increases in other cholesterol were also negatively associated with the risk of cognitive decline although not significantly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: A longitudinal increase in NHDL-C may be protective for cognition in females or individuals without cardiovascular disease.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Regional Spontaneous Neural Activity Alterations in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: A Meta-Analysis of Resting-State Functional MRI Studies</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.678359</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Objective: Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) studies have revealed inconsistent regional spontaneous neural activity alterations in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The aim of our meta-analysis was to identify concordant regional spontaneous neural activity abnormalities in patients with T2DM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: A systematic search was conducted to identify voxel-based rs-fMRI studies comparing T2DM patients with healthy controls. The permutation of subject images seed-based d mapping (SDM) was used to quantitatively estimate the regional spontaneous neural activity abnormalities in patients with T2DM. Metaregression was conducted to examine the associations between clinical characteristics and functional alterations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: A total of 16 studies with 19 datasets including 434 patients with T2DM and 391 healthy controls were included. Patients with T2DM showed hypoactivity in the right medial superior frontal gyrus, right superior temporal gyrus, and left lingual gyrus, whereas hyperactivity in the right cerebellum. Metaregression analysis identified negative correlation between regional activity in the medial superior frontal and anterior cingulate gyri and illness duration of patients with T2DM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: The patterns of regional spontaneous neural activity alterations, characterized by hypoactivity in the medial pre-frontal cortex, visual cortex, and superior temporal gyrus, whereas hyperactivity in the cerebellum, might represent the underlying neuropathological mechanisms of T2DM.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Niacin Enhancement for Parkinson’s Disease: An Effectiveness Trial</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.667032</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;We previously reported that individuals with Parkinson’s disease (PD) present with lower vitamin B3 levels compared to controls. It may be related to carbidopa interaction, defective tryptophan metabolism, and stresses of night sleep disorder. Vitamin B3 is the energy source for all cells by producing NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and NADP&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; in redox reactions of oxidative phosphorylation. Thus, some symptoms of PD such as fatigue, sleep dysfunction, and mood changes may be related to the deficiency of vitamin B3. Here, we conducted an effectiveness trial to determine the effect of 12 months of low-dose niacin (a vitamin B3 derivative) enhancement in PD individuals. An average of 9 ± 6-point improvement in the Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) III (motor) score was observed after 12 months of daily niacin compared to the expected decline in score (effect size = 0.78, 95% CI = 7–11). Additionally, secondary outcome measures improved. Notably, handwriting size increased, fatigue perception decreased, mood improved, frontal beta rhythm during quiet stance increased, and stance postural sway amplitude and range of acceleration decreased. Set shifting, however, as measured by the Trail Making-B test, worsened from 66 to 96 s. Other measures did not change after 12 months, but it is not clear whether this represents a positive benefit of the vitamin. For example, while the quality of night sleep remained the same, there was a trend towards a decrease in the frequency of awakening episodes. These results suggest that niacin enhancement has the potential to maintain or improve quality of life in PD and slow disease progression.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Prognostic Factors in COVID-19 Patients With New Neurological Manifestations: A Retrospective Cohort Study in a Romanian Neurology Department</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.645611</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Introduction: The emerging Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) pandemic caused by Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a serious public health issue due to its rapid spreading, high mortality rate and lack of specific treatment. Given its unpredictable clinical course, risk assessment, and stratification for severity of COVID-19 are required. Apart from serving as admission criteria, prognostic factors might guide future therapeutic strategies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aim: We aimed to compare clinical features and biological parameters between elderly (age ≥ 65 years) and non-elderly (age &amp;lt;65 years) patients with COVID-19 and new neurological symptoms/conditions. We also aimed to determine factors independently associated with all-cause in-hospital mortality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: All consecutive patients with COVID-19 and new neurological symptoms/conditions admitted in our Neurology Department between April 1 and August 23, 2020 were enrolled in this observational retrospective cohort study. Patient characteristics such as demographic data, comorbidities, biological parameters, imaging findings and clinical course were recorded. All-cause in-hospital mortality was the main outcome, whereas COVID-19 severity, hospitalization duration and the levels of supplemental oxygen were the secondary outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: One hundred forty-eight patients were included, out of which 54.1% were women. The average age was 59.84 ± 19.06 years and 47.3% were elderly, the majority having cardiovascular and metabolic comorbidities. In the elderly group, the most frequent neurological symptoms/manifestations responsible for hospitalization were stroke symptoms followed by confusion, whereas in the non-elderly, headache prevailed. The final neurological diagnosis significantly varied between the two groups, with acute cerebrovascular events and acute confusional state in dementia most commonly encountered in the elderly (65.71 and 14.28%, respectively) and secondary headache attributed to SARS-CoV-2 infection often experienced by the non-elderly (38.46%). The elderly had statistically significant higher median values of white blood cell (8,060 vs. 6,090/μL) and neutrophil count (6,060 vs. 4,125/μL), C-reactive protein (29.2 vs. 5.72 mg/L), ferritin (482 vs. 187 mg/dL), fibrinogen (477 vs. 374 mg/dL), D-dimer (1.16 vs. 0.42), prothrombin time (151.15 vs. 13.8/s), aspartate transaminase (26.8 vs. 20.8 U/l), creatinine (0.96 vs. 0.77 mg/dL), and blood urea nitrogen level (51.1 vs. 27.65 mg/dL), as well as lower median value of hemoglobin (13.05 vs. 13.9 g/dL) and lymphocyte count (1,245 vs. 1,670/μL). Moreover, advanced age was significantly associated with more extensive lung involvement (25 vs. 10%) and higher fatality rate (40 vs. 9%). Overall, the mortality rate was 23.6%. Age as well as neutrophil count, C-reactive protein, fibrinogen, and activated partial thromboplastin time levels were independently associated with mortality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: Older age, higher neutrophil count, C-reactive protein, fibrinogen, and activated partial thromboplastin time levels are independent predictors of mortality in COVID-19 patients with new neurological manifestations/conditions at admission.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/69619</link>
	<content:encoded>Human bromodomain-containing BET family members are promising targets for therapy of cancer and immunoinflammatory diseases, but their mechanisms of action and functional redundancies are poorly understood. Bdf1/2, yeast homologues of the human BET factors, were previously proposed to target transcription factor TFIID to acetylated histone H4, analogous to bromodomains that are present within the largest subunit of metazoan TFIID. We investigated the genome-wide roles of Bdf1/2 and found that their important contributions to transcription extend beyond TFIID function, as transcription of many genes is more sensitive to Bdf1/2 than to TFIID depletion. Bdf1/2 co-occupy the majority of yeast promoters and affect preinitiation complex formation through recruitment of TFIID, Mediator and basal transcription factors to chromatin. Surprisingly, we discovered that hypersensitivity of genes to Bdf1/2 depletion results from combined defects in transcription initiation and early elongation, a striking functional similarity to human BET proteins, most notably Brd4. Our results establish Bdf1/2 as critical for yeast transcription and provide important mechanistic insights into the function of BET proteins in all eukaryotes.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: A signal capture and proofreading mechanism for the KDEL-receptor explains selectivity and dynamic range in ER retrieval</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/68380</link>
	<content:encoded>ER proteins of widely differing abundance are retrieved from the Golgi by the KDEL-receptor. Abundant ER proteins tend to have KDEL rather than HDEL signals, whereas ADEL and DDEL are not used in most organisms. Here, we explore the mechanism of selective retrieval signal capture by the KDEL-receptor and how HDEL binds with ten-fold higher affinity than KDEL. Our results show the carboxyl-terminus of the retrieval signal moves along a ladder of arginine residues as it enters the binding pocket of the receptor. Gatekeeper residues D50 and E117 at the entrance of this pocket exclude ADEL and DDEL sequences. D50N/E117Q mutation of human KDEL-receptors changes the selectivity to ADEL and DDEL. However, further analysis of HDEL, KDEL and RDEL-bound receptor structures shows that affinity differences are explained by interactions between the variable -4 H/K/R position of the signal and W120, rather than D50 or E117. Together, these findings explain KDEL-receptor selectivity, and how signal variants increase dynamic range to support efficient ER retrieval of low and high abundance proteins.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: A functional model of adult dentate gyrus neurogenesis</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/66463</link>
	<content:encoded>In adult dentate gyrus neurogenesis, the link between maturation of newborn neurons and their function, such as behavioral pattern separation, has remained puzzling. By analyzing a theoretical model, we show that the switch from excitation to inhibition of the GABAergic input onto maturing newborn cells is crucial for their proper functional integration. When the GABAergic input is excitatory, cooperativity drives the growth of synapses such that newborn cells become sensitive to stimuli similar to those that activate mature cells. When GABAergic input switches to inhibitory, competition pushes the configuration of synapses onto newborn cells towards stimuli that are different from previously stored ones. This enables the maturing newborn cells to code for concepts that are novel, yet similar to familiar ones. Our theory of newborn cell maturation explains both how adult-born dentate granule cells integrate into the preexisting network and why they promote separation of similar but not distinct patterns.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: Apical PAR complex proteins protect against programmed epithelial assaults to create a continuous and functional intestinal lumen</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/64437</link>
	<content:encoded>Sustained polarity and adhesion of epithelial cells is essential for the protection of our organs and bodies, and this epithelial integrity emerges during organ development amidst numerous programmed morphogenetic assaults. Using the developing &lt;i&gt;C. elegans &lt;/i&gt;intestine as an &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; model, we investigated how epithelia maintain their integrity through cell division and elongation to build a functional tube. Live-imaging revealed that apical PAR complex proteins PAR-6/Par6 and PKC-3/aPkc remained apical during mitosis while apical microtubules and microtubule-organizing center (MTOC) proteins were transiently removed. Intestine-specific depletion of PAR-6, PKC-3, and the aPkc regulator CDC-42/Cdc42 caused persistent gaps in the apical MTOC as well as in other apical and junctional proteins after cell division and in non-dividing cells that elongated. Upon hatching, gaps coincided with luminal constrictions that blocked food, and larvae arrested and died. Thus, the apical PAR complex maintains apical and junctional continuity to construct a functional intestinal tube.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.06.17.448894v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Drosophila phototransduction represents a classical model for signaling cascades that culminate with activation of TRP channels. TRP and TRPL are the canonical TRP (TRPC) channels, which are gated by light stimulation of rhodopsin and engagement of Gq and phospholipase C{beta} (PLC). Despite decades of investigation, the mechanism of TRP activation in photoreceptor cells is unresolved. Here, using a combination of genetics, lipidomics and Ca2+ imaging, we found that light increased the levels of an abundant endocannabinoid, 2-linoleoyl glycerol (2-LG) in vivo. The elevation in 2-LG strictly depended on the PLC encoded by norpA. Moreover, this endocannabinoid upregulated TRPC-dependent Ca2+ influx in a heterologous expression system and in dissociated ommatidia from compound eyes. We propose that 2-LG is a physiologically relevant endocannabinoid that activates TRPC channels in photoreceptor cells.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Oligomeric α-Synuclein induces skin degeneration in a reconstructed human epidermis model</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.06.17.448863v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Cell senescence may promote epidermal inflammation and degeneration, termed as inflammaging, which is accompanied by keratinocyte loss, resulting in fine lines of wrinkles. Recent findings showed that healthy elderly skin expresses age- and neuron-related amyloidogenic proteins, such as tau, {beta}-Amyloid34, and -synuclein (-Syn), typically found in patients with neurodegenerative diseases. These proteins form toxic aggregates that trigger inflammatory signals. Herein, we investigated the impact of oligomeric -Syn (O-Syn) on the neurosphere (NP) and the reconstructed human epidermis (RHE) 3D models. First, we found the expression of -Syn, {beta}-Amyloid, and amyloid precursor protein (APP) in the RHE. Second, we challenged the RHE and NP with O-Syn, which decreased RHE regeneration, measured by the percentage of cell proliferation and thickness of the stratum basale, but did not affect NP neurite outgrowth. O-Syn did not decrease the number of human neonatal epidermal keratinocytes (HEKn) but, as seen for the RHE, it also decreased the proliferation of HEKn. We confirmed that the oligomeric, and not the monomeric -Syn species, accounted for the proliferation-decreasing effect. O-Syn also increased the NF-{kappa}B nuclear translocation in HEKn analyzed by nucleus/cytoplasm NF-{kappa}B fluorescence intensity. In addition, O-Syn triggered inflammation in the RHE, by increasing the mRNA levels of IL-1{beta} and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-), and the release of TNF- in a time-dependent manner. These findings show that O-Syn does not affect neurite outgrowth but induces a decrease in keratinocyte proliferation along with epidermal inflammation. With our tridimensional models, we demonstrated that the neurodegenerative protein O-Syn also degenerates the epidermis, drawing attention to the need of target-based screening to prevent and treat the effects of skin aging.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.06.17.448826v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Imagery-based extinction procedures have long been used in the treatments of fear-related conditions. The assumption here is that imagery can substitute for the perceptual stimuli in the extinction process. Yet, experimental validations of this assumption have been limited in number and some have relied exclusively on measures of autonomic reactivity without consideration of conscious feelings of fear. The current investigation sought to assess whether imagery-based exposure could lead to extinction of conditioned fear to the corresponding perceptual stimulus. Conditioned fear responses were measured by both a physiological (i.e., skin conductance response/SCR) and a subjective (i.e., self-reported fear) measure. Participants (N = 56) first underwent perceptual differential fear conditioning, then imagery extinction, then to perceptual extinction. SCR evidence was found for successful fear conditioning, generalization of fear from viewing to imagery, and most importantly, the absence of differential fear after imagery extinction upon re-exposure to the conditioned perceptual stimulus. Self-reported fear confirmed the acquisition and generalization of fear and provided evidence of a significant reduction in differential fear conditioning across extinction. Consistent with clinical evidence of the efficacy of imagery extinction and the existing limited experimental literature, the current study offers support for fear extinction to perceptual stimuli via imagery exposure.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: A Dynamic Efficient Sensory Encoding Approach to Adaptive Tuning in Neural Models of Visual Motion Processing</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.06.17.448823v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>This paper introduces a self-tuning mechanism for capturing rapid adaptation to changing visual stimuli by a population of neurons. Building upon the principles of efficient sensory encoding, we show how neural tuning curve parameters can be continually updated to optimally encode a time-varying distribution of recently detected stimulus values. We implemented this mechanism in a neural model that produces human-like estimates of self-motion direction (i.e., heading) based on optic flow. The parameters of speed-sensitive units were dynamically tuned in accordance with efficient sensory encoding such that the network remained sensitive as the distribution of optic flow speeds varied. In two simulation experiments, we found that model performance with dynamic tuning yielded more accurate, shorter latency heading estimates compared to the model with static tuning. We conclude that dynamic efficient sensory encoding offers a plausible approach for capturing adaptation to varying visual environments in biological visual systems and neural models alike.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.06.17.448817v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>The emergence of degenerative disease after traumatic brain injury is often described as an acceleration of normal age-related processes. Whether similar molecular processes occur in injury and in age is unclear. Here we identify a functionally dynamic and lasting transcriptional response in glia, mediated by the conserved transcription factor AP1. In the early post-TBI period, glial AP1 is essential for recovery, ensuring brain integrity and animal survival. In sharp contrast, chronic AP1 activation promotes human tau pathology, tissue loss, and mortality. We show a similar process activates in healthy brains with age. Importantly, AP1 activity is present in moderate human TBI, decades after injury, and associates with microglial activation and tauopathy. Our data provide key molecular insight into glia, highlighting that the same molecular process drives dynamic and contradictory glia behavior in TBI, first acting to protect but chronically promoting disease.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.06.17.448812v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Diverse GABAergic interneuron microcircuits orchestrate information processing in the brain. Understanding the cellular and molecular composition of these microcircuits, and whether these can be imaged by available non-invasive in vivo methods is crucial for the study of GABAergic neurotransmission in health and disease. Here, we use human gene expression data and state-of-the-art imaging transcriptomics to uncover co-expression patterns between GABAA receptor subunits and interneuron subtype-specific markers, and to decode the cellular and molecular signatures of gold-standard GABA PET radiotracers, [11C]Ro15-4513 and [11C]flumazenil. We find that the interneuron marker somatostatin is co-expressed with GABAA receptor-subunit genes GABRA5 and GABRA2, and their distribution maps onto [11C]Ro15-4513 binding in vivo. In contrast, the interneuron marker parvalbumin co-expressed with more predominant GABAA receptor subunits (GABRA1, GABRB2 and GABRG2), and their distribution tracks [11C]flumazenil binding in vivo. These results have important implications for the non-invasive study of GABAergic microcircuit dysfunction in psychiatric conditions.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Task-Dependent Warping of Semantic Representations During Search for Visual Action Categories</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.06.17.448789v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Object and action perception in cluttered dynamic natural scenes relies on efficient allocation of limited brain resources to prioritize the attended targets over distractors. It has been suggested that during visual search for objects, distributed semantic representation of hundreds of object categories is warped to expand the representation of targets. Yet, little is known about whether and where in the brain visual search for action categories modulates semantic representations. To address this fundamental question, we studied human brain activity recorded via functional magnetic resonance imaging while subjects viewed natural movies and searched for either communication or locomotion actions. We find that attention directed to action categories elicits tuning shifts that warp semantic representations broadly across neocortex, and that these shifts interact with intrinsic selectivity of cortical voxels for target actions. These results suggest that attention serves to facilitate task performance during social interactions by dynamically shifting semantic selectivity towards target actions, and that tuning shifts are a general feature of conceptual representations in the brain.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Dynamic interplay between reward and voluntary attention determines stimulus processing in visual cortex</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.06.17.448788v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Reward enhances stimulus processing in the visual cortex, but the mechanisms through which this effect occurs remain unclear. Reward prospect can both increase the deployment of voluntary attention and increase the salience of previously neutral stimuli. In this study we orthogonally manipulated reward and voluntary attention while human participants performed a global motion detection task. We recorded steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEPs) to simultaneously measure the processing of attended and unattended stimuli linked to different reward probabilities, as they compete for attentional resources. The processing of the high rewarded feature was enhanced independently of voluntary attention, but this gain diminished once rewards were no longer available. Neither the voluntary attention nor the salience account alone can fully explain these results. Instead, we propose how these two accounts can be integrated to allow for the flexible balance between reward-driven increase in salience and voluntary attention.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Presynaptic Mitochondrial Volume and Density Scale with Presynaptic Power Demand</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.06.17.448756v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Stable neural function requires an energy supply that can meet the intense episodic power demands of neuronal activity. The bioenergetic machinery of glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation is highly responsive to such demands, but it must occupy a minimum volume if it is to accommodate these demands. We examined the trade-off between presynaptic power demands and the volume available to the bioenergetic machinery. We quantified the energy demands of six Drosophila motor nerve terminals through direct measurements of neurotransmitter release and Ca2+ entry, and via theoretical estimates of Na+ entry and power demands at rest. Electron microscopy revealed that terminals with the highest power demands contained the greatest volume of mitochondria, indicating that mitochondria are allocated according to presynaptic power demands. In addition, terminals with the greatest power demand-to-volume ratio (~66 nmol/min/uL) harbor the largest mitochondria packed at the greatest density. If we assume sequential and complete oxidation of glucose by glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation, then these mitochondria are required to produce ATP at a rate of 52 nmol/min/uL at rest, rising to 963 during activity. Glycolysis would contribute ATP at 0.24 nmol/min/uL of cytosol at rest, rising to 4.36. These data provide a quantitative framework for presynaptic bioenergetics in situ, and reveal that, beyond an immediate capacity to accelerate ATP output from glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation, over longer time periods presynaptic terminals optimize mitochondrial volume and density to meet power demand.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Can the causal role of brain oscillations be studied through rhythmic brain stimulation?</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.06.17.448493v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Many studies have investigated the causal relevance of brain-oscillations using rhythmic stimulation, either through direct-brain-stimulation or sensory stimulation. Yet, how intrinsic rhythms interact with the externally generated rhythm is largely unknown. We either presented a flickered visual grating or its correspondent unflickered stimulus in a psychophysical change-detection-task to humans, during simultaneous MEG-recordings, to test the effect of visual entrainment on induced gamma- oscillations. Notably, we generally observed a co-existence of the broadband induced gamma-rhythm with the entrained flicker-rhythm (reliably measured in each participant), with the peak frequency of the induced response remaining unaltered in approximately half of participants - relatively independently of their native frequency. However, flicker increased broadband induced-gamma-power, and this was stronger in participants with a native frequency closer to the flicker-frequency (resonance), and led to strong phase-entrainment. Presence of flicker did not change behaviour itself, but profoundly altered brain-behaviour correlates across the sample: whilst broadband induced gamma-oscillations correlated with reaction-times for unflickered stimuli (as known previously), for the flicker, the amplitude of the entrained flicker-rhythm (but no more the induced oscillation) correlated with reaction-times. This, however, strongly depended on whether a participants peak frequency shifted to the entrained rhythm. Our results suggests that rhythmic brain-stimulation leads to a coexistence of two partially independent oscillations with heterogeneous effects across participants on the downstream relevance of these rhythms for behaviour. This may explain the inconsistency of findings related to external entrainment of brain-oscillations and poses further questions towards causal manipulations of brain-oscillations in general.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: No evidence for changes in GABA concentration, functional connectivity, or working memory following continuous theta burst stimulation over dorsolateral prefrontal cortex</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.06.17.448448v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Continuous theta burst stimulation (cTBS) is thought to reduce cortical excitability and modulate functional connectivity, possibly by altering cortical inhibition at the site of stimulation. However, most evidence comes from the motor cortex and it remains unclear whether similar effects occur following stimulation over other brain regions. We assessed whether cTBS over left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex altered gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA) concentration, functional connectivity and brain dynamics at rest, and brain activation and memory performance during a working memory task. Seventeen healthy individuals participated in a randomised, sham-controlled, cross-over experiment. Before and after either real or sham cTBS, magnetic resonance spectroscopy was obtained at rest to measure GABA concentrations, whereas functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was recorded at rest and during an n-back working memory task to measure functional connectivity, brain dynamics (low-frequency fluctuations), and task-related patterns of brain activity. We could not find evidence for changes in GABA concentration (P=0.66, Bayes factor [BF10]=0.07), resting-state functional connectivity (P(FWE)&amp;gt;0.05), resting-state low-frequency fluctuations (P=0.88, BF10=0.04), blood-oxygen level dependent activity during the n-back task (P(FWE) &amp;gt;0.05), or working memory performance (P=0.13, BF10=0.05) following real or sham cTBS. Our findings add to a growing body of literature suggesting the effects of cTBS are highly variable between individuals and question the notion that cTBS is a universal 'inhibitory' paradigm.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Tau (MAPT) drives neuronal dysfunction in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other tauopathies. To dissect the underlying mechanisms, we combined an engineered ascorbic acid peroxidase (APEX) approach with quantitative affinity purification mass spectrometry (AP-MS) followed by proximity ligation assay (PLA) to characterize Tau interactomes modified by neuronal activity and mutations that cause frontotemporal dementia (FTD) in human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived neurons. We established activity-dependent interactions of Tau with presynaptic vesicle proteins during Tau secretion and mapped the exact APEX-tau-induced biotinylated tyrosines to the cytosolic domains of the interacting vesicular proteins. We showed that FTD mutations impair bioenergetics and markedly diminished Tau's interaction with mitochondria proteins, which were downregulated in AD brains of multiple cohorts and correlated with disease severity. These multi-modal and dynamic Tau interactomes with unprecedented spatiotemporal resolution shed novel insights into Tau's role in neuronal function and disease-related processes with potential therapeutic targets to block Tau-mediated pathogenesis.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Brain-imaging research enjoys increasing adoption of supervised machine learning for single-subject disease classification. Yet, the success of these algorithms likely depends on population diversity, including demographic differences and other factors that may be outside of primary scientific interest. Here, we capitalize on propensity scores as a composite confound index to quantify diversity due to major sources of population stratification. We delineate the impact of population heterogeneity on the predictive accuracy and pattern stability in two separate clinical cohorts: the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE, n=297) and the Healthy Brain Network (HBN, n=551). Across various analysis scenarios, our results uncover the extent to which cross-validated prediction performances are interlocked with diversity. The instability of extracted brain patterns attributable to diversity is located preferentially to the default mode network. Our collective findings highlight the limitations of prevailing deconfounding practices in mitigating the full consequences of population diversity.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.06.16.448761v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>The sensitivity of the human visual system is thought to be shaped by environmental statistics. A major endeavour in visual neuroscience, therefore, is to uncover the image statistics that predict perceptual and cognitive function. When searching for targets in natural images, for example, it has recently been proposed that target detection is inversely related to the spatial similarity of the target to its local background. We tested this hypothesis by measuring observers' sensitivity to targets that were blended with natural image backgrounds. Importantly, targets were designed to have a spatial structure that was either similar or dissimilar to the background. Contrary to masking from similarity, however, we found that observers were most sensitive to targets that were most similar to their backgrounds. We hypothesised that a coincidence of phase-alignment between target and background results in a local contrast signal that facilitates detection when target-background similarity is high. We confirmed this prediction in a second experiment. Indeed, we show that, by solely manipulating the phase of a target relative to its background, the target can be rendered easily visible or completely undetectable. Our study thus reveals a set of image statistics that predict how well people can perform the ubiquitous task of detecting an object in clutter.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.06.16.448753v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Neurotransmitter (NT) release is accomplished by a machinery that unclamps fusion in response to calcium and then fuses the synaptic vesicle and plasma membranes. These are often thought of as distinct tasks assigned to non-overlapping components. Vesicle release rates have a power law dependence on [Ca2+] with an exponent of 3-5, long taken to indicate that 3-5 Ca2+ ions bind the calcium sensor Synaptotagmin to trigger release. However, dependencies at low [Ca2+] are inconsistent with simple sequential binding to a single Ca2+ sensor followed by a final fusion step. Here we developed coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations of the NT release machinery accounting for Synaptotagmin-mediated unclamping and SNARE-mediated fusion. Calcium-triggered unclamping and SNARE-mediated fusion emerged from simulations as contemporaneous, coupled processes. Increasing cytosolic [Ca2+], the instantaneous fusion rate increased as SNAREpins were progressively and reversibly released by dissociation of Synaptotagmin-SNAREpin complexes. Simulations reproduced the observed dependence of release rates on [Ca2+], but the power law was unrelated to the number of Ca2+ ions required. Action potential-evoked vesicle release probabilities depended on the number of transiently unclamped SNAREpins, explaining experimental dependencies of release probabilities on both unclamping and membrane-fusing machinery components. These results describe a highly cooperative NT release machinery with intrinsically inseparable unclamping and membrane-fusing functionalities.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.06.16.448746v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Fyn kinase has recently been established as a major upstream regulator of neuroinflammation in PD. This study aimed to determine if inhibition of Fyn kinase could lead to reduced neuroinflammation and improvements in motor and non-motor impairments in an early-stage model of PD. An experimental model of PD was produced using intra-striatal injection (4ul) of the neurotoxin 6-OHDA (5ug/ul). Sprague Dawley rats (n=42) were given either vehicle, 6mg/kg or 12mg/kg of Fyn kinase inhibitor (AZD0530) daily for 32 days via oral gavage and tested on a battery of tasks assessing motor, cognitive and neuropsychiatric outcomes. AZD 0530 administration led to improvement in volitional locomotion and recognition memory, as well as a reduction in depressive-like behaviour. Pathologically, an inflammatory response was observed; however, there were no significant differences in markers of neuroinflammation between treatment groups. Taken together, results indicate a potential therapeutic benefit for use of Fyn kinase inhibition to treat non-motor symptoms of PD, although mechanisms remain to be elucidated.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Event-related potentials (ERPs) associated with the involuntary orientation of (bottom-up) attention towards an unexpected sound are of larger amplitude in high dream recallers (HR) than in low dream recallers (LR) during passive listening, suggesting different attentional functioning. We measured bottom-up and top-down attentional performance and their cerebral correlates in 18 HR (11 women, age = 22.7 +/- 4.1 years, dream recall frequency = 5.3 +/- 1.3 days with a dream recall per week) and 19 LR (10 women, age = 22.3, DRF = 0.2 +/- 0.2) using EEG and the Competitive Attention Task. Between-group differences were found in ERPs but not in behavior. The results confirm that HR present larger ERPs to distracting sounds than LR during active listening, suggesting enhanced bottom-up processing of irrelevant sounds. HR also presented a larger contingent negative variation during target expectancy and a larger P3b response to target sounds than LR, speaking for an enhanced recruitment of top-down attention. Enhancement of both top-down and bottom-up processes in HR leads to an apparently preserved attentional balance since similar performance were observed in the two groups. Therefore, different neurophysiological profiles can result in similar cognitive performance, with some profiles possibly costlier in term of resource/energy consumption.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Efficient processing of visual environment necessitates the integration of incoming sensory evidence with concurrent contextual inputs and mnemonic content from our past experiences. To delineate how this integration takes place in the brain, we studied modulations of feedback neural patterns in non-stimulated areas of the early visual cortex in humans (i.e., V1 and V2). Using functional magnetic resonance imaging and multivariate pattern analysis, we show that both, concurrent contextual and time-distant mnemonic information, coexist in V1/V2 as feedback signals. The extent to which mnemonic information is reinstated in V1/V2 depends on whether the information is retrieved episodically or semantically. These results demonstrate that our stream of visual experience contains not just information from the visual surrounding, but also memory-based predictions internally generated in the brain.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Task-optimized deep convolutional neural networks are the most quantitatively accurate models of the primate ventral visual stream. However, such networks are implausible as a model of the mouse visual system because mouse visual cortex has a known shallower hierarchy and the supervised objectives these networks are typically trained with are likely neither ethologically relevant in content nor in quantity. Here we develop shallow network architectures that are more consistent with anatomical and physiological studies of mouse visual cortex than current models. We demonstrate that hierarchically shallow architectures trained using contrastive objective functions applied to visual-acuity-adapted images achieve neural prediction performance that exceed those of the same architectures trained in a supervised manner and result in the most quantitatively accurate models of the mouse visual system. Moreover, these models' neural predictivity significantly surpasses those of supervised, deep architectures that are known to correspond well to the primate ventral visual stream. Finally, we derive a novel measure of inter-animal consistency, and show that the best models closely match this quantity across visual areas.

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Time-resolved multivariate pattern analysis of infant EEG data</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.06.16.448720v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Time-resolved multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA), a popular technique for analyzing magneto- and electro-encephalography (M/EEG) neuroimaging data, quantifies the extent and time-course by which neural representations support the discrimination of relevant stimuli dimensions. As EEG is widely used for infant neuroimaging, time-resolved MVPA of infant EEG data is a particularly promising tool for infant cognitive neuroscience. MVPA methods have recently been applied to common infant imaging methods such as EEG and fNIRS. In this tutorial, we provide and describe code to implement time-resolved, within-subject MVPA with infant EEG data. A pipeline for time-resolved MVPA based on linear SVM classification is described and implemented with accompanying code in both Matlab and Python. Results from a test dataset indicated that in both infants and adults this method reliably produced above chance classification accuracy. Extensions of the core pipeline are presented including both geometric- and accuracy-based representational similarity analysis, implemented in Python. Common choices of implementation are presented and discussed. As the amount of artifact-free EEG data contributed by each participant is lower in studies of infants than in studies of children and adults, we also explore and discuss the impact of varying participant-level inclusion thresholds on resulting MVPA findings in these datasets.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Effects of tDCS on the attentional blink revisited: A statistical evaluation of a replication attempt</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.06.16.448698v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>The attentional blink (AB) phenomenon reveals a bottleneck of human information processing: the second of two targets is often missed when they are presented in rapid succession among distractors. A recent study by London &amp;amp; Slagter (Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience, 33, 756 to 768, 2021) showed that the size of the AB can be changed by applying transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (lDLPFC). Although AB size at the group level remained unchanged, the effects of anodal and cathodal tDCS were negatively correlated: if a given individuals AB size decreased from baseline during anodal tDCS, their AB size would increase during cathodal tDCS, and vice versa. Here, we attempted to replicate this finding. Like London &amp;amp; Slagter, we found no group effects of tDCS, but also no longer found a significant negative correlation. We present a series of statistical measures of replication success, all of which confirm that both studies are not in agreement. First, the correlation here is significantly smaller than a conservative estimate of the original correlation. Second, the difference between the correlations is greater than expected due to sampling error, and our data are more consistent with a zero effect than with the original estimate. Finally, the overall effect when combining both studies is small and not significant. Our findings thus indicate that the effects of lDPLFC tDCS on the AB are less substantial than observed by London &amp;amp; Slagter (2021). Although this should be quite a common scenario, null findings can be difficult to interpret and are still under represented in the brain stimulation and cognitive neuroscience literatures. An important auxiliary goal of this paper is therefore to provide a tutorial for other researchers, to maximize the evidential value from null findings.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.06.16.448690v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Genetically encoded optical sensors and advancements in microscopy instrumentation and techniques have revolutionized the scientific toolbox available for probing complex biological processes such as release of specific neurotransmitters. Most genetically encoded optical sensors currently used are based on fluorescence and have been highly successful tools for single-cell imaging in superficial brain regions. However, there remains a need to develop new tools for reporting neuronal activity in vivo within deeper structures without the need for hardware such as lenses or fibers to be implanted within the brain. Our approach to this problem is to replace the fluorescent elements of the existing biosensors with bioluminescent elements. This eliminates the need of external light sources to illuminate the sensor and overcomes several drawbacks of fluorescence imaging such as limited light penetration depth, excitation scattering, and tissue heating that are all associated with the external light needed for fluorescence imaging. Here we report the development of the first genetically encoded neurotransmitter indicators based on bioluminescent light emission. These probes exhibit robust changes in light output in response to extracellular presentation of the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate. We expect this new approach to neurotransmitter indicator design to enable the engineering of specific bioluminescent probes for multiple additional neurotransmitters in the future, ultimately allowing neuroscientists to monitor activity associated with a specific neurotransmitter as it relates to behavior in a variety of psychiatric disorders, among many other applications.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.06.16.448688v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Perceptual adaptation is often studied within a single sense. However, our experience of the world is naturally multisensory. Here, we investigated cross-sensory (visual vestibular) adaptation of self motion perception. It was previously found that relatively long visual self-motion stimuli (greater or equal to 15s) are required to adapt subsequent vestibular perception, and that shorter duration stimuli do not elicit cross sensory (visual vestibular) adaptation. However, it is not known whether several discrete short duration stimuli may lead to cross sensory adaptation (even when their sum, if presented together, would be too short to elicit cross sensory adaptation). This would suggest that the brain monitors and adapts to supra modal statistics of events in the environment. Here we investigated whether cross sensory (visual vestibular) adaptation occurs after experiencing several short (1s) self-motion stimuli. Forty five participants discriminated the headings of a series of self motion stimuli. To expose adaptation effects, the trials were grouped in 140 batches, each comprising three prior trials, with headings biased to the right or left, followed by a single unbiased test trial. Right, and left biased batches were interleaved pseudo randomly. We found significant adaptation in both cross sensory conditions (visual prior and vestibular test trials, and vice versa), as well as both unisensory conditions (when prior and test trials were of the same modality, either visual or vestibular). Fitting the data with a logistic regression model revealed that adaptation was elicited by the prior stimuli (not prior choices). These results suggest that the brain monitors supra modal statistics of events in the environment, even for short duration stimuli, leading to functional (supra modal) adaptation of perception.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Rhes Deletion Prevents Age-Dependent Selective Motor Deficits and Reduces Phosphorylation of S6K in Huntington Disease Hdh150Q(CAG) Knock-In Mice.</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.06.16.448681v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Huntington disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative disease caused by a CAG trinucleotide repeat expansion in the huntingtin (mHTT) protein. This expansion is thought to promote striatal atrophy by a combination of cell- and non-cell-autonomous processes, but the mechanisms are unclear. Previous evidence suggests that the striatal-enriched SUMO E3-like protein Rhes could play a pathological role in HD. Rhes interacts with, and SUMOylates, mHTT and promotes toxicity and Rhes deletion ameliorates the HD phenotype in cell and severe mouse models of HD. However, the effect of Rhes on less severe knock-in models of HD remains obscure. Here, we report that a Hdh(CAG)150 knock-in murine model of HD showed diminished body weight but no changes in locomotor coordination or activity at 80 and 100 weeks of age. Conversely, Rhes deletion did not impact the body weight or behaviors but caused a significant reduction of gait, clasping, and tremor behaviors in Hdh150Q/150Q mice. Rhes deletion did not affect the loss of striatal DARPP-32 protein levels but abrogated the hyper ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta-1 (S6K) phosphorylation, which is a substrate for a mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling, in Hdh(CAG)150 mice. Interestingly, striatal Rhes protein levels were downregulated in the striatum of Hdh(CAG)150 mice, indicating a potential compensatory mechanisms at work. Thus, Rhes deletion prevents age-dependent behavioral deficits and diminishes hyperactive mTORC1-S6K signaling in Hdh(CAG)150 knock-in mice HD striatum.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Area-specific axonal projections from the mammalian thalamus shape unique cellular organization in target areas in the adult neocortex. How these axons control neurogenesis and early neuronal fate specification is poorly understood. By using mutant mice lacking the majority of thalamocortical axons, we show that these axons increase the number of layer 4 neurons in primary sensory areas by enhancing neurogenesis and shifting the fate of superficial layer neurons to that of layer 4 by the neonatal stage. Part of these area-specific roles are played by the thalamus-derived molecule, VGF. Our work reveals that extrinsic cues from sensory thalamic projections have an early role in the formation of cortical cytoarchitecture by enhancing the production and specification of layer 4 neurons.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.06.16.448657v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Restoration of functional connectivity is a major contributor to functional recovery after stroke. We investigated the role of reactive astrocytes in functional connectivity and recovery after photothrombotic stroke in mice with attenuated reactive gliosis (GFAP-/-Vim-/-). Infarct volume and longitudinal functional connectivity changes were determined by in vivo T2-weighted MRI and resting-state functional MRI. Sensorimotor function was assessed with behavioral tests, and glial and neural plasticity responses were quantified in the peri-infarct region. Four weeks after stroke, GFAP-/-Vim-/- mice showed impaired recovery of sensorimotor function and aberrant restoration of global neuronal connectivity. These mice also exhibited maladaptive plasticity responses, shown by higher number of lost and newly formed functional connections between primary and secondary targets of cortical stroke regions and increased peri-infarct expression of the axonal plasticity marker Gap43. We conclude that reactive astrocytes are required for optimal recovery-promoting plasticity responses after ischemic stroke.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.06.16.448650v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>INTRODUCTION: The aim of this study was to identify the histopathological correlates of MRI cortical atrophy in (a)typical Alzheimer's disease (AD) donors. METHODS: 19 AD and 10 control donors underwent post-mortem in-situ 3T-3DT1-MRI, from which cortical thickness was calculated. Upon subsequent autopsy, 21 cortical brain regions were selected and immunostained for amyloid-beta, phosphorylated-tau, and reactive microglia. MRI-pathology associations were assessed using linear mixed models. Post-mortem MRI was compared to ante-mortem MRI when available. RESULTS: Higher amyloid-beta load weakly correlated with a higher cortical thickness globally. Phosphorylated-tau strongly correlated with cortical atrophy in temporo-frontal regions. Reactive microglia load strongly correlated with cortical atrophy in the parietal region. Post-mortem scans showed high concordance with ante-mortem scans acquired &amp;lt;1 year before death. DISCUSSION: Distinct histopathological markers differently correlate with cortical atrophy, highlighting their different roles in the neurodegenerative process. This study contributes in understanding the pathological underpinnings of MRI atrophy patterns.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.06.16.448637v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>It is largely assumed that the fish retina shows continuous and active proliferative and neurogenic activity throughout life. This is based on studies in teleost models. However, work in lampreys and cartilaginous fishes has shown that proliferative and mitotic activity is almost absent in adult individuals of these ancient fish groups. Interestingly, when deepening in the teleost literature one finds that claims of a highly active and continuous proliferation in the adult retina are based on studies in which proliferation was not quantified in a comparative way at different life stages or was mainly studied in juveniles/young adults. Here, we performed a systematic and comparative study of the constitutive proliferative activity of the retina from early developing (2 days post-fertilization) to aged (up to 3-4 years post-fertilization) zebrafish. Cell proliferation was analysed by using immunofluorescence against pH3 (marker of mitotic cells) and PCNA (marker of proliferating cells). We observed a decline in cell proliferation in the whole retina with ageing, even despite the occurrence of a wave of secondary proliferation during sexual maturation. Interestingly, during this wave of secondary proliferation the distribution of proliferating and mitotic cells changes from the inner to the outer nuclear layer in the central retina. Importantly, in aged zebrafish there is a virtual disappearance of mitotic activity. Our results showing a decline in proliferative activity of the zebrafish retina with ageing are of crucial importance since it is largely assumed that the fish retina grows continuously throughout life from progenitor cells located in the periphery.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.06.16.448227v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Peripheral inputs to the brain continuously shape its function and adjust non-emotional memory, but the mechanisms involved are not fully understood. Cannabinoid type-1 receptors (CB1Rs), widely distributed in the organism, are well recognized players in memory performance and their systemic modulation significantly influence memory function. By assessing non-emotional memory in mice, we found a relevant role of peripheral CB1R in memory persistence. Indeed, peripherally restricted CB1R antagonist AM6545 showed a mnemonic effect occluded in adrenalectomized mice, after peripheral adrenergic blockade, or when vagus nerve was chemogenetically inhibited. Genetic CB1R deletion in dopamine {beta}-hydroxylase-expressing cells enhanced memory persistence, supporting a role of peripheral CB1Rs modulating the adrenergic tone. Notably, while brain connectivity was slightly affected by peripheral CB1R inhibition, locus coeruleus activity and extracellular norepinephrine in the hippocampus, were increased, and intra-hippocampal {beta}-adrenergic blockade prevented AM6545 mnemonic effects. Together, we disclose a novel peripheral mechanism relevant for non-emotional memory persistence modulation.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>We generated homozygous mice that have a base pair missense mutation (208T &amp;gt; C) (Cdh23erl2/erl2) and a single base pair deletion (235G) (Cdh23V2J2/V2J2) in the Cdh23 gene at exon 5 on the CBA/CaJ background using the CRISPR/Cas9 system.

Moreover, our study confirms that the Cdh23 gene is essential for normal hearing and balance.

Abstract
Different mutations in the cadherin 23 (CDH23) gene in different genetic backgrounds have been linked to either syndromic or nonsyndromic forms of deafness in humans. We previously reported a progressive hearing loss (HL) mouse model, the Cdh23erl/erl mouse, which carries a 208T &amp;gt; C mutation causing an amino acid substitution at S70P in C57BL/6J mice. To investigate the differences in Cdh23 mutation‐related HL in different genetic backgrounds, we used the CRISPR/Cas9 system to generate homozygous mice in the CBA/CaJ background that have the same base pair missense mutation (208T &amp;gt; C) (Cdh23erl2/erl2) as Cdh23erl/erl mice in the C57BL/6J background or a single base pair deletion (235G) (Cdh23V2J2/V2J2) in the Cdh23 gene at exon 5. The two mutant mice exhibit hearing impairment across a broad range of frequencies. The progression of HL in Cdh23erl2/erl2 mice is slower than that in Cdh23erl/erl mice. We also found structural abnormalities in the stereocilia of cochlear hair cells in Cdh23erl2/erl2 and Cdh23V2J2/V2J2 mice. Cdh23V2J2/V2J2 mice show signs of vestibular dysfunction in open field behavior and swimming tests. In addition, we observed hair bundle defects in vestibular hair cells in Cdh23V2J2/V2J2 mice. Our results suggest an interaction between the erl locus and the C57BL/6J background that exacerbates HL in Cdh23erl/erl mice. Moreover, our study confirms that the Cdh23 gene is essential for normal hearing and balance. These two novel mutant mouse strains provide excellent models for studying CDH23 mutation‐related deafness in humans.</content:encoded>

Original data on healthy preterm adolescents who were administered visuo‐spatial tasks support female disadvantage in the visuo‐cognitive domain.

Abstract
This article presents a revision of the literature regarding the influence of sex differences on the recovery and long‐term behavioral and cognitive outcomes of preterm children. After initial discussion of some methodological concerns, the literature regarding the concept of “male disadvantage,” which is often used when talking about early neurological and psychomotor outcomes in preterm children, is presented. Subsequently, the literature data on sex‐related differences in preterm children are discussed, focusing on their influence on the developmental pathways of cognition, language, executive function, behavior and affect, and response to rehabilitation therapies. Finally, evidence about brain structural and connectivity correlates of sex differences in the brain of preterm survivors is taken into account. Although visuo‐spatial and visuo‐perceptual functioning is widely studied in the preterm child and is strongly sex specific, little to no data are available regarding male–female differences in preterm children and the interaction effect between sex and preterm birth. For this reason, original data analyses of male–female differences in visuo‐spatial performance from a small sample of preterm children are also presented.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Our analyses revealed lower concentration of NAA in the left DLPFC in participants with SHE compared with controls. These findings shed light on some of the neurobiochemical mechanisms of SHE and enrich our knowledge about MRI‐negative SHE patients.

Abstract
Sleep‐related hypermotor epilepsy (SHE) is a focal epilepsy whose neurobiological underpinnings remain poorly understood. The present study aimed to identify possible neurochemical alterations in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) in participants with SHE using proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H MRS). Thirty‐nine participants with SHE (mean age, 30.7 years ± 11.3 [standard deviation], 24 men) and 59 controls (mean age, 29.4 years ± 10.4, 29 men) were consecutively and prospectively recruited and underwent brain magnetic resonance imaging and 1H MRS in the bilateral DLPFCs. Brain concentrations of metabolites, including N‐acetyl aspartate (NAA), myo‐inositol (mI), choline, creatine, the sum of glutamate and glutamine, glutathione (GSH) and γ‐aminobutyric acid, were estimated with LCModel and corrected for the partial volume effect of cerebrospinal fluid using tissue segmentation. ANCOVA analyses revealed lower concentration of NAA in the left DLPFC in participants with SHE compared with controls. A significant difference of NAA concentration between DLPFC in the two hemispheres (left &amp;gt; right) was observed only in the control group. We further confirmed a higher GSH concentration in men than in women in SHE participants, which probably indicates that men are more susceptible to this disease. The mI concentration in the right DLPFC was negatively correlated with epilepsy duration. This study demonstrates that DLPFC is an important brain region involved in the pathophysiology of SHE, in which both neurons and astrocytes appear impaired, and the elevated GSH level may suggest an abnormality related to oxidative stress.</content:encoded>

Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) is characterized by progressive neurodegeneration and cognitive impairment. Synaptic dysfunction is an established early symptom, which correlates strongly with cognitive decline, and is hypothesised to mediate the diverse neuronal network abnormalities observed in AD. However, how synaptic dysfunction contributes to network pathology and cognitive impairment in AD remains elusive. Here, we present a grid-cell-to-place-cell transformation model of long-term CA1 place cell dynamics to interrogate the effect of synaptic loss on network function and environmental representation. Synapse loss modelled after experimental observations in the APP/PS1 mouse model was found to induce firing rate alterations and place cell abnormalities that have previously been observed in AD mouse models, including enlarged place fields and lower across-session stability of place fields. Our results support the hypothesis that synaptic dysfunction underlies cognitive deficits, and demonstrate how impaired environmental representation may arise in the early stages of AD. We further propose that dysfunction of excitatory and inhibitory inputs to CA1 pyramidal cells may cause distinct impairments in place cell function, namely reduced stability and place map resolution.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/TTutxNiPYhY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

We describe an approach for integrating distance restraints from Double Electron-Electron Resonance (DEER) spectroscopy into Rosetta with the purpose of modeling alternative protein conformations from an initial experimental structure. Fundamental to this approach is a multilateration algorithm that harnesses sets of interconnected spin label pairs to identify optimal rotamer ensembles at each residue that fit the DEER decay in the time domain. Benchmarked relative to data analysis packages, the algorithm yields comparable distance distributions with the advantage that fitting the DEER decay and rotamer ensemble optimization are coupled. We demonstrate this approach by modeling the protonation-dependent transition of the multidrug transporter PfMATE to an inward facing conformation with a deviation to the experimental structure of less than 2Å C&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt; RMSD. By decreasing spin label rotamer entropy, this approach engenders more accurate Rosetta models that are also more closely clustered, thus setting the stage for more robust modeling of protein conformational changes.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/92OznlMzWTY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: A network modelling approach to assess non-pharmaceutical disease controls in a worker population: An application to SARS-CoV-2</title>

As part of a concerted pandemic response to protect public health, businesses can enact non-pharmaceutical controls to minimise exposure to pathogens in workplaces and premises open to the public. Amendments to working practices can lead to the amount, duration and/or proximity of interactions being changed, ultimately altering the dynamics of disease spread. These modifications could be specific to the type of business being operated. We use a data-driven approach to parameterise an individual-based network model for transmission of SARS-CoV-2 amongst the working population, stratified into work sectors. The network is comprised of layered contacts to consider the risk of spread in multiple encounter settings (workplaces, households, social and other). We analyse several interventions targeted towards working practices: mandating a fraction of the population to work from home; using temporally asynchronous work patterns; and introducing measures to create ‘COVID-secure’ workplaces. We also assess the general role of adherence to (or effectiveness of) isolation and test and trace measures and demonstrate the impact of all these interventions across a variety of relevant metrics. The progress of the epidemic can be significantly hindered by instructing a significant proportion of the workforce to work from home. Furthermore, if required to be present at the workplace, asynchronous work patterns can help to reduce infections when compared with scenarios where all workers work on the same days, particularly for longer working weeks. When assessing COVID-secure workplace measures, we found that smaller work teams and a greater reduction in transmission risk reduced the probability of large, prolonged outbreaks. Finally, following isolation guidance and engaging with contact tracing without other measures is an effective tool to curb transmission, but is highly sensitive to adherence levels. In the absence of sufficient adherence to non-pharmaceutical interventions, our results indicate a high likelihood of SARS-CoV-2 spreading widely throughout a worker population. Given the heterogeneity of demographic attributes across worker roles, in addition to the individual nature of controls such as contact tracing, we demonstrate the utility of a network model approach to investigate workplace-targeted intervention strategies and the role of test, trace and isolation in tackling disease spread.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Ew1J7OITDFc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Three-dimensional topology optimization model to simulate the external shapes of bone</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/1KwC2dsWD7s/article</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Misaki Sakashita, Shintaro Yamasaki, Kentaro Yaji, Atsushi Kawamoto, Shigeru Kondo&lt;/p&gt;

Elucidation of the mechanism by which the shape of bones is formed is essential for understanding vertebrate development. Bones support the body of vertebrates by withstanding external loads, such as those imposed by gravity and muscle tension. Many studies have reported that bone formation varies in response to external loads. An increased external load induces bone synthesis, whereas a decreased external load induces bone resorption. This relationship led to the hypothesis that bone shape adapts to external load. In fact, by simulating this relationship through topology optimization, the internal trabecular structure of bones can be successfully reproduced, thereby facilitating the study of bone diseases. In contrast, there have been few attempts to simulate the external structure of bones, which determines vertebrate morphology. However, the external shape of bones may be reproduced through topology optimization because cells of the same type form both the internal and external structures of bones. Here, we constructed a three-dimensional topology optimization model to attempt the reproduction of the external shape of teleost vertebrae. In teleosts, the internal structure of the vertebral bodies is invariable, exhibiting an hourglass shape, whereas the lateral structure supporting the internal structure differs among species. Based on the anatomical observations, we applied different external loads to the hourglass-shaped part. The simulations produced a variety of three-dimensional structures, some of which exhibited several structural features similar to those of actual teleost vertebrae. In addition, by adjusting the geometric parameters, such as the width of the hourglass shape, we reproduced the variation in the teleost vertebrae shapes. These results suggest that a simulation using topology optimization can successfully reproduce the external shapes of teleost vertebrae. By applying our topology optimization model to various bones of vertebrates, we can understand how the external shape of bones adapts to external loads.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/1KwC2dsWD7s&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

We present ten simple rules that support converting a legacy vocabulary—a list of terms available in a print-based glossary or in a table not accessible using web standards—into a FAIR vocabulary. Various pathways may be followed to publish the FAIR vocabulary, but we emphasise particularly the goal of providing a globally unique resolvable identifier for each term or concept. A standard representation of the concept should be returned when the individual web identifier is resolved, using SKOS or OWL serialised in an RDF-based representation for machine-interchange and in a web-page for human consumption. Guidelines for vocabulary and term metadata are provided, as well as development and maintenance considerations. The rules are arranged as a stepwise recipe for creating a FAIR vocabulary based on the legacy vocabulary. By following these rules you can achieve the outcome of converting a legacy vocabulary into a standalone FAIR vocabulary, which can be used for unambiguous data annotation. In turn, this increases data interoperability and enables data integration.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/v57TH_5xTuQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Blood flow governs transport of oxygen and nutrients into tissues. Hypoxic tissues secrete VEGFs to promote angiogenesis during development and in tissue homeostasis. In contrast, tumors enhance pathologic angiogenesis during growth and metastasis, suggesting suppression of tumor angiogenesis could limit tumor growth. In line with these observations, various factors have been identified to control vessel formation in the last decades. However, their impact on the vascular transport properties of oxygen remain elusive. Here, we take a computational approach to examine the effects of vascular branching on blood flow in the growing vasculature. First of all, we reconstruct a 3D vascular model from the 2D confocal images of the growing vasculature at postnatal day 5 (P5) mouse retina, then simulate blood flow in the vasculatures, which are obtained from the gene targeting mouse models causing hypo- or hyper-branching vascular formation. Interestingly, hyper-branching morphology attenuates effective blood flow at the angiogenic front, likely promoting tissue hypoxia. In contrast, vascular hypo-branching enhances blood supply at the angiogenic front of the growing vasculature. Oxygen supply by newly formed blood vessels improves local hypoxia and decreases VEGF expression at the angiogenic front during angiogenesis. Consistent with the simulation results indicating improved blood flow in the hypo-branching vasculature, VEGF expression around the angiogenic front is reduced in those mouse retinas. Conversely, VEGF expression is enhanced in the angiogenic front of hyper-branching vasculature. Our results indicate the importance of detailed flow analysis in evaluating the vascular transport properties of branching morphology of the blood vessels.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/_KLELEfXE_8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Biology: Neuronal selectivity to complex vocalization features emerges in the superficial layers of primary auditory cortex</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~3/_owryd6p9aM/article</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Pilar Montes-Lourido, Manaswini Kar, Stephen V. David, Srivatsun Sadagopan&lt;/p&gt;

Early in auditory processing, neural responses faithfully reflect acoustic input. At higher stages of auditory processing, however, neurons become selective for particular call types, eventually leading to specialized regions of cortex that preferentially process calls at the highest auditory processing stages. We previously proposed that an intermediate step in how nonselective responses are transformed into call-selective responses is the detection of informative call features. But how neural selectivity for informative call features emerges from nonselective inputs, whether feature selectivity gradually emerges over the processing hierarchy, and how stimulus information is represented in nonselective and feature-selective populations remain open question. In this study, using unanesthetized guinea pigs (GPs), a highly vocal and social rodent, as an animal model, we characterized the neural representation of calls in 3 auditory processing stages—the thalamus (ventral medial geniculate body (vMGB)), and thalamorecipient (L4) and superficial layers (L2/3) of primary auditory cortex (A1). We found that neurons in vMGB and A1 L4 did not exhibit call-selective responses and responded throughout the call durations. However, A1 L2/3 neurons showed high call selectivity with about a third of neurons responding to only 1 or 2 call types. These A1 L2/3 neurons only responded to restricted portions of calls suggesting that they were highly selective for call features. Receptive fields of these A1 L2/3 neurons showed complex spectrotemporal structures that could underlie their high call feature selectivity. Information theoretic analysis revealed that in A1 L4, stimulus information was distributed over the population and was spread out over the call durations. In contrast, in A1 L2/3, individual neurons showed brief bursts of high stimulus-specific information and conveyed high levels of information per spike. These data demonstrate that a transformation in the neural representation of calls occurs between A1 L4 and A1 L2/3, leading to the emergence of a feature-based representation of calls in A1 L2/3. Our data thus suggest that observed cortical specializations for call processing emerge in A1 and set the stage for further mechanistic studies.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/_owryd6p9aM&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Abstract
It is well established that in most species, the hippocampus shows extensive postnatal development. This delayed maturation has a number of implications, which can be thought of in three categories. First, the late maturation has the direct effect of depriving the developing organism of at least some of the functions of the hippocampus, in particular place learning, context coding and in humans, episodic memory. Second, such learning that does occur very early in life, prior to hippocampal maturation, will largely bear the imprint and properties of those brain systems that, unlike the hippocampus, are fully functional early in life. Third, the active state of development of hippocampus in the first weeks and months of life render this structure susceptible to disruption by environmental and/or chromosomal factors. In this article, I discuss my efforts, with many colleagues over the past 40 years, to understand each of these implications.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Abstract
Anosognosia and impairment of insight are characteristic features of Alzheimer's disease (AD), which can lead to delays in appropriate medical care and significant family discord. The default mode network (DMN), a distributed but highly connected network of brain regions more active during rest than during task, is integrally involved in awareness. DMN dysfunction is common in AD, and disrupted communication between memory‐related and self‐related DMN networks is associated with anosognosia in AD patients. In addition, the temporoparietal junction (TPJ) is a key region of the “social brain” and also contributes to representations of the self. The exact classification of the TPJ within the DMN is unclear, though connections between the TPJ and DMN have been highlighted in multiple avenues of research. Here we discuss the relationship between the TPJ, DMN, and AD, as well as the potential involvement of the TPJ in anosognosia in AD. We review past and present findings to raise attention to the TPJ, with a specific emphasis on neuroimaging technologies which suggest a pivotal role of the TPJ within large‐scale brain networks linked to anosognosia in AD.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.08314</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Imitation learning enables high-fidelity, vision-based learning of policies
within rich, photorealistic environments. However, such techniques often rely
on traditional discrete-time neural models and face difficulties in
generalizing to domain shifts by failing to account for the causal
relationships between the agent and the environment. In this paper, we propose
a theoretical and experimental framework for learning causal representations
using continuous-time neural networks, specifically over their discrete-time
counterparts. We evaluate our method in the context of visual-control learning
of drones over a series of complex tasks, ranging from short- and long-term
navigation, to chasing static and dynamic objects through photorealistic
environments. Our results demonstrate that causal continuous-time deep models
can perform robust navigation tasks, where advanced recurrent models fail.
These models learn complex causal control representations directly from raw
visual inputs and scale to solve a variety of tasks using imitation learning.

	<title>arXiv: Quantitative Biology: Neurons and Cognition: Natural continual learning: success is a journey, not (just) a destination. (arXiv:2106.08085v1 [cs.LG])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.08085</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Biological agents are known to learn many different tasks over the course of
their lives, and to be able to revisit previous tasks and behaviors with little
to no loss in performance. In contrast, artificial agents are prone to
'catastrophic forgetting' whereby performance on previous tasks deteriorates
rapidly as new ones are acquired. This shortcoming has recently been addressed
using methods that encourage parameters to stay close to those used for
previous tasks. This can be done by (i) using specific parameter regularizers
that map out suitable destinations in parameter space, or (ii) guiding the
optimization journey by projecting gradients into subspaces that do not
interfere with previous tasks. However, parameter regularization has been shown
to be relatively ineffective in recurrent neural networks (RNNs), a setting
relevant to the study of neural dynamics supporting biological continual
learning. Similarly, projection based methods can reach capacity and fail to
learn any further as the number of tasks increases. To address these
limitations, we propose Natural Continual Learning (NCL), a new method that
unifies weight regularization and projected gradient descent. NCL uses Bayesian
weight regularization to encourage good performance on all tasks at convergence
and combines this with gradient projections designed to prevent catastrophic
forgetting during optimization. NCL formalizes gradient projection as a trust
region algorithm based on the Fisher information metric, and achieves
scalability via a novel Kronecker-factored approximation strategy. Our method
outperforms both standard weight regularization techniques and projection based
approaches when applied to continual learning problems in RNNs. The trained
networks evolve task-specific dynamics that are strongly preserved as new tasks
are learned, similar to experimental findings in biological circuits.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.07949</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The mapping between visual inputs on the retina and neuronal activations in
the visual cortex, i.e., retinotopic map, is an essential topic in vision
science and neuroscience. Human retinotopic maps can be revealed by analyzing
the functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) signal responses to designed
visual stimuli in vivo. Neurophysiology studies summarized that visual areas
are topological (i.e., nearby neurons have receptive fields at nearby locations
in the image). However, conventional fMRI-based analyses frequently generate
non-topological results because they process fMRI signals on a voxel-wise
basis, without considering the neighbor relations on the surface. Here we
propose a topological receptive field (tRF) model which imposes the topological
condition when decoding retinotopic fMRI signals. More specifically, we
parametrized the cortical surface to a unit disk, characterized the topological
condition by tRF, and employed an efficient scheme to solve the tRF model. We
tested our framework on both synthetic and human fMRI data. Experimental
results showed that the tRF model could remove the topological violations,
improve model explaining power, and generate biologically plausible retinotopic
maps. The proposed framework is general and can be applied to other sensory
maps.

	<title>arXiv: Quantitative Biology: Neurons and Cognition: Neuromodulatory control over nonlinear spiking of layer V pyramidal neurons mediates adaptive slightly subcritical network dynamics. (arXiv:2106.07865v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.07865</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;To remain adaptable to a dynamic environment, coordinated neural activity in
the brain must be simultaneously flexible and reliable. There is evidence that
the brain facilitates this adaptive response using highly-conserved
metabotropic neuromodulatory neurotransmitters, such as noradrenaline and
acetylcholine. While we understand how these neuromodulators alter individual
neuronal dynamics, precisely how neuromodulation operates in networks of
neurons to give rise to observed large-scale dynamics remains unknown. Here, we
investigate this disparity by demonstrating correspondence between adaptive
information processing modes - calculated on in vivo electrophysiological
recordings of bursting layer V neurons in awake mice - and fluctuations in
neuromodulatory tone - assessed by dynamic changes in pupil diameter. We
theoretically validate these results by creating a novel, biologically
plausible dual-compartment model of nonlinear layer V pyramidal neurons -
capable of both regular spike and bursting modes - that reproduce our main
empirical findings. We then demonstrate that the adrenergic and cholinergic
neuromodulatory systems shift the brain into a neuroprotective (i.e., slightly
subcritical) regime - assessed by the branching parameter - while facilitating
flexible and reliable dynamics, respectively. This unexpected result
demonstrates that the brain has circumvented the necessity to shift the system
closer to criticality for variability by differentially augmenting an intrinsic
neuronal nonlinearity. Our analyses establish that these distinct arms of the
ascending arousal system modulate ensembles of layer V pyramidal neurons to
augment critical dynamics and facilitate distinct adaptive information
processing modes within the brain.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.07713</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Animal interval timing is often studied through the peak interval (PI)
procedure. In this procedure, the animal is rewarded for the first response
after a fixed delay from the stimulus onset, but on some trials, the stimulus
remains and no reward is given. The common methods and models to analyse the
response pattern describe it as break-run-break, a period of low rate response
followed by rapid responding, followed by a low rate of response. The study of
the pattern has found correlations between start, stop, and duration of the run
period that hold across species and experiment.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is commonly assumed that in order to achieve the statistics with a
pacemaker accumulator model it is necessary to have start and stop thresholds.
In this paper we will develop a new model that varies response rate in relation
to the likelihood of event occurrence, as opposed to a threshold, for changing
the response rate. The new model reproduced the start and stop statistics that
have been observed in 14 different PI experiments from 3 different papers. The
developed model is also compared to the Time-adaptive Drift-diffusion Model
(TDDM), the latest accumulator model subsuming the scalar expectancy theory
(SET), on all 14 data-sets. The results show that it is unnecessary to have
explicit start and stop thresholds or an internal equivalent to break-run-break
states to reproduce the individual trials statistics and population behaviour
and get the same break-run-break analysis results. The new model also produces
more realistic individual trials compared to TDDM.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2012.03837</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Deep learning models trained on large data sets have been widely successful
in both vision and language domains. As state-of-the-art deep learning
architectures have continued to grow in parameter count so have the compute
budgets and times required to train them, increasing the need for
compute-efficient methods that parallelize training. Two common approaches to
parallelize the training of deep networks have been data and model parallelism.
While useful, data and model parallelism suffer from diminishing returns in
terms of compute efficiency for large batch sizes. In this paper, we
investigate how to continue scaling compute efficiently beyond the point of
diminishing returns for large batches through local parallelism, a framework
which parallelizes training of individual layers in deep networks by replacing
global backpropagation with truncated layer-wise backpropagation. Local
parallelism enables fully asynchronous layer-wise parallelism with a low memory
footprint, and requires little communication overhead compared with model
parallelism. We show results in both vision and language domains across a
diverse set of architectures, and find that local parallelism is particularly
effective in the high-compute regime.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1910.14215</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Deep learning has the potential to dramatically impact navigation and
tracking state estimation problems critical to autonomous vehicles and
robotics. Measurement uncertainties in state estimation systems based on Kalman
and other Bayes filters are typically assumed to be a fixed covariance matrix.
This assumption is risky, particularly for &quot;black box&quot; deep learning models, in
which uncertainty can vary dramatically and unexpectedly. Accurate
quantification of multivariate uncertainty will allow for the full potential of
deep learning to be used more safely and reliably in these applications. We
show how to model multivariate uncertainty for regression problems with neural
networks, incorporating both aleatoric and epistemic sources of heteroscedastic
uncertainty. We train a deep uncertainty covariance matrix model in two ways:
directly using a multivariate Gaussian density loss function, and indirectly
using end-to-end training through a Kalman filter. We experimentally show in a
visual tracking problem the large impact that accurate multivariate uncertainty
quantification can have on Kalman filter performance for both in-domain and
out-of-domain evaluation data. We additionally show in a challenging visual
odometry problem how end-to-end filter training can allow uncertainty
predictions to compensate for filter weaknesses.

                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Objective&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;To analyse the course of multiple sclerosis (MS) after fingolimod withdrawal in a multicentre cohort.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec2&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Methods&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Patients who discontinued fingolimod were included. Relapses, Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS), and new/gadolinium-enhancing lesions on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were assessed during the last year on fingolimod, and in the year after discontinuation. Wilcoxon test was used to analyse the difference in EDSS and relapses between the two periods, and to compare lymphocyte counts at discontinuation and 3 months later. Demographic and clinical variables were evaluated using univariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec3&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Patients were 230 (females 66.1%; mean age 38 years; median EDSS 3). Fingolimod was discontinued due to inefficacy in 57%, and 87.4% started another treatment. Relapse was observed in 33% of the patients in the year after discontinuation. Severe reactivation was observed in 15%. During the first 6 months after discontinuation, new/enhancing lesions were seen in 62/116 patients. Higher age at the fingolimod discontinuation was found to be associated with a lower probability of inflammatory activity (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.001) and severe reactivation (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.007) during the year after discontinuation. Lower lymphocyte count was a risk factor for clinical, radiological, and severe activity (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.02, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.002, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.01, respectively).&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec4&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;The main reason for the discontinuation of fingolimod was inefficacy. One-third of the patients had a relapse during the year after discontinuation, 15% experienced a severe reactivation, and approximately 50% of patients with available MRI scan had new/enhancing lesions. The risk factors for disease activity after discontinuation were low lymphocyte count and younger age.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Loss of BAF Complex in Developing Cortex Perturbs Radial Neuronal Migration in a WNT Signaling-Dependent Manner</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2021.687581</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Radial neuronal migration is a key neurodevelopmental event indispensable for proper cortical laminar organization. Cortical neurons mainly use glial fiber guides, cell adhesion dynamics, and cytoskeletal remodeling, among other discrete processes, to radially trek from their birthplace to final layer positions. Dysregulated radial migration can engender cortical mis-lamination, leading to neurodevelopmental disorders. Epigenetic factors, including chromatin remodelers have emerged as formidable regulators of corticogenesis. Notably, the chromatin remodeler BAF complex has been shown to regulate several aspects of cortical histogenesis. Nonetheless, our understanding of how BAF complex regulates neuronal migration is limited. Here, we report that BAF complex is required for neuron migration during cortical development. Ablation of BAF complex in the developing mouse cortex caused alteration in the cortical gene expression program, leading to loss of radial migration-related factors critical for proper cortical layer formation. Of note, BAF complex inactivation in cortex caused defective neuronal polarization resulting in diminished multipolar-to-bipolar transition and eventual disruption of radial migration of cortical neurons. The abnormal radial migration and cortical mis-lamination can be partly rescued by downregulating WNT signaling hyperactivity in the BAF complex mutant cortex. By implication, the BAF complex modulates WNT signaling to establish the gene expression program required for glial fiber-dependent neuronal migration, and cortical lamination. Overall, BAF complex has been identified to be crucial for cortical morphogenesis through instructing multiple aspects of radial neuronal migration in a WNT signaling-dependent manner.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Decreased MEF2A Expression Regulated by Its Enhancer Methylation Inhibits Autophagy and May Play an Important Role in the Progression of Alzheimer’s Disease</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.682247</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles which significantly affects people’s life quality. Recently, AD has been found to be closely related to autophagy. The aim of this study was to identify autophagy-related genes associated with the pathogenesis of AD from multiple types of microarray and sequencing datasets using bioinformatics methods and to investigate their role in the pathogenesis of AD in order to identify novel strategies to prevent and treat AD. Our results showed that the autophagy-related genes were significantly downregulated in AD and correlated with the pathological progression. Furthermore, enrichment analysis showed that these autophagy-related genes were regulated by the transcription factor myocyte enhancer factor 2A (MEF2A), which had been confirmed using si-MEF2A. Moreover, the single-cell sequencing data suggested that MEF2A was highly expressed in microglia. Methylation microarray analysis showed that the methylation level of the enhancer region of MEF2A in AD was significantly increased. In conclusion, our results suggest that AD related to the increased methylation level of MEF2A enhancer reduces the expression of MEF2A and downregulates the expression of autophagy-related genes which are closely associated with AD pathogenesis, thereby inhibiting autophagy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Altered Functional Connectivity of Insular Subregions in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.676624</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Diabetes-related brain damage can lead to cognitive decline and increase the risk of depression, but the neuropathological mechanism of this phenomenon remains unclear. Different insular subregions have obvious functional heterogeneity, which is related to many aspects of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM)-related brain damage. However, little is known about changes in functional connectivity (FC) in insular subregions in patients with T2DM. Therefore, we aimed to investigate FC between different insular subregions and clinical/cognitive variables in patients with T2DM. Fifty-seven patients with T2DM and 55 healthy controls (HCs) underwent a neuropsychological assessment and resting-state FC examination. We defined three insular subregions, including the bilateral dorsal anterior insula (dAI), bilateral ventral anterior insula (vAI), and bilateral posterior insula (PI). We examined differences in FC between insular subregions and the whole brain in patients with T2DM compared with HCs. A correlation analysis was performed to examine the relationship between FC and clinical/cognitive variables. Compared with HCs, patients with T2DM showed significantly decreased FC between the dAI and the right inferior frontal gyrus, right superior/middle temporal gyrus, right hippocampus, and right precentral gyrus. FC between the vAI and the right supramarginal gyrus, as well as the PI and the right precentral/postcentral gyrus, was reduced in the T2DM group compared with the control group. In the T2DM group, we showed a significant negative correlation between glycated hemoglobin concentration and FC in the dAI and right hippocampus (r = −0.428, P = 0.001) after Bonferroni correction. We conclude that different insular subregions present distinct FC patterns with functional regions and that abnormal FC in these insular subregions may affect cognitive, emotional, and sensorimotor functions in patients with T2DM.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Reassessment of Pioglitazone for Alzheimer’s Disease</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.666958</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s disease is a quintessential ‘unmet medical need’, accounting for ∼65% of progressive cognitive impairment among the elderly, and 700,000 deaths in the United States in 2020. In 2019, the cost of caring for Alzheimer’s sufferers was $244B, not including the emotional and physical toll on caregivers. In spite of this dismal reality, no treatments are available that reduce the risk of developing AD or that offer prolonged mitiagation of its most devestating symptoms. This review summarizes key aspects of the biology and genetics of Alzheimer’s disease, and we describe how pioglitazone improves many of the patholophysiological determinants of AD. We also summarize the results of pre-clinical experiments, longitudinal observational studies, and clinical trials. The results of animal testing suggest that pioglitazone can be corrective as well as protective, and that its efficacy is enhanced in a time- and dose-dependent manner, but the dose-effect relations are not monotonic or sigmoid. Longitudinal cohort studies suggests that it delays the onset of dementia in individuals with pre-existing type 2 diabetes mellitus, which small scale, unblinded pilot studies seem to confirm. However, the results of placebo-controlled, blinded clinical trials have not borne this out, and we discuss possible explanations for these discrepancies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Multi-Channel 4D Parametrized Atlas of Macro- and Microstructural Neonatal Brain Development</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.661704</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Structural (also known as anatomical) and diffusion MRI provide complimentary anatomical and microstructural characterization of early brain maturation. However, the existing models of the developing brain in time include only either structural or diffusion MRI channels. Furthermore, there is a lack of tools for combined analysis of structural and diffusion MRI in the same reference space. In this work, we propose a methodology to generate a multi-channel (MC) continuous spatio-temporal parametrized atlas of the brain development that combines multiple MRI-derived parameters in the same anatomical space during 37–44 weeks of postmenstrual age range. We co-align structural and diffusion MRI of 170 normal term subjects from the developing Human Connectomme Project using MC registration driven by both T2-weighted and orientation distribution functions channels and fit the Gompertz model to the signals and spatial transformations in time. The resulting atlas consists of 14 spatio-temporal microstructural indices and two parcellation maps delineating white matter tracts and neonatal transient structures. In order to demonstrate applicability of the atlas for quantitative region-specific studies, a comparison analysis of 140 term and 40 preterm subjects scanned at the term-equivalent age is performed using different MRI-derived microstructural indices in the atlas reference space for multiple white matter regions, including the transient compartments. The atlas and software will be available after publication of the article&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Fast and High-Resolution Neonatal Brain MRI Through Super-Resolution Reconstruction From Acquisitions With Variable Slice Selection Direction</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.636268</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The brain of neonates is small in comparison to adults. Imaging at typical resolutions such as one cubic mm incurs more partial voluming artifacts in a neonate than in an adult. The interpretation and analysis of MRI of the neonatal brain benefit from a reduction in partial volume averaging that can be achieved with high spatial resolution. Unfortunately, direct acquisition of high spatial resolution MRI is slow, which increases the potential for motion artifact, and suffers from reduced signal-to-noise ratio. The purpose of this study is thus that using super-resolution reconstruction in conjunction with fast imaging protocols to construct neonatal brain MRI images at a suitable signal-to-noise ratio and with higher spatial resolution than can be practically obtained by direct Fourier encoding. We achieved high quality brain MRI at a spatial resolution of isotropic 0.4 mm with 6 min of imaging time, using super-resolution reconstruction from three short duration scans with variable directions of slice selection. Motion compensation was achieved by aligning the three short duration scans together. We applied this technique to 20 newborns and assessed the quality of the images we reconstructed. Experiments show that our approach to super-resolution reconstruction achieved considerable improvement in spatial resolution and signal-to-noise ratio, while, in parallel, substantially reduced scan times, as compared to direct high-resolution acquisitions. The experimental results demonstrate that our approach allowed for fast and high-quality neonatal brain MRI for both scientific research and clinical studies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Conversely, in recent years, studies have identified the glial–lymphatic system in the brain, which primarily comprises the inflow of fluid along the para-arterial space. Aquaporin-4 mediates the convection of interstitial fluid in the brain and outflow along the paravenous space. β-Amyloid deposition is a characteristic pathological change in Alzheimer’s disease, and some studies have found that the glial–lymphatic system plays an important role in its clearance. Thus, the glial–lymphatic system may influence Alzheimer’s disease severity and outcome; therefore, this review summarizes the current and available research on the glial–lymphatic system and Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurogenesis: Adult Hippocampal Neurogenesis and Affective Disorders: New Neurons for Psychic Well-Being</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.594448</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A paradigm shift in neuroscience was the discovery that new neurons are constantly produced in the adult mammalian brain of several species, including Homo sapiens. These new-born cells are formed in some main neurogenic niches, including the subventricular zone (SVZ) at the margin of the lateral ventricle and subgranular zone (SGZ) in the hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG). In the DG, neuroblasts derive from SGZ progenitors and migrate to the hippocampal granular layer becoming adult granule cells, which are integrated into functional adult circuits. It has been confirmed that adult hippocampal neurogenesis (AHN) is a long-lasting phenomenon in the human brain. The functions of hippocampal new-born cells are not fully established. Experimental studies suggest that they have unique electrophysiological properties, including hyperexcitability, which enable them to regulate adult granule cells. Their specific function depends on the anatomical hippocampal location along the hippocampal dorsal-ventral axis. Dorsal hippocampus plays a more defined role on spatial learning and contextual information, while the ventral hippocampus is more related to emotional behavior, stress resilience and social interaction. Several reports suggest a role for AHN in pattern separation, cognitive flexibility, forgetting and reversal learning. It has been proposed that deficits in AHN might impair normal DG function, including pattern separation and cognitive flexibility, which could play a role on the etiology of affective disorders, such as depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). In this paper, we review recent scientific evidence suggesting that impairment of AHN may underlie the pathophysiology of affective disorders even in humans and that neurogenesis-inspired therapies may be a promising approach to reduce symptoms of affective disorders in humans.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Fast Ripples as a Biomarker of Epileptogenic Tuber in Tuberous Sclerosis Complex Patients Using Stereo-Electroencephalograph</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.680295</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Objectives: To evaluate the value of fast ripples (FRs) (200–500 Hz) recorded with stereo-electroencephalograph (SEEG) in the localization of epileptogenic tubers in patients with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Seventeen TSC patients who underwent preoperative SEEG examination and resective epilepsy surgery were retrospectively enrolled. They were divided into two groups according to the seizure control at 1-year postoperative follow-up. The occurrence frequencies of FRs were automatically counted, and the FR rate was calculated. The high FR rate was defined as FR rate ≧0.5. According to different positions, the contacts’ locations were divided into three groups: inner of the tubers, the junction region of the tubers, and out of the tubers. The influence factors of postoperative seizure freedom were also analyzed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Twelve patients reached postoperative seizure freedom at 1-year follow-up. In total, FRs were found in 24.2% of the contacts and 67.1% of the tubers in all assessed patients. There were 47 high FR rate contacts localized in the junction region of the tubers, which was 62.7% of the 75 high FR rate contacts in total and was 8.4% of the total 561 contacts localized in the junction region of the tubers. Total removal of epileptogenic tubers and total resection of the high FR rate tubers/contacts were associated with postoperative seizure freedom (P &amp;lt; 0.05).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: FRs could be extensively detected in TSC patients using SEEG, and high FR rate contacts were mostly localized in the junction region of the epileptogenic tuber, which could aid in the localization of epileptogenic tubers.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: A Short-Term Intervention of High-Intensity Exercise and Anodal-tDCS on Motor Learning in Middle-Aged Adults: An RCT</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.661079</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;High-intensity exercise has enhanced motor learning in healthy young adults. Anodal-transcranial direct current stimulation (a-tDCS) may optimize these effects. This study aimed to determine the effects of a short-term high-intensity interval exercise intervention either with or without a-tDCS on the learning and retention of a novel motor task in middle-aged adults. Forty-two healthy middle-aged adults (age = 44.6 ± 6.3, female = 76%) were randomized into three groups: exercise and active a-tDCS, exercise and sham a-tDCS, and a non-exercise and sham a-tDCS control. Participants completed a baseline testing session, followed by three intervention sessions 48-h apart. The exercise groups completed 20-min of high-intensity exercise followed by a novel sequential visual isometric pinch task (SVIPT) while receiving 20-min of 1.5 mA a-tDCS, or sham tDCS. The control group completed 20-min of reading before receiving sham a-tDCS during the SVIPT. Learning was assessed by skill change within and between intervention sessions. Participants returned 5–7 days after the final intervention session and performed the SVIPT task to assess retention. All three groups showed evidence of learning on the SVIPT task. Neither group displayed enhanced overall learning or retention when compared to the control group. High-intensity exercise with or without a-tDCS did not improve learning or retention of a novel motor task in middle-aged adults. The methodological framework provides direction for future research to investigate the potential of differing exercise intensity effects on learning and retention.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience: Double Two-State Opsin Model With Autonomous Parameter Inference</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2021.688331</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Optogenetics has a lot of potential to become an effective neuromodulative therapy for clinical applications. Selecting the correct opsin is crucial to have an optimal optogenetic tool. With computational modeling, the neuronal response to the current dynamics of an opsin can be extensively and systematically tested. Unlike electrical stimulation where the effect is directly defined by the applied field, the stimulation in optogenetics is indirect, depending on the selected opsin's non-linear kinetics. With the continuous expansion of opsin possibilities, computational studies are difficult due to the need for an accurate model of the selected opsin first. To this end, we propose a double two-state opsin model as alternative to the conventional three and four state Markov models used for opsin modeling. Furthermore, we provide a fitting procedure, which allows for autonomous model fitting starting from a vast parameter space. With this procedure, we successfully fitted two distinctive opsins (ChR2(H134R) and MerMAID). Both models are able to represent the experimental data with great accuracy and were obtained within an acceptable time frame. This is due to the absence of differential equations in the fitting procedure, with an enormous reduction in computational cost as result. The performance of the proposed model with a fit to ChR2(H134R) was tested, by comparing the neural response in a regular spiking neuron to the response obtained with the non-instantaneous, four state Markov model (4SB), derived by Williams et al. (2013). Finally, a computational speed gain was observed with the proposed model in a regular spiking and sparse Pyramidal-Interneuron-Network-Gamma (sPING) network simulation with respect to the 4SB-model, due to the former having two differential equations less. Consequently, the proposed model allows for computationally efficient optogenetic neurostimulation and with the proposed fitting procedure will be valuable for further research in the field of optogenetics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Calcineurin Participation in Hebbian and Homeostatic Plasticity Associated With Extinction</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.685838</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In nature, animals need to adapt to constant changes in their environment. Learning and memory are cognitive capabilities that allow this to happen. Extinction, the reduction of a certain behavior or learning previously established, refers to a very particular and interesting type of learning that has been the basis of a series of therapies to diminish non-adaptive behaviors. In recent years, the exploration of the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying this type of learning has received increasing attention. Hebbian plasticity (the activity-dependent modification of the strength or efficacy of synaptic transmission), and homeostatic plasticity (the homeostatic regulation of plasticity) constitute processes intimately associated with memory formation and maintenance. Particularly, long-term depression (LTD) has been proposed as the underlying mechanism of extinction, while the protein phosphatase calcineurin (CaN) has been widely related to both the extinction process and LTD. In this review, we focus on the available evidence that sustains CaN modulation of LTD and its association with extinction. Beyond the classic view, we also examine the interconnection among extinction, Hebbian and homeostatic plasticity, as well as emergent evidence of the participation of kinases and long-term potentiation (LTP) on extinction learning, highlighting the importance of the balance between kinases and phosphatases in the expression of extinction. Finally, we also integrate data that shows the association between extinction and less-studied phenomena, such as synaptic silencing and engram formation that open new perspectives in the field.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Sensorineural Hearing Loss and Mitochondrial Apoptosis of Cochlear Spiral Ganglion Neurons in Fibroblast Growth Factor 13 Knockout Mice</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.658586</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Deafness is known to occur in more than 400 syndromes and accounts for almost 30% of hereditary hearing loss. The molecular mechanisms underlying such syndromic deafness remain unclear. Furthermore, deafness has been a common feature in patients with three main syndromes, the BÖrjeson-Forssman-Lehmann syndrome, Wildervanck syndrome, and Congenital Generalized Hirsutism, all of which are characterized by loss-of-function mutations in the Fgf13 gene. Whether the pathogenesis of deafness in these syndromes is associated with the Fgf13 mutation is not known. To elucidate its role in auditory function, we generated a mouse line with conditional knockout of the Fgf13 gene in the inner ear (Fgf13 cKO). FGF13 is expressed predominantly in the organ of Corti, spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs), stria vascularis, and the supporting cells. Conditional knockout of the gene in the inner ear led to sensorineural deafness with low amplitude and increased latency of wave I in the auditory brainstem response test but had a normal distortion product otoacoustic emission threshold. Fgf13 deficiency resulted in decreased SGN density from the apical to the basal region without significant morphological changes and those in the number of hair cells. TUNEL and caspase-3 immunocytochemistry assays showed that apoptotic cell death mediated the loss of SGNs. Further detection of apoptotic factors through qRT-PCR suggested the activation of the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway in SGNs. Together, this study reveals a novel role for Fgf13 in auditory function, and indicates that the gene could be a potential candidate for understanding deafness. These findings may provide new perspectives on the molecular mechanisms and novel therapeutic targets for treatment deafness.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/68346</link>
	<content:encoded>Our ability to rationally optimize allosteric regulation is limited by incomplete knowledge of the mutations that tune allostery. Are these mutations few or abundant, structurally localized or distributed? To examine this, we conducted saturation mutagenesis of a synthetic allosteric switch in which Dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) is regulated by a blue-light sensitive LOV2 domain. Using a high-throughput assay wherein DHFR catalytic activity is coupled to &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; growth, we assessed the impact of 1548 viable DHFR single mutations on allostery. Despite most mutations being deleterious to activity, fewer than 5% of mutations had a statistically significant influence on allostery. Most allostery disrupting mutations were proximal to the LOV2 insertion site. In contrast, allostery enhancing mutations were structurally distributed and enriched on the protein surface. Combining several allostery enhancing mutations yielded near-additive improvements to dynamic range. Our results indicate a path towards optimizing allosteric function through variation at surface sites.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Crustacean aquaculture is expected to be a major source of fishery commodities in the near future. Hemocytes are key players of the immune system in shrimps; however, their classification, maturation, and differentiation are still under debate. To date, only discrete and inconsistent information on the classification of shrimp hemocytes has been reported, showing that the morphological characteristics are not sufficient to resolve their actual roles. Our present study using single-cell RNA sequencing, revealed six types of hemocytes of &lt;i&gt;Marsupenaeus japonicus&lt;/i&gt; based on their transcriptional profiles. We identified markers of each subpopulation and predicted the differentiation pathways involved in their maturation. We also predicted cell growth factors that might play crucial roles in hemocyte differentiation. Different immune roles among these subpopulations were suggested from the analysis of differentially expressed immune-related genes. These results provide a unified classification of shrimp hemocytes, which improves the understanding of its immune system.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/65735</link>
	<content:encoded>Emerging evidence demonstrates the important role of circular RNAs (circRNAs) in regulating pathological processes in various diseases including organ fibrosis. Endometrium fibrosis is the leading cause of uterine infertility, but the role of circRNAs in its pathogenesis is largely unknown. Here, we provide the evidence that upregulation of circPTPN12 in endometrial epithelial cells (EECs) of fibrotic endometrium functions as endogenous sponge of miR-21–5 p to inhibit miR-21–5 p expression and activity, which in turn results in upregulation of ΔNp63α to induce the epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) of EECs (EEC–EMT). In a mouse model of endometrium fibrosis, circPTPN12 appears to be a cofactor of driving EEC–EMT and administration of &lt;i&gt;miR-21–5&lt;/i&gt; p could reverse this process and improve endometrial fibrosis. Our findings revealed that the dysfunction of circPTPN12/miR-21–5 p/∆Np63α pathway contributed to the pathogenesis of endometrial fibrosis.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/65532</link>
	<content:encoded>In the course of global climate change, central Europe is experiencing more frequent and prolonged periods of drought. The drought years 2018 and 2019 affected European beeches (&lt;i&gt;Fagus sylvatica&lt;/i&gt; L.) differently: even in the same stand, drought damaged trees neighboured healthy trees, suggesting that the genotype rather than the environment was responsible for this conspicuous pattern. We used this natural experiment to study the genomic basis of drought resistance with Pool-GWAS. Contrasting the extreme phenotypes identified 106 significantly associated SNPs throughout the genome. Most annotated genes with associated SNPs (&amp;gt;70%) were previously implicated in the drought reaction of plants. Non-synonymous substitutions led either to a functional amino acid exchange or premature termination. A SNP-assay with 70 loci allowed predicting drought phenotype in 98.6% of a validation sample of 92 trees. Drought resistance in European beech is a moderately polygenic trait that should respond well to natural selection, selective management, and breeding.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Visually guided behavior relies on the integration of sensory input and information held in working memory (WM). Yet it remains unclear how this is accomplished at the level of neural circuits. We studied the direct visual cortical inputs to neurons within a visuomotor area of prefrontal cortex in behaving monkeys. We show that the efficacy of visual input to prefrontal cortex is gated by information held in WM. Surprisingly, visual input to prefrontal neurons was found to target those with both visual and motor properties, rather than preferentially targeting other visual neurons. Furthermore, activity evoked from visual cortex was larger in magnitude, more synchronous, and more rapid, when monkeys remembered locations that matched the location of visual input. These results indicate that WM directly influences the circuitry that transforms visual input into visually guided behavior.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/64134</link>
	<content:encoded>The biological embedding model (BEM) suggests that fitness costs of maternal loss arise when early-life experience embeds long-term alterations to hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis activity. Alternatively, the adaptive calibration model (ACM) regards physiological changes during ontogeny as short-term adaptations. Both models have been tested in humans but rarely in wild, long-lived animals. We assessed whether, as in humans, maternal loss had short- and long-term impacts on orphan wild chimpanzee urinary cortisol levels and diurnal urinary cortisol slopes, both indicative of HPA axis functioning. Immature chimpanzees recently orphaned and/or orphaned early in life had diurnal cortisol slopes reflecting heightened activation of the HPA axis. However, these effects appeared short-term, with no consistent differences between orphan and non-orphan cortisol profiles in mature males, suggesting stronger support for the ACM than the BEM in wild chimpanzees. Compensatory mechanisms, such as adoption, may buffer against certain physiological effects of maternal loss in this species.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: Intrinsic OXPHOS limitations underlie cellular bioenergetics in leukemia</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/63104</link>
	<content:encoded>Typified by oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), mitochondria catalyze a wide variety of cellular processes seemingly critical for malignant growth. As such, there is considerable interest in targeting mitochondrial metabolism in cancer. However, notwithstanding the few drugs targeting mutant dehydrogenase activity, nearly all hopeful 'mito-therapeutics' cannot discriminate cancerous from non-cancerous OXPHOS and thus suffer from a limited therapeutic index. The present project was based on the premise that the development of efficacious mitochondrial-targeted anti-cancer compounds requires answering two fundamental questions: 1) is mitochondrial bioenergetics in fact different between cancer and non-cancer cells? and 2) If so, what are the underlying mechanisms? Such information is particularly critical for the subset of human cancers, including acute myeloid leukemia (AML), in which alterations in mitochondrial metabolism are implicated in various aspects of cancer biology (e.g., clonal expansion and chemoresistance). Herein, we leveraged an in-house diagnostic biochemical workflow to comprehensively evaluate mitochondrial bioenergetic efficiency and capacity in various hematological cell types, with a specific focus on OXPHOS dynamics in AML. Consistent with prior reports, clonal cell expansion, characteristic of leukemia, was universally associated with a hyper-metabolic phenotype which included increases in basal and maximal glycolytic and respiratory flux. However, despite having nearly 2-fold more mitochondria per cell, clonally expanding hematopoietic stem cells, leukemic blasts, as well as chemoresistant AML were all consistently hallmarked by intrinsic limitations in oxidative ATP synthesis (i.e., OXPHOS). Remarkably, by performing experiments across a physiological span of ATP free energy (i.e, ΔG&lt;sub&gt;ATP&lt;/sub&gt;), we provide direct evidence that, rather than contributing to cellular ΔG&lt;sub&gt;ATP&lt;/sub&gt;, leukemic mitochondria are particularly poised to consume ATP. Relevant to AML biology, acute restoration of OXPHOS kinetics proved highly cytotoxic to leukemic blasts, suggesting that active OXPHOS repression supports aggressive disease dissemination in AML. Taken together, these findings argue against ATP being the primary output of mitochondria in leukemia and provide proof-of-principle that restoring, rather than disrupting, OXPHOS and/or cellular ΔG&lt;sub&gt;ATP&lt;/sub&gt; in cancer may represent an untapped therapeutic avenue for combatting hematological malignancy and chemoresistance.</content:encoded>

Microbial communities have become a major research focus due to their importance for biogeochemical cycles, biomedicine and biotechnological applications. While some biotechnological applications, such as anaerobic digestion, make use of naturally arising microbial communities, the rational design of microbial consortia for bio-based production processes has recently gained much interest. One class of synthetic microbial consortia is based on specifically designed strains of one species. A common design principle for these consortia is based on division of labor, where the entire production pathway is divided between the different strains to reduce the metabolic burden caused by product synthesis. We first show that classical division of labor does not automatically reduce the metabolic burden when metabolic flux per biomass is analyzed. We then present ASTHERISC (Algorithmic Search of THERmodynamic advantages in Single-species Communities), a new computational approach for designing multi-strain communities of a single-species with the aim to divide a production pathway between different strains such that the thermodynamic driving force for product synthesis is maximized. ASTHERISC exploits the fact that compartmentalization of segments of a product pathway in different strains can circumvent thermodynamic bottlenecks arising when operation of one reaction requires a metabolite with high and operation of another reaction the same metabolite with low concentration. We implemented the ASTHERISC algorithm in a dedicated program package and applied it on &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; core and genome-scale models with different settings, for example, regarding number of strains or demanded product yield. These calculations showed that, for each scenario, many target metabolites (products) exist where a multi-strain community can provide a thermodynamic advantage compared to a single strain solution. In some cases, a production with sufficiently high yield is thermodynamically only feasible with a community. In summary, the developed ASTHERISC approach provides a promising new principle for designing microbial communities for the bio-based production of chemicals.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/AsBjj8YyUk8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Collective dynamics in multicellular systems such as biological organs and tissues plays a key role in biological development, regeneration, and pathological conditions. Collective tissue dynamics—understood as population behaviour arising from the interplay of the constituting discrete cells—can be studied with on- and off-lattice agent-based models. However, classical on-lattice agent-based models, also known as cellular automata, fail to replicate key aspects of collective migration, which is a central instance of collective behaviour in multicellular systems. To overcome drawbacks of classical on-lattice models, we introduce an on-lattice, agent-based modelling class for collective cell migration, which we call biological lattice-gas cellular automaton (BIO-LGCA). The BIO-LGCA is characterised by synchronous time updates, and the explicit consideration of individual cell velocities. While rules in classical cellular automata are typically chosen ad hoc, rules for cell-cell and cell-environment interactions in the BIO-LGCA can also be derived from experimental cell migration data or biophysical laws for individual cell migration. We introduce elementary BIO-LGCA models of fundamental cell interactions, which may be combined in a modular fashion to model complex multicellular phenomena. We exemplify the mathematical mean-field analysis of specific BIO-LGCA models, which allows to explain collective behaviour. The first example predicts the formation of clusters in adhesively interacting cells. The second example is based on a novel BIO-LGCA combining adhesive interactions and alignment. For this model, our analysis clarifies the nature of the recently discovered invasion plasticity of breast cancer cells in heterogeneous environments.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/vilLL9K1a5s&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Biology: What’s not in the news headlines or titles of Alzheimer disease articles? #InMice</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~3/Vyr7Oq10CKM/article</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Marcia Triunfol, Fabio C. Gouveia&lt;/p&gt;

There is increasing scrutiny around how science is communicated to the public. For instance, a Twitter account @justsaysinmice (with 70.4K followers in January 2021) was created to call attention to news headlines that omit that mice, not humans, are the ones for whom the study findings apply. This is the case of many headlines reporting on Alzheimer disease (AD) research. AD is characterized by a degeneration of the human brain, loss of cognition, and behavioral changes, for which no treatment is available. Around 200 rodent models have been developed to study AD, even though AD is an exclusively human condition that does not occur naturally in other species and appears impervious to reproduction in artificial animal models, an information not always disclosed. It is not known what prompts writers of news stories to either omit or acknowledge, in the story’s headlines, that the study was done in mice and not in humans. Here, we raised the hypothesis that how science is reported by scientists plays a role on the news reporting. To test this hypothesis, we investigated whether an association exists between articles’ titles and news’ headlines regarding the omission, or not, of mice. To this end, we analyzed a sample of 623 open-access scientific papers indexed in PubMed in 2018 and 2019 that used mice either as models or as the biological source for experimental studies in AD research. We found a significant association (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.01) between articles’ titles and news stories’ headlines, revealing that when authors omit the species in the paper’s title, writers of news stories tend to follow suit. We also found that papers not mentioning mice in their titles are more newsworthy and significantly more tweeted than papers that do. Our study shows that science reporting may affect media reporting and asks for changes in the way we report about findings obtained with animal models used to study human diseases.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/Vyr7Oq10CKM&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.07622</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a high-risk dementia condition which
progresses to probable Alzheimer's disease (AD) at approximately 10% to 15% per
year. Characterization of group-level differences between two subtypes of MCI -
stable MCI (sMCI) and progressive MCI (pMCI) is the key step to understand the
mechanisms of MCI progression and enable possible delay of transition from MCI
to AD. Functional connectivity (FC) is considered as a promising way to study
MCI progression since which may show alterations even in preclinical stages and
provide substrates for AD progression. However, the representative FC patterns
during AD development for different clinical groups, especially for sMCI and
pMCI, have been understudied. In this work, we integrated autoencoder and
multi-class classification into a single deep model and successfully learned a
set of clinical group related feature vectors. Specifically, we trained two
non-linear mappings which realized the mutual transformations between original
FC space and the feature space. By mapping the learned clinical group related
feature vectors to the original FC space, representative FCs were constructed
for each group. Moreover, based on these feature vectors, our model achieves a
high classification accuracy - 68% for multi-class classification (NC vs SMC vs
sMCI vs pMCI vs AD).

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.07411</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A few years ago, the first CNN surpassed human performance on ImageNet.
However, it soon became clear that machines lack robustness on more challenging
test cases, a major obstacle towards deploying machines &quot;in the wild&quot; and
towards obtaining better computational models of human visual perception. Here
we ask: Are we making progress in closing the gap between human and machine
vision? To answer this question, we tested human observers on a broad range of
out-of-distribution (OOD) datasets, adding the &quot;missing human baseline&quot; by
recording 85,120 psychophysical trials across 90 participants. We then
investigated a range of promising machine learning developments that crucially
deviate from standard supervised CNNs along three axes: objective function
(self-supervised, adversarially trained, CLIP language-image training),
architecture (e.g. vision transformers), and dataset size (ranging from 1M to
1B). Our findings are threefold. (1.) The longstanding robustness gap between
humans and CNNs is closing, with the best models now matching or exceeding
human performance on most OOD datasets. (2.) There is still a substantial
image-level consistency gap, meaning that humans make different errors than
models. In contrast, most models systematically agree in their categorisation
errors, even substantially different ones like contrastive self-supervised vs.
standard supervised models. (3.) In many cases, human-to-model consistency
improves when training dataset size is increased by one to three orders of
magnitude. Our results give reason for cautious optimism: While there is still
much room for improvement, the behavioural difference between human and machine
vision is narrowing. In order to measure future progress, 17 OOD datasets with
image-level human behavioural data are provided as a benchmark here:

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Understanding how agents learn to generalize -- and, in particular, to
extrapolate -- in high-dimensional, naturalistic environments remains a
challenge for both machine learning and the study of biological agents. One
approach to this has been the use of function learning paradigms, which allow
peoples' empirical patterns of generalization for smooth scalar functions to be
described precisely. However, to date, such work has not succeeded in
identifying mechanisms that acquire the kinds of general purpose
representations over which function learning can operate to exhibit the
patterns of generalization observed in human empirical studies. Here, we
present a framework for how a learner may acquire such representations, that
then support generalization -- and extrapolation in particular -- in a few-shot
fashion. Taking inspiration from a classic theory of visual processing, we
construct a self-supervised encoder that implements the basic inductive bias of
invariance under topological distortions. We show the resulting representations
outperform those from other models for unsupervised time series learning in
several downstream function learning tasks, including extrapolation.

either visually presented or imagined monetary rewards and scrambled pictures.
Brain images for a group of 12 participants were collected using functional
magnetic resonance imaging. Statistical analysis showed that human midbrain
regions were activated irrespective of the monetary rewards being imagined or
visually present. A support vector machine trained on the midbrain activation
patterns to the visually presented rewards predicted with 75% accuracy whether
the participants imagined the monetary reward or the scrambled picture during
imagination trials. Training samples were drawn from visually presented trials
and classification accuracy was assessed for imagination trials. These results
suggest the use of machine learning technique for classification of underlying
cognitive states from brain imaging data.

	<title>arXiv: Quantitative Biology: Neurons and Cognition: Modeling Object Recognition in Newborn Chicks using Deep Neural Networks. (arXiv:2106.07185v1 [cs.AI])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.07185</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In recent years, the brain and cognitive sciences have made great strides
developing a mechanistic understanding of object recognition in mature brains.
Despite this progress, fundamental questions remain about the origins and
computational foundations of object recognition. What learning algorithms
underlie object recognition in newborn brains? Since newborn animals learn
largely through unsupervised learning, we explored whether unsupervised
learning algorithms can be used to predict the view-invariant object
recognition behavior of newborn chicks. Specifically, we used feature
representations derived from unsupervised deep neural networks (DNNs) as inputs
to cognitive models of categorization. We show that features derived from
unsupervised DNNs make competitive predictions about chick behavior compared to
supervised features. More generally, we argue that linking controlled-rearing
studies to image-computable DNN models opens new experimental avenues for
studying the origins and computational basis of object recognition in newborn
animals.

	<content:encoded>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Fetal resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) has emerged as a critical new approach for characterizing brain development before birth. Despite the rapid and widespread growth of this approach, at present, we lack neuroimaging processing pipelines suited to address the unique challenges inherent in this data type. Here, we solve the most challenging processing step, rapid and accurate isolation of the fetal brain from surrounding tissue across thousands of non-stationary 3D brain volumes. Leveraging our library of 1,241 manually traced fetal fMRI images from 207 fetuses, we trained a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) that achieved excellent performance across two held-out test sets from separate scanners and populations. Furthermore, we unite the auto-masking model with additional fMRI preprocessing steps from existing software and provide insight into our adaptation of each step. This work represents an initial advancement towards a fully comprehensive, open-source workflow, with openly shared code and data, for fetal functional MRI data preprocessing.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neurology: Mitochondrial genome variations are associated with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis in patients from mainland China</title>
	<link>http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s00415-021-10659-7</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;

                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Background&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a late-onset neurodegenerative disorder. Mitochondrial dysfunction is involved in the complex pathophysiology of ALS; however, the role of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) variants in ALS is poorly understood. We aimed to elucidate the role of mtDNA variants in the pathogenesis of ALS.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec2&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Methods&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;The mitochondrial haplogroups of 585 ALS patients and 371 healthy controls were determined; 38 ALS patients and 42 controls underwent long-range polymerase chain reaction combined with next-generation sequencing technology to analyze whole mitochondrial genome variants.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec3&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;A higher percentage of variants accumulated in ALS patients than in controls. Analysis of coding region variations that were further stratified by mtDNA genes revealed that nonsynonymous variants were more vulnerable in ALS patients than in controls, particularly in the &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;ND4L&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;ND5&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;ATP8&lt;/em&gt; genes. Moreover, pathogenic nonsynonymous variants tended to over-represent in ALS patients. Unsurprisingly, nonsynonymous variants were not related to the phenotype. Haplogroup analysis did not found evidence of association between haplogroups with the risk of ALS, however, patients belonging to haplogroup Y and M7c were prone to develop later onset of ALS.&lt;/p&gt;

                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;This is the first study to profile mtDNA variants in ALS patients from mainland China. Our results suggest that an increase in the number of nonsynonymous variants is linked to the pathogenesis of ALS. Moreover, haplogroup Y and M7c may modulate the clinical expression of ALS. Our findings provide independent, albeit limited, evidence for the role of mtDNA in the pathogenesis of ALS.&lt;/p&gt;

                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec1&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Background&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Microbiome feedbacks are proposed to influence Parkinson’s disease (PD) pathophysiology. A number of studies have evaluated the impact of oral medication on the gut microbiome (GM) in PD. However, the influence of PD device-assisted therapies (DATs) on the GM remains to be investigated.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec2&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Objectives&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;To profile acute gut microbial community alterations in response to PD DAT initiation.
      &lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec3&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Methods&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Clinical data and stool samples were collected from 21 PD patients initiating either deep brain stimulation (DBS) or levodopa–carbidopa intestinal gel (LCIG) and ten spousal healthy control (HC) subjects. 16S amplicon sequencing of stool DNA enabled comparison of temporal GM stability between groups and with clinical measures, including disease alterations relative to therapy initiation.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec4&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;We assessed GM response to therapy in the PD group by comparing pre-therapy (− 2 and 0 weeks) with post-therapy initiation timepoints (+ 2 and + 4 weeks) and HCs at baseline (0 weeks). Altered GM compositions were noted between the PD and HC groups at various taxonomic levels, including specific differences for DBS (overrepresentation of &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Clostridium_XlVa, Bilophila, Parabacteroides&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Pseudoflavonifractor&lt;/em&gt; and underrepresentation of &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Dorea&lt;/em&gt;) and LCIG therapy (overrepresentation of &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Pseudoflavonifractor, Escherichia/Shigella&lt;/em&gt;, and underrepresentation of &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Gemmiger&lt;/em&gt;). Beta diversity changes were also found over the 4 week post-treatment initiation period.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec5&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;We report on initial short-term GM changes in response to the initiation of PD DATs. Prior to the introduction of the DAT, a PD-associated GM was observed. Following initiation of DAT, several DAT-specific changes in GM composition were identified, suggesting DATs can influence the GM in PD.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Roles and Transcriptional Responses of Inhibitory Neurons in Learning and Memory</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2021.689952</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Increasing evidence supports a model whereby memories are encoded by sparse ensembles of neurons called engrams, activated during memory encoding and reactivated upon recall. An engram consists of a network of cells that undergo long-lasting modifications of their transcriptional programs and connectivity. Ground-breaking advancements in this field have been made possible by the creative exploitation of the characteristic transcriptional responses of neurons to activity, allowing both engram labeling and manipulation. Nevertheless, numerous aspects of engram cell-type composition and function remain to be addressed. As recent transcriptomic studies have revealed, memory encoding induces persistent transcriptional and functional changes in a plethora of neuronal subtypes and non-neuronal cells, including glutamatergic excitatory neurons, GABAergic inhibitory neurons, and glia cells. Dissecting the contribution of these different cellular classes to memory engram formation and activity is quite a challenging yet essential endeavor. In this review, we focus on the role played by the GABAergic inhibitory component of the engram through two complementary lenses. On one hand, we report on available physiological evidence addressing the involvement of inhibitory neurons to different stages of memory formation, consolidation, storage and recall. On the other, we capitalize on a growing number of transcriptomic studies that profile the transcriptional response of inhibitory neurons to activity, revealing important clues on their potential involvement in learning and memory processes. The picture that emerges suggests that inhibitory neurons are an essential component of the engram, likely involved in engram allocation, in tuning engram excitation and in storing the memory trace.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2021.684977</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The main goal of scientific research is to uncover new knowledge to understand reality. In the field of life sciences, the aim of translational research—to transfer results “from bench to bedside”—has to contend with the problem that the knowledge acquired at the “bench” is often not reproducible at the “bedside,” raising the question whether scientific discoveries truly mirror the real world. As a result, researchers constantly struggle to overcome the dichotomy between methodological problems and expectations, as funding agencies and industries demand expandable and quick results whereas patients, who are uninterested in the epistemological dispute, only ask for an effective cure. Despite the numerous attempts made to address reproducibility and reliability issues, some essential pitfalls of scientific investigations are often overlooked. Here, we discuss some limitations of the conventional scientific method and how researcher cognitive bias and conceptual errors have the potential to steer an experimental study away from the search for the vera causa of a phenomenon. As an example, we focus on Alzheimer’s disease research and on some problems that may have undermined most of the clinical trials conducted to investigate it.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Integrative Neuroscience: Mammalian Neuronal mRNA Transport Complexes: The Few Knowns and the Many Unknowns</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnint.2021.692948</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Hundreds of messenger RNAs (mRNAs) are transported into neurites to provide templates for the assembly of local protein networks. These networks enable a neuron to configure different cellular domains for specialized functions. According to current evidence, mRNAs are mostly transported in rather small packages of one to three copies, rarely containing different transcripts. This opens up fascinating logistic problems: how are hundreds of different mRNA cargoes sorted into distinct packages and how are they coupled to and released from motor proteins to produce the observed mRNA distributions? Are all mRNAs transported by the same transport machinery, or are there different adaptors or motors for different transcripts or classes of mRNAs? A variety of often indirect evidence exists for the involvement of proteins in mRNA localization, but relatively little is known about the essential activities required for the actual transport process. Here, we summarize the different types of available evidence for interactions that connect mammalian mRNAs to motor proteins to highlight at which point further research is needed to uncover critical missing links. We further argue that a combination of discovery approaches reporting direct interactions, in vitro reconstitution, and fast perturbations in cells is an ideal future strategy to unravel essential interactions and specific functions of proteins in mRNA transport processes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Central Nervous System-Endogenous TLR7 and TLR9 Induce Different Immune Responses and Effects on Experimental Autoimmune Encephalomyelitis</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.685645</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Innate receptors, including Toll like receptors (TLRs), are implicated in pathogenesis of CNS inflammatory diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS) and its animal model experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). TLR response to pathogens or endogenous signals includes production of immunoregulatory mediators. One of these, interferon (IFN)β, a Type I IFN, plays a protective role in MS and EAE. We have previously shown that intrathecal administration of selected TLR ligands induced IFNβ and infiltration of blood-derived myeloid cells into the central nervous system (CNS), and suppressed EAE in mice. We have now extended these studies to evaluate a potential therapeutic role for CNS-endogenous TLR7 and TLR9. Intrathecal application of Imiquimod (TLR7 ligand) or CpG oligonucleotide (TLR9 ligand) into CNS of otherwise unmanipulated mice induced IFNβ expression, with greater magnitude in response to CpG. CD45+ cells in the meninges were identified as source of IFNβ. Intrathecal CpG induced infiltration of monocytes, neutrophils, CD4+ T cells and NK cells whereas Imiquimod did not recruit blood-derived CD45+ cells. CpG, but not Imiquimod, had a beneficial effect on EAE, when given at time of disease onset. This therapeutic effect of CpG on EAE was not seen in mice lacking the Type I IFN receptor. In mice with EAE treated with CpG, the proportion of monocytes was significantly increased in the CNS. Infiltrating cells were predominantly localized to spinal cord meninges and demyelination was significantly reduced compared to non-treated mice with EAE. Our findings show that TLR7 and TLR9 signaling induce distinct inflammatory responses in the CNS with different outcome in EAE and point to recruitment of blood-derived cells and IFNβ induction as possible mechanistic links between TLR9 stimulation and amelioration of EAE. The protective role of TLR9 signaling in the CNS may have application in treatment of diseases such as MS.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: [18F]FDG PET/CT Studies in Transgenic Hualpha-Syn (A53T) Parkinson’s Disease Mouse Model of α-Synucleinopathy</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.676257</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Transgenic mice line M83 that express the A53T mutant α–synuclein protein at six times the level of endogenous mice α–synuclein are a model of α-synucleinopathy found in Parkinson’s disease (PD). This Hualpha-Syn (A53T) PD model is useful in assessing non-motor deficits at earlier stages of onset of PD. We report findings on metabolic changes using [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]FDG PET/CT in the Hualpha-Syn (A53T) PD mouse model in comparison to non-carrier mice. Whole-body PET/CT imaging of male and female mice were carried out 2 h after [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]FDG ip administration under 3% isoflurane anesthesia. Brain images were analyzed with PET images coregistered to a mouse brain MRI template. Hualpha-Syn (A53T) mice had significantly lower [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]FDG uptake in several brain regions compared to the no-carrier mice. Significant hind limb muscle and lower spinal cord [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]FDG hypometabolism at 9 months of age in A53T PD mice was also indicative of neurodegenerative disease, with a progressive motoric dysfunction leading to death. Significant decrease (up to 30%) in [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]FDG uptake were observed in 9-month old male and female Hualpha-Syn (A53) mice. This is consistent with the cortical hypometabolism in PD patients. Hualpha-Syn (A53) mice may thus be a suitable model for studies related to PD α-synucleinopathy for the discovery of new biomarkers.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.667932</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In this study, we propose a complementary-metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) image sensor with a self-resetting system demonstrating a high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) to detect small intrinsic signals such as a hemodynamic reaction or neural activity in a mouse brain. The photodiode structure was modified from N-well/P-sub to P+/N-well/P-sub to increase the photodiode capacitance to reduce the number of self-resets required to decrease the unstable stage. Moreover, our new relay board was used for the first time. As a result, an effective SNR of over 70 dB was achieved within the same pixel size and fill factor. The unstable state was drastically reduced. Thus, we will be able to detect neural activity. With its compact size, this device has significant potential to become an intrinsic signal detector in freely moving animals. We also demonstrated in vivo imaging with image processing by removing additional noise from the self-reset operation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.663174</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Flexible polymer neural probes are an attractive emerging approach for invasive brain recordings, given that they can minimize the risks of brain damage or glial scaring. However, densely packed electrode sites, which can facilitate neuronal data analysis, are not widely available in flexible probes. Here, we present a new flexible polyimide neural probe, based on standard and low-cost lithography processes, which has 32 closely spaced 10 μm diameter gold electrode sites at two different depths from the probe surface arranged in a matrix, with inter-site distances of only 5 μm. The double-layer design and fabrication approach implemented also provides additional stiffening just sufficient to prevent probe buckling during brain insertion. This approach avoids typical laborious augmentation strategies used to increase flexible probes’ mechanical rigidity while allowing a small brain insertion footprint. Chemical composition analysis and metrology of structural, mechanical, and electrical properties demonstrated the viability of this fabrication approach. Finally, in vivo functional assessment tests in the mouse cortex were performed as well as histological assessment of the insertion footprint, validating the biological applicability of this flexible neural probe for acquiring high quality neuronal recordings with high signal to noise ratio (SNR) and reduced acute trauma.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Bundle-Specific Axon Diameter Index as a New Contrast to Differentiate White Matter Tracts</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.646034</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In the central nervous system of primates, several pathways are characterized by different spectra of axon diameters. In vivo methods, based on diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging, can provide axon diameter index estimates non-invasively. However, such methods report voxel-wise estimates, which vary from voxel-to-voxel for the same white matter bundle due to partial volume contributions from other pathways having different microstructure properties. Here, we propose a novel microstructure-informed tractography approach, COMMIT&lt;sub&gt;AxSize&lt;/sub&gt;, to resolve axon diameter index estimates at the streamline level, thus making the estimates invariant along trajectories. Compared to previously proposed voxel-wise methods, our formulation allows the estimation of a distinct axon diameter index value for each streamline, directly, furnishing a complementary measure to the existing calculation of the mean value along the bundle. We demonstrate the favourable performance of our approach comparing our estimates with existing histologically-derived measurements performed in the corpus callosum and the posterior limb of the internal capsule. Overall, our method provides a more robust estimation of the axon diameter index of pathways by jointly estimating the microstructure properties of the tissue and the macroscopic organisation of the white matter connectivity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroinformatics: A Quick and Easy Way to Estimate Entropy and Mutual Information for Neuroscience</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fninf.2021.596443</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Calculations of entropy of a signal or mutual information between two variables are valuable analytical tools in the field of neuroscience. They can be applied to all types of data, capture non-linear interactions and are model independent. Yet the limited size and number of recordings one can collect in a series of experiments makes their calculation highly prone to sampling bias. Mathematical methods to overcome this so-called “sampling disaster” exist, but require significant expertise, great time and computational costs. As such, there is a need for a simple, unbiased and computationally efficient tool for estimating the level of entropy and mutual information. In this article, we propose that application of entropy-encoding compression algorithms widely used in text and image compression fulfill these requirements. By simply saving the signal in PNG picture format and measuring the size of the file on the hard drive, we can estimate entropy changes through different conditions. Furthermore, with some simple modifications of the PNG file, we can also estimate the evolution of mutual information between a stimulus and the observed responses through different conditions. We first demonstrate the applicability of this method using white-noise-like signals. Then, while this method can be used in all kind of experimental conditions, we provide examples of its application in patch-clamp recordings, detection of place cells and histological data. Although this method does not give an absolute value of entropy or mutual information, it is mathematically correct, and its simplicity and broad use make it a powerful tool for their estimation through experiments.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Exclusion of the Possibility of “False Ripples” From Ripple Band High-Frequency Oscillations Recorded From Scalp Electroencephalogram in Children With Epilepsy</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.696882</link>
	<content:encoded>Aim&lt;p&gt;Ripple-band epileptic high-frequency oscillations (HFOs) can be recorded by scalp electroencephalography (EEG), and tend to be associated with epileptic spikes. However, there is a concern that the filtration of steep waveforms such as spikes may cause spurious oscillations or “false ripples.” We excluded such possibility from at least some ripples by EEG differentiation, which, in theory, enhances high-frequency signals and does not generate spurious oscillations or ringing.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;The subjects were 50 pediatric patients, and ten consecutive spikes during sleep were selected for each patient. Five hundred spike data segments were initially reviewed by two experienced electroencephalographers using consensus to identify the presence or absence of ripples in the ordinary filtered EEG and an associated spectral blob in time-frequency analysis (Session A). These EEG data were subjected to numerical differentiation (the second derivative was denoted as EEG″). The EEG″ trace of each spike data segment was shown to two other electroencephalographers who judged independently whether there were clear ripple oscillations or uncertain ripple oscillations or an absence of oscillations (Session B).&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;In Session A, ripples were identified in 57 spike data segments (Group A-R), but not in the other 443 data segments (Group A-N). In Session B, both reviewers identified clear ripples (strict criterion) in 11 spike data segments, all of which were in Group A-R (p &amp;lt; 0.0001 by Fisher’s exact test). When the extended criterion that included clear and/or uncertain ripples was used in Session B, both reviewers identified 25 spike data segments that fulfilled the criterion: 24 of these were in Group A-R (p &amp;lt; 0.0001).&lt;/p&gt;Discussion&lt;p&gt;We have demonstrated that real ripples over scalp spikes exist in a certain proportion of patients. Ripples that were visualized consistently using both ordinary filters and the EEG″ method should be true, but failure to clarify ripples using the EEG″ method does not mean that true ripples are absent.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;The numerical differentiation of EEG data provides convincing evidence that HFOs were detected in terms of the presence of such unusually fast oscillations over the scalp and the importance of this electrophysiological phenomenon.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Gender Beneath the Skull: Agency, Trauma and Persisting Stereotypes in Neuroepigenetics</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.667896</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Epigenetics stands in a complex relationship to issues of sex and gender. As a scientific field, it has been heavily criticized for disproportionately targeting the maternal body and reproducing deterministic views of biological sex (Kenney and Müller, 2017; Lappé, 2018; Richardson et al., 2014). And yet, it also represents the culmination of a long tradition of engaging with developmental biology as a feminist cause, because of the dispersal of the supposed ‘master code’ of DNA among wider cellular, organismic and ecological contexts (Keller, 1988). In this paper, we explore a number of tensions at the intersection of sex, gender and trauma that are playing out in the emerging area of neuroepigenetics - a relatively new subfield of epigenetics specifically interested in environment-brain relations through epigenetic modifications in neurons. Using qualitative interviews with leading scientists, we explore how trauma is conceptualized in neuroepigenetics, paying attention to its gendered dimensions. We address a number of concerns raised by feminist STS researchers in regard to epigenetics, and illustrate why we believe close engagement with neuroepigenetic claims, and neuroepigenetic researchers themselves, is a crucial step for social scientists interested in questions of embodiment and trauma. We argue this for three reasons: (1) Neuroepigenetic studies are recognizing the agential capacities of biological materials such as genes, neurotransmitters and methyl groups, and how they influence memory formation; (2) Neuroepigenetic conceptions of trauma are yet to be robustly coupled with social and anthropological theories of violence (Eliot, 2021; Nelson, 2021; Walby, 2013); (3) In spite of the gendered assumptions we find in neuroepigenetics, there are fruitful spaces – through collaboration – to be conceptualizing gender beyond culture-biology and nature-nurture binaries (Lock and Nguyen, 2010). To borrow Gravlee’s (2009: 51) phrase, we find reason for social scientists to consider how gender is not only constructed, but how it may “become biology” via epigenetic and other biological pathways. Ultimately, we argue that a robust epigenetic methodology is one which values the integrity of expertise outside its own field, and can have an open, not empty mind to cross-disciplinary dialogue.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Design Considerations for Long Term Non-invasive Brain Computer Interface Training With Tetraplegic CYBATHLON Pilot</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.648275</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Several studies in the recent past have demonstrated how Brain Computer Interface (BCI) technology can uncover the neural mechanisms underlying various tasks and translate them into control commands. While a multitude of studies have demonstrated the theoretic potential of BCI, a point of concern is that the studies are still confined to lab settings and mostly limited to healthy, able-bodied subjects. The CYBATHLON 2020 BCI race represents an opportunity to further develop BCI design strategies for use in real-time applications with a tetraplegic end user. In this study, as part of the preparation to participate in CYBATHLON 2020 BCI race, we investigate the design aspects of BCI in relation to the choice of its components, in particular, the type of calibration paradigm and its relevance for long-term use. The end goal was to develop a user-friendly and engaging interface suited for long-term use, especially for a spinal-cord injured (SCI) patient. We compared the efficacy of conventional open-loop calibration paradigms with real-time closed-loop paradigms, using pre-trained BCI decoders. Various indicators of performance were analyzed for this study, including the resulting classification performance, game completion time, brain activation maps, and also subjective feedback from the pilot. Our results show that the closed-loop calibration paradigms with real-time feedback is more engaging for the pilot. They also show an indication of achieving better online median classification performance as compared to conventional calibration paradigms (p = 0.0008). We also observe that stronger and more localized brain activation patterns are elicited in the closed-loop paradigm in which the experiment interface closely resembled the end application. Thus, based on this longitudinal evaluation of single-subject data, we demonstrate that BCI-based calibration paradigms with active user-engagement, such as with real-time feedback, could help in achieving better user acceptability and performance.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Narrowband Resting-State fNIRS Functional Connectivity in Autism Spectrum Disorder</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.643410</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Hemispheric asymmetry in the power spectrum of low-frequency spontaneous hemodynamic fluctuations has been previously observed in autism spectrum disorder (ASD). This observation may imply a specific narrow-frequency band in which individuals with ASD could show more significant alteration in resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC). To test this assumption, we evaluated narrowband RSFC at several frequencies for functional near-infrared spectroscopy signals recorded from the bilateral temporal lobes on 25 children with ASD and 22 typically developing (TD) children. In several narrow-frequency bands, we observed altered interhemispheric RSFC in ASD. However, in the band of 0.01–0.02 Hz, more mirrored channel pairs (or cortical sites) showed significantly weaker RSFC in the ASD group. Receiver operating characteristic analysis further demonstrated that RSFC in the narrowband of 0.01–0.02 Hz might have better differentiation ability between the ASD and TD groups. This may indicate that the narrowband RSFC could serve as a characteristic for the prediction of ASD.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience: A Network Architecture for Bidirectional Neurovascular Coupling in Rat Whisker Barrel Cortex</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2021.638700</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Neurovascular coupling is typically considered as a master-slave relationship between the neurons and the cerebral vessels: the neurons demand energy which the vessels supply in the form of glucose and oxygen. In the recent past, both theoretical and experimental studies have suggested that the neurovascular coupling is a bidirectional system, a loop that includes a feedback signal from the vessels influencing neural firing and plasticity. An integrated model of bidirectionally connected neural network and the vascular network is hence required to understand the relationship between the informational and metabolic aspects of neural dynamics. In this study, we present a computational model of the bidirectional neurovascular system in the whisker barrel cortex and study the effect of such coupling on neural activity and plasticity as manifest in the whisker barrel map formation. In this model, a biologically plausible self-organizing network model of rate coded, dynamic neurons is nourished by a network of vessels modeled using the biophysical properties of blood vessels. The neural layer which is designed to simulate the whisker barrel cortex of rat transmits vasodilatory signals to the vessels. The feedback from the vessels is in the form of available oxygen for oxidative metabolism whose end result is the adenosine triphosphate (ATP) necessary to fuel neural firing. The model captures the effect of the feedback from the vascular network on the neuronal map formation in the whisker barrel model under normal and pathological (Hypoxia and Hypoxia-Ischemia) conditions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Pre-Bötzinger complex (PBC) neurons located in mammalian brain are the necessary conditions to produce respiratory rhythm, which has been widely verified experimentally and numerically. At present, one of the two different types of bursting mechanisms found in PBC mainly depends on the calcium-activated of non-specific cation current (I&lt;sub&gt;CaN&lt;/sub&gt;). In order to study the influence of I&lt;sub&gt;CaN&lt;/sub&gt; and stimulus current I&lt;sub&gt;exc&lt;/sub&gt; in PBC inspiratory neurons, a single compartment model was simplified, and firing patterns of the model was discussed by using stability theory, bifurcation analysis, fast, and slow decomposition technology combined with numerical simulation. Under the stimulation of different somatic applied currents, the firing behavior of neurons are studied and exhibit multiple mix bursting patterns, which is helpful to further understand the mechanism of respiratory rhythms of PBC neurons.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.692762</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Aminoglycosides, a class of clinically important drugs, are widely used worldwide against gram-negative bacterial infections. However, there is growing evidence that aminoglycosides can cause hearing loss or balance problems. In this article, we mainly introduce the main mechanism of ototoxicity induced by aminoglycosides. Genetic analysis showed that the susceptibility of aminoglycosides was attributable to mutations in mtDNA, especially A1555G and C1494T mutations in 12S rRNA. In addition, the overexpression of NMDA receptors and the formation of free radicals also play an important role. Understanding the mechanism of ototoxicity induced by aminoglycosides is helpful to develop new therapeutic methods to protect hearing. In this article, the prevention methods of ototoxicity induced by aminoglycosides were introduced from the upstream and downstream aspects.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Huntingtin and the Synapse</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.689332</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Huntington disease (HD) is a monogenic disease that results in a combination of motor, psychiatric and cognitive symptoms. HD is caused by a CAG trinucleotide repeat expansion in the huntingtin (HTT) gene, which results in the production of a pathogenic mutant HTT protein (mHTT). Although there is no cure at present for HD, a number of RNA-targeting therapies have recently entered clinical trials which aim to lower mHTT production through the use of antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) and RNAi. However, many of these treatment strategies are non-selective in that they cannot differentiate between non-pathogenic wild type HTT (wtHTT) and the mHTT variant. As HD patients are already born with decreased levels of wtHTT, these genetic therapies may result in critically low levels of wtHTT. The consequence of wtHTT reduction in the adult brain is currently under debate, and here we argue that wtHTT loss is not well-tolerated at the synaptic level. Synaptic dysfunction is an extremely sensitive measure of subsequent cell death, and is known to precede neurodegeneration in numerous brain diseases including HD. The present review focuses on the prominent role of wtHTT at the synapse and considers the consequences of wtHTT loss on both pre- and postsynaptic function. We discuss how wtHTT is implicated in virtually all major facets of synaptic neurotransmission including anterograde and retrograde transport of proteins to/from terminal buttons and dendrites, neurotransmitter release, endocytic vesicle recycling, and postsynaptic receptor localization and recycling. We conclude that wtHTT presence is essential for proper synaptic function.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Analysing Intercellular Communication in Astrocytic Networks Using “Astral”</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.689268</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Astrocytic networks are critically involved in regulating the activity of neuronal networks. However, a comprehensive and ready-to-use data analysis tool for investigating functional interactions between the astrocytes is missing. We developed the novel software package named “Astral” to analyse intercellular communication in astrocytic networks based on live-cell calcium imaging. Our method for analysing calcium imaging data does not require the assignment of regions of interest. The package contains two applications: the core processing pipeline for detecting and quantifying Ca&lt;sup&gt;++&lt;/sup&gt; events, and the auxiliary visualization tool for controlling data quality. Our method allows for the network-wide quantification of Ca&lt;sup&gt;++&lt;/sup&gt; events and the analysis of their intercellular propagation. In a set of proof-of-concept experiments, we examined Ca&lt;sup&gt;++&lt;/sup&gt; events in flat monolayers of primary astrocytes and confirmed that inter-astrocytic interactions depend on the permeability of gap junctions and connexin hemichannels. The Astral tool is particularly useful for studying astrocyte-neuronal interactions on the network level. We demonstrate that compared with purely astrocytic cultures, spontaneous generation of Ca&lt;sup&gt;++&lt;/sup&gt; events in astrocytes that were co-cultivated with neurons was significantly increased. Interestingly, the increased astrocytic Ca&lt;sup&gt;++&lt;/sup&gt; activity after long-term co-cultivation with neurons was driven by the enhanced formation of gap junctions and connexin hemichannels but was not affected by silencing neuronal activity. Our data indicate the necessity for systematic investigation of astrocyte-neuronal interactions at the network level. For this purpose, the Astral software offers a powerful tool for processing and quantifying calcium imaging data.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Developmental Changes in Peripherin-eGFP Expression in Spiral Ganglion Neurons</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.678113</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The two types of spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs), types I and II, innervate inner hair cells and outer hair cells, respectively, within the mammalian cochlea and send another process back to cochlear nuclei in the hindbrain. Studying these two neuronal types has been made easier with the identification of unique molecular markers. One of these markers, peripherin, was shown using antibodies to be present in all SGNs initially but becomes specific to type II SGNs during maturation. We used mice with fluorescently labeled peripherin (Prph-eGFP) to examine peripherin expression in SGNs during development and in aged mice. Using these mice, we confirm the initial expression of Prph-eGFP in both types I and II neurons and eventual restriction to only type II perikarya shortly after birth. However, while Prph-eGFP is uniquely expressed within type II cell bodies by P8, both types I and II peripheral and central processes continue to express Prph-eGFP for some time before becoming downregulated. Only at P30 was there selective type II Prph-eGFP expression in central but not peripheral processes. By 9 months, only the type II cell bodies and more distal central processes retain Prph-eGFP expression. Our results show that Prph-eGFP is a reliable marker for type II SGN cell bodies beyond P8; however, it is not generally a suitable marker for type II processes, except for central processes beyond P30. How the changes in Prph-eGFP expression relate to subsequent protein expression remains to be explored.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Microglial Implications in SARS-CoV-2 Infection and COVID-19: Lessons From Viral RNA Neurotropism and Possible Relevance to Parkinson’s Disease</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.670298</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Since December 2019, humankind has been experiencing a ravaging severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) outbreak, the second coronavirus pandemic in a decade after the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) disease in 2012. Infection with SARS-CoV-2 results in Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which is responsible for over 3.1 million deaths worldwide. With the emergence of a second and a third wave of infection across the globe, and the rising record of multiple reinfections and relapses, SARS-CoV-2 infection shows no sign of abating. In addition, it is now evident that SARS-CoV-2 infection presents with neurological symptoms that include early hyposmia, ischemic stroke, meningitis, delirium and falls, even after viral clearance. This may suggest chronic or permanent changes to the neurons, glial cells, and/or brain vasculature in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection or COVID-19. Within the central nervous system (CNS), microglia act as the central housekeepers against altered homeostatic states, including during viral neurotropic infections. In this review, we highlight microglial responses to viral neuroinfections, especially those with a similar genetic composition and route of entry as SARS-CoV-2. As the primary sensor of viral infection in the CNS, we describe the pathogenic and neuroinvasive mechanisms of RNA viruses and SARS-CoV-2 vis-à-vis the microglial means of viral recognition. Responses of microglia which may culminate in viral clearance or immunopathology are also covered. Lastly, we further discuss the implication of SARS-CoV-2 CNS invasion on microglial plasticity and associated long-term neurodegeneration. As such, this review provides insight into some of the mechanisms by which microglia could contribute to the pathophysiology of post-COVID-19 neurological sequelae and disorders, including Parkinson’s disease, which could be pervasive in the coming years given the growing numbers of infected and re-infected individuals globally.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Investigation of a Model-Based Working Memory Training With and Without Distractor Inhibition and Its Comparative Efficacy: A Randomized Controlled Trial on Healthy Old Adults</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.682474</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Background: Various working memory (WM) trainings have been tested, but differences in experimental designs, the lack of theoretical background, and the need of identifying task-related processes such as filtering efficiency limit conclusions about their comparative efficacy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Objectives: In this study, we compared the efficacy of a model-based WM training with (MB&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) and without (MB) distractor inhibition on improving WM capacity to a dual n-back and active control condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: This randomized clinical trial included 123 healthy elderly adults (78 women, 45 men; aged 64.1 ± 8.3 years). All groups underwent 12 40-min training sessions over 3 weeks and four cognitive testing sessions. The first two sessions served as double baseline to account for practice effects. Primary outcome was WM capacity post-training measured by complex span tasks. Near and far transfer was assessed by simple span, n-back, visuospatial and verbal learning, processing speed, and reasoning tasks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Due to preliminary termination (COVID-19), 93 subjects completed the post-training and 60 subjects the follow-up session. On a whole group level, practice effects occurred from prebaseline to baseline in WM capacity (b = 4.85, t&lt;sub&gt;(103)&lt;/sub&gt; = 4.01, p &amp;lt; 0.001, r = 0.37). Linear mixed-effects models revealed a difference in WM capacity post-training between MB&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and MB (b = −9.62, t&lt;sub&gt;(82)&lt;/sub&gt; = −2.52, p = 0.014, r = 0.27) and a trend difference between MB&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and dual n-back (b = −7.59, t&lt;sub&gt;(82)&lt;/sub&gt; = −1.87, p = 0.065, r = 0.20) and control training (b = −7.08, t&lt;sub&gt;(82)&lt;/sub&gt; = −1.86, p = 0.067, r = 0.20). Univariate analyses showed an increase between pre- and post-training for WM capacity within MB&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; (t&lt;sub&gt;(22)&lt;/sub&gt; = −3.34, p &amp;lt; 0.05) only. There was no difference between groups pre- and post-training regarding near and far transfer. Univariate analyses showed improved visuospatial learning within MB&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; (t&lt;sub&gt;(21)&lt;/sub&gt; = −3.8, p &amp;lt; 0.05), improved processing speed (t&lt;sub&gt;(23)&lt;/sub&gt; = 2.19, p&amp;lt; 0.05) and n-back performance (t&lt;sub&gt;(23)&lt;/sub&gt; = 2.12, p &amp;lt; 0.05) in MB, and improved n-back performance (t&lt;sub&gt;(25)&lt;/sub&gt; = 3.83, p &amp;lt; 0.001) in the dual n-back training.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interpretation: A model-based WM training including filtering efficacy may be a promising approach to increase WM capacity and needs further investigation in randomized controlled studies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Age-Related Alterations in DTI Metrics in the Human Brain—Consequences for Age Correction</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.682109</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Background: Over the life span, the diffusion metrics in brain MRI show different, partly nonlinear changes. These age-dependent changes also seem to exhibit regional differences with respect to the brain anatomy. The age correction of a study cohort's diffusion metrics might thus require consideration of age-related factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Diffusion tensor imaging data sets were acquired from 219 healthy participants at ages between 19 and 81 years. Fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), and axial and radial diffusivity (AD and RD, respectively) maps were analyzed by a tract of interest-based fiber tracking approach. To describe diffusion metrics as a function of the participant age, linear splines were used to perform curve fitting in 21 specific tract systems covering different functional areas and diffusion directions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: In the majority of tracts, an interpolation with a change of alteration rate during adult life described the diffusion properties more accurately than a linear model. Consequently, the diffusion properties remained relatively stable until a decrease (of FA) or increase (of MD, AD, and RD) started at a region-specific time point, whereas a uniform change of diffusion properties was observed only in a few tracts. Single tracts, e.g., located in the cerebellum, remained nearly unaltered throughout the ages between 19 and 81 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: Age corrections of diffusion properties should not be applied to all white matter regions and all age spans in the same way. Therefore, we propose three different approaches for age correction based on fiber tracking techniques, i.e., no correction for areas that do not experience age-related changes and two variants of an age correction depending on the age range of the cohort and the tracts considered.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.669612</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common fatal neurodegenerative disease of the elderly worldwide. The identification of AD biomarkers will allow for earlier diagnosis and thus earlier intervention. The aim of this study was to find such biomarkers. It was observed that the expression of Alix was significantly decreased in brain tissues and serum samples from AD patients compared to the controls. A significant correlation between Alix levels and cognitive decline was observed (r = 0.80; p &amp;lt; 0.001) as well as a significant negative correlation between Alix and Aβ&lt;sub&gt;40&lt;/sub&gt; in serum levels (r =−0.60, p &amp;lt; 0.001). The receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis showed the area under the curve (AUC) of Alix was 0.80, and the optimal cut-off point of 199.5 pg/ml was selected with the highest sum of sensitivity and specificity. The diagnostic accuracy for serum Alix was 74%, with 76% sensitivity and 71% specificity respectively, which could differentiate AD from controls. In addition, the expression of Alix was found to be significantly decreased in AD compared to vascular dementia (VaD). ROC analysis between AD and VaD showed that the AUC was 0.777, which could be indicative of the role of serum Alix as a biomarker in the differential diagnosis between AD and VaD. Most surprisingly, the decreased expression of Alix was attenuated after the treatment of Memantine in different AD animal models. In conclusion, our results indicate the possibility of serum Alix as a novel and non-invasive biomarker for AD for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Role of Neuron and Glia in Alzheimer’s Disease and Associated Vascular Dysfunction</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.653334</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Amyloidogenicity and vascular dysfunction are the key players in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), involving dysregulated cellular interactions. An intricate balance between neurons, astrocytes, microglia, oligodendrocytes and vascular cells sustains the normal neuronal circuits. Conversely, cerebrovascular diseases overlap neuropathologically with AD, and glial dyshomeostasis promotes AD-associated neurodegenerative cascade. While pathological hallmarks of AD primarily include amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, microvascular disorders, altered cerebral blood flow (CBF), and blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability induce neuronal loss and synaptic atrophy. Accordingly, microglia-mediated inflammation and astrogliosis disrupt the homeostasis of the neuro-vascular unit and stimulate infiltration of circulating leukocytes into the brain. Large-scale genetic and epidemiological studies demonstrate a critical role of cellular crosstalk for altered immune response, metabolism, and vasculature in AD. The glia associated genetic risk factors include APOE, TREM2, CD33, PGRN, CR1, and NLRP3, which correlate with the deposition and altered phagocytosis of Aβ. Moreover, aging-dependent downregulation of astrocyte and microglial Aβ-degrading enzymes limits the neurotrophic and neurogenic role of glial cells and inhibits lysosomal degradation and clearance of Aβ. Microglial cells secrete IGF-1, and neurons show a reduced responsiveness to the neurotrophic IGF-1R/IRS-2/PI3K signaling pathway, generating amyloidogenic and vascular dyshomeostasis in AD. Glial signals connect to neural stem cells, and a shift in glial phenotype over the AD trajectory even affects adult neurogenesis and the neurovascular niche. Overall, the current review informs about the interaction of neuronal and glial cell types in AD pathogenesis and its critical association with cerebrovascular dysfunction.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: The cryptic gonadotropin-releasing hormone neuronal system of human basal ganglia</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/67714</link>
	<content:encoded>Human reproduction is controlled by ~2,000 hypothalamic gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons. Here we report the discovery and characterization of additional ~150,000-200,000 GnRH-synthesizing cells in the human basal ganglia and basal forebrain. Nearly all extrahypothalamic GnRH neurons expressed the cholinergic marker enzyme choline acetyltransferase. Similarly, hypothalamic GnRH neurons were also cholinergic both in embryonic and adult human brains. Whole-transcriptome analysis of cholinergic interneurons and medium spiny projection neurons laser-microdissected from the human putamen showed selective expression of &lt;i&gt;GNRH1&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;GNRHR1&lt;/i&gt; autoreceptors in the cholinergic cell population and uncovered the detailed transcriptome profile and molecular connectome of these two cell types. Higher-order non-reproductive functions regulated by GnRH under physiological conditions in the human basal ganglia and basal forebrain require clarification. The role and changes of GnRH/GnRHR1 signaling in neurodegenerative disorders affecting cholinergic neurocircuitries, including Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases, need to be explored.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: Biosynthesis of a sulfated exopolysaccharide, synechan, and bloom formation in the model cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. strain PCC 6803</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/66538</link>
	<content:encoded>Extracellularpolysaccharides of bacteria contribute to biofilm formation, stress tolerance, and infectivity. Cyanobacteria, the oxygenic photoautotrophic bacteria, uniquely produce sulfated extracellular polysaccharides among bacteria to support phototrophic biofilms. In addition, sulfated polysaccharides of cyanobacteria and other organisms have been focused as beneficial biomaterial. However, very little is known about their biosynthesis machinery and function in cyanobacteria. Here, we found that the model cyanobacterium, &lt;i&gt;Synechocystis&lt;/i&gt; sp. strain PCC 6803, formed bloom-like cell aggregates embedded in sulfated extracellular polysaccharides (designated as synechan) and identified whole set of genes responsible for synechan biosynthesis and its transcriptional regulation, thereby suggesting a model for the synechan biosynthesis apparatus. Because similar genes are found in many cyanobacterial genomes with wide variation, our findings may lead elucidation of various sulfated polysaccharides, their functions, and their potential application in biotechnology.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/66398</link>
	<content:encoded>We previously reported xanthohumol (XN), and its synthetic derivative tetrahydro-XN (TXN), attenuates high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity and metabolic syndrome in C57Bl/6J mice. The objective of the current study was to determine the effect of XN and TXN on lipid accumulation in the liver. Non-supplemented mice were unable to adapt their caloric intake to 60% HFD, resulting in obesity and hepatic steatosis; however, TXN reduced weight gain and decreased hepatic steatosis. Liver transcriptomics indicated that TXN might antagonize lipogenic PPARγ actions in vivo. XN and TXN inhibited rosiglitazone-induced 3T3-L1 cell differentiation concomitant with decreased expression of lipogenesis-related genes. A peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) competitive binding assay showed that XN and TXN bind to PPARγ with an IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; similar to pioglitazone and 8–10 times stronger than oleate. Molecular docking simulations demonstrated that XN and TXN bind in the PPARγ ligand-binding domain pocket. Our findings are consistent with XN and TXN acting as antagonists of PPARγ.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Cardiometabolic diseases are an increasing global health burden. While socioeconomic, environmental, behavioural, and genetic risk factors have been identified, a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms is required to develop more effective interventions. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been used to assess organ health, but biobank-scale studies are still in their infancy. Using over 38,000 abdominal MRI scans in the UK Biobank, we used deep learning to quantify volume, fat, and iron in seven organs and tissues, and demonstrate that imaging-derived phenotypes reflect health status. We show that these traits have a substantial heritable component (8–44%) and identify 93 independent genome-wide significant associations, including four associations with liver traits that have not previously been reported. Our work demonstrates the tractability of deep learning to systematically quantify health parameters from high-throughput MRI across a range of organs and tissues, and use the largest-ever study of its kind to generate new insights into the genetic architecture of these traits.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Humans refer to their mood state regularly in day-to-day as well as clinical interactions. Theoretical accounts suggest that when reporting on our mood we integrate over the history of our experiences; yet, the temporal structure of this integration remains unexamined. Here we use a computational approach to quantitatively answer this question and show that early events exert a stronger influence on reported mood compared to recent events. We show that a Primacy model accounts better for mood reports compared to a range of alternative temporal representations across random, consistent or dynamic reward environments, different age groups and in both healthy and depressed participants. Moreover, we find evidence for neural encoding of the Primacy, but not the Recency, model in frontal brain regions related to mood regulation. These findings hold implications for the timing of events in experimental or clinical settings and suggest new directions for individualized mood interventions.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: Establishment of H3K9me3-dependent heterochromatin during embryogenesis in Drosophila miranda</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/55612</link>
	<content:encoded>Heterochromatin is a key architectural feature of eukaryotic genomes crucial for silencing of repetitive elements. During Drosophila embryonic cellularization, heterochromatin rapidly appears over repetitive sequences but the molecular details of how heterochromatin is established are poorly understood. Here, we map the genome-wide distribution of H3K9me3-dependent heterochromatin in individual embryos of &lt;i&gt;Drosophila miranda&lt;/i&gt; at precisely-staged developmental time points. We find that canonical H3K9me3 enrichment is established prior to cellularization, and matures into stable and broad heterochromatin domains through development. Intriguingly, initial nucleation sites of H3K9me3 enrichment appear as early as embryonic stage3 over transposable elements (TE) and progressively broaden, consistent with spreading to neighboring nucleosomes. The earliest nucleation sites are limited to specific regions of a small number of recently active retrotransposon families and often appear over promoter and 5' regions of LTR retrotransposons, while late nucleation develops broadly across the entirety of most TEs. Interestingly, early nucleating TEs are strongly associated with abundant maternal piRNAs and show early zygotic transcription. These results support a model of piRNA-associated co-transcriptional silencing while also suggesting additional mechanisms for site-restricted H3K9me3 nucleation at TEs in pre-cellular &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; embryos.</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: Neuropeptides as potential modulators of behavioral transitions in the ant Cataglyphis nodus</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cne.25166?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>We highlighted the spatial distribution of the neuropeptides allatostatin‐A, corazonin, and tachykinin in the brain of Cataglyphis nodus desert ants. We further show behavioral‐stage‐related changes in allatostatin‐A and corazonin expression patterns. The results suggest that these neuropeptides are highly promising candidate modulators for major behavioral transitions of the ants.







Abstract
Age‐related behavioral plasticity is a major prerequisite for the ecological success of insect societies. Although ecological aspects of behavioral flexibility have been targeted in many studies, the underlying intrinsic mechanisms controlling the diverse changes in behavior along the individual life history of social insects are not completely understood. Recently, the neuropeptides allatostatin‐A, corazonin, and tachykinin have been associated with the regulation of behavioral transitions in social insects. Here, we investigated changes in brain localization and expression of these neuropeptides following major behavioral transitions in Cataglyphis nodus ants. Our immunohistochemical analyses in the brain revealed that the overall branching pattern of neurons immunoreactive (ir) for the three neuropeptides is largely independent of the behavioral stages. Numerous allatostatin‐A‐ and tachykinin‐ir neurons innervate primary sensory neuropils and high‐order integration centers of the brain. In contrast, the number of corazonergic neurons is restricted to only four neurons per brain hemisphere with cell bodies located in the pars lateralis and axons extending to the medial protocerebrum and the retrocerebral complex. Most interestingly, the cell‐body volumes of these neurons are significantly increased in foragers compared to freshly eclosed ants and interior workers. Quantification of mRNA expression levels revealed a stage‐related change in the expression of allatostatin‐A and corazonin mRNA in the brain. Given the presence of the neuropeptides in major control centers of the brain and the neurohemal organs, these mRNA‐changes strongly suggest an important modulatory role of both neuropeptides in the behavioral maturation of Cataglyphis ants.</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: Longitudinal intravital imaging nerve degeneration and sprouting in the toes of spared nerve injured mice</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cne.25162?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>We have developed a method for the longitudinal intravital observation of changes in peripheral nerve fibers. This method provides a high‐resolution approach for investigating epidermal and dermal nerve terminals as well as nerve plexuses and were extremely stable for at least 28 days. Using the SNI model, we found that the degeneration of the peripheral nerve terminals and plexuses over 2–3 days was aligned closely with the initiation of mechanical hypersensitivity. In addition, we obtained clear images of sprouting in the lateral part of the paw, which may be related to the maintenance of neuropathic pain symptoms.







Abstract
Neuropathic pain is pain caused by damage to the somatosensory nervous system. Both degenerating injured nerves and neighboring sprouting nerves can contribute to neuropathic pain. However, the mesoscale changes in cutaneous nerve fibers over time after the loss of the parent nerve has not been investigated in detail. In this study, we followed the changes in nerve fibers longitudinally in the toe tips of mice that had undergone spared nerve injury (SNI). Nav1.8‐tdTomato, Thy1‐GFP and MrgD‐GFP mice were used to observe the small and large cutaneous nerve fibers. We found that peripheral nerve plexuses degenerated within 3 days of nerve injury, and free nerve endings in the epidermis degenerated within 2 days. The timing of degeneration paralleled the initiation of mechanical hypersensitivity. We also found that some of the Nav1.8‐positive nerve plexuses and free nerve endings in the fifth toe survived, and sprouting occurred mostly from 7 to 28 days. The timing of the sprouting of nerve fibers in the fifth toe paralleled the maintenance phase of mechanical hypersensitivity. Our results support the hypotheses that both injured and intact nerve fibers participate in neuropathic pain, and that, specifically, nerve degeneration is related to the initiation of evoked pain and nerve sprouting is related to the maintenance of evoked pain.</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: As above, so below: Whole transcriptome profiling demonstrates strong molecular similarities between avian dorsal and ventral pallial subdivisions</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cne.25159?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>In 2013, our group examined the expression profiles of 50 genes to develop the continuum hypothesis of avian brain organization. It states that the subdivisions of the dorsal pallium develop continuously with those of the ventral pallium, resulting in a “partial mirror image” organization around the vestigial ventricle divide. However, these claims were challenged due to the small number of genes profiled. The present study uses RNA sequencing to profile the whole transcriptome (~20,000 genes) of the principal subdivisions of the avian telencephalon and confirms the remarkable molecularly similarities between the dorsal and ventral pallium. We recommend adopting a hierarchal nomenclature to reflect these robust molecular similarities.







Abstract
Over the last two decades, beginning with the Avian Brain Nomenclature Forum in 2000, major revisions have been made to our understanding of the organization and nomenclature of the avian brain. However, there are still unresolved questions on avian pallial organization, particularly whether the cells above the vestigial ventricle represent distinct populations to those below it or similar populations. To test these two hypotheses, we profiled the transcriptomes of the major avian pallial subdivisions dorsal and ventral to the vestigial ventricle boundary using RNA sequencing and a new zebra finch genome assembly containing about 22,000 annotated, complete genes. We found that the transcriptomes of neural populations above and below the ventricle were remarkably similar. Each subdivision in dorsal pallium (Wulst) had a corresponding molecular counterpart in the ventral pallium (dorsal ventricular ridge). In turn, each corresponding subdivision exhibited shared gene co‐expression modules that contained gene sets enriched in functional specializations, such as anatomical structure development, synaptic transmission, signaling, and neurogenesis. These findings are more in line with the continuum hypothesis of avian brain subdivision organization above and below the vestigial ventricle space, with the pallium as a whole consisting of four major cell populations (intercalated pallium, mesopallium, hyper‐nidopallium, and arcopallium) instead of seven (hyperpallium apicale, interstitial hyperpallium apicale, intercalated hyperpallium, hyperpallium densocellare, mesopallium, nidopallium, and arcopallium). We suggest adopting a more streamlined hierarchical naming system that reflects the robust similarities in gene expression, neural connectivity motifs, and function. These findings have important implications for our understanding of overall vertebrate brain evolution.</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: Controlling for activity‐dependent genes and behavioral states is critical for determining brain relationships within and across species</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cne.25157?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>In 2016, Puelles et al. sought to determine the relationship of avian and mammalian pallial regions using the expression profile of the NR4A2 nuclear orphan receptor, concluding that the lateral avian mesopallium was most like the mammalian claustrum, not layer 2 of the cortex as found by Suzuki and Hirata (Frontiers in Neuroanatomy, 2014, 8, 783). However, we found that the NR4A2 expression patterns were characteristic of an activity‐dependent gene. Looking at different behavioral contexts in the zebra finch, we found induced expression of NR4A2 in regions across the pallium associated with visual, somatosensory, and motor activity, confounding and contradicting previous findings. Accordingly, we do not believe NR4A2 is a suitable gene for assessing homologous brain anatomy without understanding the animal's behavioral state.







Abstract
The genetic profile of vertebrate pallia has long driven debate on homology across distantly related clades. Based on an expression profile of the orphan nuclear receptor NR4A2 in mouse and chicken brains, Puelles et al. (The Journal of Comparative Neurology, 2016, 524, 665–703) concluded that the avian lateral mesopallium is homologous to the mammalian claustrum, and the medial mesopallium homologous to the insula cortex. They argued that their findings contradict conclusions by Jarvis et al. (The Journal of Comparative Neurology, 2013, 521, 3614–3665) and Chen et al. (The Journal of Comparative Neurology, 2013, 521, 3666–3701) that the hyperpallium densocellare is instead a mesopallium cell population, and by Suzuki and Hirata (Frontiers in Neuroanatomy, 2014, 8, 783) that the avian mesopallium is homologous to mammalian cortical layers 2/3. Here, we find that NR4A2 is an activity‐dependent gene and cannot be used to determine brain organization or species relationships without considering behavioral state. Activity‐dependent NR4A2 expression has been previously demonstrated in the rodent brain, with the highest induction occurring within the claustrum, amygdala, deep and superficial cortical layers, and hippocampus. In the zebra finch, we find that NR4A2 is constitutively expressed in the arcopallium, but induced in parts of the mesopallium, and in sparse cells within the hyperpallium, depending on animal stimulus or behavioral state. Basal and induced NR4A2 expression patterns do not discount the previously named avian hyperpallium densocellare as dorsal mesopallium and conflict with proposed homology between the avian mesopallium and mammalian claustrum/insula at the exclusion of other brain regions. Broadly, these findings highlight the importance of controlling for behavioral state and neural activity to genetically define brain cell population relationships within and across species.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Long‐term stress is linked to depression in humans. We used a rat learned helplessness model of depression to study the effects on synaptic proteins important for plasticity. With quantitative immunogold EM we show an increase in NMDA receptor subunit GluN2B in the PSD of excitatory synapses in CA1 area of hippocampus.







Abstract
Major depressive disorder involves changes in synaptic structure and function, but the molecular underpinnings of these changes are still not established. In an initial pilot experiment, whole‐brain synaptosome screening with quantitative western blotting was performed to identify synaptic proteins that may show concentration changes in a congenital rat learned helplessness model of depression. We found that the N‐methyl‐d‐aspartate receptor (NMDAR) subunits GluN2A/GluN2B, activity‐regulated cytoskeleton‐associated protein (Arc) and syntaxin‐1 showed significant concentration differences between congenitally learned helpless (LH) and nonlearned helpless (NLH) rats. Having identified these three proteins, we then performed more elaborate quantitative immunogold electron microscopic analyses of the proteins in a specific synapse type in the dorsal hippocampus: the Schaffer collateral synapse in the CA1 region. We expanded the setup to include also unstressed wild‐type (WT) rats. The concentrations of the proteins in the LH and NLH groups were compared to WT animals. In this specific synapse, we found that the concentration of NMDARs was increased in postsynaptic spines in both LH and NLH rats. The concentration of Arc was significantly increased in postsynaptic densities in LH animals as well as in presynaptic cytoplasm of NLH rats. The concentration of syntaxin‐1 was significantly increased in both presynaptic terminals and postsynaptic spines in LH animals, while pre‐ and postsynaptic syntaxin‐1 concentrations were significantly decreased in NLH animals. These protein changes suggest pathways by which synaptic plasticity may be increased in dorsal hippocampal Schaffer collateral synapses during depression, corresponding to decreased synaptic stability.</content:encoded>

Abstract
In the vertebrate retina, amacrine and ganglion cells represent the most diverse cell classes. They can be classified into different cell types by several features, such as morphology, light responses, and gene expression profile. Although birds possess high visual acuity (similar to primates that we used here for comparison) and tetrachromatic color vision, data on the expression of transcription factors in retinal ganglion cells of birds are largely missing. In this study, we tested various transcription factors, known to label subpopulations of cells in mammalian retinae, in two avian species: the common buzzard (Buteo buteo), a raptor with exceptional acuity, and the domestic pigeon (Columba livia domestica), a good navigator and widely used model for visual cognition. Staining for the transcription factors Foxp2, Satb1 and Satb2 labeled most ganglion cells in the avian ganglion cell layer. CtBP2 was established as marker for displaced amacrine cells, which allowed us to reliably distinguish ganglion cells from displaced amacrine cells and assess their densities in buzzard and pigeon. When we additionally compared the temporal and central fovea of the buzzard with the fovea of primates, we found that the cellular organization in the pits was different in primates and raptors. In summary, we demonstrate that the expression of transcription factors is a defining feature of cell types not only in the retina of mammals but also in the retina of birds. The markers, which we have established, may provide useful tools for more detailed studies on the retinal circuitry of these highly visual animals.</content:encoded>

In one species of shore crab (Brachyura, Varunidae), a center that supports long‐term visual habituation and that matches the reniform body's morphology has been claimed as a homolog of the insect mushroom body despite lacking traits that define it as such. The discovery in a related species of shore crab of a mushroom body possessing those defining traits renders that interpretation unsound. Two phenotypically distinct, coexisting centers cannot both be homologs of the insect mushroom body. The present commentary outlines the history of research leading to misidentification of the reniform body as a mushroom body. One conclusion is that if both centers support learning and memory, this would be viewed as a novel and fascinating attribute of the pancrustacean brain.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>The central complex is an insect brain area controlling spatial orientation. Immunolabeling in 20 species ranging from firebrats to flies shows that the cellular distribution of the dopamine‐synthesizing enzyme tyrosine hydroxylase in the central complex is largely conserved but reveals additional novel cell types in flies and water striders.







Abstract
Dopamine acts as a neurohormone and neurotransmitter in the insect nervous system and controls a variety of physiological processes. Dopaminergic neurons also innervate the central complex (CX), a multisensory center of the insect brain involved in sky compass navigation, goal‐directed locomotion and sleep control. To infer a possible influence of evolutionary history and lifestyle on the neurochemical architecture of the CX, we have studied the distribution of neurons immunoreactive to tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), the rate‐limiting enzyme in dopamine biosynthesis. Analysis of representatives from 12 insect orders ranging from firebrats to flies revealed high conservation of immunolabeled neurons. One type of TH‐immunoreactive neuron was found in all species studied. The neurons have somata in the pars intercerebralis, arborizations in the lateral accessory lobes, and axonal ramifications in the central body and noduli. In all pterygote species, a second type of tangential neuron of the upper division of the central body was TH‐immunoreactive. The neurons have cell bodies near the calyces and arborizations in the superior protocerebrum. Both types of neuron showed species‐specific variations in cell number and in the innervated areas outside and inside the CX. Additional neurons were found in only two taxa: one type of columnar neuron showed TH immunostaining in the water strider Gerris lacustris, but not in other Heteroptera, and a tritocerebral neuron innervating the protocerebral bridge was immunolabeled in Diptera. The data show largely taxon‐specific variations of a common ground pattern of putatively dopaminergic neurons that may be commonly involved in state‐dependent modulation of CX function.</content:encoded>

Specific interaction between the start codon, 5’-AUG-3’, and the anticodon, 5’-CAU-3’, ensures accurate initiation of translation. Recent studies show that several near-cognate start codons (e.g. GUG and CUG) can play a role in initiating translation in eukaryotes. However, the mechanism allowing initiation through mismatched base-pairs at the ribosomal decoding site is still unclear at an atomic level. In this work, we propose an extended simulation-based method to evaluate free energy profiles, through computing the distance between each base-pair of the triplet interactions involved in recognition of start codons in eukaryotic translation pre-initiation complex. Our method provides not only the free energy penalty for mismatched start codons relative to the AUG start codon, but also the preferred pathways of transitions between bound and unbound states, which has not been described by previous studies. To verify the method, the binding dynamics of cognate (AUG) and near-cognate start codons (CUG and GUG) were simulated. Evaluated free energy profiles agree with experimentally observed changes in initiation frequencies from respective codons. This work proposes for the first time how a G:U mismatch at the first position of codon (GUG)-anticodon base-pairs destabilizes the accommodation in the initiating eukaryotic ribosome and how initiation at a CUG codon is nearly as strong as, or sometimes stronger than, that at a GUG codon. Our method is expected to be applied to study the affinity changes for various mismatched base-pairs.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/tPecjyTY_U4&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: How does feedback from phage infections influence the evolution of phase variation in &lt;i&gt;Campylobacter&lt;/i&gt;?</title>

&lt;i&gt;Campylobacter jejuni&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;C. jejuni&lt;/i&gt;) causes gastroenteritis following the consumption of contaminated poultry meat, resulting in a large health and economic burden worldwide. Phage therapy is a promising technique for eradicating &lt;i&gt;C. jejuni&lt;/i&gt; from poultry flocks and chicken carcasses. However, &lt;i&gt;C. jejuni&lt;/i&gt; can resist infections by some phages through stochastic, phase-variable ON/OFF switching of the phage receptors mediated by simple sequence repeats (SSR). While selection strength and exposure time influence the evolution of SSR-mediated phase variation (PV), phages offer a more complex evolutionary environment as phage replication depends on having a permissive host organism. Here, we build and explore several continuous culture bacteria-phage computational models, each analysing different phase-variable scenarios calibrated to the experimental SSR rates of &lt;i&gt;C. jejuni&lt;/i&gt; loci and replication parameters for the F336 phage. We simulate the evolution of PV rates via the adaptive dynamics framework for varying levels of selective pressures that act on the phage-resistant state. Our results indicate that growth reducing counter-selection on a single PV locus results in the stable maintenance of the phage, while compensatory selection between bacterial states affects the evolutionary stable mutation rates (i.e. very high and very low mutation rates are evolutionarily disadvantageous), whereas, in the absence of either selective pressure the evolution of PV rates results in mutation rates below the basal values. Contrastingly, a biologically-relevant model with two phase-variable loci resulted in phage extinction and locking of the bacteria into a phage-resistant state suggesting that another counter-selective pressure is required, for instance the use of a distinct phage whose receptor is an F336-phage-resistant state. We conclude that a delicate balance between counter-selection and phage-attack can result in both the evolution of phase-variable phage receptors and persistence of PV-receptor-specific phage.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/PTygv1_RlsE&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Neonatal invasive disease caused by Group B Streptococcus (GBS) is responsible for much acute mortality and long-term morbidity. To guide development of better prevention strategies, including maternal vaccines that protect neonates against GBS, it is necessary to estimate the burden of this condition globally and in different regions. Here, we present a Bayesian model that estimates country-specific invasive GBS (iGBS) disease incidence in children aged 0 to 6 days. The model combines different types of epidemiological data, each of which has its own limitations: GBS colonization prevalence in pregnant women, risk of iGBS disease in children born to GBS-colonized mothers and direct estimates of iGBS disease incidence where available. In our analysis, we present country-specific maternal GBS colonization prevalence after adjustment for GBS detection assay used in epidemiological studies. We then integrate these results with other epidemiological data and estimate country-level incidence of iGBS disease including in countries with no studies that directly estimate incidence. We are able to simultaneously estimate two key epidemiological quantities: the country-specific incidence of early-onset iGBS disease, and the risk of iGBS disease in babies born to GBS-colonized women. Overall, we believe our method will contribute to a more comprehensive quantification of the global burden of this disease, inform cost-effectiveness assessments of potential maternal GBS vaccines and identify key areas where data are necessary.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/jrzDICINQ5g&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Understanding the relationships between biological processes is paramount to unravel pathophysiological mechanisms. These relationships can be modeled with Transfer Functions (TFs), with no need of &lt;i&gt;a priori&lt;/i&gt; hypotheses as to the shape of the transfer function. Here we present Iliski, a software dedicated to TFs computation between two signals. It includes different pre-treatment routines and TF computation processes: deconvolution, deterministic and non-deterministic optimization algorithms that are adapted to disparate datasets. We apply Iliski to data on neurovascular coupling, an ensemble of cellular mechanisms that link neuronal activity to local changes of blood flow, highlighting the software benefits and caveats in the computation and evaluation of TFs. We also propose a workflow that will help users to choose the best computation according to the dataset. Iliski is available under the open-source license CC BY 4.0 on GitHub (https://github.com/alike-aydin/Iliski) and can be used on the most common operating systems, either within the MATLAB environment, or as a standalone application.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/fSbhMDOSwQ8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Biology: Rapid microstructural plasticity in the cortical semantic network following a short language learning session</title>

Despite the clear importance of language in our life, our vital ability to quickly and effectively learn new words and meanings is neurobiologically poorly understood. Conventional knowledge maintains that language learning—especially in adulthood—is slow and laborious. Furthermore, its structural basis remains unclear. Even though behavioural manifestations of learning are evident near instantly, previous neuroimaging work across a range of semantic categories has largely studied neural changes associated with months or years of practice. Here, we address rapid neuroanatomical plasticity accompanying new lexicon acquisition, specifically focussing on the learning of action-related language, which has been linked to the brain’s motor systems. Our results show that it is possible to measure and to externally modulate (using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) of motor cortex) cortical microanatomic reorganisation after mere minutes of new word learning. Learning-induced microstructural changes, as measured by diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI) and machine learning-based analysis, were evident in prefrontal, temporal, and parietal neocortical sites, likely reflecting integrative lexico-semantic processing and formation of new memory circuits immediately during the learning tasks. These results suggest a structural basis for the rapid neocortical word encoding mechanism and reveal the causally interactive relationship of modal and associative brain regions in supporting learning and word acquisition.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/L4Qros8z-X0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: A Novel Multisystem Proteinopathy Caused by a Missense ANXA11 Variant</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.26136?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Objective
Protein misfolding plays a central role not only in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), but also in other conditions, such as frontotemporal dementia (FTD), inclusion body myopathy (hIBM) or Paget's disease of bone. The concept of multisystem proteinopathies (MSP) was created to account for those rare families that segregate at least 2 out of these 4 conditions in the same pedigree. The calcium‐dependent phospholipid‐binding protein annexin A11 was recently associated to ALS in European pedigrees. Herein, we describe in detail 3 Brazilian families presenting hIBM (isolated or in combination with ALS/FTD) caused by the novel p.D40Y change in the gene encoding annexin A11 (ANXA11).


Methods
We collected clinical, genetic, pathological and skeletal muscle imaging from 11 affected subjects. Neuroimaging was also obtained from 8 patients and 8 matched controls.


Results
Clinico‐radiological phenotype of this novel hIBM reveals a slowly progressive predominant limb‐girdle syndrome, but with frequent axial (ptosis/dropped head) and distal (medial gastrocnemius) involvement as well. Muscle pathology identified numerous rimmed vacuoles with positive annexin A11, TDP‐43 and p62 inclusions, but no inflammation. Central nervous system was also involved: two patients had FTD, but diffusion tensor imaging uncovered multiple areas of cerebral white matter damage in the whole group (including the corticospinal tracts and frontal subcortical regions).


Interpretation
These findings expand the phenotypic spectrum related to ANXA11. This gene should be considered the cause of a novel multisystem proteinopathy (MSP type 6), rather than just ALS. ANN NEUROL 2021</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Objective evaluation of cerebellar dysfunction in neurodegenerative disorders is often difficult because of other overlapping symptoms. Cerebellar inhibition (CBI) tested by dual-coil transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is anticipated as a promising measure to estimate cerebellar function. Cerebellar TMS inhibits the primary motor cortex (M1), which can be measured as the decrease of motor evoked potential (MEP) elicited by a single-pulse TMS over the M1. This study was conducted to quantify cerebellar dysfunction using CBI in cerebellar type multiple system atrophy (MSA-C) patients. First, CBI was measured using MEP elicited from a hand muscle by stimulating the hand motor area of M1. The amount of CBI was defined as the degree of decrease in the MEP amplitude in the presence of cerebellar stimulation compared with the condition of M1 stimulation alone. Results of the MSA-C patients were compared with those of healthy volunteers. Correlation between amounts of CBI and a clinical scale of ataxia, the International Cooperative Ataxia Scale Rating (ICARS), was assessed. Healthy volunteers showed more inhibition than MSA-C patients. Moreover, ICARS showed that the CBI amount in the patients is correlated with the degree of ataxia significantly. Results suggest that CBI can be a good marker of disease progression in MSA-C patients.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;The projection from dopaminergic neurons to gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) interneurons in the prefrontal cortex is involved in the etiology of schizophrenia. The impact of interacting effects between dopamine signals and the expression of GABA on the clinical phenotypes of schizophrenia has not been studied. Since these interactions could be closely involved in prefrontal cortex functions, patients with specific alleles of these relevant molecules (which lead to lower or vulnerable genetic functions) may develop treatment-refractory symptoms. We conducted a genetic association study focusing on &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;COMT&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;GAD1&lt;/em&gt; genes for a treatment-resistant schizophrenia (TRS) group (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;n&lt;/em&gt;=171), a non-TRS group (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;n&lt;/em&gt;=592), and healthy controls (HC: &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;n&lt;/em&gt;=447), and we examined allelic combinations specific to TRS. The results revealed that the percentage of subjects with Met allele of rs4680 on the &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;COMT&lt;/em&gt; gene and C/C homozygote of rs3470934 on the &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;GAD1&lt;/em&gt; gene was significantly higher in the TRS group than the other two groups. There was no significant difference between the non-TRS group and HC groups. Considering the direction of functions of these single-nucleotide polymorphisms revealed by previous studies, we speculate that subjects with the Met/CC allelic combination could have a higher dopamine level and a lower expression of GABA in the prefrontal cortex. Our results suggest that an interaction between the dopaminergic signal and GABA signal intensities could differ between TRS patients and patients with other types of schizophrenia and healthy subjects.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Vitamin D receptor (VDR) signaling has been reported to affect neurodevelopment, thus participating in the risk of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). We have measured expression amounts of &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;VDR&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;CYP27B1&lt;/em&gt;, and two related long non-coding RNAs, namely &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;SNHG6&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;LINC00511&lt;/em&gt;, in the circulation of ASD patients compared with normal controls. Expression of &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;CYP27B1&lt;/em&gt; was remarkably higher in ASD cases compared with controls (posterior beta = 2.38, SE = 0.46, adjusted &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; value &amp;lt; 0.0001, 95% credible interval (CrI) for beta = [1.49, 3.27]). Level of &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;SNHG6&lt;/em&gt; was lower in ASD cases compared with controls (posterior beta = − 0.791, SE = 0.24, adjusted &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; value = 0.029, 95% CrI for beta = [− 1.27, − 0.33]). Expression levels of &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;VDR&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;LINC00511&lt;/em&gt; were similar between ASD cases and controls (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; values = 0.97 and 0.46, respectively). Expressions of &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;VDR&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;CYP27B1&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;SNHG6&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;LINC00511&lt;/em&gt; were not correlated with age of children. However, significant correlations were perceived between expressions of &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;CYP27B1&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;LINC00511&lt;/em&gt; (r = 0.47, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.0001), &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;VDR&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;CYP27B1&lt;/em&gt; (r = 0.42, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.0001), and &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;VDR&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;SNHG6&lt;/em&gt; (r = 0.32, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.0001). Therefore, these results imply dysregulation of a number of VDR-related genes in ASD patients.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Parkinson's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder in which dopaminergic neurons located in the substantia nigra are gradually lost. Currently, combined treatment strategies are receiving increasing attention as potential therapeutic approaches for Parkinson's disease. This study aimed to evaluate the potential effects of exosomes released from SH-Sy5y cells and the liposomal form of L-dopa on Parkinson's rat models. Twenty-five male Wistar albino rats, in five groups, were included in this study. Parkinson's disease was induced through microinjection of 6-OHDA (2.5 mg/mL) into the right substantia nigra. The exosomes released from the SH-Sy5y cell line were isolated and administered (0.2 µg/5 µL) alone or in combination with the liposomal form of L-Dopa (80 mg/kg) to the defined model groups. Behavioral tests and molecular assays were conducted to evaluate the expression levels of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and dopamine receptor D2 (DRD2). The rats in the groups receiving the combined liposomal form of L-Dopa and exosome treatment and the liposomal form of L-Dopa alone showed a significant improvement in their movement ability (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05). At molecular levels, these two groups also exhibited significant increases in &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Th&lt;/em&gt; (0.005 ± 0.001) and &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Drd2&lt;/em&gt; (0.002 ± 0.0001) expression compared to controls (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05). The observed alterations of &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Th&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Drd2&lt;/em&gt; expression were not statistically significant in exosome- and L-Dopa-treated groups. The current study shows that exosome-derived neuronal cells and liposomal form of L-Dopa can protect different cells against pathological complications such as Parkinson’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Place cells and grid cells are important neurons involved in spatial navigation in the mammalian brain. Grid cells are believed to play an important role in forming a cognitive map of the environment. Experimental observations in recent years showed that the grid pattern is not invariant but is influenced by the shape of the spatial environment. However, the cause of this deformation remains elusive. Here, we focused on the functional interactions between place cells and grid cells, utilizing the information of location relationships between the firing fields of place cells to optimize the previous grid cell feedforward generation model and expand its application to more complex environmental scenarios. Not only was the regular equilateral triangle periodic firing field structure of the grid cells reproduced, but the expected results were consistent with the experiment for the environment with various complex boundary shapes and environmental deformation. Even in the field of three-dimensional spatial grid patterns, forward-looking predictions have been made. This provides a possible model explanation for how the coupling of grid cells and place cells adapt to the diversity of the external environment to deepen our understanding of the neural basis for constructing cognitive maps.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Objective&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis with polyneuropathy (ATTRv-PN) is a rare disease characterized by rapid neuropathic progression. In pivotal studies of gene-silencing treatments, the modified Neuropathy Impairment Score + 7 tests (mNIS + 7) and Norfolk-Quality of Life (QOL)-Diabetic Neuropathy (DN) questionnaire assessed treatment impact on neuropathic progression. Establishing responder definition (RD) thresholds for these measures would enable evaluation of clinically meaningful treatment benefit.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec2&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Methods&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;mNIS + 7 and Norfolk-QOL-DN were administered at baseline and week 65 to 165 adults with ATTRv-PN receiving inotersen (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 106) or placebo (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 59) in the NEURO-TTR study. Anchor-based approaches for estimating RD thresholds were used for Norfolk QOL-DN, while distribution-based approaches were used for both measures. Responders were patients with a score change &amp;lt; RD, indicating improvement or stabilization (i.e., no clinically meaningful progression). Odds ratios (ORs) and Fisher’s exact tests compared proportions of responders by treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec3&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;The mean RD estimates were 12.2 points and 8.8 points for mNIS + 7 and Norfolk QOL-DN, respectively. The proportions of patients whose change in score indicated improvement or stabilization were statistically significantly larger for inotersen than placebo for all estimated RD thresholds for mNIS + 7 (64–86% responders for inotersen vs. 27–46% for placebo, ORs = 3.8–7.2, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;s &amp;lt; 0.001) and Norfolk QOL-DN (66–81% vs. 35–56%, ORs = 2.4–3.6, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;s &amp;lt; 0.05).&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;

                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Establishing RD thresholds for these instruments enables evaluation of clinically relevant and individual-level treatment benefit on neuropathic progression. Across RDs estimated using multiple methods, a higher proportion of patients receiving inotersen than placebo showed improved or stabilized neuropathic progression at week 65.&lt;/p&gt;

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2021.697973</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Since neurons have long neurites including axons, it is crucial for the axons to transport many intracellular substances such as proteins and mitochondria in order to maintain their morphology and function. In addition, mRNAs have also been shown to be transported within axons. RNA-binding proteins form complexes with mRNAs, and regulate transport of the mRNAs to axons, as well as locally translate them into proteins. Local translation of mRNAs actively occurs during the development and damage of neurons, and plays an important role in axon elongation, regeneration, and synapse formation. In recent years, it has been reported that impaired axonal transport and local translation of mRNAs may be involved in the pathogenesis of some neurodegenerative diseases. In this review, we discuss the significance of mRNA axonal transport and their local translation in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis/frontotemporal dementia, spinal muscular atrophy, Alzheimer’s disease, and fragile X syndrome.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2021.683035</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The formation of synapses is a tightly regulated process that requires the coordinated assembly of the presynaptic and postsynaptic sides. Defects in synaptogenesis during development or in the adult can lead to neurodevelopmental disorders, neurological disorders, and neurodegenerative diseases. In order to develop therapeutic approaches for these neurological conditions, we must first understand the molecular mechanisms that regulate synapse formation. The Wnt family of secreted glycoproteins are key regulators of synapse formation in different model systems from invertebrates to mammals. In this review, we will discuss the role of Wnt signaling in the formation of excitatory synapses in the mammalian brain by focusing on Wnt7a and Wnt5a, two Wnt ligands that play an in vivo role in this process. We will also discuss how changes in neuronal activity modulate the expression and/or release of Wnts, resulting in changes in the localization of surface levels of Frizzled, key Wnt receptors, at the synapse. Thus, changes in neuronal activity influence the magnitude of Wnt signaling, which in turn contributes to activity-mediated synapse formation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

The current review describes the history of evolution of gene editing tools, with the aim of improving overall understanding of this technology, and focuses on the four most common NDD disorders to demonstrate the potential future applications and research directions of gene editing.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Multimodal Simulation of a Novel Device for a Safe and Effective External Ventricular Drain Placement</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.690705</link>
	<content:encoded>Background&lt;p&gt;External ventricular drain (EVD) placement is mandatory for several pathologies. The misplacement rate of the EVD varies widely in literature, ranging from 12.3 to 60%. The purpose of this simulation study is to provide preliminary data about the possibility of increasing the safety of one of the most common life-saving procedures in neurosurgery by testing a new device for EVD placement.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;We used a novel guide for positioning the ventricular catheter (patent RM2014A000376). The trajectory was assessed using 25 anonymized head CT scans. The data sets were used to conduct three-dimensional computer-based and combined navigation and augmented reality-based simulations using plaster models. The data set inclusion criteria were volumetric head CT scan, without midline shift, of patients older than 18. Evans’ index was used to quantify the ventricle’s size. We excluded patients with slit ventricles, midline shift, skull fractures, or complex skull malformations. The proximal end of the device was tested on the cadaver.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;The cadaveric tests proved that a surgeon could use the device without any external help. The multimodal simulation showed Kakarla grade 1 in all cases but one (grade 2) on both sides, after right and left EVD placement. The mean Evans’ index was 0.28. The geometric principles that explain the device’s efficacy can be summarized by studying the properties of circumference and chord. The contact occurs, for each section considered, at the extreme points of the chord. Its axis, perpendicular to the plane tangent to the spherical surface at the entry point, corresponds to the direction of entry of the catheter guided by the instrument.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;According to our multimodal simulation on cadavers, 3D computer-based simulation, 3D plaster modeling, 3D neuronavigation, and augmented reality, the device promises to offer safer and effective EVD placement. Further validation in future clinical studies is recommended.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: MRIES: A Matlab Toolbox for Mapping the Responses to Intracranial Electrical Stimulation</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.652841</link>
	<content:encoded>Propose&lt;p&gt;Directed cortical responses to intracranial electrical stimulation are a good standard for mapping inter-regional direct connectivity. Cortico-cortical evoked potential (CCEP), elicited by single pulse electrical stimulation (SPES), has been widely used to map the normal and abnormal brain effective network. However, automated processing of CCEP datasets and visualization of connectivity results remain challenging for researchers and clinicians. In this study, we develop a Matlab toolbox named MRIES (Mapping the Responses to Intracranial Electrical Stimulation) to automatically process CCEP data and visualize the connectivity results.&lt;/p&gt;Method&lt;p&gt;The MRIES integrates the processing pipeline of the CCEP datasets and various methods for connectivity calculation based on low- and high-frequency signals with stimulation artifacts removed. The connectivity matrices are saved in different folders for visualization. Different visualization patterns (connectivity matrix, circle map, surface map, and volume map) are also integrated to the graphical user interface (GUI), which makes it easy to intuitively display and compare different connectivity measurements. Furthermore, one sample CCEP data set collected from eight epilepsy patients is used to validate the MRIES toolbox.&lt;/p&gt;Result&lt;p&gt;We show the GUI and visualization functions of MRIES using one example CCEP data that has been described in a complete tutorial. We applied this toolbox to the sample CCEP data set to investigate the direct connectivity between the medial temporal lobe and the insular cortex. We find bidirectional connectivity between MTL and insular that are consistent with the findings of previous studies.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;MRIES has a friendly GUI and integrates the full processing pipeline of CCEP data and various visualization methods.

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Transcranial Auricular Vagus Nerve Stimulation (taVNS) and Ear-EEG: Potential for Closed-Loop Portable Non-invasive Brain Stimulation</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.699473</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;No matter how hard we concentrate, our attention fluctuates – a fact that greatly affects our success in completing a current task. Here, we review work from two methods that, in a closed-loop manner, have the potential to ameliorate these fluctuations. Ear-EEG can measure electric brain activity from areas in or around the ear, using small and thus portable hardware. It has been shown to capture the state of attention with high temporal resolution. Transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation (taVNS) comes with the same advantages (small and light) and critically current research suggests that it is possible to influence ongoing brain activity that has been linked to attention. Following the review of current work on ear-EEG and taVNS we suggest that a combination of the two methods in a closed-loop system could serve as a potential application to modulate attention.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Radiofrequency Lesioning for Movement and Psychiatric Disorders-Experience of 107 Cases</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.673848</link>
	<content:encoded>Background&lt;p&gt;Radiofrequency lesioning (RFL) though used since the 1950s, had been replaced by DBS in the 1990s. The availability of magnetic resonance-guided focused ultrasound for lesioning has renewed the interest in RFL.&lt;/p&gt;Objective&lt;p&gt;This paper analysis RFL in contemporary Functional Neurosurgery for various indications and its outcome. Complication rates of RFL are compared with the same author’s experience of DBS.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;One hundred and seven patients underwent RFL between 1998 and 2019. Indications included Parkinson’s Disease (PD), tremors, dystonia, and obsessive-compulsive disorders (OCD). The surgeries performed include thalamotomy (29), pallidotomy (49), subthalamotomy (23), and anterior capsulotomy/nucleus accumbens lesioning (6). Appropriate rating scales were used for preoperative and postoperative evaluations.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;There was a 25% recurrence rate of tremors for PD after thalamotomy. Writer’s cramp rating scale improved from a mean of 10.54–1.6 in task specific dystonia (TSD) patients, after thalamotomy. In PD patients, after pallidotomy, contralateral motor Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) and dyskinesia scores, improved by 41 and 57%, respectively, at 1-year. Burke-Fahn-Marsden Dystonia Rating Scale in hemidystonia patients improved from 18.04 to 6.91, at 1-year. There was 32 and 31% improvement in total and motor UPDRS, respectively, in the subthalamotomy patients, at 2-year. All patients of OCD were in remission. There were three deaths in the pallidotomy group. Postoperative, dysarthria, confusion, hemiparesis, dyskinesia, and paraesthesia occurred in 12 patients, of which, 7 were transient.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;RFL is a useful option in a select group of patients with tremors and dystonia. It is our preferred treatment option for TSD and OCD.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Behavioural Features of Cerebral Visual Impairment Are Common in Children With Down Syndrome</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.673342</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;It is widely recognised that children with Down syndrome have a broad range and a high prevalence of visual deficits and it has been suggested that those with Down syndrome are more likely to exhibit visual perception deficits indicative of cerebral visual impairment. This exploratory study aims to determine the prevalence of behavioural features suggestive of cerebral visual impairment (CVI) occurring with Down syndrome and whether the visual problems can be ascribed to optometric factors. A cohort of 226 families of children with Down syndrome (trisomy 21), aged 4–17, were invited to participate in a validated question inventory, to recognise visual perception issues. The clinical records of the participants were then reviewed retrospectively. A five-question screening instrument was used to indicate suspected CVI. The majority of the 81 families who responded to the questionnaire reported some level of visual perceptual difficulty in their child. Among this cohort, the prevalence of suspected CVI as indicated by the screening questionnaire was 38%. Only ametropia was found to have a significant association with suspected CVI, although this increased the correct prediction of suspected CVI outcome by only a small amount. Results suggest that children with Down syndrome are more likely to experience problems consistent with cerebral visual impairment, and that these may originate from a similar brain dysfunction to that which contributes to high levels of ametropia and failure to emmetropise. It is important that behavioural features of CVI are recognised in children with Down syndrome, further investigations initiated and appropriate management applied.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Two Aspects of Feedforward Control During a Fencing Lunge: Early and Anticipatory Postural Adjustments</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.638675</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The present study investigated whether expertise in fencing influences the onset of postural preparation during the fencing lunge and how it changes under different performance conditions. We also questioned if the onset of feedforward control can be categorized into one of the postural phases: anticipatory or early postural adjustment. Eight elite fencers and nine physical education students performed an attack with a lunge in self-paced and reaction time conditions from three different initial stance widths. The onset of the center of pressure (COP) displacement and EMG activities for the tibialis anterior (TA) of both limbs were recorded. The results show that expertise in fencing delays the onset of the activity of TA of the front leg and the onset of COP displacement during fencing lunge performance in comparison to controls. Additionally, in contrast to the control group, fencers produce typical APA patterns in the activation of TA under different performance conditions, delayed reaction time in comparison to self-initiated lunging, and constant time of APA onset under different widths of stance. According to different times and functions of TA activity and COP displacement in lunging, we propose to address them as anticipatory postural adjustment and early postural adjustment, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neural Circuits: Cortical Electrical Stimulation Ameliorates Traumatic Brain Injury-Induced Sensorimotor and Cognitive Deficits in Rats</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncir.2021.693073</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Objective: Individuals with different severities of traumatic brain injury (TBI) often suffer long-lasting motor, sensory, neurological, or cognitive disturbances. To date, no neuromodulation-based therapies have been used to manage the functional deficits associated with TBI. Cortical electrical stimulation (CES) has been increasingly developed for modulating brain plasticity and is considered to have therapeutic potential in TBI. However, the therapeutic value of such a technique for TBI is still unclear. Accordingly, an animal model of this disease would be helpful for mechanistic insight into using CES as a novel treatment approach in TBI. The current study aims to apply a novel CES scheme with a theta-burst stimulation (TBS) protocol to identify the therapeutic potential of CES in a weight drop-induced rat model of TBI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: TBI rats were divided into the sham CES treatment group and CES treatment group. Following early and long-term CES intervention (starting 24 h after TBI, 1 session/day, 5 days/week) in awake TBI animals for a total of 4 weeks, the effects of CES on the modified neurological severity score (mNSS), sensorimotor and cognitive behaviors and neuroinflammatory changes were identified.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: We found that the 4-week CES intervention significantly alleviated the TBI-induced neurological, sensorimotor, and cognitive deficits in locomotor activity, sensory and recognition memory. Immunohistochemically, we found that CES mitigated the glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) activation in the hippocampus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: These findings suggest that CES has significant benefits in alleviating TBI-related symptoms and represents a promising treatment for TBI.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neural Circuits: Oxytocinergic Feedback Circuitries: An Anatomical Basis for Neuromodulation of Social Behaviors</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncir.2021.688234</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Oxytocin (OT) is a neuropeptide produced by hypothalamic neurons and is known to modulate social behavior among other functions. Several experiments have shown that OT modulates neuronal activity in many brain areas, including sensory cortices. OT neurons thus project axons to various cortical and subcortical structures and activate neuronal subpopulations to increase the signal-to-noise ratio, and in turn, increases the saliency of social stimuli. Less is known about the origin of inputs to OT neurons, but recent studies show that cells projecting to OT neurons are often located in regions where the OT receptor (OTR) is expressed. Thus, we propose the existence of reciprocal connectivity between OT neurons and extrahypothalamic OTR neurons to tune OT neuron activity depending on the behavioral context. Furthermore, the latest studies have shown that OTR-expressing neurons located in social brain regions also project to other social brain regions containing OTR-expressing neurons. We hypothesize that OTR-expressing neurons across the brain constitute a common network coordinated by OT.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neural Circuits: Modulatory Effects of Monoamines and Perineuronal Nets on Output of Cerebellar Purkinje Cells</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncir.2021.661899</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Classically, the cerebellum has been thought to play a significant role in motor coordination. However, a growing body of evidence for novel neural connections between the cerebellum and various brain regions indicates that the cerebellum also contributes to other brain functions implicated in reward, language, and social behavior. Cerebellar Purkinje cells (PCs) make inhibitory GABAergic synapses with their target neurons: other PCs and Lugaro/globular cells via PC axon collaterals, and neurons in the deep cerebellar nuclei (DCN) via PC primary axons. PC-Lugaro/globular cell connections form a cerebellar cortical microcircuit, which is driven by serotonin and noradrenaline. PCs’ primary outputs control not only firing but also synaptic plasticity of DCN neurons following the integration of excitatory and inhibitory inputs in the cerebellar cortex. Thus, strong PC-mediated inhibition is involved in cerebellar functions as a key regulator of cerebellar neural networks. In this review, we focus on physiological characteristics of GABAergic transmission from PCs. First, we introduce monoaminergic modulation of GABAergic transmission at synapses of PC-Lugaro/globular cell as well as PC-large glutamatergic DCN neuron, and a Lugaro/globular cell-incorporated microcircuit. Second, we review the physiological roles of perineuronal nets (PNNs), which are organized components of the extracellular matrix and enwrap the cell bodies and proximal processes, in GABA release from PCs to large glutamatergic DCN neurons and in cerebellar motor learning. Recent evidence suggests that alterations in PNN density in the DCN can regulate cerebellar functions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Multi-structure Cortical States Deduced From Intracellular Representations of Fixed Tactile Input Patterns</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.677568</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The brain has a never-ending internal activity, whose spatiotemporal evolution interacts with external inputs to constrain their impact on brain activity and thereby how we perceive them. We used reproducible touch-related spatiotemporal sensory inputs and recorded intracellularly from rat (Sprague-Dawley, male) neocortical neurons to characterize this interaction. The synaptic responses, or the summed input of the networks connected to the neuron, varied greatly to repeated presentations of the same tactile input pattern delivered to the tip of digit 2. Surprisingly, however, these responses tended to sort into a set of specific time-evolving response types, unique for each neuron. Further, using a set of eight such tactile input patterns, we found each neuron to exhibit a set of specific response types for each input provided. Response types were not determined by the global cortical state, but instead likely depended on the time-varying state of the specific subnetworks connected to each neuron. The fact that some types of responses recurred indicates that the cortical network had a non-continuous landscape of solutions for these tactile inputs. Therefore, our data suggest that sensory inputs combine with the internal dynamics of the brain networks, thereby causing them to fall into one of the multiple possible perceptual attractor states. The neuron-specific instantiations of response types we observed suggest that the subnetworks connected to each neuron represent different components of those attractor states. Our results indicate that the impact of cortical internal states on external inputs is substantially more richly resolvable than previously shown.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.700306</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Aging is a process that adversely affects brain functions such as cognition. Brain activity is highly energy consuming, with glucose serving as the main energy source under normal circumstances. Whether the dynamics of glucose metabolism change with aging is not well understood. This study sought to investigate the activity-dependent changes in glucose metabolism of the mouse hippocampus during aging. In brief, after 1 h of contextual exploration in an enriched environmental condition or 1 h in a familiar home cage condition, metabolites were measured from the hippocampus of both young adult and aged mice with metabolomic profiling. Compared to the home cage context, the enriched contextual exploration condition resulted in changes in the concentration of 11 glucose metabolism-related metabolites in the young adult hippocampus. In contrast, glucose metabolism-related metabolite changes were more apparent in the aged group altered by contextual exploration when compared to those in the home cage condition. Importantly, in the aged groups, several key metabolites involved in glycolysis, the TCA cycle, and ketone body metabolism accumulated, suggesting the less efficient metabolization of glucose-based energy resources. Altogether, the analyses revealed that in the aged mice altered by enriched contextual exploration, the glucose resource seems to be unable to provide enough energy for hippocampal function.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Exercise Improves Movement by Regulating the Plasticity of Cortical Function in Hemiparkinsonian Rats</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.695108</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Aberrant cortical spike-local field potential (LFP) coupling leads to abnormal basal ganglia activity, disruption of cortical function, and impaired movement in Parkinson's disease (PD). Here, the primary motor cortex mediated plasticity mechanism underlying behavioral improvement by exercise intervention was investigated. Exercise alleviates motor dysfunction and induces neuroplasticity in PD. In this study, Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were injected with 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) to induce unilateral nigrostriatal dopamine depletion. Two weeks later, a 4-week exercise intervention was initiated in the PD + exercise (Ex) group. Multichannel recording technology recorded spikes and LFPs in rat motor cortices, and balanced ability tests evaluated behavioral performance. The balanced ability test showed that the total crossing time/front leg error/input latency time was significantly lower in PD + Ex rats than in PD rats (P &amp;lt; 0.05). Scalograms and LFP power spectra indicated increased beta-range LFP power in lesioned hemispheres, with exercise reducing LFP power spectral density. Spike-triggered LFP waveform averages showed strong phase-locking in PD motor cortex cells, and exercise reduced spike-LFP synchronization. Our results suggest that exercise can suppress overexcitability of LFPs and minimize spike-LFP synchronization in the motor cortex, leading to motor-improving effects in PD.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.685683</link>
	<content:encoded>Background&lt;p&gt;The estimated absolute cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk level is known to be a useful surrogate marker for future cognitive impairment; however, evidence regarding its predictive validity in terms of cognitive subtypes is limited. We aimed to examine subtype-dependent differences in the associations between absolute CVD risk and the incidence of cognitive impairment in a community-dwelling older Japanese cohort.&lt;/p&gt;Methods and Results&lt;p&gt;This study comprised 1,641 cognitively intact older Japanese participants without CVDs at baseline. We estimated absolute CVD risk using WHO region-specific risk estimation charts and included age, sex, diabetes mellitus, smoking, systolic blood pressure, and total cholesterol at baseline, and the CVD risk level was stratified into the three following risk categories: low (&amp;lt;10%), moderate (10 to &amp;lt;20%), and high (≥20%). Objective cognitive screening was performed using a multicomponent neurocognitive test at baseline and follow-up, and the incidence of cognitive impairment over 48 ± 2 months was determined. The incidence of cognitive impairment in low-, moderate-, and high-CVD risk participants was 1.2, 3.0, and 5.4%, respectively, for amnestic subtypes and 5.8, 10.1, and 14.0%, respectively, for non-amnestic subtypes. After adjusting for potential confounding factors, the absolute CVD risk level was significantly associated with non-amnestic impairment but not with amnestic impairment.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusions&lt;p&gt;The absolute CVD risk estimated using region-specific risk estimation charts in old age is useful to predict incidence of cognitive impairment. Strategies to screen populations at risk of cognitive impairment and to prevent progression to dementia should be cognitive subtype-specific.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Motor Sequence Learning Deficits in Idiopathic Parkinson’s Disease Are Associated With Increased Substantia Nigra Activity</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.685168</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Previous studies have shown that persons with Parkinson’s disease (pwPD) share specific deficits in learning new sequential movements, but the neural substrates of this impairment remain unclear. In addition, the degree to which striatal dopaminergic denervation in PD affects the cortico-striato-thalamo-cerebellar motor learning network remains unknown. We aimed to answer these questions using fMRI in 16 pwPD and 16 healthy age-matched control subjects while they performed an implicit motor sequence learning task. While learning was absent in both pwPD and controls assessed with reaction time differences between sequential and random trials, larger error-rates during the latter suggest that at least some of the complex sequence was encoded. Moreover, we found that while healthy controls could improve general task performance indexed by decreased reaction times across both sequence and random blocks, pwPD could not, suggesting disease-specific deficits in learning of stimulus-response associations. Using fMRI, we found that this effect in pwPD was correlated with decreased activity in the hippocampus over time. Importantly, activity in the substantia nigra (SN) and adjacent bilateral midbrain was specifically increased during sequence learning in pwPD compared to healthy controls, and significantly correlated with sequence-specific learning deficits. As increased SN activity was also associated (on trend) with higher doses of dopaminergic medication as well as disease duration, the results suggest that learning deficits in PD are associated with disease progression, indexing an increased drive to recruit dopaminergic neurons in the SN, however, unsuccessfully. Finally, there were no differences between pwPD and controls in task modulation of the cortico-striato-thalamo-cerebellar network. However, a restricted nigral-striatal model showed that negative modulation of SN to putamen connection was larger in pwPD compared to controls during random trials, while no differences between the groups were found during sequence learning. We speculate that learning-specific SN recruitment leads to a relative increase in SN- &amp;gt; putamen connectivity, which returns to a pathological reduced state when no learning takes place.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Learning by Insight-Like Sudden Comprehension as a Potential Strategy to Improve Memory Encoding in Older Adults</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.661346</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Several cognitive functions show a decline with advanced age, most prominently episodic memory. Problem-solving by insight represents a special associative form of problem-solving that has previously been shown to facilitate long-term memory formation. Recent neuroimaging evidence suggests that the encoding network involved in insight-based memory formation is largely hippocampus-independent. This may represent a potential advantage in older adults, as the hippocampus is one of the earliest brain structures to show age-related volume loss and functional impairment. Here, we investigated the potential beneficial effects of learning by insight in healthy older (60–79 years) compared to young adults (19–28 years). To this end, we compared later memory performance for verbal riddles encoded incidentally via induced insight-like sudden comprehension in both age groups. We employed a variant of the Compound Remote Associate Task (CRAT) for incidental encoding, during which participants were instructed to judge the solvability of items. In a 24-h delayed surprise memory test, participants attempted to solve previously encountered items and additionally performed a recognition memory test. During this test, older adults correctly solved an equal proportion of new CRA items compared to young adults and both age groups reported a similar frequency of Aha! experiences. While overall memory performance was better in young participants (higher proportion of correctly solved and correctly recognized old CRA items), older participants exhibited a stronger beneficial effect of insight-like sudden comprehension on later recognition memory for CRA items. Our results suggest that learning via insight might constitute a promising approach to improve memory function in old age.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.657646</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Background and Objectives: Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is often a precursor of dementia, and in particular of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) which is the most common cause of dementia. Individuals with amnestic MCI are several-fold more likely to develop AD than the general population. Therefore, MCI comprises a well-detectable, early stage time-point for therapeutic intervention and strategic prevention. Based on common electroencephalographical (EEG) pattern changes seen in individuals with MCI, we postulated that EEG-based neurofeedback could help improve the memory performance of patients with MCI. Memory performance is of particular importance in these patients, since memory decline is the most prominent symptom in most patients with MCI, and is the most predictive symptom for cognitive deterioration and the development of AD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: In order to improve the memory performance of patients with MCI we used a system of EEG-based neurofeedback in an attempt to reverse alterations of the EEG that are known to be common in patients with MCI. Our protocol comprised the provision of positive feedback in order to enhance the activity level of the upper alpha band. Participants were divided to two groups receiving either neurofeedback training to enhance the upper alpha frequency (Experimental group) or random feedbacks (Sham group)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: We witnessed a significant improvement in memory performance in subjects in the experimental group compared to those in the sham group. This improvement was maintained for at least 1 month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: Neurofeedback may be a promising and affordable novel approach for treating the decline in memory witnessed in patients with MCI.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a common global health problem. Recently, the potential of mind-body intervention for MCI has drawn the interest of investigators. This study aims to comparatively explore the modulation effect of Baduanjin, a popular mind-body exercise, and physical exercise on the cognitive function, as well as the norepinephrine and dopamine systems using the resting state functional connectivity (rsFC) method in patients with MCI. 69 patients were randomized to the Baduanjin, brisk walking, or healthy education control group for 6 months. The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans were applied at baseline and at the end of the experiment. Results showed that (1) compared to the brisk walking, the Baduanjin significantly increased MoCA scores; (2) Baduanjin significantly increased the right locus coeruleus (LC) and left ventral tegmental area (VTA) rsFC with the right insula and right amygdala compared to that of the control group; and the right anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) compared to that of the brisk walking group; (3) the increased right LC-right insula rsFC and right LC-right ACC rsFC were significantly associated with the corresponding MoCA score after 6-months of intervention; (4) both exercise groups experienced an increased effective connectivity from the right ACC to the left VTA compared to the control group; and (5) Baduanjin group experienced an increase in gray matter volume in the right ACC compared to the control group. Our results suggest that Baduanjin can significantly modulate intrinsic functional connectivity and the influence of the norepinephrine (LC) and dopamine (VTA) systems. These findings may shed light on the mechanisms of mind-body intervention and aid the development of new treatments for MCI.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Temporal Integration of Text Transcripts and Acoustic Features for Alzheimer's Diagnosis Based on Spontaneous Speech</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.642647</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Background: Advances in machine learning (ML) technology have opened new avenues for detection and monitoring of cognitive decline. In this study, a multimodal approach to Alzheimer's dementia detection based on the patient's spontaneous speech is presented. This approach was tested on a standard, publicly available Alzheimer's speech dataset for comparability. The data comprise voice samples from 156 participants (1:1 ratio of Alzheimer's to control), matched by age and gender.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Materials and Methods: A recently developed Active Data Representation (ADR) technique for voice processing was employed as a framework for fusion of acoustic and textual features at sentence and word level. Temporal aspects of textual features were investigated in conjunction with acoustic features in order to shed light on the temporal interplay between paralinguistic (acoustic) and linguistic (textual) aspects of Alzheimer's speech. Combinations between several configurations of ADR features and more traditional bag-of-n-grams approaches were used in an ensemble of classifiers built and evaluated on a standardised dataset containing recorded speech of scene descriptions and textual transcripts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Employing only semantic bag-of-n-grams features, an accuracy of 89.58% was achieved in distinguishing between Alzheimer's patients and healthy controls. Adding temporal and structural information by combining bag-of-n-grams features with ADR audio/textual features, the accuracy could be improved to 91.67% on the test set. An accuracy of 93.75% was achieved through late fusion of the three best feature configurations, which corresponds to a 4.7% improvement over the best result reported in the literature for this dataset.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: The proposed combination of ADR audio and textual features is capable of successfully modelling temporal aspects of the data. The machine learning approach toward dementia detection achieves best performance when ADR features are combined with strong semantic bag-of-n-grams features. This combination leads to state-of-the-art performance on the AD classification task.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Exploring the Key Genes and Identification of Potential Diagnosis Biomarkers in Alzheimer’s Disease Using Bioinformatics Analysis</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.602781</link>
	<content:encoded>Background&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is one of the major threats of the twenty-first century and lacks available therapy. Identification of novel molecular markers for diagnosis and treatment of AD is urgently demanded, and genetic biomarkers show potential prospects.&lt;/p&gt;Method&lt;p&gt;We identify and intersected differentially expressed genes (DEGs) from five microarray datasets to detect consensus DEGs. Based on these DEGs, we conducted Gene Ontology (GO), performed the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analysis, constructed a protein—protein interaction (PPI) network, and utilized Cytoscape to identify hub genes. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) logistic regression was applied to identify potential diagnostic biomarkers. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was performed to investigate the biological functions of the key genes.&lt;/p&gt;Result&lt;p&gt;We identified 608 consensus DEGs, several dysregulated pathways, and 18 hub genes. Sixteen hub genes dysregulated as AD progressed. The diagnostic model of 35 genes was constructed, which has a high area under the curve (AUC) value in both the validation dataset and combined dataset (AUC = 0.992 and AUC = 0.985, respectively). The model can also differentiate mild cognitive impairment and AD patients from controls in two blood datasets. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and WW domain-containing transcription regulator protein 1 (WWTR1), which are associated with the Braak stage, Aβ 42 levels, and β-secretase activity, were identified as critical genes of AD.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;Our study identified 16 hub genes correlated to the neuropathological stage and 35 potential biomarkers for the diagnosis of AD. WWTR1 were identified as candidate genes for future studies. This study deepens our understanding of the transcriptomic and functional features and provides new potential diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets for AD.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: Myosin-based regulation of twitch and tetanic contractions in mammalian skeletal muscle</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/68211</link>
	<content:encoded>Time-resolved X-ray diffraction from isolated fast-twitch muscles of the mouse was used to show how structural changes in the myosin-containing thick filaments contribute to the regulation of muscle contraction, extending the previous focus on regulation by the actin-containing thin filaments. This study shows that muscle activation involves the following sequence of structural changes: thin filament activation, disruption of the helical array of myosin motors characteristic of resting muscle, release of myosin motor domains from the folded conformation on the filament backbone, and actin attachment. Physiological force generation in the 'twitch' response of skeletal muscle to single action potential stimulation is limited by incomplete activation of the thick filament and the rapid inactivation of both filaments. Muscle relaxation after repetitive stimulation is accompanied by complete recovery of the folded motor conformation on the filament backbone but incomplete reformation of the helical array, revealing a structural basis for post-tetanic potentiation in isolated muscle.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: Extracellular signal-regulated kinase mediates chromatin rewiring and lineage transformation in lung cancer</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/66524</link>
	<content:encoded>Small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) is neuroendocrine in origin and rarely contains mutations in the MAPK pathway. Likewise, non-SCLC (NSCLC) that transform to SCLC concomitantly with development of therapy resistance downregulate MAPK signaling, suggesting an inverse relationship between pathway activation and lineage state. To test this, we activated MAPK in SCLC through expression of mutant KRAS or EGFR, which revealed suppression of the neuroendocrine differentiation via ERK. We found that ERK induces expression of ETS factors that mediate transformation into a NSCLC-like state. ATAC-seq demonstrated ERK-driven changes in chromatin accessibility at putative regulatory regions and global chromatin rewiring at neuroendocrine and ETS transcriptional targets. Further, induction of ETS factors and suppression of neuroendocrine differentiation were dependent on histone acetyltransferases CBP/p300. Overall, we describe how the ERK-CBP/p300-ETS axis promotes a lineage shift between neuroendocrine and non-neuroendocrine phenotypes and provide rationale for the disruption of this program during transformation-driven resistance to targeted therapy.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: Preserved sensory processing but hampered conflict detection when stimulus input is task-irrelevant</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/64431</link>
	<content:encoded>Conflict detection in sensory input is central to adaptive human behavior. Perhaps unsurprisingly, past research has shown that conflict may even be detected in absence of conflict awareness, suggesting that conflict detection is an automatic process that does not require attention. To test the possibility of conflict processing in the absence of attention, we manipulated task relevance and response overlap of potentially conflicting stimulus features across six behavioral tasks. Multivariate analyses on human electroencephalographic data revealed neural signatures of conflict only when at least one feature of a conflicting stimulus was attended, regardless of whether that feature was part of the conflict, or overlaps with the response. In contrast, neural signatures of basic sensory processes were present even when a stimulus was completely unattended. These data reveal an attentional bottleneck at the level of objects, suggesting that object-based attention is a prerequisite for cognitive control operations involved in conflict detection.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/62927</link>
	<content:encoded>Collagens are a primary component of the extracellular matrix and are functional ligands for the inhibitory immune receptor leukocyte associated immunoglobulin-like receptor (LAIR)-1. LAIR-2 is a secreted protein that can act as a decoy receptor by binding collagen with higher affinity than LAIR-1. We propose that collagens promote immune evasion by interacting with LAIR-1 expressed on immune cells, and that LAIR-2 releases LAIR-1 mediated immune suppression. Analysis of public human datasets show that collagens, LAIR-1 and LAIR-2 have unique and overlapping associations with survival in certain tumors. We designed a dimeric LAIR-2 with a functional IgG1 Fc tail, NC410, and showed that NC410 increases human T cell expansion and effector function &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; in a mouse xenogeneic-graft versus-host disease model. In humanized mouse tumor models NC410 reduces tumor growth that is dependent on T cells. Immunohistochemical analysis of human tumors shows that NC410 binds to collagen-rich areas where LAIR-1&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; immune cells are localized. Our findings show that NC410 might be a novel strategy for cancer immunotherapy for immune-excluded tumors.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: Identical sequences found in distant genomes reveal frequent horizontal transfer across the bacterial domain</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/62719</link>
	<content:encoded>Horizontal Gene Transfer (HGT) is an essential force in microbial evolution. Despite detailed studies on a variety of systems, a global picture of HGT in the microbial world is still missing. Here, we exploit that HGT creates long identical DNA sequences in the genomes of distant species, which can be found efficiently using alignment-free methods. Our pairwise analysis of 93 481 bacterial genomes identified 138 273 HGT events. We developed a model to explain their statistical properties as well as estimate the transfer rate between pairs of taxa. This reveals that long-distance HGT is frequent: our results indicate that HGT between species from different phyla has occurred in at least 8% of the species. Finally, our results confirm that the function of sequences strongly impacts their transfer rate, which varies by more than 3 orders of magnitude between different functional categories. Overall, we provide a comprehensive view of HGT, illuminating a fundamental process driving bacterial evolution.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: Glycinergic axonal inhibition subserves acute spatial sensitivity to sudden increases in sound intensity</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/62183</link>
	<content:encoded>Locomotion generates adventitious sounds which enable detection and localization of predators and prey. Such sounds contain brisk changes or transients in amplitude. We investigated the hypothesis that ill-understood temporal specializations in binaural circuits subserve lateralization of such sound transients, based on different time of arrival at the ears (interaural time differences, ITDs). We find that Lateral Superior Olive (LSO) neurons show exquisite ITD-sensitivity, reflecting extreme precision and reliability of excitatory and inhibitory postsynaptic potentials, in contrast to Medial Superior Olive neurons, traditionally viewed as the ultimate ITD-detectors. &lt;i&gt;In vivo&lt;/i&gt;, inhibition blocks LSO excitation over an extremely short window, which, &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;, required synaptically-evoked inhibition. Light and electron microscopy revealed inhibitory synapses on the axon initial segment as the structural basis of this observation. These results reveal a neural vetoing mechanism with extreme temporal and spatial precision and establish the LSO as the primary nucleus for binaural processing of sound transients.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/61018</link>
	<content:encoded>Human dexterous motor control improves from childhood to adulthood, but little is known about the changes in cortico-cortical communication that support such ontogenetic refinement of motor skills. To investigate age-related differences in connectivity between cortical regions involved in dexterous control we analyzed electroencephalographic data from 88 individuals (range 8-30y) performing a visually-guided precision grip task using Dynamic Causal Modelling (DCM) and Parametric Empirical Bayes (PEB). Our results demonstrate that bidirectional coupling in a canonical 'grasping network' is associated with precision grip performance across age groups. We further demonstrate greater backward coupling from higher-order to lower-order sensorimotor regions from late adolescence in addition to differential associations between connectivity strength in a premotor-prefrontal network and motor performance for different age groups. We interpret these findings as reflecting greater use of top-down and executive control processes with development. These results expand our understanding of the cortical mechanisms that support dexterous abilities through development.</content:encoded>

                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Background&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is increasingly recognised as a multi-system disorder, presenting with common and impactful non-motor symptoms, such as neuropsychiatric symtpoms, cognitive and behavioural changes, pain, disordered sleep, fatigue and problematic saliva.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec2&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Aim/hypothesis&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;We aimed to systematically review 25 years of ALS clinical trials data to identify if non-motor features were evaluated, in addition to the traditional measures of motor functioning and survival, and where evaluated to describe the instruments used to assess. We hypothesised that assessment of non-motor symptoms has been largely neglected in trial design and not evaluated with ALS-suitable instruments.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec3&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Methods&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;We reviewed clinical trials of investigative medicinal products in ALS, since the licensing of riluzole in 1994. Trial registry databases including WHO International Trials Registry, European Clinical Trials Register, clinicaltrials.gov, and PubMed were systematically searched for Phase II, III or IV trials registered, completed or published between 01/01/1994 and 16/09/2020. No language restrictions were applied.&lt;/p&gt;

                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;237 clinical trials, including over 29,222 participants, were investigated for their use of non-motor outcome measures. These trials evaluated neuropsychiatric symptoms (75, 32%), cognitive impairment (16, 6.8%), behavioural change (34, 14%), pain (55, 23%), sleep disturbances (12, 5%) and fatigue (18, 8%). Problematic saliva was assessed as part of composite ALS-FRS(R) scores in 184 trials (78%) but with no focus on this as an isolated symptom. 31 (13%) trials including 3585 participants did not include any assessment of non-motor symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;

                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Non-motor symptoms such as neuropsychiatric, cognitive and behavioural changes, pain, disordered sleep, fatigue, and problematic saliva have not been consistently evaluated in trials for people with ALS. Where evaluated, non-symptoms were primarily assessed using instruments and impairment thresholds that are not adapted for people with ALS. Future trials should include non-motor symptom assessments to evaluate the additional potential therapeutic benefit of candidate drugs.&lt;/p&gt;

                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Sleep disturbance is common among individuals with Tourette’s Disorder (TD). Given that sleep is influenced by the circadian system, this study examined circadian rhythms and sleep in adults with TD, and explored the possible benefit of short-wavelength wearable morning light therapy.
      &lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;

                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Participants were 34 adults with TD (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 14) and age- and sex-matched healthy controls (HC; &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 20). Participants were screened using clinician-rated diagnostic and tic severity interviews, and procedures lasted 3 consecutive weeks. Participants completed a baseline week of actigraphy. Adults with TD completed 2 weeks of Re-Timer™ morning light therapy and continued actigraphy monitoring. Dim light melatonin-onset (DLMO) phase assessment, tic severity interview, and measures of chronotype, sleep disturbance, daytime sleepiness, disability, depression, anxiety, and stress were completed at baseline and post-intervention.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec3&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Adults with TD reported significantly greater eveningness and sleep disturbance relative to controls. Per wrist actigraphy, adults with TD exhibited significantly longer sleep-onset latency, lower sleep efficiency, and greater sleep fragmentation than HC. Following morning light therapy, there was a significant advance in DLMO phase, but not self-report or actigraphy sleep variables. There were small, statistically significant decreases in tic severity and impairment. There were also significant reductions in daytime sleepiness, and self-reported anxiety, but not depression, stress, or disability. Participants reported minimal side effects and rated light therapy as acceptable and comfortable.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec4&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Findings showed some benefits following brief light therapy in TD; further exploration of the impact of spectral tuning the photic environment as part of treatment for TD subjects is warranted.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Experimental Brain Research: Multisensory contribution in visuospatial orientation: an interaction between neck and trunk proprioception</title>
	<link>http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s00221-021-06146-0</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;A coherent perception of spatial orientation is key in maintaining postural control. To achieve this the brain must access sensory inputs encoding both the body and the head position and integrate them with incoming visual information. Here we isolated the contribution of proprioception to verticality perception and further investigated whether changing the body position without moving the head can modulate visual dependence—the extent to which an individual relies on visual cues for spatial orientation. Spatial orientation was measured in ten healthy individuals [6 female; 25–47 years (SD 7.8 years)] using a virtual reality based subjective visual vertical (SVV) task. Individuals aligned an arrow to their perceived gravitational vertical, initially against a static black background (10 trials), and then in other conditions with clockwise and counterclockwise background rotations (each 10 trials). In all conditions, subjects were seated first in the upright position, then with trunk tilted 20° to the right, followed by 20° to the left while the head was always aligned vertically. The SVV error was modulated by the trunk position, and it was greater when the trunk was tilted to the left compared to right or upright trunk positions (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001). Likewise, background rotation had an effect on SVV errors as these were greater with counterclockwise visual rotation compared to static background and clockwise roll motion (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001). Our results show that the interaction between neck and trunk proprioception can modulate how visual inputs affect spatial orientation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Current standard treatment in chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (CIDP) has been proved effective, but it is poorly effective in refractory patients and unclear for anti-IgG4 antibody-associated CIDP. Rituximab is a B cell-depleting monoclonal antibody. It has been applied as one of the management strategies in CIDP, but its efficacy is unknown.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec2&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Objective&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;To perform a systematic review and a meta-analysis of the efficacy of rituximab treatment in CIDP patients.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec3&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Methods&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Through searches in MEDLINE, PubMed, EMBASE, BIOSOS, Web of Science, and Cochrane library on March 31st, 2021, 15 studies were identified. Patients’ characteristics, treatment regime and outcome measure were extracted.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec4&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Ninety-six patients in 15 studies were included. The pooled estimate of responsiveness was 75% (95% CI 72–78%). The standard mean difference (SMD) of Inflammatory Neuropathy Cause and Treatment (INCAT) disability score improvement was 1.7 (95% CI 1.0–2.3, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; value &amp;lt; 0.0001) and the Medical Research Council (MRC) score for muscle power is 1.3 (95% CI − 2.6 to − 0.1, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; value 0.04). All of the anti-IgG4 antibody-positive patients showed excellent responses to rituximab treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec5&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Rituximab was effective in the treatment in CIDP patients, especially in anti-IgG4 antibody-positive patients. Randomized clinical trials are needed to determine the effectiveness and safety of rituximab in CIDP patients.&lt;/p&gt;

Following recent evidence of interoceptive signals modulating higher-level cognition, we examined whether breathing changes the production and perception of quantities.

In Experiment 2, 24 further adults estimated the numerosity of dot patterns that were briefly shown after either inhaling or exhaling. Again, we obtained on average larger responses following inhalation than exhalation. These converging results extend models of situated cognition according to which higher-level cognition is sensitive to transient interoceptive states.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jnr.24895?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
The pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD) remains elusive. There is still no available disease‐modifying strategy against PD, whose management is mainly symptomatic. A growing amount of preclinical evidence shows that a complex interplay between autophagy dysregulation, mitochondrial impairment, endoplasmic reticulum stress, oxidative stress, and excessive neuroinflammation underlies PD pathogenesis. Identifying key molecules linking these pathological cellular processes may substantially aid in our deeper understanding of PD pathophysiology and the development of novel effective therapeutic approaches. Emerging preclinical evidence indicates that apelin, an endogenous neuropeptide acting as a ligand of the orphan G protein‐coupled receptor APJ, may play a key neuroprotective role in PD pathogenesis, via inhibition of apoptosis and dopaminergic neuronal loss, autophagy enhancement, antioxidant effects, endoplasmic reticulum stress suppression, as well as prevention of synaptic dysregulation in the striatum, excessive neuroinflammation, and glutamate‐induced excitotoxicity. Underlying signaling pathways involve phosphoinositide 3‐kinase (PI3K)/Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin, extracellular signal‐regulated kinase 1/2, and inositol requiring kinase 1α/XBP1/C/EBP homologous protein. Herein, we discuss the role of apelin/APJ axis and associated molecular mechanisms on the pathogenesis of PD in vitro and in vivo and provide evidence for its challenging therapeutic potential.</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience Research: 14‐3‐3ζ is crucial for the conversion of labile short‐term object recognition memory into stable long‐term memory</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jnr.24894?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>The upregulation of 14‐3‐3ζ facilitates the transformation of labile object recognition memory (ORM) into stable ORM and causes the increase in brain‐derived growth factor (BDNF) expression, which further aids in the consolidation of newly formed ORM to long‐term memory. The blockage of either 14‐3‐3ζ or BDNF expression abolishes the formation of long‐term ORM (LT‐ORM).

Abstract
The consolidation of new memories into long‐lasting memories is multistage process characterized by distinct temporal dynamics. However, our understanding on the initial stage of transformation of labile memory of recent experience into stable memory remains elusive. Here, with the use of rats and mice overexpressing a memory enhancer called regulator of G protein signaling 14 of 414 amino acids (RGS14414) as a tool, we show that the expression of RGS14414 in male rats' perirhinal cortex (PRh), which is a brain area crucial for object recognition memory (ORM), enhanced the ORM to the extent that it caused the conversion of labile short‐term ORM (ST‐ORM) expected to last for 40 min into stable long‐term ORM (LT‐ORM) traceable after a delay of 24 hr, and that the temporal window of 40 to 60 min after object exposure not only was key for this conversion but also was the time frame when a surge in 14‐3‐3ζ protein was observed. A knockdown of 14‐3‐3ζ gene abrogated both the increase in 14‐3‐3ζ protein and the formation of LT‐ORM. Furthermore, this 14‐3‐3ζ upregulation increased brain‐derived growth factor (BDNF) levels in the time frame of 60 min and 24 hr and 14‐3‐3ζ knockdown decreased the BDNF levels, and a deletion of BDNF gene produced loss in mice ability to form LT‐ORM. Thus, within 60 min of object exposure, 14‐3‐3ζ facilitated the conversion of labile ORM into stable ORM, whereas beyond the 60 min, it mediated the consolidation of the stable memory into long‐lasting ORM by regulating BDNF signaling.</content:encoded>

Abstract
Repetitive behavioral phenotypes are a trait of several neuropsychiatric disorders, including obsessive‐compulsive disorder (OCD). Such behaviors are typified by complex interactions between cognitive and neurobiological processes which most likely contribute to the suboptimal treatment responses often observed. To this end, exploration of the adenosinergic system may be useful, since adenosine‐receptor modulation has previously shown promise to restore control over voluntary behavior and improve cognition in patients presenting with motor repetition. Here, we employed the deer mouse (Peromyscus maniculatus bairdii) model of compulsive‐like behavioral persistence, seeking to investigate possible associations between stereotypic motor behavior and cognitive flexibility as measured in the T‐maze continuous alternation task (T‐CAT). The effect of istradefylline, a selective adenosine A2A receptor antagonist at two doses (10 and 20 mg kg−1 day−1) on the expression of stereotypy and T‐CAT performance in high (H) and non‐(N) stereotypical animals, was investigated in comparison to a control intervention (six groups; n = 8 or 9 per group). No correlation between H behavior and T‐CAT performance was found. However, H but not N animals presented with istradefylline‐sensitive spontaneous alternation and stereotypy, in that istradefylline at both doses significantly improved the spontaneous alternation scores and attenuated the stereotypical expression of H animals. Thus, evidence is presented that anti‐adenosinergic drug action improves repetitive behavior and spontaneous alternation in stereotypical deer mice, putatively pointing to a shared psychobiological construct underlying naturalistic stereotypy and alterations in cognitive flexibility in deer mice.</content:encoded>

Abstract
Freshwater snails of the genus Biomphalaria serve as intermediate hosts for the digenetic trematode Schistosoma mansoni, the etiological agent for the most widespread form of intestinal schistosomiasis. As neuropeptide signaling in host snails can be altered by trematode infection, a neural transcriptomics approach was undertaken to identify peptide precursors in Biomphalaria glabrata, the major intermediate host for S. mansoni in the Western Hemisphere. Three transcripts that encode peptides belonging to the FMRF‐NH2‐related peptide (FaRP) family were identified in B. glabrata. One transcript encoded a precursor polypeptide (Bgl‐FaRP1; 292 amino acids) that included eight copies of the tetrapeptide FMRF‐NH2 and single copies of FIRF‐NH2, FLRF‐NH2, and pQFYRI‐NH2. The second transcript encoded a precursor (Bgl‐FaRP2; 347 amino acids) that comprised 14 copies of the heptapeptide GDPFLRF‐NH2 and 1 copy of SKPYMRF‐NH2. The precursor encoded by the third transcript (Bgl‐FaRP3; 287 amino acids) recapitulated Bgl‐FaRP2 but lacked the full SKPYMRF‐NH2 peptide. The three precursors shared a common signal peptide, suggesting a genomic organization described previously in gastropods. Immunohistochemical studies were performed on the nervous systems of B. glabrata and B. alexandrina, a major intermediate host for S. mansoni in Egypt. FMRF‐NH2‐like immunoreactive (FMRF‐NH2‐li) neurons were located in regions of the central nervous system associated with reproduction, feeding, and cardiorespiration. Antisera raised against non‐FMRF‐NH2 peptides present in the tetrapeptide and heptapeptide precursors labeled independent subsets of the FMRF‐NH2‐li neurons. This study supports the participation of FMRF‐NH2‐related neuropeptides in the regulation of vital physiological and behavioral systems that are altered by parasitism in Biomphalaria.</content:encoded>

&lt;i&gt;Staphylococcus aureus&lt;/i&gt; is a serious human and animal pathogen threat exhibiting extraordinary capacity for acquiring new antibiotic resistance traits in the pathogen population worldwide.
The development of fast, affordable and effective diagnostic solutions capable of discriminating between antibiotic-resistant and susceptible &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;aureus&lt;/i&gt; strains would be of huge benefit for effective disease detection and treatment. Here we develop a diagnostics solution that uses Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionisation–Time of Flight Mass Spectrometry (MALDI-TOF) and machine learning, to identify signature profiles of antibiotic resistance to either multidrug or benzylpenicillin in &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;aureus&lt;/i&gt; isolates. Using ten different supervised learning techniques, we have analysed a set of 82 &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;aureus&lt;/i&gt; isolates collected from 67 cows diagnosed with bovine mastitis across 24 farms. For the multidrug phenotyping analysis, LDA, linear SVM, RBF SVM, logistic regression, naïve Bayes, MLP neural network and QDA had Cohen’s kappa values over 85.00%. For the benzylpenicillin phenotyping analysis, RBF SVM, MLP neural network, naïve Bayes, logistic regression, linear SVM, QDA, LDA, and random forests had Cohen’s kappa values over 85.00%. For the benzylpenicillin the diagnostic systems achieved up to (mean result ± standard deviation over 30 runs on the test set): accuracy = 97.54% ± 1.91%, sensitivity = 99.93% ± 0.25%, specificity = 95.04% ± 3.83%, and Cohen’s kappa = 95.04% ± 3.83%. Moreover, the diagnostic platform complemented by a protein-protein network and 3D structural protein information framework allowed the identification of five molecular determinants underlying the susceptible and resistant profiles. Four proteins were able to classify multidrug-resistant and susceptible strains with 96.81% ± 0.43% accuracy. Five proteins, including the previous four, were able to classify benzylpenicillin resistant and susceptible strains with 97.54% ± 1.91% accuracy.

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: A physicochemical model of odor sampling</title>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Mitchell E. Gronowitz, Adam Liu, Qiang Qiu, C. Ron Yu, Thomas A. Cleland&lt;/p&gt;

We present a general physicochemical sampling model for olfaction, based on established pharmacological laws, in which arbitrary combinations of odorant ligands and receptors can be generated and their individual and collective effects on odor representations and olfactory performance measured. Individual odor ligands exhibit receptor-specific affinities and efficacies; that is, they may bind strongly or weakly to a given receptor, and can act as strong agonists, weak agonists, partial agonists, or antagonists. Ligands interacting with common receptors compete with one another for dwell time; these competitive interactions appropriately simulate the degeneracy that fundamentally defines the capacities and limitations of odorant sampling. The outcome of these competing ligand-receptor interactions yields a pattern of receptor activation levels, thereafter mapped to glomerular presynaptic activation levels based on the convergence of sensory neuron axons. The metric of greatest interest is the mean discrimination sensitivity, a measure of how effectively the olfactory system at this level is able to recognize a small change in the physicochemical quality of a stimulus. This model presents several significant outcomes, both expected and surprising. First, adding additional receptors reliably improves the system’s discrimination sensitivity. Second, in contrast, adding additional ligands to an odor scene initially can improve discrimination sensitivity, but eventually will reduce it as the number of ligands increases. Third, the presence of antagonistic ligand-receptor interactions produced clear benefits for sensory system performance, generating higher absolute discrimination sensitivities and increasing the numbers of competing ligands that could be present before discrimination sensitivity began to be impaired. Finally, the model correctly reflects and explains the modest reduction in odor discrimination sensitivity exhibited by transgenic mice in which the specificity of glomerular targeting by primary olfactory neurons is partially disrupted.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/QetEW3-tyP0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Stochastic optimal feedforward-feedback control determines timing and variability of arm movements with or without vision</title>

Human movements with or without vision exhibit timing (i.e. speed and duration) and variability characteristics which are not well captured by existing computational models. Here, we introduce a stochastic optimal feedforward-feedback control (SFFC) model that can predict the nominal timing and trial-by-trial variability of self-paced arm reaching movements carried out with or without online visual feedback of the hand. In SFFC, movement timing results from the minimization of the intrinsic factors of effort and variance due to constant and signal-dependent motor noise, and movement variability depends on the integration of visual feedback. Reaching arm movements data are used to examine the effect of online vision on movement timing and variability, and test the model. This modelling suggests that the central nervous system predicts the effects of sensorimotor noise to generate an optimal feedforward motor command, and triggers optimal feedback corrections to task-related errors based on the available limb state estimate.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/j0tKNrqoHlE&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Inclusion of maintenance energy improves the intracellular flux predictions of CHO</title>

Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells are the leading platform for the production of biopharmaceuticals with human-like glycosylation. The standard practice for cell line generation relies on trial and error approaches such as adaptive evolution and high-throughput screening, which typically take several months. Metabolic modeling could aid in designing better producer cell lines and thus shorten development times. The genome-scale metabolic model (GSMM) of CHO can accurately predict growth rates. However, in order to predict rational engineering strategies it also needs to accurately predict intracellular fluxes. In this work we evaluated the agreement between the fluxes predicted by parsimonious flux balance analysis (pFBA) using the CHO GSMM and a wide range of &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C metabolic flux data from literature. While glycolytic fluxes were predicted relatively well, the fluxes of tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle were vastly underestimated due to too low energy demand. Inclusion of computationally estimated maintenance energy significantly improved the overall accuracy of intracellular flux predictions. Maintenance energy was therefore determined experimentally by running continuous cultures at different growth rates and evaluating their respective energy consumption. The experimentally and computationally determined maintenance energy were in good agreement. Additionally, we compared alternative objective functions (minimization of uptake rates of seven nonessential metabolites) to the biomass objective. While the predictions of the uptake rates were quite inaccurate for most objectives, the predictions of the intracellular fluxes were comparable to the biomass objective function.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/XPTg3xYZeQk&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Existing software tools for topology-based pathway enrichment analysis are either computationally inefficient, have undesirable statistical power, or require expert knowledge to leverage the methods’ capabilities. To address these limitations, we have overhauled NetGSA, an existing topology-based method, to provide a computationally-efficient user-friendly tool that offers interactive visualization. Pathway enrichment analysis for thousands of genes can be performed in minutes on a personal computer without sacrificing statistical power. The new software also removes the need for expert knowledge by directly curating gene-gene interaction information from multiple external databases. Lastly, by utilizing the capabilities of Cytoscape, the new software also offers interactive and intuitive network visualization.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/sI-LUVLcQJw&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Efficient representations of tumor diversity with paired DNA-RNA aberrations</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/5uFgp5U90fw/article</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Qian Ke, Wikum Dinalankara, Laurent Younes, Donald Geman, Luigi Marchionni&lt;/p&gt;

Cancer cells display massive dysregulation of key regulatory pathways due to now well-catalogued mutations and other DNA-related aberrations. Moreover, enormous heterogeneity has been commonly observed in the identity, frequency and location of these aberrations across individuals with the same cancer type or subtype, and this variation naturally propagates to the transcriptome, resulting in myriad types of dysregulated gene expression programs. Many have argued that a more integrative and quantitative analysis of heterogeneity of DNA and RNA molecular profiles may be necessary for designing more systematic explorations of alternative therapies and improving predictive accuracy. We introduce a representation of multi-&lt;i&gt;omics&lt;/i&gt; profiles which is sufficiently rich to account for observed heterogeneity and support the construction of quantitative, integrated, metrics of variation. Starting from the network of interactions existing in Reactome, we build a library of “paired DNA-RNA aberrations” that represent prototypical and recurrent patterns of dysregulation in cancer; each two-gene “Source-Target Pair” (STP) consists of a “source” regulatory gene and a “target” gene whose expression is plausibly “controlled” by the source gene. The STP is then “aberrant” in a joint DNA-RNA profile if the source gene is DNA-aberrant (&lt;i&gt;e.g&lt;/i&gt;., mutated, deleted, or duplicated), and the downstream target gene is “RNA-aberrant”, meaning its expression level is outside the normal, baseline range. With &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt; STPs, each sample profile has exactly one of the 2&lt;sup&gt;M&lt;/sup&gt; possible configurations. We concentrate on subsets of STPs, and the corresponding reduced configurations, by selecting tissue-dependent minimal coverings, defined as the smallest family of STPs with the property that every sample in the considered population displays at least one aberrant STP within that family. These minimal coverings can be computed with integer programming. Given such a covering, a natural measure of cross-sample diversity is the extent to which the particular aberrant STPs composing a covering vary from sample to sample; this variability is captured by the entropy of the distribution over configurations. We apply this program to data from TCGA for six distinct tumor types (breast, prostate, lung, colon, liver, and kidney cancer). This enables an efficient simplification of the complex landscape observed in cancer populations, resulting in the identification of novel signatures of molecular alterations which are not detected with frequency-based criteria. Estimates of cancer heterogeneity across tumor phenotypes reveals a stable pattern: entropy increases with disease severity. This framework is then well-suited to accommodate the expanding complexity of cancer genomes and epigenomes emerging from large consortia projects.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/5uFgp5U90fw&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Tonic activity in the levator palpebrae superioris muscle, which holds the upper eyelid open, is interrupted during blinks. Here, we demonstrate a monosynpatic pathway from cells distributed along the rostral edge of the principal trigeminal nucleus that targets, and presumably inhibits, levator motoneurons for blinks triggered from the face.







Abstract
For normal viewing, the eyes are held open by the tonic actions of the levator palpebrae superioris (levator) muscle raising the upper eyelid. This activity is interrupted during blinks, when the eyelid sweeps down to spread the tear film or protect the cornea. We examined the circuit connecting the principal trigeminal nucleus to the levator motoneurons by use of both anterograde and retrograde tracers in macaque monkeys. Injections of anterograde tracer were made into the principal trigeminal nucleus using either a stereotaxic approach or localization following physiological characterization of trigeminal second order neurons. Anterogradely labeled axonal arbors were located both within the caudal central subdivision, which contains levator motoneurons, and in the adjacent supraoculomotor area. Labeled boutons made synaptic contacts on retrogradely labeled levator motoneurons indicating a monosynaptic connection. As the eye is also retracted through the actions of the rectus muscles during a blink, we examined whether these trigeminal injections labeled boutons contacting rectus motoneurons within the oculomotor nucleus. These were not found when the injection sites were confined to the principal trigeminal nucleus region. To identify the source of the projection to the levator motoneurons, we injected retrograde tracer into the oculomotor complex. Retrogradely labeled cells were confined to a narrow, dorsoventrally oriented cell population that lined the rostral edge of the principal trigeminal nucleus. Presumably these cells inhibit levator motoneurons, while other parts of the trigeminal sensory complex are activating orbicularis oculi motoneurons, when a blink is initiated by sensory stimuli contacting the face.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Whilst SARS‐CoV‐2 vaccines are very safe, we report four cases of the bifacial weakness with paraesthesias variant of Guillain‐Barré syndrome (GBS) occurring within three weeks of vaccination with the Oxford‐AstraZeneca SARS‐CoV‐2 vaccine. This rare neurological syndrome has previously been reported in association with SARS‐CoV‐2 infection itself. Our cases were given either intravenous immunoglobulin, oral steroids, or no treatment. We suggest vigilance for cases of bifacial weakness with paraesthesias variant GBS following vaccination for SARS‐CoV‐2 and that post‐vaccination surveillance programs ensure robust data capture of this outcome, to assess for causality.

                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Background&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;The COVID-19 pandemic outbreak has dramatically disrupted healthcare systems. Two rapid WHO pulse surveys studied disruptions in mental health services, but did not particularly focus on neurology. Here, a global survey was conducted and addresses the impact of the pandemic on neurology services.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec2&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Methods&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;A cross-sectional study was carried out in which 34 international neurological associations were asked to distribute the survey to national associations. The responses represented the national situation, in November–December 2020, with regard to the main disrupted neurological services, reasons and the mitigation strategies implemented as well as the disruption on training of residents and on neurological research. A comparison with the situation in February–April 2020, first pandemic wave, was also requested.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec3&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Findings&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;54 completed surveys came from 43 countries covering all the 6 WHO regions. Overall, neurological services disruption was reported as mild by 26%, moderate by 30%, complete by 13% of associations. The most affected services were cross-sectoral neurological services (57%) and neurorehabilitation (56%). The second wave of the pandemic, however, was associated with the improvement of service provision for diagnostics services (44%) and for neurorehabilitation (41%). Governmental directives were the major cause of services’ disruption (56%). Mitigation strategies were mostly established through telemedicine (48%). Almost half of respondents reported a significant impact on neurological research (48%) and educational activities (60%). Most associations (67%) were not involved in decision making for neurological patients’ issues by their national government.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec4&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;The COVID-19 pandemic affects neurological services and raises the universal need for the development of neurological health care at the policy, systems and services levels. A global national plan on mitigation strategies for disruption of neurological services during pandemic situations should be established and neurological scientific and patients associations should get involved in decision making.&lt;/p&gt;

                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Visually guided reaching precision and accuracy depend on the level of coupling between movements of the eyes and hand. In the present study, participants performed central fixations and either saccadic or smooth pursuit eye movements during fast and accurate reaching tasks involving eye–hand coupling and decoupling to better understand type of eye movement influence over upper limb control. Some eye–hand coupling and decoupling tasks also included hand reversals, where the hand moves away from the target to direct a cursor toward the target to account for various levels of hand–cursor and eye–cursor coupling. Regardless of eye-movement type, eye–hand–cursor coupling produced an endpoint accuracy advantage over decoupling. Use of hand reversal decreased peak speed and increased response time of the hand, whether considering fixation or a given eye movement. Use of smooth pursuit slowed hand movements relative to saccades, yet improved endpoint accuracy. Compared to central fixations, using smooth pursuit also slowed hand movements, while using saccades decreased, thus improved, hand reaction times. Data suggest an advantage, when using smooth pursuit to track the hand movement for the greatest endpoint accuracy, an advantage when using saccades for the fastest movements, and an eye–hand coupling advantage when using saccades for the shortest reactions. Researchers should provide clear eye-movement instructions for participants and/or monitor the eyes when assessing similar upper limb control to account for possible differences in eye movements used. Moreover, the type of eye movement chosen for participants should correspond to the primary goal of the task.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience: Perception of Social Odor and Gender-Related Differences Investigated Through the Use of Transfer Entropy and Embodied Medium</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2021.650528</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The perception of putative pheromones or social odors (PPSO) in humans is a widely debated topic because the published results seem ambiguous. Our research aimed to evaluate how cross-modal processing of PPSO and gender voice can affect the behavioral and psychophysiological states of the subject during a listening task with a bodily contact medium, and how these effects could be gender related. Before the experimental session, three embodied media, were exposed to volatilized estratetraenol (Estr), 5α-androst-16-en-3 α-ol (Andr), and Vaseline oil. The experimental session consisted in listening to a story that were transmitted, with a male or female voice, by the communicative medium via a Bluetooth system during a listening task, recorded through 64-active channel electroencephalography (EEG). The sense of co-presence and social presence, elicited by the medium, showed how the established relationship with the medium was gender dependent and modulated by the PPSO. In particular, Andr induced greater responses related to co-presence. The gender of the participants was related to the co-presence desire, where women imagined higher medium co-presence than men. EEG findings seemed to be more responsive to the PPSO–gender voice interaction, than behavioral results. The mismatch between female PPSO and male voice elicited the greatest cortical flow of information. In the case of the Andr–male voice condition, the trained model appeared to assign more relevance to the flow of information to the right frontotemporal regions (involved in odor recognition memory and social behavior). The Estr–male voice condition showed activation of the bilateral frontoparietal network, which is linked to cognitive control, cognitive flexibility, and auditory consciousness. The model appears to distinguish the dissonance condition linked to Andr matched with a female voice: it highlights a flow of information to the right occipital lobe and to the frontal pole. The PPSO could influence the co-presence judgements and EEG response. The results seem suggest that could be an implicit pattern linked to PPSO-related gender differences and gender voice.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Gene Dosage- and Age-Dependent Differential Transcriptomic Changes in the Prefrontal Cortex of Shank2-Mutant Mice</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2021.683196</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Shank2 is an abundant postsynaptic scaffolding protein that is known to regulate excitatory synapse assembly and synaptic transmission and has been implicated in various neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Previous studies on Shank2-mutant mice provided mechanistic insights into their autistic-like phenotypes, but it remains unclear how transcriptomic patterns are changed in brain regions of the mutant mice in age- and gene dosage-dependent manners. To this end, we performed RNA-Seq analyses of the transcripts from the prefrontal cortex (PFC) of heterozygous and homozygous Shank2-mutant mice lacking exons 6 and 7 at juvenile (week 3) and adult (week 12) stages. Juvenile heterozygous Shank2-mutant mice showed upregulation of glutamate synapse-related genes, downregulation of ribosomal and mitochondrial genes, and transcriptomic changes that are opposite to those observed in ASD (anti-ASD) such as upregulation of ASD_down (downregulated in ASD), GABA neuron-related, and oligodendrocyte-related genes. Juvenile homozygous Shank2 mice showed upregulation of chromatin-related genes and transcriptomic changes that are in line with those occurring in ASD (pro-ASD) such as downregulation of ASD_down, GABA neuron-related, and oligodendrocyte-related genes. Adult heterozygous and homozygous Shank2-mutant mice both exhibited downregulation of ribosomal and mitochondrial genes and pro-ASD transcriptomic changes. Therefore, the gene dosage- and age-dependent effects of Shank2 deletions in mice include differential transcriptomic changes across distinct functional contexts, including synapses, chromatin, ribosomes, mitochondria, GABA neurons, and oligodendrocytes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Whole-Brain Imaging of Subvoxel T1-Diffusion Correlation Spectra in Human Subjects</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.671465</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;T1 relaxation and water mobility generate eloquent MRI tissue contrasts with great diagnostic value in many neuroradiological applications. However, conventional methods do not adequately quantify the microscopic heterogeneity of these important biophysical properties within a voxel, and therefore have limited biological specificity. We describe a new correlation spectroscopic (CS) MRI method for measuring how T1 and mean diffusivity (MD) co-vary in microscopic tissue environments. We develop a clinical pulse sequence that combines inversion recovery (IR) with single-shot isotropic diffusion encoding (IDE) to efficiently acquire whole-brain MRIs with a wide range of joint T1-MD weightings. Unlike conventional diffusion encoding, the IDE preparation ensures that all subvoxel water pools are weighted by their MDs regardless of the sizes, shapes, and orientations of their corresponding microscopic diffusion tensors. Accordingly, IR-IDE measurements are well-suited for model-free, quantitative spectroscopic analysis of microscopic water pools. Using numerical simulations, phantom experiments, and data from healthy volunteers we demonstrate how IR-IDE MRIs can be processed to reconstruct maps of two-dimensional joint probability density functions, i.e., correlation spectra, of subvoxel T1-MD values. In vivo T1-MD spectra show distinct cerebrospinal fluid and parenchymal tissue components specific to white matter, cortical gray matter, basal ganglia, and myelinated fiber pathways, suggesting the potential for improved biological specificity. The one-dimensional marginal distributions derived from the T1-MD correlation spectra agree well with results from other relaxation spectroscopic and quantitative MRI studies, validating the T1-MD contrast encoding and the spectral reconstruction. Mapping subvoxel T1-diffusion correlations in patient populations may provide a more nuanced, comprehensive, sensitive, and specific neuroradiological assessment of the non-specific changes seen on fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) and diffusion-weighted MRIs (DWIs) in cancer, ischemic stroke, or brain injury.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Deep Brain Stimulation Complications in Patients With Parkinson’s Disease and Surgical Modifications: A Single-Center Retrospective Analysis</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.684895</link>
	<content:encoded>Background&lt;p&gt;As a complication-prone operation, deep brain stimulation (DBS) has become the first-line surgical approach for patients with advanced Parkinson’s disease (PD). This study aimed to evaluate the incidence and risk factors of DBS-associated complications.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;We have reviewed a consecutive series of patients with PD undergoing DBS procedures to describe the type, severity, management, and outcome of postoperative complications from January 2011 to December 2018. Both univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to identify statistically significant risk factors. We also described our surgical strategies to minimize the adverse events.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;A total of 225 patients underwent 229 DBS implantation procedures (440 electrodes), of whom 20 patients experienced 23 DBS-associated complications, including ten operation-related complications and 13 hardware-related ones. Univariate analysis elucidated that comorbid medical conditions (P = 0.024), hypertension (P = 0.003), early-stage operation (P &amp;lt; 0.001), and unilateral electrode implantation (P = 0.029) as risk factors for overall complications, or more specifically, operation-related complications demonstrated in the stratified analysis. In contrast, no risk factor for hardware-related complications was identified. Statistical significances of hypertension (OR = 3.33, 95% CI: 1.14–9.71, P = 0.027) and early-stage (OR = 11.04, 95% CI: 2.42–50.45, P = 0.002) were further validated via multivariate analysis. As the annual number of DBS procedures increased, the incidence of complications gradually decreased (R = −0.699, P &amp;lt; 0.01). Additionally, there was a strong correlation between surgical complications and unplanned readmission (R = 0.730, P &amp;lt; 0.01).&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;The importance of cumulative experience and relevant technique modifications should be addressed to prevent DBS-associated complications and unplanned readmission.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Intermodal Priming of Cognitive Conflict? A Failed Replication of Mager et al. (2009)</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.680885</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Introduction: The present study was conducted to verify a promising experimental setup which demonstrated an inversed Stroop-effect (much faster responses for incongruent relative to congruent Stroop trials) following a mismatching tone. In the matching condition, which was an almost exact replication of the original study, participants were required to indicate whether word color and word meaning were matching, whereas in the response conflict condition, instruction was the same as in a classical Stroop task and required the participants to respond to the word color. As in the original study, each trial was preceded by a sine tone which was deviant in pitch in 20% of the trials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: The main result was that the Stroop effect was not inversed after deviant tones, neither under the matching task instruction nor under the response conflict task instruction. The Stroop effect was unaffected by the previous “conceptual mismatch.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: The current study failed to replicate the astonishing concept of “conflict priming” reported in previous work and does not open the doors for a new window on sequences of conflicts. Nevertheless, the failed replication is valuable for future research, since it demonstrated that “Conflict Priming” as a facilitation of processing of conflict trials following deviant tones, is not an confirmed finding.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Oscillatory Correlates of Selective Restudy</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.679823</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Prior behavioral work has shown that selective restudy of some studied items leaves recall of the other studied items unaffected when lag between study and restudy is short, but improves recall of the other items when lag is prolonged. The beneficial effect has been attributed to context retrieval, assuming that selective restudy reactivates the context at study and thus provides a retrieval cue for the other items (Bäuml, 2019). Here the results of two experiments are reported, in each of which subjects studied a list of items and then, after a short 2-min or a prolonged 10-min lag, restudied some of the list items. Participants' electroencephalography (EEG) was recorded during both the study and restudy phases. In Experiment 2, but not in Experiment 1, subjects engaged in a mental context reinstatement task immediately before the restudy phase started, trying to mentally reinstate the study context. Results of Experiment 1 revealed a theta/alpha power increase from study to restudy after short lag and an alpha/beta power decrease after long lag. Engagement in the mental context reinstatement task in Experiment 2 eliminated the decrease in alpha/beta power. The results are consistent with the view that the observed alpha/beta decrease reflects context retrieval, which became obsolete when there was preceding mental context reinstatement.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Not Just a Pot: Visual Episodic Memory in Cannabis Users and Polydrug Cannabis Users: ROC and ERP Preliminary Investigation</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.677793</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Background While research has consistently identified an association between long-term cannabis use and memory impairments, few studies have examined this relationship in a polydrug context (i.e., when combining cannabis with other substances).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aims: In this preliminary study, we used event-related potentials to examine the recognition process in a visual episodic memory task in cannabis users (CU) and cannabis polydrug users (PU). We hypothesized that CU and PU will have both–behavioral and psychophysiological–indicators of memory processes affected, compared to matched non-using controls with the PU expressing more severe changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods 29 non-using controls (CG), 24 CU and 27 PU were enrolled into the study. All participants completed a visual learning recognition task while brain electrical activity was recorded. Event-related potentials were calculated for familiar (old) and new images from a signal recorded during a subsequent recognition test. We used receiver operating characteristic curves for behavioral data analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results The groups did not differ in memory performance based on receiver operating characteristic method in accuracy and discriminability indicators nor mean reaction times for old/new images. The frontal old/new effect expected from prior research was observed for all participants, while a parietal old/new effect was not observed. While, the significant differences in the late parietal component (LPC) amplitude was observed between CG and PU but not between CG and CU nor CU and PU. Linear regression analysis was used to examine the mean amplitude of the LPC component as a predictor of memory performance accuracy indicator. LPC amplitude predicts recognition accuracy only in the CG.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion The results showed alterations in recognition memory processing in CU and PU groups compared to CG, which were not manifested on the behavioral level, and were the most prominent in cannabis polydrug users. We interpret it as a manifestation of the cumulative effect of multiple drug usage in the PU group.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Enhanced Visual Feedback Using Immersive VR Affects Decision Making Regarding Hand Use With a Simulated Impaired Limb</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.677578</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The long-term effects of impairment have a negative impact on the quality of life of stroke patients in terms of not using the affected limb even after some recovery (i.e., learned non-use). Immersive virtual reality (IVR) has been introduced as a new approach for the treatment of stroke rehabilitation. We propose an IVR-based therapeutic approach to incorporate positive reinforcement components in motor coordination as opposed to constraint-induced movement therapy (CIMT). This study aimed to investigate the effect of IVR-reinforced physical therapy that incorporates positive reinforcement components in motor coordination. To simulate affected upper limb function loss in patients, a wrist weight was attached to the dominant hand of participant. Participants were asked to choose their right or left hand to reach toward a randomly allocated target. The movement of the virtual image of the upper limb was reinforced by visual feedback to participants, that is, the participants perceived their motor coordination as if their upper limb was moving to a greater degree than what was occurring in everyday life. We found that the use of the simulated affected limb was increased after the visual feedback enhancement intervention, and importantly, the effect was maintained even after gradual withdrawal of the visual amplification. The results suggest that positive reinforcement within the IVR could induce an effect on decision making in hand usage.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Purpose&lt;p&gt;The purpose of the study was to investigate the brain functional alteration in patients with thyroid-associated ophthalmopathy (TAO) by evaluating the spontaneous neural activity changes using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) with the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF) method.&lt;/p&gt;Materials and Methods&lt;p&gt;The rs-fMRI data of 30 TAO patients (15 active and 15 inactive) and 15 healthy controls (HCs) were included for analyses. The ALFF values were calculated and compared among groups. Correlations between ALFF values and clinical metrics were assessed.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Compared with HCs, active TAOs showed significantly decreased ALFF values in the left middle occipital gyrus, superior occipital gyrus, and cuneus. Compared with inactive TAOs, active TAOs showed significantly increased ALFF values in the bilateral precuneus. Additionally, inactive TAOs showed significantly decreased ALFF values in the left middle occipital gyrus, superior occipital gyrus, cuneus, and bilateral precuneus than HCs. The ALFF value in the right precuneus of TAOs was positively correlated with clinical activity score (r = 0.583, P &amp;lt; 0.001) and Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score (r = 0.377, P = 0.040), and negatively correlated with disease duration (r = −0.382, P = 0.037). Moreover, the ALFF value in the left middle occipital gyrus of TAOs was positively correlated with visual acuity (r = 0.441, P = 0.015).&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;TAO patients had altered spontaneous brain activities in the left occipital lobe and bilateral precuneus. The neuropsychological aspect of the disease should be noticed during clinical diagnosis and treatment.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Physical Activity as a Treatment for Social Anxiety in Clinical and Non-clinical Populations: A Systematic Review and Three Meta-Analyses for Different Study Designs</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.653108</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The fear of being in the focus of attention in social situations can develop into a social anxiety disorder (SAD). The classical treatment for SAD is cognitive behavioral therapy, which is in many cases accompanied by drug treatments. A promising alternative treatment is physical activity (PA) interventions, because regular PA has been shown to be suitable for reducing anxiety in general. We conducted a pre-registered systematic review and meta-analysis (PROSPERO registration no. CRD42020191181) as well as two additional searches. Our aim was to investigate whether PA interventions are a suitable treatment for SAD and whether PA is suitable for reducing social anxiety (SA) in general. For studies with randomized controlled trial designs, a not statistically significant effect of medium size toward lower general SA symptomatology was found in the PA group in comparison with the control group (d = −0.24, p = 0.377). For studies with longitudinal designs, significantly lower SA symptoms were found after PA treatments (d = −0.22, p = 0.001). The effect of PA on SA was stronger for adults than for children and adolescents (p = 0.003). For cross-sectional studies, a small negative association between SA symptoms and the amount of PA was found, i.e., lower SA was found for people who were more physically active (r = −0.12, p = 0.003). We conclude that PA is a promising means for the (additional) treatment of SAD or to reduce SA in general in non-clinical samples, but more research in which high-quality studies with randomized controlled trial designs are used is needed. Furthermore, open questions with respect to moderating variables (e.g., age, sex, BMI, type of intervention, stress, amount of regular PA before the intervention, and comorbidities) remain still open.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: The Automatic but Flexible and Content-Dependent Nature of Syntax</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.651158</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Syntactic processing has often been considered an utmost example of unconscious automatic processing. In this line, it has been demonstrated that masked words containing syntactic anomalies are processed by our brain triggering event related potential (ERP) components similar to the ones triggered by conscious syntactic anomalies, thus supporting the automatic nature of the syntactic processing. Conversely, recent evidence also points out that regardless of the level of awareness, emotional information and other relevant extralinguistic information modulate conscious syntactic processing too. These results are also in line with suggestions that, under certain circumstances, syntactic processing could also be flexible and context-dependent. However, the study of the concomitant automatic but flexible conception of syntactic parsing is very scarce. Hence, to this aim, we examined whether and how masked emotional words (positive, negative, and neutral masked adjectives) containing morphosyntactic anomalies (half of the cases) affect linguistic comprehension of an ongoing unmasked sentence that also can contain a number agreement anomaly between the noun and the verb. ERP components were observed to emotional information (EPN), masked anomalies (LAN and a weak P600), and unmasked ones (LAN/N400 and P600). Furthermore, interactions in the processing of conscious and unconscious morphosyntactic anomalies and between unconscious emotional information and conscious anomalies were detected. The findings support, on the one hand, the automatic nature of syntax, given that syntactic components LAN and P600 were observed to unconscious anomalies. On the other hand, the flexible, permeable, and context-dependent nature of the syntactic processing is also supported, since unconscious information modulated conscious syntactic components. This double nature of syntactic processing is in line with theories of automaticity, suggesting that even unconscious/automatic, syntactic processing is flexible, adaptable, and context-dependent.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Local Functional MR Change Pattern and Its Association With Cognitive Function in Objectively-Defined Subtle Cognitive Decline</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.684918</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Introduction: To identify individuals with preclinical cognitive impairment, researchers proposed the concept of objectively-defined subtle cognitive decline (Obj-SCD). However, it is not clear whether Obj-SCD has characteristic brain function changes. In this study, we aimed at exploring the changing pattern of brain function activity in Obj-SCD individuals and the similarities and differences with mild cognitive impairments (MCI).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Method: 37 healthy control individuals, 25 Obj-SCD individuals (with the impairment in memory and language domain), and 28 aMCI individuals were included. Resting-state fMRI and neuropsychological tests were performed. fALFF was used to reflect the local functional activity and compared between groups. Finally, we analyzed the correlation between the fALFF values of significantly changed regions and neuropsychological performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: We found similar functional activity enhancements in some local brain regions in the Obj-SCD and aMCI groups, including the left orbital part of the inferior frontal gyrus and the left median cingulate and paracingulate gyri. However, some changes in local functional activities of the Obj-SCD group showed different patterns from the aMCI group. Compared with healthy control (HC), the Obj-SCD group showed increased local functional activity in the right middle occipital gyrus, decreased local functional activity in the left precuneus and the left inferior temporal gyrus. In the Obj-SCD group, in normal band, the fALFF value of the right middle occipital gyrus was significantly negatively correlated with Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score (r = −0.450, p = 0.024) and Animal Verbal Fluency Test (AFT) score (r = −0.402, p = 0.046); the left inferior temporal gyrus was significantly positively correlated with MMSE score (r = 0.588, p = 0.002). In slow-4 band, the fALFF value of the left precuneus was significantly positively correlated with MMSE score (r = 0.468, p = 0.018) and AFT score (r = 0.600, p = 0.002). In the aMCI group, the fALFF value of the left orbital part of the inferior frontal gyrus was significantly positively correlated with Auditory Verbal Learning Test (AVLT) long delay cued recall score (r = 0.506, p = 0.006).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: The Obj-SCD group showed a unique changing pattern; the functional changes of different brain regions have a close but different correlation with cognitive impairment, indicating that there may be a complex pathological basis inside. This suggests that Obj-SCD may be a separate stage of cognitive decline before aMCI and is helpful to the study of preclinical cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: The Unfolded Protein Response in Immune Cells as an Emerging Regulator of Neuroinflammation</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.682633</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Immune surveillance is an essential process that safeguards the homeostasis of a healthy brain. Among the increasing diversity of immune cells present in the central nervous system (CNS), microglia have emerged as a prominent leukocyte subset with key roles in the support of brain function and in the control of neuroinflammation. In fact, impaired microglial function is associated with the development of neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and Parkinson’s disease (PD). Interestingly, these pathologies are also typified by protein aggregation and proteostasis dysfunction at the level of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). These processes trigger activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR), which is a conserved signaling network that maintains the fidelity of the cellular proteome. Remarkably, beyond its role in protein folding, the UPR has also emerged as a key regulator of the development and function of immune cells. However, despite this evidence, the contribution of the UPR to immune cell homeostasis, immune surveillance, and neuro-inflammatory processes remains largely unexplored. In this review, we discuss the potential contribution of the UPR in brain-associated immune cells in the context of neurodegenerative diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.680672</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Objective: Subjective cognitive decline (SCD) is associated with an increased risk of clinical cognitive disorders. Post-operative delirium (POD) is a common complication after total hip replacement. We aimed to investigate the relationship between SCD and POD in patients undergoing total hip replacement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Our study recruited 214 cognitively intact individuals from the Perioperative Neurocognitive Disorder And Biomarker Lifestyle (PNDABLE) study in the final analysis. SCD was diagnosed with Subjective Cognitive Decline Scale (SCDS), Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). The incidence of POD was evaluated by using Confusion Assessment Method (CAM), and POD severity was measured by using the Memorial Delirium Assessment Scale (MDAS). Preoperative cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) Aβ40, Aβ42, T-tau, and P-tau levels were measured by enzyme-linked immune-sorbent assay (ELISA).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Overall, the incidence of POD was 26.64% (57/214), including 32.43% (36/111) in the SCD group and 20.39% (21/103) in the NC group. With the increase of age, the incidence of POD in all age groups increased (P &amp;lt; 0.05). Logistic regression analysis showed that after adjusting for SCD, Aβ42, Aβ40, P-tau, and T-tau, SCD (OR 2.32, CI 1.18–4.55, P = 0.01) and the increased CSF level of P-tau (OR 1.04, CI 1.01–1.06, P &amp;lt; 0.001) were risk factors for POD, while the level of aβ42 (OR 0.99, CI 0.99–1.00, P &amp;lt; 0.001) was a protective factor for POD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: SCD is one of the preoperative risk factors for POD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clinical Trial Registration: This study was registered at China Clinical Trial Registry (Chictr200033439).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Age-dependent accumulation of amyloid-β, provoking increasing brain amyloidopathy, triggers abnormal patterns of neuron activity and circuit synchronization in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) as observed in human AD patients and AD mouse models. Recent studies on AD mouse models, mimicking this age-dependent amyloidopathy, identified alterations in CA1 neuron excitability. However, these models generally also overexpress mutated amyloid precursor protein (APP) and presenilin 1 (PS1) and there is a lack of a clear correlation of neuronal excitability alterations with progressive amyloidopathy. The active development of computational models of AD points out the need of collecting such experimental data to build a reliable disease model exhibiting AD-like disease progression. We therefore used the feature extraction tool of the Human Brain Project (HBP) Brain Simulation Platform to systematically analyze the excitability profile of CA1 pyramidal neuron in the APPPS1 mouse model. We identified specific features of neuron excitability that best correlate either with over-expression of mutated APP and PS1 or increasing Aβ amyloidopathy. Notably, we report strong alterations in membrane time constant and action potential width and weak alterations in firing behavior. Also, using a CA1 pyramidal neuron model, we evidence amyloidopathy-dependent alterations in I&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;. Finally, cluster analysis of these recordings showed that we could reliably assign a trace to its correct group, opening the door to a more refined, less variable analysis of AD-affected neurons. This inter-disciplinary analysis, bringing together experimentalists and modelers, helps to further unravel the neuronal mechanisms most affected by AD and to build a biologically plausible computational model of the AD brain.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Impaired Subjective Visual Vertical and Increased Visual Dependence in Older Adults With Falls</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.667608</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Aging affects the vestibular system and may disturb the perception of verticality and lead to increased visual dependence (VD). Studies have identified that abnormal upright perception influences the risk of falling. The aim of our study was to evaluate subjective visual vertical (SVV) and VD using a mobile virtual reality-based system for SVV assessment (VIRVEST) in older adults with falls and evaluate its relationship with clinical balance assessment tools, dizziness, mental state, and depression level. This study included 37 adults &amp;gt;65 years who experienced falls and 40 non-faller age-matched controls. Three tests were performed using the VIRVEST system: a static SVV, dynamic SVV with clockwise and counter-clockwise background stimulus motion. VD was calculated as the mean of absolute values of the rod tilt from each trial of dynamic SVV minus the mean static SVV rod tilt. Older adults who experienced falls manifested significantly larger biases in static SVV (p = 0.012), dynamic SVV (p &amp;lt; 0.001), and VD (p = 0.014) than controls. The increase in static SVV (odds ratio = 1.365, p = 0.023), dynamic SVV (odds ratio = 1.623, p &amp;lt; 0.001) and VD (odds ratio = 1.460, p = 0.010) tilt by one degree significantly related to falls risk in the faller group. Fallers who had a high risk of falling according to the Tinetti test exhibited significantly higher tilts of dynamic SVV than those who had a low or medium risk (p = 0.037). In the faller group, the increase of the dynamic SVV tilt by one degree was significantly related to falls risk according to the Tinetti test (odds ratio = 1.356, p = 0.049). SVV errors, particularly with the dynamic SVV test (i.e., greater VD) were associated with an increased risk of falling in the faller group. The VIRVEST system may be applicable in clinical settings for SVV testing and predicting falls in older adults.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Elevated HDL Levels Linked to Poorer Cognitive Ability in Females With Parkinson’s Disease</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.656623</link>
	<content:encoded>Introduction&lt;p&gt;Cholesterol levels have been associated with age-related cognitive decline, however, such an association has not been comprehensively explored in people with Parkinson’s disease (PD). To address this uncertainty, the current cross-sectional study examined the cholesterol profile and cognitive performance in a cohort of PD patients.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;Cognitive function was evaluated using two validated assessments (ACE-R and SCOPA-COG) in 182 people with PD from the Australian Parkinson’s Disease Registry. Total cholesterol (TC), high-density lipoprotein (HDL), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), and Triglyceride (TRG) levels were examined within this cohort. The influence of individual lipid subfractions on domain-specific cognitive performance was investigated using covariate-adjusted generalised linear models.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Females with PD exhibited significantly higher lipid subfraction levels (TC, HDL, and LDL) when compared to male counterparts. While accounting for covariates, HDL levels were strongly associated with poorer performance across multiple cognitive domains in females but not males. Conversely, TC and LDL levels were not associated with cognitive status in people with PD.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;Higher serum HDL associates with poorer cognitive function in females with PD and presents a sex-specific biomarker for cognitive impairment in PD.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Sleep in Older Adults and Its Possible Relations With COVID-19</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.647875</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, older adults have been found to be a highly vulnerable group, with a higher prevalence of severe cases and negative outcomes. Research has focused on the reasons why older adults are at greater risk; Sleep-related factors have been suggested as one possible explanation for this. An individual’s sleep pattern undergoes significant changes over the course of their life. In older adults a specific sleep profile can be observed, one characterized by advanced sleep timing, a morningness preference, longer sleep-onset latency, shorter overall sleep duration, increased sleep fragmentation, reduced slow-wave sleep and, increased wake time after sleep onset. Additionally, an increased prevalence of sleep disorders can be observed, such as obstructive sleep apnea and insomnia. Previous research has already linked sleep disorders (especially sleep apnea) with COVID-19, but few studies have focused specifically on the older population. We believe that the intrinsic sleep patterns of older adults, and the prevalence of sleep disorders in this population, may be important factors that could explain why they are at a greater risk of negative COVID-19 outcomes. In this review, we discuss the relationship between sleep and COVID-19 among older adults, focusing on three different aspects: (1) Sleep-related issues that might increase the likelihood of getting infected by SARS-COV-2; (2) Sleep disturbances that might increase the predisposition to worse COVID-19 prognosis and outcomes; and (3) COVID-19-related aspects affecting community-dwelling older adults, such as social isolation, quarantine, and home confinement, among others, that might impact sleep.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Tinnitus can be a burdensome condition on both individual and societal levels. Many aspects of this condition remain elusive, including its underlying mechanisms, ultimately hindering the development of a cure. Interdisciplinary approaches are required to overcome long-established research challenges. This review summarizes current knowledge in various tinnitus-relevant research fields including tinnitus generating mechanisms, heterogeneity, epidemiology, assessment, and treatment development, in an effort to highlight the main challenges and provide suggestions for future research to overcome them. Four common themes across different areas were identified as future research direction: (1) Further establishment of multicenter and multidisciplinary collaborations; (2) Systematic reviews and syntheses of existing knowledge; (3) Standardization of research methods including tinnitus assessment, data acquisition, and data analysis protocols; (4) The design of studies with large sample sizes and the creation of large tinnitus-specific databases that would allow in-depth exploration of tinnitus heterogeneity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Correlation Between Gait and Near-Infrared Brain Functional Connectivity Under Cognitive Tasks in Elderly Subjects With Mild Cognitive Impairment</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.482447</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Older adults with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) have a high risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease. Gait performance is a potential clinical marker for the progression of MCI into dementia. However, the relationship between gait and brain functional connectivity (FC) in older adults with MCI remains unclear. Forty-five subjects [MCI group, n = 23; healthy control (HC) group, n = 22] were recruited. Each subject performed a walking task (Task 01), counting backward–walking task (Task 02), naming animals–walking task (Task 03), and calculating–walking task (Task 04). The gait parameters and cerebral oxygenation signals from the left prefrontal cortex (LPFC), right prefrontal cortex (RPFC), left motor cortex (LMC), right motor cortex (RMC), left occipital leaf cortex (LOL), and right occipital leaf cortex (ROL) were obtained simultaneously. Wavelet phase coherence was calculated in two frequency intervals: low frequency (interval I, 0.052–0.145 Hz) and very low frequency (interval II, 0.021–0.052 Hz). Results showed that the FC of RPFC–RMC is significantly lower in interval I in Task 03 compared with that in Task 02 in the MCI group (p = 0.001). Also, the right relative symmetry index (IDpsR) is significantly lower in Task 03 compared with that in Task 02 (p = 0.000). The IDpsR is positively correlated with the FC of RPFC–RMC in interval I in the MCI group (R = 0.205, p = 0.041). The gait symmetry such as left relative symmetry index (IDpsL) and IDpsR is significantly lower in the dual-task (DT) situation compared with the single task in the two groups (p &amp;lt; 0.05). The results suggested that the IDpsR might reflect abnormal change in FC of RPFC–RMC in interval I in the MCI population during Task 03. The gait symmetry is affected by DTs in both groups. The findings of this study may have a pivotal role in the early monitoring and intervention of brain dysfunction among older adults with MCI.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: Locating Macromolecular Assemblies in Cells by 2D Template Matching with cisTEM</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/68946</link>
	<content:encoded>For a more complete understanding of molecular mechanisms, it is important to study macromolecules and their assemblies in the broader context of the cell. This context can be visualized at nanometer resolution in three dimensions (3D) using electron cryo-tomography, which requires tilt series to be recorded and computationally aligned, currently limiting throughput. Additionally, the high-resolution signal preserved in the raw tomograms is currently limited by a number of technical difficulties, leading to an increased false-positive detection rate when using 3D template matching to find molecular complexes in tomograms. We have recently described a 2D template matching approach that addresses these issues by including high-resolution signal preserved in single-tilt images. A current limitation of this approach is the high computational cost that limits throughput. We describe here a GPU-accelerated implementation of 2D template matching in the image processing software &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt;TEM that allows for easy scaling and improves the accessibility of this approach. We apply 2D template matching to identify ribosomes in images of frozen-hydrated &lt;i&gt;Mycoplasma pneumoniae&lt;/i&gt; cells with high precision and sensitivity, demonstrating that this is a versatile tool for &lt;i&gt;in situ&lt;/i&gt; visual proteomics and &lt;i&gt;in situ &lt;/i&gt;structure determination. We benchmark the results with 3D template matching of tomograms acquired on identical sample locations and identify strengths and weaknesses of both techniques, which offer complementary information about target localization and identity.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/iA1twVExQEE/article</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Grace Wan Yu Ang, Clara S. Tang, Y. Audrey Hay, Sara Zannone, Ole Paulsen, Claudia Clopath&lt;/p&gt;

To survive, animals have to quickly modify their behaviour when the reward changes. The internal representations responsible for this are updated through synaptic weight changes, mediated by certain neuromodulators conveying feedback from the environment. In previous experiments, we discovered a form of hippocampal Spike-Timing-Dependent-Plasticity (STDP) that is sequentially modulated by acetylcholine and dopamine. Acetylcholine facilitates synaptic depression, while dopamine retroactively converts the depression into potentiation. When these experimental findings were implemented as a learning rule in a computational model, our simulations showed that cholinergic-facilitated depression is important for reversal learning. In the present study, we tested the model’s prediction by optogenetically inactivating cholinergic neurons in mice during a hippocampus-dependent spatial learning task with changing rewards. We found that reversal learning, but not initial place learning, was impaired, verifying our computational prediction that acetylcholine-modulated plasticity promotes the unlearning of old reward locations. Further, differences in neuromodulator concentrations in the model captured mouse-by-mouse performance variability in the optogenetic experiments. Our line of work sheds light on how neuromodulators enable the learning of new contingencies.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/iA1twVExQEE&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Recent studies have shown that long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are critical regulators in the central nervous system (CNS). However, their roles in the cerebellum are currently unclear. In this work, we identified the isoform 204 of lncRNA &lt;i&gt;Gm2694&lt;/i&gt; (designated as &lt;i&gt;lncRNA-Promoting Methylation&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;lncRNA-PM&lt;/i&gt;)) is highly expressed in the cerebellum and derived from the antisense strand of the upstream region of &lt;i&gt;Cerebellin-1&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;Cbln1&lt;/i&gt;), a well-known critical cerebellar synaptic organizer. &lt;i&gt;LncRNA-PM&lt;/i&gt; exhibits similar spatiotemporal expression pattern as &lt;i&gt;Cbln1&lt;/i&gt; in the postnatal mouse cerebellum and activates the transcription of &lt;i&gt;Cbln1&lt;/i&gt; through Pax6/Mll1-mediated H3K4me3. In mouse cerebellum, &lt;i&gt;lncRNA-PM&lt;/i&gt;, Pax6/Mll1, and H3K4me3 are all associated with the regulatory regions of &lt;i&gt;Cbln1&lt;/i&gt;. Knockdown of &lt;i&gt;lncRNA-PM&lt;/i&gt; in cerebellum causes deficiencies in &lt;i&gt;Cbln1&lt;/i&gt; expression, cerebellar synaptic integrity, and motor function. Together, our work reveals an lncRNA-mediated transcriptional activation of &lt;i&gt;Cbln1&lt;/i&gt; through Pax6-Mll1-H3K4me3 and provides novel insights of the essential roles of lncRNA in the cerebellum.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/xpLhYAqbyS4&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Biology: Identification of sequence changes in myosin II that adjust muscle contraction velocity</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~3/selZOH0i93g/article</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Chloe A. Johnson, Jake E. McGreig, Sarah T. Jeanfavre, Jonathan Walklate, Carlos D. Vera, Marta Farré, Daniel P. Mulvihill, Anthony J. Baines, Martin Ridout, Leslie A. Leinwand, Mark N. Wass, Michael A. Geeves&lt;/p&gt;

The speed of muscle contraction is related to body size; muscles in larger species contract at slower rates. Since contraction speed is a property of the myosin isoform expressed in a muscle, we investigated how sequence changes in a range of muscle myosin II isoforms enable this slower rate of muscle contraction. We considered 798 sequences from 13 mammalian myosin II isoforms to identify any adaptation to increasing body mass. We identified a correlation between body mass and sequence divergence for the motor domain of the 4 major adult myosin II isoforms (β/Type I, IIa, IIb, and IIx), suggesting that these isoforms have adapted to increasing body mass. In contrast, the non-muscle and developmental isoforms show no correlation of sequence divergence with body mass. Analysis of the motor domain sequence of β-myosin (predominant myosin in Type I/slow and cardiac muscle) from 67 mammals from 2 distinct clades identifies 16 sites, out of 800, associated with body mass (p&lt;sub&gt;adj&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05) but not with the clade (p&lt;sub&gt;adj&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;gt; 0.05). Both clades change the same small set of amino acids, in the same order from small to large mammals, suggesting a limited number of ways in which contraction velocity can be successfully manipulated. To test this relationship, the 9 sites that differ between human and rat were mutated in the human β-myosin to match the rat sequence. Biochemical analysis revealed that the rat–human β-myosin chimera functioned like the native rat myosin with a 2-fold increase in both motility and in the rate of ADP release from the actin–myosin crossbridge (the step that limits contraction velocity). Thus, these sequence changes indicate adaptation of β-myosin as species mass increased to enable a reduced contraction velocity and heart rate.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/selZOH0i93g&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>This is the first study to demonstrate functional as well as structural plasticity of the central olfactory networks, following surgical treatment for olfactory dysfunction. Our results help to confirm the neuroanatomical corelates of olfactory function and dysfunction.

Abstract
Olfactory dysfunction (OD) is more common than hearing loss, partial blindness, or blindness and can have a significant impact on the quality of life. Moreover, unexplained OD is an early biomarker in neurodegenerative diseases and increases 5‐year mortality risk. Structural alterations in olfactory eloquent brain regions may represent the neuroanatomical correlates of OD. Previous studies have demonstrated reduced gray matter (GM) volume in areas of presumed olfactory relevance in patients with OD. However, being cross‐sectional in nature, these studies do not provide evidence of causality, for which longitudinal work is required. At present, however, longitudinal studies addressing olfactory structural plasticity are limited, both in number and methodological approach: to our knowledge, such work has not included parallel functional imaging to confirm the relevance of structural change. We therefore performed a longitudinal multimodal neuroimaging study investigating structural and functional plasticity in 24 patients undergoing surgical treatment for chronic rhinosinusitis, compared with 17 healthy controls. We demonstrated functionally significant structural plasticity within the orbitofrontal, anterior cingulate and insular cortices, and temporal poles in patients 3 months after surgery. Of interest, GM volume decreased in these regions, in association with increased psychophysical scores and BOLD signal. To our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate both structural and functional plasticity of the central olfactory networks, thereby confirming these areas as neuroanatomical correlates of olfactory function/dysfunction.</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience Research: Functional brain network topology across the menstrual cycle is estradiol dependent and correlates with individual well‐being</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jnr.24898?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>The topology of brain networks along the menstrual cycle (MC), estimated in 24 women (N = 24), is influenced by estradiol blood levels. The betweenness centrality (BC) of the right posterior cingulate gyrus (rPCG), in the alpha frequency band, increased in the peri‐ovulatory phase (a). The estradiol levels predicted the BC variance in rPCG (b) and, accordingly, its variations during the luteal phase (expressed as the difference between the mid‐luteal and peri‐ovulatory time points of the MC) correlated positively with the variation of the BC of the rPCG (c).

Abstract
The menstrual cycle (MC) is a sex hormone‐related phenomenon that repeats itself cyclically during the woman's reproductive life. In this explorative study, we hypothesized that coordinated variations of multiple sex hormones may affect the large‐scale organization of the brain functional network and that, in turn, such changes might have psychological correlates, even in the absence of overt clinical signs of anxiety and/or depression. To test our hypothesis, we investigated longitudinally, across the MC, the relationship between the sex hormones and both brain network and psychological changes. We enrolled 24 naturally cycling women and, at the early‐follicular, peri‐ovulatory, and mid‐luteal phases of the MC, we performed: (a) sex hormone dosage, (b) magnetoencephalography recording to study the brain network topology, and (c) psychological questionnaires to quantify anxiety, depression, self‐esteem, and well‐being. We showed that during the peri‐ovulatory phase, in the alpha band, the leaf fraction and the tree hierarchy of the brain network were reduced, while the betweenness centrality (BC) of the right posterior cingulate gyrus (rPCG) was increased. Furthermore, the increase in BC was predicted by estradiol levels. Moreover, during the luteal phase, the variation of estradiol correlated positively with the variations of both the topological change and environmental mastery dimension of the well‐being test, which, in turn, was related to the increase in the BC of rPCG. Our results highlight the effects of sex hormones on the large‐scale brain network organization as well as on their possible relationship with the psychological state across the MC. Moreover, the fact that physiological changes in the brain topology occur throughout the MC has widespread implications for neuroimaging studies.</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience Research: A multielectrode array‐based hypoxia model for the analysis of electrical activity in murine retinae</title>

	<content:encoded>Hypoxia has an immense effect on the retina, especially on retinal ganglion cells (RGCs). It causes cell damage and results in vision loss. In this study, the electrical RGC activity under hypoxic conditions is analyzed using a multielectrode array‐based ex vivo model.

Abstract
Several eye diseases, for example, retinal artery occlusion, diabetic retinopathy, and glaucoma, are associated with retinal hypoxia. The lack of oxygen in the retina, especially in retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), causes cell damage up to cell degeneration and leads to blindness. Using multielectrode array recordings, an ex vivo hypoxia acute model was established to analyze the electrical activity of murine wild‐type retinae under hypoxic stress conditions. Hypoxia was induced by exchanging the perfusion with oxygen‐saturated medium by nitrogen‐saturated medium. Hypoxic periods of 0 min (control) up to 60 min were tested on the retinae of adult female C57BL/6J mice. The electrical RGC activity vanished during hypoxia, but conditionally returned after the reestablishment of conventional test conditions. With increasing duration of hypoxia, the returning RGC activity decreased. After a hypoxic period of 30 min and a subsequent recovery time of 30 min, 59.43 ± 11.35% of the initially active channels showed a restored RGC activity. The survival rate of retinal cells after hypoxic stress was analyzed by a live/dead staining assay using two‐photon laser scanning microscopy. For detailed information about molecular changes caused by hypoxia, a microarray gene expression analysis was performed. Furthermore, the effect of 2‐aminoethanesulfonic acid (taurine, 1 mM) on retinae under hypoxic stress was tested. Treatment with taurine resulted in an increase in the RGC response rate after hypoxia and also increased the survival rate of retinal cells under hypoxic stress, confirming its potential as promising candidate for neuroprotective therapies of eye diseases.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.26143?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>As of April 22, 2021, around 1.5 million individuals in 3 districts of Kerala, India had been vaccinated with COVID‐19 vaccines. Over 80% of these individuals (1.2 million) received the ChAdOx1‐S/nCoV‐19 vaccine. In this population, during this period of 4 weeks (mid‐March to mid‐April 2021), we observed seven cases of Guillain‐Barre syndrome (GBS) that occurred within two weeks of the first dose of vaccination. All 7 patients developed severe GBS. The frequency of GBS was 1.4 to10 fold higher than that expected in this period for a population of this magnitude. In addition, the frequency of bilateral facial weakness, which typically occurs in &amp;lt;20% of GBS cases, suggests a pattern associated with the vaccination. While the benefits of vaccination substantially outweigh the risk of this relatively rare outcome (5.8 per million), clinicians should be alert to this possible adverse event, as six out of seven patients progressed to areflexic quadriplegia and required mechanical ventilatory support.

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience Research: Cardiorespiratory findings in epilepsy: A recent review on outcomes and pathophysiology</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jnr.24861?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
Epilepsy is a debilitating disorder of uncontrollable recurrent seizures that occurs as a result of imbalances in the brain excitatory and inhibitory neuronal signals, that could stem from a range of functional and structural neuronal impairments. Globally, nearly 70 million people are negatively impacted by epilepsy and its comorbidities. One such comorbidity is the effect epilepsy has on the autonomic nervous system (ANS), which plays a role in the control of blood circulation, respiration and gastrointestinal function. These epilepsy‐induced impairments in the circulatory and respiratory systems may contribute toward sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP). Although, various hypotheses have been proposed regarding the role of epilepsy on ANS, the linking pathological mechanism still remains unclear. Channelopathies and seizure‐induced damages in ANS‐control brain structures were some of the causal/pathological candidates of cardiorespiratory comorbidities in epilepsy patients, especially in those who were drug resistant. However, emerging preclinical research suggest that neurotransmitter/receptor dysfunction and synaptic changes in the ANS may also contribute to the epilepsy‐related autonomic disorders. Thus, pathological mechanisms of cardiorespiratory dysfunction should be elucidated by considering the modifications in anatomy and physiology of the autonomic system caused by seizures. In this regard, we present a comprehensive review of the current literature, both clinical and preclinical animal studies, on the cardiorespiratory findings in epilepsy and elucidate the possible pathological mechanisms of these findings, in hopes to prevent SUDEP especially in patients who are drug resistant.</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Synaptic Neuroscience: Cannabinoid Modulation of Dopamine Release During Motivation, Periodic Reinforcement, Exploratory Behavior, Habit Formation, and Attention</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsyn.2021.660218</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Motivational and attentional processes energize action sequences to facilitate evolutionary competition and promote behavioral fitness. Decades of neuropharmacology, electrophysiology and electrochemistry research indicate that the mesocorticolimbic DA pathway modulates both motivation and attention. More recently, it was realized that mesocorticolimbic DA function is tightly regulated by the brain’s endocannabinoid system and greatly influenced by exogenous cannabinoids—which have been harnessed by humanity for medicinal, ritualistic, and recreational uses for 12,000 years. Exogenous cannabinoids, like the primary psychoactive component of cannabis, delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol, produce their effects by acting at binding sites for naturally occurring endocannabinoids. The brain’s endocannabinoid system consists of two G-protein coupled receptors, endogenous lipid ligands for these receptor targets, and several synthetic and metabolic enzymes involved in their production and degradation. Emerging evidence indicates that the endocannabinoid 2-arachidonoylglycerol is necessary to observe concurrent increases in DA release and motivated behavior. And the historical pharmacology literature indicates a role for cannabinoid signaling in both motivational and attentional processes. While both types of behaviors have been scrutinized under manipulation by either DA or cannabinoid agents, there is considerably less insight into prospective interactions between these two important signaling systems. This review attempts to summate the relevance of cannabinoid modulation of DA release during operant tasks designed to investigate either motivational or attentional control of behavior. We first describe how cannabinoids influence DA release and goal-directed action under a variety of reinforcement contingencies. Then we consider the role that endocannabinoids might play in switching an animal’s motivation from a goal-directed action to the search for an alternative outcome, in addition to the formation of long-term habits. Finally, dissociable features of attentional behavior using both the 5-choice serial reaction time task and the attentional set-shifting task are discussed along with their distinct influences by DA and cannabinoids. We end with discussing potential targets for further research regarding DA-cannabinoid interactions within key substrates involved in motivation and attention.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Background&lt;p&gt;There is evidence that the T allele of rs405509 located in the apolipoprotein E (APOE) promotor region is a risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease (AD). However, the effect of the T/T allele on brain function in non-demented aging is still unclear.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;We analyzed the effects of the rs405509 T/T allele on cognitive performances using multiple neuropsychological tests and local brain function using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI).&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Significant differences were found between T/T carriers and G allele carriers on general cognitive status, memory, and attention (p &amp;lt; 0.05). Rs-fMRI analyses demonstrated decreased amplitude of low frequency fluctuation (ALFF) in the right middle frontal gyrus, decreased percent amplitude of fluctuation (PerAF) in the right middle frontal gyrus, increased regional homogeneity (ReHo) in the right cerebellar tonsil and decreased ReHo in the right putamen, and decreased degree centrality (DC) in the left middle frontal gyrus (p &amp;lt; 0.05, corrected). Furthermore, significant correlations were found between cognitive performance and these neuroimaging changes (p &amp;lt; 0.05).&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;These findings suggest that T/T allele may serve as an independent risk factor that can influence brain function in different regions in non-demented aging.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Systematic reviews of neuroimaging studies confirm stimulus-induced activity in response to verbal and non-verbal self-referential processing (SRP) in cortical midline structures, temporoparietal cortex and insula. Whether SRP can be causally modulated by way of non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) has also been investigated in several studies. Here we summarize the NIBS literature including 27 studies of task-based SRP comparing response between verbal and non-verbal SRP tasks. The studies differed in design, experimental tasks and stimulation parameters. Results support the role of left inferior parietal lobule (left IPL) in verbal SRP and for the medial prefrontal cortex when valenced stimuli were used. Further, results support roles for the bilateral parietal lobe (IPL, posterior cingulate cortex), the sensorimotor areas (the primary sensory and motor cortex, the premotor cortex, and the extrastriate body area) and the insula in non-verbal SRP (bodily self-consciousness). We conclude that NIBS may differentially modulate verbal and non-verbal SRP by targeting the corresponding brain areas.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.655247</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A prominent goal of neuroscience is to improve our understanding of how brain structure and activity interact to produce perception, emotion, behavior, and cognition. The brain’s network activity is inherently organized in distinct spatiotemporal patterns that span scales from nanometer-sized synapses to meter-long nerve fibers and millisecond intervals between electrical signals to decades of memory storage. There is currently no single imaging method that alone can provide all the relevant information, but intelligent combinations of complementary techniques can be effective. Here, we thus present the latest advances in biomedical and biological engineering on photoacoustic neuroimaging in the context of complementary imaging techniques. A particular focus is placed on recent advances in whole-brain photoacoustic imaging in rodent models and its influential role in bridging the gap between fluorescence microscopy and more non-invasive techniques such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). We consider current strategies to address persistent challenges, particularly in developing molecular contrast agents, and conclude with an overview of potential future directions for photoacoustic neuroimaging to provide deeper insights into healthy and pathological brain processes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.617175</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Photocoagulation is used for the treatment of retinal ischemic disease. However, due to the invasive nature of photocoagulation and variety of melanin concentrations between individuals, it is challenging to avoid damaging the adjacent photoreceptors and inducing several side effects. Previous studies indicate the role of laser power, duration, and spot size on retinal lesions, but the effect of interspot distance of the laser pulses needs to be considered in panretinal photocoagulation. In this study, we examine different parameters of photocoagulation on lesions of the retina in rabbit, finding that the lesion level of the outer nuclear layer of the retina depended on the pulse duration and laser spot size, and decreasing interspot distance could completely abolish the photoreceptor layer. The degeneration of the photoreceptor by photocoagulation occurred in 24 h and was not restored afterward. We then conducted panretinal photocoagulation in rabbit and found that oxidative stress was decreased in the inner nuclear layer of the retina, and pupillary light reflex and ERG signals were impaired. Our study could provide a rabbit model to explore the mechanism of photoreceptor degeneration and therapies for the side effects after photocoagulation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroinformatics: Characterizing Network Search Algorithms Developed for Dynamic Causal Modeling</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fninf.2021.656486</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Dynamic causal modeling (DCM) is a widely used tool to estimate the effective connectivity of specified models of a brain network. Finding the model explaining measured data is one of the most important outstanding problems in Bayesian modeling. Using heuristic model search algorithms enables us to find an optimal model without having to define a model set a priori. However, the development of such methods is cumbersome in the case of large model-spaces. We aimed to utilize commonly used graph theoretical search algorithms for DCM to create a framework for characterizing them, and to investigate relevance of such methods for single-subject and group-level studies. Because of the enormous computational demand of DCM calculations, we separated the model estimation procedure from the search algorithm by providing a database containing the parameters of all models in a full model-space. For test data a publicly available fMRI dataset of 60 subjects was used. First, we reimplemented the deterministic bilinear DCM algorithm in the ReDCM R package, increasing computational speed during model estimation. Then, three network search algorithms have been adapted for DCM, and we demonstrated how modifications to these methods, based on DCM posterior parameter estimates, can enhance search performance. Comparison of the results are based on model evidence, structural similarities and the number of model estimations needed during search. An analytical approach using Bayesian model reduction (BMR) for efficient network discovery is already available for DCM. Comparing model search methods we found that topological algorithms often outperform analytical methods for single-subject analysis and achieve similar results for recovering common network properties of the winning model family, or set of models, obtained by multi-subject family-wise analysis. However, network search methods show their limitations in higher level statistical analysis of parametric empirical Bayes. Optimizing such linear modeling schemes the BMR methods are still considered the recommended approach. We envision the freely available database of estimated model-spaces to help further studies of the DCM model-space, and the ReDCM package to be a useful contribution for Bayesian inference within and beyond the field of neuroscience.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroinformatics: Event-Based Update of Synapses in Voltage-Based Learning Rules</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fninf.2021.609147</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Due to the point-like nature of neuronal spiking, efficient neural network simulators often employ event-based simulation schemes for synapses. Yet many types of synaptic plasticity rely on the membrane potential of the postsynaptic cell as a third factor in addition to pre- and postsynaptic spike times. In some learning rules membrane potentials not only influence synaptic weight changes at the time points of spike events but in a continuous manner. In these cases, synapses therefore require information on the full time course of membrane potentials to update their strength which a priori suggests a continuous update in a time-driven manner. The latter hinders scaling of simulations to realistic cortical network sizes and relevant time scales for learning. Here, we derive two efficient algorithms for archiving postsynaptic membrane potentials, both compatible with modern simulation engines based on event-based synapse updates. We theoretically contrast the two algorithms with a time-driven synapse update scheme to analyze advantages in terms of memory and computations. We further present a reference implementation in the spiking neural network simulator NEST for two prototypical voltage-based plasticity rules: the Clopath rule and the Urbanczik-Senn rule. For both rules, the two event-based algorithms significantly outperform the time-driven scheme. Depending on the amount of data to be stored for plasticity, which heavily differs between the rules, a strong performance increase can be achieved by compressing or sampling of information on membrane potentials. Our results on computational efficiency related to archiving of information provide guidelines for the design of learning rules in order to make them practically usable in large-scale networks.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Globus Pallidus Internus Deep Brain Stimulation for Dystonic Opisthotonus in Adult-Onset Dystonia: A Personalized Approach</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.683545</link>
	<content:encoded>Introduction&lt;p&gt;Dystonic opisthotonus is defined as a backward arching of the neck and trunk, which ranges in severity from mild backward jerks to life-threatening prolonged severe muscular spasms. It can be associated with generalized dystonic syndromes or, rarely, present as a form of axial truncal dystonia. The etiologies vary from idiopathic, genetic, tardive, hereditary-degenerative, or associated with parkinsonism. We report clinical cases of dystonic opisthotonus associated with adult-onset dystonic syndromes, that benefitted from globus pallidus internus (GPi) deep brain stimulation (DBS).&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;Clinical data from patients with dystonic syndromes who underwent comprehensive medical review, multidisciplinary assessment, and tailored medical and neurosurgical managements were prospectively analyzed. Quantification of dystonia severity pre- and postoperatively was performed using the Burke-Fahn-Marsden Dystonia Rating Scale and quantification of overall pain severity was performed using the Visual Analog Scale.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Three male patients, with age of onset of the dystonic symptoms ranging from 32 to 51 years old, were included. Tardive dystonia, adult-onset dystonia-parkinsonism and adult-onset idiopathic axial dystonia were the etiologies identified. Clinical investigation and management were tailored according to the complexity of the individual presentations. Although they shared common clinical features of adult-onset dystonia, disabling dystonic opisthotonus, refractory to medical management, was the main indication for GPi-DBS in all patients presented. The severity of axial dystonia ranged from disturbance of daily function to life-threatening truncal distortion. All three patients underwent bilateral GPi DBS at a mean age of 52 years (range 48–55 years), after mean duration of symptoms prior to DBS of 10.7 years (range 4–16 years). All patients showed a rapid and sustained clinical improvement of their symptoms, notably of the dystonic opisthotonos, at postoperative follow-up ranging from 20 to 175 months. In some, the ability to resume activities of daily living and reintegration into the society was remarkable.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;Adult-onset dystonic syndromes predominantly presenting with dystonic opisthotonus are relatively rare. The specific nature of dystonic opisthotonus remains a treatment challenge, and thorough investigation of this highly disabling condition with varying etiologies is often necessary. Although patients may be refractory to medical management and botulinum toxin injection, Globus pallidus stimulation timed and tailored provided symptomatic control in this cohort and may be considered in other carefully selected cases.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Application of High-Frequency Oscillations on Scalp EEG in Infant Spasm: A Prospective Controlled Study</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.682011</link>
	<content:encoded>Objective&lt;p&gt;We quantitatively analyzed high-frequency oscillations (HFOs) using scalp electroencephalography (EEG) in patients with infantile spasms (IS).&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;We enrolled 60 children with IS hospitalized from January 2019 to August 2020. Sixty healthy age-matched children comprised the control group. Time–frequency analysis was used to quantify γ, ripple, and fast ripple (FR) oscillation energy changes.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;γ, ripple, and FR oscillations dominated in the temporal and frontal lobes. The average HFO energy of the sleep stage is lower than that of the wake stage in the same frequency bands in both the normal control (NC) and IS groups (P &amp;lt; 0.05). The average HFO energy of the IS group was significantly higher than that of the NC group in γ band during sleep stage (P &amp;lt; 0.01). The average HFO energy of S and Post-S stage were higher than that of sleep stage in γ band (P &amp;lt; 0.05). In the ripple band, the average HFO energy of Pre-S, S, and Post-S stage was higher than that of sleep stage (P &amp;lt; 0.05). Before treatment, there was no significant difference in BASED score between the effective and ineffective groups. The interaction of curative efficacy × frequency and the interaction of curative efficacy × state are statistically significant. The average HFO energy of the effective group was lower than that of the ineffective group in the sleep stage (P &amp;lt; 0.05). For the 16 children deemed “effective” in the IS group, the average HFO energy of three frequency bands was not significantly different before compared with after treatment.&lt;/p&gt;Significance&lt;p&gt;Scalp EEG can record HFOs. The energy of HFOs can distinguish physiological HFOs from pathological ones more accurately than frequency. On scalp EEG, γ oscillations can better detect susceptibility to epilepsy than ripple and FR oscillations. HFOs can trigger spasms. The analysis of average HFO energy can be used as a predictor of the effectiveness of epilepsy treatment.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Advantage of Handwriting Over Typing on Learning Words: Evidence From an N400 Event-Related Potential Index</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.679191</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The growing implementation of digital education comes with an increased need to understand the impact of digital tools on learning. Previous behavioral studies have shown that handwriting on paper is more effective for learning than typing on a keyboard. However, the impact of writing with a digital pen on a tablet remains to be clarified. In the present study, we compared learning by handwriting with an ink pen on paper, handwriting with a digital pen on a tablet, and typing on a keyboard. Behavioral and electroencephalographic indices were measured immediately after learning with each writing tool. The moods of the subjects during the training were also assessed. The participants were divided according to their use of digital pen in their everyday lives, allowing us to take into account the effect of the familiarity with the digital pen on the learning process (familiar group vs. unfamiliar group). We performed an EEG experiment applying a repetition priming paradigm. In each trial, a learned foreign language word (prime word) and a mother tongue word (target word) were consecutively presented. The target word was either semantically identical to the prime word (repetitive condition) or different (non-repetitive condition). We assumed that a larger priming effect on N400 reflects larger learning progress. The familiar group showed a greater N400 priming effect for words learned with the digital or ink pen than those learned with the keyboard. The unfamiliar group showed the greater N400 priming effect for words learned with the ink pen compared with words learned by typing. In addition, positive mood during learning was significantly higher during handwriting than during typing, regardless of the groups. On the other hand, the behavioral indices were not influenced by the writing tool. These results suggest that the movements involved in handwriting allow a greater memorization of new words. The advantage of handwriting over typing might also be caused by a more positive mood during learning. Finally, our results show that handwriting with a digital pen and tablet can increase the ability to learn compared with keyboard typing once the individuals are accustomed to it.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The basolateral amygdala (BLA) is a cortical structure based on its cell types, connectivity features, and developmental characteristics. This part of the amygdala is considered to be the main entry site of processed and multisensory information delivered via cortical and thalamic afferents. Although GABAergic inhibitory cells in the BLA comprise only 20% of the entire neuronal population, they provide essential control over proper network operation. Previous studies have uncovered that GABAergic cells in the basolateral amygdala are as diverse as those present in other cortical regions, including the hippocampus and neocortex. To understand the role of inhibitory cells in various amygdala functions, we need to reveal the connectivity and input-output features of the different types of GABAergic cells. Here, I review the recent achievements in uncovering the diversity of GABAergic cells in the basolateral amygdala with a specific focus on the microcircuit organization of these inhibitory cells.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neural Circuits: The Complement of Projection Neurons Activated Determines the Type of Feeding Motor Program in Aplysia</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncir.2021.685222</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Multiple projection neurons are often activated to initiate behavior. A question that then arises is, what is the unique functional role of each neuron activated? We address this issue in the feeding system of Aplysia. Previous experiments identified a projection neuron [cerebral buccal interneuron 2 (CBI-2)] that can trigger ingestive motor programs but only after it is repeatedly stimulated, i.e., initial programs are poorly defined. As CBI-2 stimulation continues, programs become progressively more ingestive (repetition priming occurs). This priming results, at least in part, from persistent actions of peptide cotransmitters released from CBI-2. We now show that in some preparations repetition priming does not occur. There is no clear seasonal effect; priming and non-priming preparations are encountered throughout the year. CBI-2 is electrically coupled to a second projection neuron, cerebral buccal interneuron 3 (CBI-3). In preparations in which priming does not occur, we show that ingestive activity is generated when CBI-2 and CBI-3 are coactivated. Programs are immediately ingestive, i.e., priming is not necessary, and a persistent state is not induced. Our data suggest that dynamic changes in the configuration of activity can vary and be determined by the complement of projection neurons that trigger activity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Connected networks are a fundamental structure of neurobiology. Understanding these networks will help us elucidate the neural mechanisms of computation. Mathematically speaking these networks are “graphs”—structures containing objects that are connected. In neuroscience, the objects could be regions of the brain, e.g., fMRI data, or be individual neurons, e.g., calcium imaging with fluorescence microscopy. The formal study of graphs, graph theory, can provide neuroscientists with a large bank of algorithms for exploring networks. Graph theory has already been applied in a variety of ways to fMRI data but, more recently, has begun to be applied at the scales of neurons, e.g., from functional calcium imaging. In this primer we explain the basics of graph theory and relate them to features of microscopic functional networks of neurons from calcium imaging—neuronal graphs. We explore recent examples of graph theory applied to calcium imaging and we highlight some areas where researchers new to the field could go awry.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.669717</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Synaptic and axonal glutamatergic signaling to NG2 glia in white matter is critical for the cells’ differentiation and activity dependent myelination. However, in gray matter the impact of neuron-to-NG2 glia signaling is still elusive, because most of these cells keep their non-myelinating phenotype throughout live. Early in postnatal development, hippocampal NG2 glia express AMPA receptors with a significant Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; permeability allowing for plasticity of the neuron-glia synapses, but whether this property changes by adulthood is not known. Moreover, it is unclear whether NG2 glia express auxiliary transmembrane AMPA receptor related proteins (TARPs), which modify AMPA receptor properties, including their Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; permeability. Through combined molecular and functional analyses, here we show that hippocampal NG2 glia abundantly express TARPs γ4, γ7, and γ8 as well as cornichon (CNIH)-2. TARP γ8 undergoes profound downregulation during development. Receptors of adult NG2 glia showed an increased sensitivity to blockers of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; permeable AMPA receptors, but this increase mainly concerned receptors located close to the soma. Evoked synaptic currents of NG2 glia were also sensitive to blockers of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; permeable AMPA receptors. The presence of AMPA receptors with varying Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; permeability during postnatal maturation may be important for the cells’ ability to sense and respond to local glutamatergic activity and for regulating process motility, differentiation, and proliferation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Abstract
Egg laying in the pond snail, Lymnaea stagnalis is regulated by the photoperiod; long‐day conditions (16L8D) promote egg laying whereas medium‐day conditions (12L12D) suppress it. In this snail, a caudo‐dorsal cell hormone (CDCH) is produced by neurosecretory cells, CDCs in the cerebral ganglion (CG), and its release triggers ovulation and subsequent egg laying. However, the physiological basis for photoperiod‐dependent egg laying remains unraveled. Here, we compared electrophysiological properties of CDCs between 16L8D and 12L12D using intracellular recording, and found that CDC excitability is higher in 16L8D than in 12L12D. Striking differences are as follows: (1) a shallower resting membrane potential in 16L8D than in 12L12D, and (2) a smaller threshold voltage (minimum depolarization from rest to elicit action potentials) in 16L8D than in 12L12D. Switching of the excitability can be a physiological basis of a photoperiod‐dependent CDCH release. Simultaneous intracellular dye injection identified two morphological subtypes of CDCs, validating a previous report. Both types bear short lateral extensions in CG, some of which probably function as integration sites of photoperiodic inputs. In addition, we found two novel CDCH‐immunoreactive cell groups (CDCCOM and SCm) in the CG besides conventional CDCs and small cells expressing CDCH. The CDCCOM with cell bodies and fibers in the neurohemal commissure may be involved in triggering ovulation. Notably, the total number of CDCs is larger than that previously reported, the right CDC cluster with more cells than the left. Our findings are instructive in following the neurophysiology of photoperiodism in L. stagnalis.</content:encoded>

	<title>Hippocampus: Disrupting the medial prefrontal cortex with designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drug alters hippocampal sharp‐wave ripples and their associated cognitive processes</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hipo.23367?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
The hippocampus and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) interact during a myriad of cognitive processes including decision‐making and long‐term memory consolidation. Exactly how the mPFC and hippocampus interact during goal‐directed decision‐making remains to be fully elucidated. During periods of rest, bursts of high‐frequency oscillations, termed sharp‐wave ripple (SWR), appear in the local field potential. Impairing SWRs on the maze or during post‐learning rest can interfere with memory‐guided decision‐making and memory consolidation. We hypothesize that the hippocampus and mPFC bidirectionally interact during SWRs to support memory consolidation and decision‐making. Rats were trained on the neuroeconomic spatial decision‐making task, Restaurant Row, to make serial stay‐skip decisions where the amount of effort (delay to reward) varied upon entry to each restaurant. Hippocampal cells and SWRs were recorded in rats with the mPFC transduced with inhibitory DREADDs. We found that disrupting the mPFC impaired consolidating SWRs in the hippocampus. Hippocampal SWR rates depended on the internalized value of the reward (derived from individual flavor preferences), a parameter important in decision‐making, and disrupting the mPFC changed this relationship. Additionally, we found a dissociation between SWRs that occurred while rats were on the maze dependent upon whether those SWRs occurred while the rat was anticipating food reward or during post‐reward consumption.</content:encoded>

Neurons rely on localized mitochondria to fulfill spatially heterogeneous metabolic demands. Mitochondrial aging occurs on timescales shorter than the neuronal lifespan, necessitating transport of fresh material from the soma. Maintaining an optimal distribution of healthy mitochondria requires an interplay between a stationary pool localized to sites of high metabolic demand and a motile pool capable of delivering new material. Interchange between these pools can occur via transient fusion / fission events or by halting and restarting entire mitochondria. Our quantitative model of neuronal mitostasis identifies key parameters that govern steady-state mitochondrial health at discrete locations. Very infrequent exchange between stationary and motile pools optimizes this system. Exchange via transient fusion allows for robust maintenance, which can be further improved by selective recycling through mitophagy. These results provide a framework for quantifying how perturbations in organelle transport and interactions affect mitochondrial homeostasis in neurons, a key aspect underlying many neurodegenerative disorders.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/SDw2RNzxDJU&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Climate drivers such as humidity and temperature may play a key role in influenza seasonal transmission dynamics. Such a relationship has been well defined for temperate regions. However, to date no models capable of capturing the diverse seasonal pattern in tropical and subtropical climates exist. In addition, multiple influenza viruses could cocirculate and shape epidemic dynamics. Here we construct seven mechanistic epidemic models to test the effect of two major climate drivers (humidity and temperature) and multi-strain co-circulation on influenza transmission in Hong Kong, an influenza epidemic center located in the subtropics. Based on model fit to long-term influenza surveillance data from 1998 to 2018, we found that a simple model incorporating the effect of both humidity and temperature best recreated the influenza epidemic patterns observed in Hong Kong. The model quantifies a bimodal effect of absolute humidity on influenza transmission where both low and very high humidity levels facilitate transmission quadratically; the model also quantifies the monotonic but nonlinear relationship with temperature. In addition, model results suggest that, at the population level, a shorter immunity period can approximate the co-circulation of influenza virus (sub)types. The basic reproductive number &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; estimated by the best-fit model is also consistent with laboratory influenza survival and transmission studies under various combinations of humidity and temperature levels. Overall, our study has developed a simple mechanistic model capable of quantifying the impact of climate drivers on influenza transmission in (sub)tropical regions. This model can be applied to improve influenza forecasting in the (sub)tropics in the future.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/hlsPTASAxno&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Mechanistic basis of post-treatment control of SIV after anti-α4β7 antibody therapy</title>

Treating macaques with an anti-α4β7 antibody under the umbrella of combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) during early SIV infection can lead to viral remission, with viral loads maintained at &amp;lt; 50 SIV RNA copies/ml after removal of all treatment in a subset of animals. Depletion of CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; lymphocytes in controllers resulted in transient recrudescence of viremia, suggesting that the combination of cART and anti-α4β7 antibody treatment led to a state where ongoing immune responses kept the virus undetectable in the absence of treatment. A previous mathematical model of HIV infection and cART incorporates immune effector cell responses and exhibits the property of two different viral load set-points. While the lower set-point could correspond to the attainment of long-term viral remission, attaining the higher set-point may be the result of viral rebound. Here we expand that model to include possible mechanisms of action of an anti-α4β7 antibody operating in these treated animals. We show that the model can fit the longitudinal viral load data from both IgG control and anti-α4β7 antibody treated macaques, suggesting explanations for the viral control associated with cART and an anti-α4β7 antibody treatment. This effective perturbation to the virus-host interaction can also explain observations in other nonhuman primate experiments in which cART and immunotherapy have led to post-treatment control or resetting of the viral load set-point. Interestingly, because the viral kinetics in the various treated animals differed—some animals exhibited large fluctuations in viral load after cART cessation—the model suggests that anti-α4β7 treatment could act by different primary mechanisms in different animals and still lead to post-treatment viral control. This outcome is nonetheless in accordance with a model with two stable viral load set-points, in which therapy can perturb the system from one set-point to a lower one through different biological mechanisms.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/xrStXoZPNXw&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

When presented with complex rhythmic auditory stimuli, humans are able to track underlying temporal structure (e.g., a “beat”), both covertly and with their movements. This capacity goes far beyond that of a simple entrained oscillator, drawing on contextual and enculturated timing expectations and adjusting rapidly to perturbations in event timing, phase, and tempo. Previous modeling work has described how entrainment to rhythms may be shaped by event timing expectations, but sheds little light on any underlying computational principles that could unify the phenomenon of expectation-based entrainment with other brain processes. Inspired by the predictive processing framework, we propose that the problem of rhythm tracking is naturally characterized as a problem of continuously estimating an underlying phase and tempo based on precise event times and their correspondence to timing expectations. We present two inference problems formalizing this insight: PIPPET (Phase Inference from Point Process Event Timing) and PATIPPET (Phase and Tempo Inference). Variational solutions to these inference problems resemble previous “Dynamic Attending” models of perceptual entrainment, but introduce new terms representing the dynamics of uncertainty and the influence of expectations in the absence of sensory events. These terms allow us to model multiple characteristics of covert and motor human rhythm tracking not addressed by other models, including sensitivity of error corrections to inter-event interval and perceived tempo changes induced by event omissions. We show that positing these novel influences in human entrainment yields a range of testable behavioral predictions. Guided by recent neurophysiological observations, we attempt to align the phase inference framework with a specific brain implementation. We also explore the potential of this normative framework to guide the interpretation of experimental data and serve as building blocks for even richer predictive processing and active inference models of timing.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/VrvLG3Bm1C4&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

We showed that males show higher level of PNNs than females and in the posterior dorsal division of the medial amygdala (MeApd) the PNN is surrounding cells positive for the estrogen receptor alpha (Esr1). These data suggest a new role of PNN in controlling innate behavior circuits and sexual dimorphism.







Abstract
Perineuronal nets are extracellular glycoprotein structures that have been found on some neurons in the central nervous system and that have been shown to regulate their structural plasticity. Until now work on perineuronal nets has been focused on their role in cortical structures where they are selectively expressed on parvalbumin‐positive neurons and are reported to restrict the experience‐dependent plasticity of inhibitory afferents. Here, we examined the expression of perineuronal nets subcortically, showing that they are expressed in several discrete structures, including nuclei that comprise the brain network controlling reproductive behaviors (e.g., mounting, lordosis, aggression, and social defense). In particular, perineuronal nets were found in the posterior dorsal division of the medial amygdala, the medial preoptic nucleus, the posterior medial bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, the ventrolateral ventromedial hypothalamus and adjacent tuberal nucleus, and the ventral premammillary nucleus in both the mouse and primate brain. Comparison of perineuronal nets in male and female mice revealed a significant sexually dimorphic expression, with expression found prominently on estrogen receptor expressing neurons in the medial amygdala. These findings suggest that perineuronal nets may be involved in regulating neural plasticity in the mammalian reproductive system.</content:encoded>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Cognitive functions in adult‐onset phenotypes of X‐linked adrenoleukodystrophy</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.26141?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Objective
X‐linked adrenoleukodystrophy (X‐ALD) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by progressive demyelination ranging from mild myelopathic forms (adrenomyeloneuropathy, AMN) to severe cerebral variants (adult cerebral adrenoleukodystrophy, ACALD). The study's aim was to compare cognitive function in adult‐onset X‐ALD phenotypes.


Methods
Cognitive function in various domains (intelligence, attention, memory, executive function, processing speed) was assessed in N = 172 adults (n = 117 AMN, n = 30 arrested ACALD, n = 25 acute ACALD) using comprehensive neuropsychological batteries. Phenotype differences were examined by analyses of variance.


Results
X‐ALD phenotypes significantly differed in non‐verbal intelligence, sustained attention, verbal encoding, non‐verbal recognition, and processing speed (ps &amp;lt; .050). No group differences emerged regarding verbal intelligence, verbal retrieval and recognition, and executive function (ps &amp;gt; .050). Specifically, patients with acute ACALD showed severe cognitive deficits compared to AMN and norm data, with largest effects on processing speed. Contrary, cognition was overall intact in AMN patients, independent of sex and corticospinal tract involvement, and those with arrested ACALD showed mild cognitive dysfunction, particularly in verbal encoding and processing speed.


Interpretation
Cerebral demyelination in X‐ALD patients causes white matter dementia, mainly characterized by an extreme slowdown in processing speed associated with deficits in attention and learning. Most AMN patients show intact cognitive function. Future prospective, longitudinal studies with more sensitive imaging techniques are required to clarify whether early mild cognitive dysfunction found in some AMN patients may be associated with subtle myelin abnormalities that do not yet appear as white matter lesions on cMRI but have the potential to serve as early predictors of later cerebral progression.

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2021.678837</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Oxidative stress appears to be a key feature of many neurodegenerative diseases either as a cause or consequence of disease. A range of molecules are subject to oxidation, but in particular, proteins are an important target and measure of oxidative stress. Proteins are subject to a range of oxidative modifications at reactive cysteine residues, and depending on the level of oxidative stress, these modifications may be reversible or irreversible. A range of experimental approaches has been developed to characterize cysteine oxidation of proteins. In particular, mass spectrometry-based proteomic methods have emerged as a powerful means to identify and quantify cysteine oxidation sites on a proteome scale; however, their application to study neurodegenerative diseases is limited to date. Here we provide a guide to these approaches and highlight the under-exploited utility of these methods to measure oxidative stress in neurodegenerative diseases for biomarker discovery, target engagement and to understand disease mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2021.662774</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Transcriptional regulation is essential for the correct functioning of cells during development and in postnatal life. The basic Helix-loop-Helix (bHLH) superfamily of transcription factors is well conserved throughout evolution and plays critical roles in tissue development and tissue maintenance. A subgroup of this family, called neural lineage bHLH factors, is critical in the development and function of the central nervous system. In this review, we will focus on the function of one subgroup of neural lineage bHLH factors, the Neurod family. The Neurod family has four members: Neurod1, Neurod2, Neurod4, and Neurod6. Available evidence shows that these four factors are key during the development of the cerebral cortex but also in other regions of the central nervous system, such as the cerebellum, the brainstem, and the spinal cord. We will also discuss recent reports that link the dysfunction of these transcription factors to neurological disorders in humans.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.656856</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Handwriting is a complex activity including motor planning and visuomotor integration and referring to some brain areas identified as “writing centers.” Although temporal features of handwriting are as important as spatial ones, to our knowledge, there is no evidence of the description of specific brain areas associated with handwriting tempo. People with multiple sclerosis (PwMS) show handwriting impairments that are mainly referred to as the temporal features of the task. The aim of this work was to assess differences in the brain activation pattern elicited by handwriting between PwMS and healthy controls (HC), with the final goal of identifying possible areas specific for handwriting tempo. Subjects were asked to write a sentence at their spontaneous speed. PwMS differed only in temporal handwriting features from HC and showed reduced activation with a subset of the clusters observed in HC. Spearman’s correlation analysis was performed between handwriting temporal parameters and the activity in the brain areas resulting from the contrast analysis, HC &amp;gt; PwMS. We found that the right inferior parietal lobule (IPL) negatively correlated with the duration of the sentence, indicating that the higher the right IPL activity, the faster the handwriting performance. We propose that the right IPL might be considered a “writing tempo center.”&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Disrupted Asymmetry of Inter- and Intra-Hemispheric Functional Connectivity at Rest in Medication-Free Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.634557</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Disrupted functional asymmetry of cerebral hemispheres may be altered in patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). However, little is known about whether anomalous brain asymmetries originate from inter- and/or intra-hemispheric functional connectivity (FC) at rest in OCD. In this study, resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging was applied to 40 medication-free patients with OCD and 38 gender-, age-, and education-matched healthy controls (HCs). Data were analyzed using the parameter of asymmetry (PAS) and support vector machine methods. Patients with OCD showed significantly increased PAS in the left posterior cingulate cortex, left precentral gyrus/postcentral gyrus, and right inferior occipital gyrus and decreased PAS in the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), bilateral middle cingulate cortex (MCC), left inferior parietal lobule, and left cerebellum Crus I. A negative correlation was found between decreased PAS in the left DLPFC and Yale–Brown Obsessive-compulsive Scale compulsive behavior scores in the patients. Furthermore, decreased PAS in the bilateral MCC could be used to distinguish OCD from HCs with a sensitivity of 87.50%, an accuracy of 88.46%, and a specificity of 89.47%. These results highlighted the contribution of disrupted asymmetry of intra-hemispheric FC within and outside the cortico-striato-thalamocortical circuits at rest in the pathophysiology of OCD, and reduced intra-hemispheric FC in the bilateral MCC may serve as a potential biomarker to classify individuals with OCD from HCs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Cross-Subject EEG Emotion Recognition With Self-Organized Graph Neural Network</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.611653</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;As a physiological process and high-level cognitive behavior, emotion is an important subarea in neuroscience research. Emotion recognition across subjects based on brain signals has attracted much attention. Due to individual differences across subjects and the low signal-to-noise ratio of EEG signals, the performance of conventional emotion recognition methods is relatively poor. In this paper, we propose a self-organized graph neural network (SOGNN) for cross-subject EEG emotion recognition. Unlike the previous studies based on pre-constructed and fixed graph structure, the graph structure of SOGNN are dynamically constructed by self-organized module for each signal. To evaluate the cross-subject EEG emotion recognition performance of our model, leave-one-subject-out experiments are conducted on two public emotion recognition datasets, SEED and SEED-IV. The SOGNN is able to achieve state-of-the-art emotion recognition performance. Moreover, we investigated the performance variances of the models with different graph construction techniques or features in different frequency bands. Furthermore, we visualized the graph structure learned by the proposed model and found that part of the structure coincided with previous neuroscience research. The experiments demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed model for cross-subject EEG emotion recognition.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: ConvDip: A Convolutional Neural Network for Better EEG Source Imaging</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.569918</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The electroencephalography (EEG) is a well-established non-invasive method in neuroscientific research and clinical diagnostics. It provides a high temporal but low spatial resolution of brain activity. To gain insight about the spatial dynamics of the EEG, one has to solve the inverse problem, i.e., finding the neural sources that give rise to the recorded EEG activity. The inverse problem is ill-posed, which means that more than one configuration of neural sources can evoke one and the same distribution of EEG activity on the scalp. Artificial neural networks have been previously used successfully to find either one or two dipole sources. These approaches, however, have never solved the inverse problem in a distributed dipole model with more than two dipole sources. We present ConvDip, a novel convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture, that solves the EEG inverse problem in a distributed dipole model based on simulated EEG data. We show that (1) ConvDip learned to produce inverse solutions from a single time point of EEG data and (2) outperforms state-of-the-art methods on all focused performance measures. (3) It is more flexible when dealing with varying number of sources, produces less ghost sources and misses less real sources than the comparison methods. It produces plausible inverse solutions for real EEG recordings from human participants. (4) The trained network needs &amp;lt;40 ms for a single prediction. Our results qualify ConvDip as an efficient and easy-to-apply novel method for source localization in EEG data, with high relevance for clinical applications, e.g., in epileptology and real-time applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

We find that perfusion of oxytocin onto acute brain slices significantly increases the frequency of miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSC) of S1BF L2/3 pyramidal neurons at P10 and P14, but reduces it at the later ages of P22 and P28; the transition occurs at around P18. Since oxytocin expression is itself regulated by sensory experience, we also examine whether the effects of oxytocin on excitatory synaptic transmission correlate with that of sensory experience. We find that, indeed, the effects of sensory experience and oxytocin on excitatory synaptic transmission of L2/3 pyramidal neurons both peak at around P14 and plateau around P18, suggesting that they regulate a specific form of synaptic plasticity in L2/3 pyramidal neurons, with a sensitive/critical period ending around P18. Consistently, oxytocin receptor (Oxtr) expression in glutamatergic neurons of the upper layers of the cerebral cortex peaks around P14. By P28, however, Oxtr expression becomes more prominent in GABAergic neurons, especially somatostatin (SST) neurons. At P28, oxytocin perfusion increases inhibitory synaptic transmission and reduces excitatory synaptic transmission, effects that result in a net reduction of neuronal excitation, in contrast to increased excitation at P14. Using oxytocin knockout mice and Oxtr conditional knockout mice, we show that loss-of-function of oxytocin affects baseline excitatory synaptic transmission, while Oxtr is required for oxytocin-induced changes in excitatory synaptic transmission, at both P14 and P28. Together, these results demonstrate that oxytocin has complex and dynamic functions in regulating synaptic transmission in cortical L2/3 pyramidal neurons. These findings add to existing knowledge of the function of oxytocin in regulating neural circuit development and plasticity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Agent-based modeling of the central amygdala and pain using cell-type specific physiological parameters</title>

The amygdala is a brain area involved in emotional regulation and pain. Over the course of the last 20 years, multiple researchers have studied sensory and motor connections within the amygdala in trying to understand the ultimate role of this structure in pain perception and descending control of pain. A number of investigators have been using cell-type specific manipulations to probe the underlying circuitry of the amygdala. As data have accumulated in this research space, we recognized a critical need for a single framework to integrate these data and evaluate emergent system-level responses. In this manuscript, we present an agent-based computational model of two distinct inhibitory neuron populations in the amygdala, those that express protein kinase C delta (PKC&lt;i&gt;δ&lt;/i&gt;) and those that express somatostatin (SOM). We utilized a network of neural links to simulate connectivity and the transmission of inhibitory signals between neurons. Type-specific parameters describing the response of these neurons to noxious stimuli were estimated from published physiological and immunological data as well as our own wet-lab experiments. The model outputs an abstract measure of pain, which is calculated in terms of the cumulative pro-nociceptive and anti-nociceptive activity across neurons in both hemispheres of the amygdala. Results demonstrate the ability of the model to produce changes in pain that are consistent with published studies and highlight the importance of several model parameters. In particular, we found that the relative proportion of PKC&lt;i&gt;δ&lt;/i&gt; and SOM neurons within each hemisphere is a key parameter in predicting pain and we explored model predictions for three possible values of this parameter. We compared model predictions of pain to data from our earlier behavioral studies and found areas of similarity as well as distinctions between the data sets. These differences, in particular, suggest a number of wet-lab experiments that could be done in the future.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/-Gu4XwB9cP4&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Abstract
Research exploring the underlying neuroanatomical correlates of early motherhood seems to suggest that the period after giving birth is marked by tissue increases in the mother's brain. While some studies point to the amygdala as one of the areas undergoing postpartum changes, existing analyses did not discriminate between the different subregions of this functionally heterogeneous structure. Thus, to further extend this understudied field of research and to better understand the potential role of the amygdala when transitioning to motherhood, we applied an advanced region‐of‐interest technique that enabled us to analyze the amygdala as a whole as well as its different subareas, specifically the left and right centromedian (CM), laterobasal (LB), and superficial (SF) regions. Comparing the brains of 14 healthy women between immediate postpartum (within 1–2 days of childbirth) and late postpartum (at 4–6 weeks after childbirth), we revealed increases of the amygdala. However, effects manifested differentially across subareas, with particularly strong effects for the SF region, moderate effects for the CM region, and no effects for the LB region. These findings might reflect region‐specific adaptations of the mother's brain tuning into the distinct and ever‐changing needs of a newborn, either as a cause for it or as a consequence thereof.</content:encoded>

	<title>Hippocampus: Distinct patterns of hippocampal activity associated with color and spatial source memory</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hipo.23368?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
The hippocampus is known to be involved in source memory across a wide variety of stimuli and source types. Thus, source memory activity in the hippocampus is thought to be domain‐general such that different types of source information are similarly processed in the hippocampus. However, there is some evidence of domain‐specificity for spatial and temporal source information. The current fMRI study aimed to determine whether patterns of activity in the hippocampus differed for two types of visual source information: spatial location and background color. Participants completed three runs of a spatial memory task and three runs of a color memory task. During the study phase, 32 line drawings of common objects and animals were presented to either the left or right of fixation for the spatial memory task or on either a red or green background for the color memory task. During the test phase of both tasks, 48 object word labels were presented in the center of the screen and participants classified the corresponding item as old and previously on the “left”/on a “green” background, old and previously on the “right”/on a “red” background, or “new.” Two analysis methods were employed to assess whether hippocampal activity differed between the two source types: a general linear model analysis and a classification‐based searchlight multivoxel pattern analysis (MVPA). The searchlight MVPA revealed that activity associated with spatial memory and color memory could be classified with above‐chance accuracy in a region of the right anterior hippocampus, and a follow‐up analysis revealed that there was a significant effect of memory accuracy. These results indicate that different types of source memory are represented by distinct patterns of activity in the hippocampus.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hipo.23337?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
The hippocampus is particularly susceptible to neurodegeneration. Physical activity, specifically increasing cardiorespiratory fitness via aerobic exercise, shows promise as a potential method for mitigating hippocampal decline in humans. Numerous studies have now investigated associations between the structure and function of the hippocampus and engagement in physical activity. Still, there remains continued debate and confusion about the relationship between physical activity and the human hippocampus. In this review, we describe the current state of the physical activity and exercise literature as it pertains to the structure and function of the human hippocampus, focusing on four magnetic resonance imaging measures: volume, diffusion tensor imaging, resting‐state functional connectivity, and perfusion. We conclude that, despite significant heterogeneity in study methods, populations of interest, and scope, there are consistent positive findings, suggesting a promising role for physical activity in promoting hippocampal structure and function throughout the lifespan.</content:encoded>
