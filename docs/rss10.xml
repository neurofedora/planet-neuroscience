	<title>arXiv: Quantitative Biology: Neurons and Cognition: A single psychotomimetic dose of ketamine decreases thalamocortical spindles and delta oscillations in the sedated rat. (arXiv:2005.01356v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.01356</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Background: In patients with psychotic disorders, sleep spindles are reduced,
supporting the hypothesis that the thalamus and glutamate receptors play a
crucial etio-pathophysiological role, whose underlying mechanisms remain
unknown. We hypothesized that a reduced function of NMDA receptors is involved
in the spindle deficit observed in schizophrenia. Methods: An
electrophysiological multisite cell-to-network exploration was used to
investigate, in pentobarbital-sedated rats, the effects of a single
psychotomimetic dose of the NMDA glutamate receptor antagonist ketamine in the
sensorimotor and associative/cognitive thalamocortical (TC) systems. Results:
Under the control condition, spontaneously-occurring spindles (intra-frequency:
10-16 waves/s) and delta-frequency (1-4Hz) oscillations were recorded in the
frontoparietal cortical EEG, in thalamic extracellular recordings, in dual
juxtacellularly recorded GABAergic thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN) and
glutamatergic TC neurons, and in intracellularly recorded TC neurons. The TRN
cells rhythmically exhibited robust high-frequency bursts of action potentials
(7 to 15 APs at 200-700Hz). A single administration of low-dose ketamine
fleetingly reduced TC spindles and delta oscillations, amplified ongoing
gamma-(30-80Hz) and higher-frequency oscillations, and switched the firing
pattern of both TC and TRN neurons from a burst mode to a single AP mode.
Furthermore, ketamine strengthened the gamma-frequency band TRN-TC
connectivity. The antipsychotic clozapine consistently prevented the ketamine
effects on spindles, delta- and gamma-/higher-frequency TC oscillations.
Conclusion: The present findings support the hypothesis that NMDA receptor
hypofunction is involved in the reduction in sleep spindles and delta
oscillations. The ketamine-induced swift conversion of ongoing TC-TRN
activities may have involved at least both the ascending reticular activating
system and the corticothalamic pathway.

	<title>arXiv: Computer Science: Neural and Evolutionary Computing: Obtaining Basic Algebra Formulas with Genetic Programming and Functional Rewriting. (arXiv:2005.01207v1 [cs.NE])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.01207</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In this paper, we develop a set of genetic programming operators and an
initialization population process based on concepts of functional programming
rewriting for boosting inductive genetic programming. Such genetic operators
are used within a hybrid adaptive evolutionary algorithm that evolves operator
rates at the same time it evolves the solution. Solutions are represented using
recursive functions where genome is encoded as an ordered list of trees and
phenotype is written in a simple functional programming language that uses
rewriting as operational semantic (computational model). The fitness is the
number of examples successfully deduced over the cardinal of the set of
examples. Parents are selected following a tournament selection mechanism and
the next population is obtained following a steady-state strategy. The
evolutionary process can use some previous functions (programs) induced as
background knowledge. We compare the performance of our technique in a set of
hard problems (for classical genetic programming). In particular, we take as
test-bed the problem of obtaining equivalent algebraic expressions of some
notable products (such as square of a binomial, and cube of a binomial), and
the recursive formulas of sum of the first n and squares of the first n natural
numbers.

	<title>arXiv: Computer Science: Neural and Evolutionary Computing: System Metamodel Formalism. (arXiv:2005.01192v1 [cs.NE])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.01192</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Differential equations have been widely and successfully used to describe the
macroscopic or global behaviour of systems in general. With inhomogeneous,
time-varying, specific, and often non-linear interactions, the dynamics of
complex systems is in contrast more efficiently described by local rules and
thus in an algorithmic and local or microscopic manner. In order to create
computer models of systems, particularly complex systems, we recently presented
a so-called allagmatic method including a system metamodel with two concrete
implementations of cellular automata and artificial neural networks. Guidance
from philosophy and its general concepts were helpful in these first studies
focusing on computer modelling and simulation as well as feasibility. A
rigorous mathematical formalism of the system metamodel, however, is still
missing. This would not only more precisely describe and define the system
metamodel, it would also further generalise it and with that extend its reach
to formal treatment in applied mathematics and computational mathematics as
well as extend its applicability to other mathematical models such as
agent-based models. In this study, a mathematical definition of the system
metamodel and its model parameters is provided and the creation of concrete
mathematical models, i.e. cellular automata and artificial neural networks,
from it is proved.

	<title>arXiv: Computer Science: Neural and Evolutionary Computing: Teaching Recurrent Neural Networks to Modify Chaotic Memories by Example. (arXiv:2005.01186v1 [cond-mat.dis-nn])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.01186</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The ability to store and manipulate information is a hallmark of
computational systems. Whereas computers are carefully engineered to represent
and perform mathematical operations on structured data, neurobiological systems
perform analogous functions despite flexible organization and unstructured
sensory input. Recent efforts have made progress in modeling the representation
and recall of information in neural systems. However, precisely how neural
systems learn to modify these representations remains far from understood. Here
we demonstrate that a recurrent neural network (RNN) can learn to modify its
representation of complex information using only examples, and we explain the
associated learning mechanism with new theory. Specifically, we drive an RNN
with examples of translated, linearly transformed, or pre-bifurcated time
series from a chaotic Lorenz system, alongside an additional control signal
that changes value for each example. By training the network to replicate the
Lorenz inputs, it learns to autonomously evolve about a Lorenz-shaped manifold.
Additionally, it learns to continuously interpolate and extrapolate the
translation, transformation, and bifurcation of this representation far beyond
the training data by changing the control signal. Finally, we provide a
mechanism for how these computations are learned, and demonstrate that a single
network can simultaneously learn multiple computations. Together, our results
provide a simple but powerful mechanism by which an RNN can learn to manipulate
internal representations of complex information, allowing for the principled
study and precise design of RNNs.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.01113</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Crossover is the process of recombining the genetic features of two parents.
For many applications where crossover is applied to permutations, relevant
genetic features are pairs of adjacent elements, also called edges in the
permutation order. Recombination of edges without errors is thought to be an
NP-hard problem, typically approximated by heuristics that either introduce new
edges or are only able to produce a small variety of offspring. Here, we derive
an algorithm for crossover of permutations that achieves perfect transmission
of edges and produces a uniform sampling of all possible offspring, in
quadratic average computation time. The algorithm and its derivation reveal a
link between cycle crossover (CX) and edge assembly crossover (EAX), offering a
new perspective on these well-established algorithms. We also describe a
modification of the algorithm that generates the mathematically optimal
offspring for the asymmetric travelling salesman problem.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.00863</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In this paper, the fuzzy multi-objective reliability redundancy allocation
problem (FMORRAP) is proposed, which maximizes the system reliability while
simultaneously minimizing the system cost under the type 2 fuzzy uncertainty.
In the proposed formulation, the higher order uncertainties (such as
parametric, manufacturing, environmental, and designers uncertainty) associated
with the system are modeled with interval type 2 fuzzy sets (IT2 FS). The
footprint of uncertainty of the interval type 2 membership functions (IT2 MFs)
accommodates these uncertainties by capturing the multiple opinions from
several system experts. We consider IT2 MFs to represent the subsystem
reliability and cost, which are to be further aggregated using extension
principle to evaluate the total system reliability and cost according to their
configurations, i.e., series parallel and parallel series. We proposed a
particle swarm optimization (PSO) based novel solution approach to solve the
FMORRAP. To demonstrate the applicability of two formulations, namely, series
parallel FMORRAP and parallel series FMORRAP, we performed experimental
simulations on various numerical data sets. The decision makers/system experts
assign different importance to the objectives (system reliability and cost),
and these preferences are represented by sets of weights. The optimal results
are obtained from our solution approach, and the Pareto optimal front is
established using these different weight sets. The genetic algorithm (GA) was
implemented to compare the results obtained from our proposed solution
approach. A statistical analysis was conducted between PSO and GA, and it was
found that the PSO based Pareto solution outperforms the GA.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.00853</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A decent number of lower bounds for non-elitist population-based evolutionary
algorithms has been shown by now. Most of them are technically demanding due to
the (hard to avoid) use of negative drift theorems -- general results which
translate an expected progress away from the target into a high hitting time.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We propose a simple negative drift theorem for multiplicative drift scenarios
and show that it simplifies many existing results. We discuss in more detail
Lehre's (PPSN 2010) \emph{negative drift in populations} method, one of the
most general tools to prove lower bounds on the runtime of non-elitist
evolutionary algorithms. Together with other arguments, we obtain an
alternative and simpler proof, which also strengthens and simplifies this
method. In particular, now only three of the five technical conditions of the
previous result have to be verified. The lower bounds we obtain are explicit
instead of only asymptotic. This allows to compute concrete lower bounds for
concrete algorithms, but also enables us to show that super-polynomial runtimes
appear already when the reproduction rate is only a $(1 - \omega(n^{-1/2}))$
factor below the threshold. As one particular result, we apply this method, for
the first time, to an algorithm using fitness-proportionate selection.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In the literature, there is a strong interest to identify and define
activation functions which can improve neural network performance. In recent
years there is a renovated interest of the scientific community in
investigating activation functions which can be trained during the learning

functions. They appear to lead to better network performance. Diverse and
heterogeneous models of trainable activation function have been proposed in the
literature. In this paper, we present a survey of these models. Starting from a
discussion on the use of the term &quot;activation function&quot; in literature, we
propose a taxonomy of trainable activation functions, highlight common and
distinctive proprieties of recent and past models, and discuss on main
advantages and limitations of this type of approach. We show that many of the
proposed approaches are equivalent to add neuron layers which use fixed
activation functions (nontrainable activation functions) and some simple local
rule constrains the corresponding weight layers.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.00805</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Seizure activity is a ubiquitous and pernicious pathophysiology that, in
principle, should yield to mathematical treatments of (neuronal) ensemble
dynamics - and therefore interventions on stochastic chaos. A seizure can be
characterised as a deviation of neural activity from a stable dynamical regime,
i.e. one in which signals fluctuate only within a limited range. In silico
treatments of neural activity are an important tool for understanding how the
brain can achieve stability, as well as how pathology can lead to seizures and
potential strategies for mitigating instabilities, e.g. via external
stimulation. Here, we demonstrate that the (neuronal) state equation used in
Dynamic Causal Modelling generalises to a Fokker-Planck formalism when
propagation of neuronal activity along structural connections is considered.
Using the Jacobian of this generalised state equation, we show that an
initially unstable system can be rendered stable via a reduction in diffusivity
(i.e., connectivity that disperses neuronal fluctuations). We show, for neural
systems prone to epileptic seizures, that such a reduction can be achieved via
external stimulation. Specifically, we show that this stimulation should be
applied in such a way as to temporarily mirror epileptic activity in the areas
adjoining an affected brain region - thus 'fighting seizures with seizures'. We
offer proof of principle using simulations based on functional neuroimaging
data collected from patients with idiopathic generalised epilepsy, in which we
successfully suppress pathological activity in a distinct sub-network. Our hope
is that this technique can form the basis for real-time monitoring and
intervention devices that are capable of suppressing or even preventing
seizures in a non-invasive manner.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.00723</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Spikes are the currency in central nervous systems for information
transmission and processing. They are also believed to play an essential role
in low-power consumption of the biological systems, whose efficiency attracts
increasing attentions to the field of neuromorphic computing. However,
efficient processing and learning of discrete spikes still remains as a
challenging problem. In this paper, we make our contributions towards this
direction. A simplified spiking neuron model is firstly introduced with effects
of both synaptic input and firing output on membrane potential being modeled
with an impulse function. An event-driven scheme is then presented to further
improve the processing efficiency. Based on the neuron model, we propose two
new multi-spike learning rules which demonstrate better performance over other
baselines on various tasks including association, classification, feature
detection. In addition to efficiency, our learning rules demonstrate a high
robustness against strong noise of different types. They can also be
generalized to different spike coding schemes for the classification task, and
notably single neuron is capable of solving multi-category classifications with
our learning rules. In the feature detection task, we re-examine the ability of
unsupervised STDP with its limitations being presented, and find a new
phenomenon of losing selectivity. In contrast, our proposed learning rules can
reliably solve the task over a wide range of conditions without specific
constraints being applied. Moreover, our rules can not only detect features but
also discriminate them. The improved performance of our methods would
contribute to neuromorphic computing as a preferable choice.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The present and future of evolutionary algorithms depends on the proper use
of modern parallel and distributed computing infrastructures. Although still
sequential approaches dominate the landscape, available multi-core, many-core
and distributed systems will make users and researchers to more frequently
deploy parallel version of the algorithms. In such a scenario, new
possibilities arise regarding the time saved when parallel evaluation of
individuals are performed. And this time saving is particularly relevant in
Genetic Programming. This paper studies how evaluation time influences not only
time to solution in parallel/distributed systems, but may also affect size
evolution of individuals in the population, and eventually will reduce the
bloat phenomenon GP features. This paper considers time and space as two sides
of a single coin when devising a more natural method for fighting bloat. This
new perspective allows us to understand that new methods for bloat control can
be derived, and the first of such a method is described and tested.
Experimental data confirms the strength of the approach: using computing time
as a measure of individuals' complexity allows to control the growth in size of
genetic programming individuals.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.10306</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;One of the main and largely unexplored challenges in evolving the weights of
neural networks using genetic algorithms is to find a sensible crossover
operation between parent networks. Indeed, naive crossover leads to
functionally damaged offspring that do not retain information from the parents.
This is because neural networks are invariant to permutations of neurons,
giving rise to multiple ways of representing the same solution. This is often
referred to as the competing conventions problem. In this paper, we propose a
two-step safe crossover(SC) operator. First, the neurons of the parents are
functionally aligned by computing how well they correlate, and only then are
the parents recombined. We compare two ways of measuring relationships between
neurons: Pairwise Correlation (PwC) and Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA).
We test our safe crossover operators (SC-PwC and SC-CCA) on MNIST and CIFAR-10
by performing arithmetic crossover on the weights of feed-forward neural
network pairs. We show that it effectively transmits information from parents
to offspring and significantly improves upon naive crossover. Our method is
computationally fast,can serve as a way to explore the fitness landscape more
efficiently and makes safe crossover a potentially promising operator in future
neuroevolution research and applications.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;On the basis of the evident ability of neuronal olfactory systems to evaluate
the intensity of an odorous stimulus and at the same time also recognise the
identity of the odorant over a large range of concentrations, a few
biologically-realistic hypotheses on some of the underlying neural processes
are made. In particular, it is assumed that the receptor neurons mean
firing-rate scale monotonically with odorant intensity, and that the receptor
sensitivities range widely across odorants and receptor neurons hence leading
to highly distributed representations of the stimuli. The mathematical
implementation of the phenomenological postulates allows for inferring explicit
functional relationships between some measurable quantities. It results that
both the dependence of the mean firing-rate on odorant concentration and the
statistical distribution of receptor sensitivity across the neuronal population
are power-laws, whose respective exponents are in an arithmetic, testable
relationship.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to test quantitatively the prediction of power-law dependence of
population mean firing-rate on odorant concentration, a probabilistic model is
created to extract information from data available in the experimental
literature. The values of the free parameters of the model are estimated by an
info-geometric Bayesian maximum-likelihood inference which keeps into account
the prior distribution of the parameters. The eventual goodness of fit is
quantified by means of a distribution-independent test.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;As a discipline cybernetics has a long and rich history. In its first
generation it not only had a worldwide span, in the area of computer modelling,
for example, its proponents such as John von Neumann, Stanislaw Ulam, Warren
McCulloch and Walter Pitts, also came up with models and methods such as
cellular automata and artificial neural networks, which are still the
foundation of most modern modelling approaches. At the same time, cybernetics
also got the attention of philosophers, such as the Frenchman Gilbert Simondon,
who made use of cybernetical concepts in order to establish a metaphysics and a
natural philosophy of individuation, giving cybernetics thereby a philosophical
interpretation, which he baptised allagmatic. In this paper, we emphasise this
allagmatic theory by showing how Simondon's philosophical concepts can be used
to formulate a generic computer model or metamodel for complex systems
modelling and its implementation in program code, according to generic
programming. We also present how the developed allagmatic metamodel is capable
of building simple cellular automata and artificial neural networks.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Differentiable programming is the combination of classical neural networks
modules with algorithmic ones in an end-to-end differentiable model. These new
models, that use automatic differentiation to calculate gradients, have new
learning capabilities (reasoning, attention and memory). In this tutorial,
aimed at researchers in nonlinear systems with prior knowledge of deep
learning, we present this new programming paradigm, describe some of its new
features such as attention mechanisms, and highlight the benefits they bring.
Then, we analyse the uses and limitations of traditional deep learning models
in the modeling and prediction of dynamical systems. Here, a dynamical system
is meant to be a set of state variables that evolve in time under general
internal and external interactions. Finally, we review the advantages and
applications of differentiable programming to dynamical systems.

perform on par with regular convolutional neural networks. Several works have
proposed methods to convert a pre-trained CNN to a Spiking CNN without a
significant sacrifice of performance. We demonstrate first that
quantization-aware training of CNNs leads to better accuracy in SNNs. One of
the benefits of converting CNNs to spiking CNNs is to leverage the sparse
computation of SNNs and consequently perform equivalent computation at a lower
energy consumption. Here we propose an efficient optimization strategy to train
spiking networks at lower energy consumption, while maintaining similar
accuracy levels. We demonstrate results on the MNIST-DVS and CIFAR-10 datasets.

	<title>arXiv: Quantitative Biology: Neurons and Cognition: Deriving pairwise transfer entropy from network structure and motifs. (arXiv:1911.02931v2 [cs.IT] UPDATED)</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1911.02931</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Transfer entropy is an established method for quantifying directed
statistical dependencies in neuroimaging and complex systems datasets. The
pairwise (or bivariate) transfer entropy from a source to a target node in a
network does not depend solely on the local source-target link weight, but on
the wider network structure that the link is embedded in. This relationship is
studied using a discrete-time linearly-coupled Gaussian model, which allows us
to derive the transfer entropy for each link from the network topology. It is
shown analytically that the dependence on the directed link weight is only a
first approximation, valid for weak coupling. More generally, the transfer
entropy increases with the in-degree of the source and decreases with the
in-degree of the target, indicating an asymmetry of information transfer
between hubs and low-degree nodes. In addition, the transfer entropy is
directly proportional to weighted motif counts involving common parents or
multiple walks from the source to the target, which are more abundant in
networks with a high clustering coefficient than in random networks. Our
findings also apply to Granger causality, which is equivalent to transfer
entropy for Gaussian variables. Moreover, similar empirical results on random
Boolean networks suggest that the dependence of the transfer entropy on the
in-degree extends to nonlinear dynamics.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1909.05508</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Performing Reinforcement Learning in sparse rewards settings, with very
little prior knowledge, is a challenging problem since there is no signal to
properly guide the learning process. In such situations, a good search strategy
is fundamental. At the same time, not having to adapt the algorithm to every
single problem is very desirable. Here we introduce TAXONS, a Task Agnostic
eXploration of Outcome spaces through Novelty and Surprise algorithm. Based on
a population-based divergent-search approach, it learns a set of diverse
policies directly from high-dimensional observations, without any task-specific
information. TAXONS builds a repertoire of policies while training an
autoencoder on the high-dimensional observation of the final state of the
system to build a low-dimensional outcome space. The learned outcome space,
combined with the reconstruction error, is used to drive the search for new
policies. Results show that TAXONS can find a diverse set of controllers,
covering a good part of the ground-truth outcome space, while having no
information about such space.

architecture search to find networks where the topology completely encodes the

the existing framework of binarized networks to find performant topologies by
constraining the weights to be either, zero or one. We show that such
topologies achieve performance similar to standard networks while pruning more
than 99% weights. We further demonstrate that these topologies can perform
tasks using constant weights without any explicit tuning. Finally, we discover
that in our setup each neuron acts like a NOR gate, virtually learning a
digital circuit. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach on computer vision

	<title>arXiv: Quantitative Biology: Neurons and Cognition: A Cognition-Affect Integrated Model of Emotion. (arXiv:1907.02557v3 [q-bio.NC] UPDATED)</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1907.02557</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The focus of the efforts for defining and modelling emotion is broadly
shifting from classical definite marker theory to statistically context
situated conceptual theory. However, the role of context processing and its
interaction with the affect is still not comprehensively explored and modelled.
With the help of neural decoding of functional networks, we have decoded
cognitive functions for 12 different basic and complex emotion conditions.
Using transfer learning in deep neural architecture, we arrived at the
conclusion that the core affect is unable to provide varieties of emotions
unless coupled with cortical cognitive functions such as autobiographical
memory, dmn, self-referential, social, tom and salient event detection.
Following our results, in this article, we present a 'cognition-affect
integrated model of emotion' which includes many cortical and subcortical
regions and their interactions. Our model suggests three testable hypotheses.
First, affect and physiological sensations alone are inconsequential in
defining or classifying emotions until integrated with the domain-general
cognitive systems. Second, cognition and affect modulate each other throughout
the generation of meaningful instance which is situated in the current context.
And, finally, the structural and temporal hierarchies in the brain's
organization and anatomical projections play an important role in emotion
responses in terms of hierarchical activities and their durations. The model,
along with the analytical and anatomical support, is presented. The article
concludes with the future research questions.

	<title>arXiv: Computer Science: Neural and Evolutionary Computing: Automatic Programming of Cellular Automata and Artificial Neural Networks Guided by Philosophy. (arXiv:1905.04232v5 [cs.AI] UPDATED)</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.04232</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Many computer models such as cellular automata and artificial neural networks
have been developed and successfully applied. However, in some cases, these
models might be restrictive on the possible solutions or their solutions might
be difficult to interpret. To overcome this problem, we outline a new approach,
the so-called allagmatic method, that automatically programs and executes
models with as little limitations as possible while maintaining human
interpretability. Earlier we described a metamodel and its building blocks
according to the philosophical concepts of structure (spatial dimension) and
operation (temporal dimension). They are entity, milieu, and update function
that together abstractly describe cellular automata, artificial neural
networks, and possibly any kind of computer model. By automatically combining
these building blocks in an evolutionary computation, interpretability might be
increased by the relationship to the metamodel, and models might be translated
into more interpretable models via the metamodel. We propose generic and
object-oriented programming to implement the entities and their milieus as
dynamic and generic arrays and the update function as a method. We show two
experiments where a simple cellular automaton and an artificial neural network
are automatically programmed, compiled, and executed. A target state is
successfully evolved and learned in the cellular automaton and artificial
neural network, respectively. We conclude that the allagmatic method can create
and execute cellular automaton and artificial neural network models in an
automated manner with the guidance of philosophy.

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Identification of Differentially Expressed Genes and Key Pathways in the Dorsal Root Ganglion After Chronic Compression</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2020.00071</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Neuropathic pain (NP) is caused by primary or secondary impairment of the peripheral or central nervous systems. Its etiology is complex and involves abnormal patterns of gene expression and pathway activation. Using bioinformatics analysis, we aimed to identify NP-associated changes in genes and pathways in L4 and L5 dorsal root ganglia (DRG) in a rat model of NP induced by chronic compression of the DRG (CCD). Genome-wide transcriptional analyses were used to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying NP. We screened differentially expressed genes (DEGs) 7 days after CCD in comparison with sham-operated controls. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and western blotting were used to confirm the presence of key DEGs. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG)-pathway analysis of DEGs and global signal transduction network analysis of DEGs were also conducted. The CCD group developed clear mechanical and thermal allodynia in the ipsilateral hind paw compared with the sham group. This comparison identified 1,887 DEGs, with 1156 upregulated and 731 downregulated DEGs, and 123 DEG-enriched pathways. We identified the key candidate genes that might play a role in the development of NP, namely syndecan 1 (Sdc1), phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase, catalytic subunit gamma (Pi3k), Janus kinase 2 (Jak2), jun proto-oncogene, AP-1 transcription factor subunit (Jun), and interleukin 6 (IL-6) by analyzing the global signal transduction network. RT-qPCR and western blot analysis confirmed the microarray results. The DEGs Sdc1, Pi3k, Jak2, Jun, and IL-6, and the cytokine signaling pathway, the neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction, the toll-like receptor signaling pathway, and the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway may have decisive modulatory roles in both nerve regeneration and NP. These results provide deeper insight into the mechanism underlying NP and promising therapeutic targets for its treatment.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Rbfox1 Is Expressed in the Mouse Brain in the Form of Multiple Transcript Variants and Contains Functional E Boxes in Its Alternative Promoters</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2020.00066</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The RNA-binding protein RBFOX1 is an important regulator of neuron development and neuronal excitability. Rbfox1 is a dosage-sensitive gene and in both mice and humans, decreased expression of Rbfox1 has been linked to neurodevelopmental disorders. Alternative promoters drive expression of Rbfox1 transcript isoforms that encode an identical protein. The tissue- and developmental stage-specific expression of these isoforms, as well as the underlying regulatory mechanisms, are, however, unclear. Here, we set out to capture all of the Rbfox1 transcript isoforms and identify transcriptional mechanisms that regulate brain-specific Rbfox1 expression. Isoform sequencing identified multiple alternative Rbfox1 transcript variants in the mouse cerebral cortex, including transcripts with novel first exons, alternatively spliced exons and 3′-truncations. Quantitative RT-PCR determined the expression of the alternative first exons in the developing cerebral cortex and different subregions of the juvenile brain. Alternative first exons were found to be highly stage- and subregion specific in their expression patterns suggesting that they fulfill specific functions during cortex development and in different brain regions. Using reporter assays we found that the promoter regions of the two first exons E1B and E1C/E1C.1 contain several functional E-boxes. Together, we provide an extensive picture of Rbfox1 isoform expression. We further identified important regulatory mechanisms that drive neuron-specific Rbfox1 expression. Thus, our study forms the basis for further research into the mechanisms that ensure physiological Rbfox1 expression in the brain. It also helps to understand why, in patients with neurodevelopmental disorders deletion of individual RBFOX1 transcript isoforms could affect brain function.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: The Delta-Opioid Receptor; a Target for the Treatment of Pain</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2020.00052</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Nowadays, pain represents one of the most important societal burdens. Current treatments are, however, too often ineffective and/or accompanied by debilitating unwanted effects for patients dealing with chronic pain. Indeed, the prototypical opioid morphine, as many other strong analgesics, shows harmful unwanted effects including respiratory depression and constipation, and also produces tolerance, physical dependence, and addiction. The urgency to develop novel treatments against pain while minimizing adverse effects is therefore crucial. Over the years, the delta-opioid receptor (DOP) has emerged as a promising target for the development of new pain therapies. Indeed, targeting DOP to treat chronic pain represents a timely alternative to existing drugs, given the weak unwanted effects spectrum of DOP agonists. Here, we review the current knowledge supporting a role for DOP and its agonists for the treatment of pain. More specifically, we will focus on the cellular and subcellular localization of DOP in the nervous system. We will also discuss in further detail the molecular and cellular mechanisms involved in controlling the cellular trafficking of DOP, known to differ significantly from most G protein-coupled receptors. This review article will allow a better understanding of how DOP represents a promising target to develop new treatments for pain management as well as where we stand as of our ability to control its cellular trafficking and cell surface expression.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Functional and Molecular Analysis of Proprioceptive Sensory Neuron Excitability in Mice</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2020.00036</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Neurons located in dorsal root ganglia (DRG) are crucial for transmitting peripheral sensations such as proprioception, touch, temperature, and nociception to the spinal cord before propagating these signals to higher brain structures. To date, difficulty in identifying modality-specific DRG neurons has limited our ability to study specific populations in detail. As the calcium-binding protein parvalbumin (PV) is a neurochemical marker for proprioceptive DRG cells we used a transgenic mouse line expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP) in PV positive DRGs, to study the functional and molecular properties of putative proprioceptive neurons. Immunolabeled DRGs showed a 100% overlap between GFP positive (GFP+) and PV positive cells, confirming the PVeGFP mouse accurately labeled PV neurons. Targeted patch-clamp recording from isolated GFP+ and GFP negative (GFP−) neurons showed the passive membrane properties of the two groups were similar, however, their active properties differed markedly. All GFP+ neurons fired a single spike in response to sustained current injection and their action potentials (APs) had faster rise times, lower thresholds and shorter half widths. A hyperpolarization-activated current (I&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;) was observed in all GFP+ neurons but was infrequently noted in the GFP− population (100% vs. 11%). For GFP+ neurons, I&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt; activation rates varied markedly, suggesting differences in the underlying hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated channel (HCN) subunit expression responsible for the current kinetics. Furthermore, quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) showed the HCN subunits 2, 1, and 4 mRNA (in that order) was more abundant in GFP+ neurons, while HCN 3 was more highly expressed in GFP− neurons. Likewise, immunolabeling confirmed HCN 1, 2, and 4 protein expression in GFP+ neurons. In summary, certain functional properties of GFP+ and GFP− cells differ markedly, providing evidence for modality-specific signaling between the two groups. However, the GFP+ DRG population demonstrates considerable internal heterogeneity when hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated channel (HCN channel) properties and subunit expression are considered. We propose this heterogeneity reflects the existence of different peripheral receptors such as tendon organs, muscle spindles or mechanoreceptors in the putative proprioceptive neuron population.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Integrative Neuroscience: Sensory Processing and Attention Profiles Among Children With Sensory Processing Disorders and Autism Spectrum Disorders</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnint.2020.00022</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;This study explores the differences in the profile of relationships between sensory processing and attention abilities among children with sensory processing disorder (SPD), autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and typically developing (TD) children. The Test of Everyday Attention for Children (TEA-Ch), a performance-based measure of attention, was administered to 69 children (TD: n = 24; SPD: n = 21; ASD: n = 24), ages 6–10 years. All participants’ parents completed the Short Sensory Profile (SSP), a standardized parent-report measure of sensory-related behaviors. Discriminant analyses using the TEA-Ch and the SSP domains revealed two classification functions; the first revealed that both clinical groups significantly differed from the TD group with greater sensory processing challenges in the categories of auditory filtering, under-responsive/seeks sensation, low energy/weak, and taste/smell sensitivity subscales of the SSP. The second function discriminated between the two clinical groups, indicating that children with ASD had significantly greater control and sustained attention deficits and less sensory issues than did children with SPD. Together, the two functions correctly classified 76.8% of the participants as to their group membership. The different profiles of sensory processing and attention abilities in children with SPD and ASD may provide guidance in identifying appropriate individualized therapeutic strategies for these children.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00446</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Neural responses of oddball tasks can be used as a physiological biomarker to evaluate the brain potential of information processing under the assumption that the differential contribution of deviant stimuli can be assessed accurately. Nevertheless, the non-stationarity of neural activity causes the brain networks to fluctuate hugely in time, deteriorating the estimation of pairwise synergies. To deal with the time variability of neural responses, we have developed a piecewise multi-subject analysis that is applied over a set of time intervals within the stationary assumption holds. To segment the whole stimulus-locked epoch into multiple temporal windows, we experimented with two approaches for piecewise segmentation of EEG recordings: a fixed time-window, at which the estimates of FC measures fulfill a given confidence level, and variable time-window, which is segmented at the change points of the time-varying classifier performance. Employing the weighted Phase Lock Index as a functional connectivity metric, we have presented the validation in a real-world EEG data, proving the effectiveness of variable time segmentation for connectivity extraction when combined with a supervised thresholding approach. Consequently, we performed a piecewise group-level analysis of electroencephalographic data that deals with non-stationary functional connectivity measures, evaluating more carefully the contribution of a link node-set in discriminating between the labeled oddball responses.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00415</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Phase contrast MRI (pcMRI) has been used to investigate flow pulsatility in cerebral arteries, larger cerebral veins, and the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Such measurements of intracranial pulsatility and compliance are beginning to inform understanding of the pathophysiology of conditions including normal pressure hydrocephalus, multiple sclerosis, and dementias. We demonstrate the presence of flow pulsatility in small cerebral cortical veins, for the first time using pcMRI at 7 T, with the aim of improving our understanding of the hemodynamics of this little-studied vascular compartment. A method for establishing where venous flow is pulsatile is introduced, revealing significant pulsatility in 116 out of 146 veins, across eight healthy participants, assessed in parietal and frontal regions. Distributions of pulsatility index (PI) and pulse waveform delay were characterized, indicating a small, but statistically significant (p &amp;lt; 0.05), delay of 59 ± 41 ms in cortical veins with respect to the superior sagittal sinus, but no differences between veins draining different arterial supply territories. Measurements of pulsatility in smaller cortical veins, a hitherto unstudied compartment closer to the capillary bed, could lead to a better understanding of intracranial compliance and cerebrovascular (patho)physiology.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00413</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Neural stem cells-based therapies have shown great potential for central nervous system regeneration, with three-dimensional (3D) culture systems representing a key technique for tissue engineering applications, as well as disease modeling and drug screenings. Self-assembling peptides (SAPs), providing biomimetic synthetic micro-environments regulating cellular functionality and tissue repair, constitute a suitable tool for the production of complex tissue-like structures in vitro. However, one of the most important drawbacks in 3D cultures, obtained via animal-derived substrates and serum-rich media, is the reproducibility and tunability of a standardized methodology capable to coax neural differentiation of different human cell lines. In this work we cultured four distinct human neural stem cell (hNSC) lines in 3D synthetic multifunctionalized hydrogel (named HYDROSAP) for up to 6 weeks. Three-dimensional cultures of differentiating hNSCs exhibited a progressive differentiation and maturation over time. All hNSCs-derived neurons in 3D culture system exhibited randomly organized entangled networks with increasing expression of GABAergic and glutamatergic phenotypes and presence of cholinergic ones. Oligodendrocytes formed insulating myelin sheaths positive for myelin basic protein (MBP). In summary, results demonstrated a successfully standardized and reproducible 3D cell culture system for hNSC differentiation and maturation in serum-free conditions useful for future therapies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroinformatics: Efficient Communication in Distributed Simulations of Spiking Neuronal Networks With Gap Junctions</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fninf.2020.00012</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Investigating the dynamics and function of large-scale spiking neuronal networks with realistic numbers of synapses is made possible today by state-of-the-art simulation code that scales to the largest contemporary supercomputers. However, simulations that involve electrical interactions, also called gap junctions, besides chemical synapses scale only poorly due to a communication scheme that collects global data on each compute node. In comparison to chemical synapses, gap junctions are far less abundant. To improve scalability we exploit this sparsity by integrating an existing framework for continuous interactions with a recently proposed directed communication scheme for spikes. Using a reference implementation in the NEST simulator we demonstrate excellent scalability of the integrated framework, accelerating large-scale simulations with gap junctions by more than an order of magnitude. This allows, for the first time, the efficient exploration of the interactions of chemical and electrical coupling in large-scale neuronal networks models with natural synapse density distributed across thousands of compute nodes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Three-Dimensional Explant Platform for Studies on Choroid Plexus Epithelium</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00108</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The choroid plexus (CP) plays a major role in controlling the entry of substances and immune cells into the brain as it forms the blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier (BCSFB) in the brain ventricles. Dysregulated immune cell trafficking through the epithelial cell (EC) layer of CP is central for the pathogenesis of infectious diseases in the brain and many neurodegenerative disorders. In vitro studies elucidating the function of the CP have so far been limited to the monolayer culture of CP ECs. To mimic immune cell migration across the CP barrier, a three-dimensional model would be advantageous. Here, we present an in vitro platform for studies of the immune cell trafficking based on CP explants/organoids. The explants were generated from fragments of mouse CPs in Matrigel, where the cells formed luminal spaces and could be maintained in culture for at least 8 weeks. We demonstrate expression of the major CP markers in the explants, including transthyretin and aquaporin 1 as well as ZO1 and ICAM-1, indicating a capacity for secretion of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and presence of tight junctions. CP explants displayed CP-like cell polarization and formed an intact EC barrier. We also show that the expression of transthyretin, transferrin, occludin and other genes associated with various functions of CP was maintained in the explants at similar levels as in native CP. By using dendritic cells and neutrophils, we show that the migration activity of immune cells and their interactions with CP epithelium can be monitored by microscopy. Thereby, the three-dimensional CP explant model can be used to study the cellular and molecular mechanisms mediating immune cell migration through CP epithelium and other functions of choroid EC. We propose this platform can potentially be used in the search for therapeutic targets and intervention strategies to improve control of (drug) substances and (immune) cell entry into the central nervous system.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Function of P2X4 Receptors Is Directly Modulated by a 1:1 Stoichiometric Interaction With 5-HT3A Receptors</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00106</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Interacting receptors at the neuronal plasma membrane represent an additional regulatory mode for intracellular transduction pathways. P2X4 receptor triggers fast neurotransmission responses via a transient increase in intracellular Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; levels. It has been proposed that the P2X4 receptor interacts with the 5-HT&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;A receptor in hippocampal neurons, but their binding stoichiometry and the role of P2X4 receptor activation by ATP on this crosstalking system remains unknown. Via pull-down assays, total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy measurements of the receptors colocalization and expression at the plasma membrane, and atomic force microscopy (AFM) imaging, we have demonstrated that P2X4/5-HT&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;A receptor complexes can interact with each other in a 1:1 stoichiometric manner that is preserved after ATP binding. Also, macromolecular docking followed by 100 ns molecular dynamics (MD) simulations suggested that the interaction energy of the P2X4 receptor with 5-HT&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;A receptor is similar at the holo and the apo state of the P2X4 receptor, and the interacting 5-HT&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;A receptor decreased the ATP binding energy of P2X4 receptor. Finally, the P2X4 receptor-dependent Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; mobilization is inhibited by the 5-HT&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;A interacting receptor. Altogether, these findings provide novel molecular insights into the allosteric regulation of P2X4/5-HT&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;A receptor complex in lipid bilayers of living cells via stoichiometric association, rather than accumulation or unspecific clustering of complexes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Disc1 Carrier Mice Exhibit Alterations in Neural pIGF-1Rβ and Related Kinase Expression</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00094</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Mutation of the disc1 gene underlies a broad range of developmental neuropsychiatric defects, including schizophrenia, depression, and bipolar disorder. The pathophysiological phenotypes linked with disc1 mutation are due to the truncation of the DISC1 primary protein structure. This leads to a defective post-synaptic scaffolding and kinase—GSK3β and Erk1/2—signaling. As a result, synaptic function and maintenance are significantly impaired in the disc1 mutant brain. Among several other pathways, GSK3β and Erk1/2 are involved in insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF-1Rβ) kinase signaling. Although disc1 mutation alters these kinases, it is unclear if the mutation impacts IGF-1R expression and activity in the brain. Here, we demonstrate that the expression of active IGF-1Rβ (pIGF-1Rβ) is altered in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex (PFC) of disc1 mutant mice and vary with the dose of the mutation (homozygous and heterozygous). The expression of pIGF-1Rβ decreased significantly in 129S (hom, disc1&lt;sup&gt;−/−&lt;/sup&gt;) brains. In contrast, 129S:B6 (het, disc1&lt;sup&gt;+/−&lt;/sup&gt;) brains were characterized by an increase in pIGF-1Rβ when compared with the C57BL/6 (disc1&lt;sup&gt;+/+&lt;/sup&gt;) level. The decrease in pIGF-1Rβ level for the 129S brains was accompanied by the loss of Akt activity (S473 pAkt) and decreased Ser9 phosphorylation of GSK3β (increased basal GSK3β). Additionally, hippocampal and cortical pErk1/2 activity increased in the 129S hippocampus and cortex. Although 129S:B6 recorded alterations in pIGF-1Rβ-pAkt-GSK3β (like 129S), there was no observable change in pErk1/2 activity for the heterozygote (disc1&lt;sup&gt;+/−&lt;/sup&gt;) mutant. In addition to GSK3β inhibition, we conclude that pIGF-1R, pAkt, and pErk1/2 are potential targets in disc1&lt;sup&gt;−/−&lt;/sup&gt; mutant brain. On the other hand, pIGF-1R and pAkt can be further explored in disc1&lt;sup&gt;+/−&lt;/sup&gt; brain.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Aging Reduces Estradiol Protection Against Neural but Not Metabolic Effects of Obesity in Female 3xTg-AD Mice</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00113</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Vulnerability to Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is increased by several risk factors, including midlife obesity, female sex, and the depletion of estrogens in women as a consequence of menopause. Conversely, estrogen-based hormone therapies have been linked with protection from age-related increases in adiposity and dementia risk, although treatment efficacy appears to be affected by the age of initiation. Potential interactions between obesity, AD, aging, and estrogen treatment are likely to have significant impact on optimizing the use of hormone therapies in postmenopausal women. In the current study, we compared how treatment with the primary estrogen, 17β-estradiol (E2), affects levels of AD-like neuropathology, behavioral impairment, and other neural and systemic effects of preexisting diet-induced obesity in female 3xTg-AD mice. Importantly, experiments were conducted at chronological ages associated with both the early and late stages of reproductive senescence. We observed that E2 treatment was generally associated with significantly improved metabolic outcomes, including reductions in body weight, adiposity, and leptin, across both age groups. Conversely, neural benefits of E2 in obese mice, including decreased β-amyloid burden, improved behavioral performance, and reduced microglial activation, were observed only in the early aging group. These results are consistent with the perspective that neural benefits of estrogen-based therapies require initiation of treatment during early rather than later phases of reproductive aging. Further, the discordance between E2 protection against systemic versus neural effects of obesity across age groups suggests that pathways other than general metabolic function, perhaps including reduced microglial activation, contribute to the mechanism(s) of the observed E2 actions. These findings reinforce the potential systemic and neural benefits of estrogen therapies against obesity, while also highlighting the critical role of aging as a mediator of estrogens’ protective actions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00111</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Reasoning requires initial encoding of the semantic association between premises or assumptions, retrieval of these semantic associations from memory, and recombination of information to draw a logical conclusion. Currently-held beliefs can interfere with the content of the assumptions if not congruent and inhibited. This study aimed to investigate the role of the hippocampus and hippocampal networks during logical reasoning tasks in which the congruence between currently-held beliefs and assumptions varies. Participants of younger and older age completed a series of syllogistic reasoning tasks in which two premises and one conclusion were presented and they were required to decide if the conclusion logically followed the premises. The belief load of premises was manipulated to be either congruent or incongruent with currently-held beliefs. Our whole-brain results showed that older adults recruited the hippocampus during the premise integration stage more than their younger counterparts. Functional connectivity using a hippocampal seed revealed that older, but not younger, adults recruited a hippocampal network that included anterior cingulate and inferior frontal regions when premises were believable. Importantly, this network contributed to better performance in believable inferences, only in older adults group. Further analyses suggested that, in older adults group, the integrity of the left cingulum bundle was associated with the higher rejection of believable premises more than unbelievable ones. Using multimodal imaging, this study highlights the importance of the hippocampus during premise integration and supports compensatory role of the hippocampal network during a logical reasoning task among older adults.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00109</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Cerebral small vessel disease (SVD) refers to a group of disease conditions affecting the cerebral small vessels, which include the small arteries, arterioles, capillaries, and postcapillary venules in the brain. SVD is the primary cause of vascular cognitive impairment and gait disturbances in aged people. There are several types of SVD, though arteriolosclerosis, which is mainly associated with hypertension, aging, and diabetes mellitus, and cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) comprise most SVD cases. The pathology of arteriolosclerosis-induced SVD is characterized by fibrinoid necrosis and lipohyalinosis, while CAA-associated SVD is characterized by progressive deposition of amyloid beta (Aβ) protein in the cerebral vessels. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been used for examination of SVD lesions; typical lesions are characterized by white matter hyperintensity, lacunar infarcts, enlargement of perivascular spaces (EPVS), microbleeds, cortical superficial siderosis (cSS), and cortical microinfarcts. The microvascular changes that occur in the small vessels are difficult to identify clearly; however, these consequent image findings can represent the SVD. There are two main strategies for prevention and treatment of SVD, i.e., pharmacotherapy and lifestyle modification. In this review, we discuss clinical features of SVD, experimental models replicating SVD, and treatments to further understand the pathological and clinical features of SVD.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00095</link>
	<content:encoded>Background&lt;p&gt;With recent technology, multivariate time-series electrocardiogram (ECG) analysis has played an important role in diagnosing cardiovascular diseases. However, discovering the association of wide range aging disease and chronic habit with ECG analysis still has room to be explored. This article mainly analyzes the possible relationship between common aging diseases or chorionic habits of medical record and ECG, such as diabetes, obesity, and hypertension, or the habit of smoking.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;In the research, we first conducted different ECG features, such as those of reduced binary pattern, waveform, and wavelet and then performed a k-means clustering analysis on the correlation between ECGs and the aforementioned diseases and habits, from which it is expected to find a firm association between them and the best characteristics that can be used for future research.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;In summary, we discovered a weak and strong evidence between ECG and medical records. For strong evidence, most patients with diabetes are always assigned into a specified group no matter the number of classes in the k-means clustering, which means we can find their association between them. For weak evidence, smokers, obesity, and hypertension have less unique ECG feature vector, enabling clustering them into specific groups, so the ECGs might be used to identify smokers, obesity, and hypertension. It is also interesting that we found obesity and hypertension, which are thought to be related to cardiovascular system. However, they are not highly correlated in our clustering analysis, which might indirectly tell us that the impact of obesity and hypertension to our body is various. In addition, the clustering effect of waveform feature is better than the other two methods.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Hydrogen peroxide is the preeminent chemical weapon that organisms use for combat. Individual cells rely on conserved defenses to prevent and repair peroxide-induced damage, but whether similar defenses might be coordinated across cells in animals remains poorly understood. Here, we identify a neuronal circuit in the nematode &lt;i&gt;Caenorhabditis elegans&lt;/i&gt; that processes information perceived by two sensory neurons to control the induction of hydrogen peroxide defenses in the organism. We found that catalases produced by &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt;, the nematode's food source, can deplete hydrogen peroxide from the local environment and thereby protect the nematodes. In the presence of &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt;, the nematode's neurons signal via TGFβ-insulin/IGF1 relay to target tissues to repress expression of catalases and other hydrogen peroxide defenses. This adaptive strategy is the first example of a multicellular organism modulating its defenses when it expects to freeload from the protection provided by molecularly orthologous defenses from another species.</content:encoded>

Whole-brain functional maps of anti-social isolated (lonely) fish were distinct from anti-social (loner) fish found in the normal population. These isolation-induced activity changes revealed profound disruption of neural activity in brain areas linked to social behaviour, social cue processing, and anxiety/stress. Several of the affected regions are modulated by serotonin, and we found that social preference in isolated fish could be rescued by acutely reducing serotonin levels.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/55185</link>
	<content:encoded>Breakthroughs in anti-tumor immunity have led to unprecedented advances in immunotherapy, yet it is now clear that the tumor microenvironment (TME) restrains immunity. T cells must substantially increase nutrient uptake to mount a proper immune response and failure to obtain sufficient nutrients or engage the appropriate metabolic pathways can alter or prevent effector T cell differentiation and function. The TME, however, can be metabolically hostile due to insufficient vascular exchange and cancer cell metabolism that leads to hypoxia, depletion of nutrients, and accumulation of waste products. Further, inhibitory receptors present in the TME can inhibit T cell metabolism and alter T cell signaling both directly and through release of extracellular vesicles such as exosomes. This review will discuss the metabolic changes that drive T cells into different stages of their development and how the TME imposes barriers to the metabolism and activity of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Biological aging is the gradual, progressive decline in system integrity that occurs with advancing chronological age, causing morbidity and disability. Measurements of the pace of aging are needed as surrogate endpoints in trials of therapies designed to prevent disease by slowing biological aging. We report a blood-DNA-methylation measure that is sensitive to variation in pace of biological aging among individuals born the same year. We first modeled change-over-time in 18 biomarkers tracking organ-system integrity across 12 years of follow-up in n=954 members of the Dunedin Study born in 1972-1973. Rates of change in each biomarker over ages 26-38 years were composited to form a measure of aging-related decline, termed Pace-of-Aging. Elastic-net regression was used to develop a DNA-methylation predictor of Pace-of-Aging, called DunedinPoAm for Dunedin(P)ace(o)f(A)ging(m)ethylation. Validation analysis in cohort studies and the CALERIE trial provide proof-of-principle for DunedinPoAm as a single-time-point measure of a person's pace of biological aging.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>We read jubmled wrods effortlessly, but the neural correlates of this remarkable ability remain poorly understood. We hypothesized that viewing a jumbled word activates a visual representation that is compared to known words. To test this hypothesis, we devised a purely visual model in which neurons tuned to letter shape respond to longer strings in a compositional manner by linearly summing letter responses. We found that dissimilarities between letter strings in this model can explain human performance on visual search, and responses to jumbled words in word reading tasks. Brain imaging revealed that viewing a string activates this letter-based code in the lateral occipital (LO) region and that subsequent comparisons to stored words are consistent with activations of the visual word form area (VWFA). Thus, a compositional neural code potentially contributes to efficient reading.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/54721</link>
	<content:encoded>Adaptation to nutrient availability is crucial for survival. Upon nutritional stress, such as during prolonged fasting or cold exposure, organisms need to balance the feeding of tissues and the maintenance of body temperature. The mechanisms that regulate the adaptation of brown adipose tissue (BAT), a key organ for non-shivering thermogenesis, to variations in nutritional state are not known. Here we report that specific deletion of the activin receptor ALK7 in BAT resulted in fasting-induced hypothermia due to exaggerated catabolic activity in brown adipocytes. After overnight fasting, BAT lacking ALK7 showed increased expression of genes responsive to nutrient stress, including the upstream regulator KLF15, aminoacid catabolizing enzymes, notably proline dehydrogenase (POX), and adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL), as well as markedly reduced lipid droplet size. In agreement with this, ligand stimulation of ALK7 suppressed POX and KLF15 expression in both mouse and human brown adipocytes. Treatment of mutant mice with the glucocorticoid receptor antagonist RU486 restored KLF15 and POX expression levels in mutant BAT, suggesting that loss of BAT ALK7 results in excessive activation of glucocorticoid signaling upon fasting. These results reveal a novel signaling pathway downstream of ALK7 which regulates the adaptation of BAT to nutrient availability by limiting nutrient stress-induced overactivation of catabolic responses in brown adipocytes.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/54257</link>
	<content:encoded>Age-associated sterile inflammation can cause dysregulated choroidal neovascularization (CNV) as age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Intraocular fluid screening of 234 AMD patients identified high levels of IL-4. The purpose of this study was to determine the functional role of IL-4 in CNV formation using murine CNV model. Our results indicate that the IL-4/IL-4 receptors (IL4Rs) controlled tube formation and global proangiogenic responses of bone marrow cells. CCR2&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; bone marrow cells were recruited to form very early CNV lesions. IL-4 rapidly induces CCL2, which enhances recruitment of CCR2&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; bone marrow cells. This in vivo communication, like quorum-sensing, was followed by the induction of IL-4 by the bone marrow cells during the formation of mature CNVs. For CNV development, IL-4 in bone marrow cells are critically required, and IL-4 directly promotes CNV formation mainly by IL-4R. The IL-4/IL-4Rα axis contributes to pathological angiogenesis through communications with bone marrow cells leading to retinal degeneration.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Invasive fungal infections cause 1.6 million deaths annually, primarily in immunocompromised individuals. Mortality rates are as high as 90% due to limited treatments. The azole class antifungal, fluconazole, is widely available and has multi-species activity but only inhibits growth instead of killing fungal cells, necessitating long treatments. To improve treatment, we used our novel high-throughput method, the overlap&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; method (O2M) to identify drugs that interact with fluconazole, either increasing or decreasing efficacy. We identified 40 molecules that act synergistically (amplify activity) and 19 molecules that act antagonistically (decrease efficacy) when combined with fluconazole. We found that critical frontline beta-lactam antibiotics antagonize fluconazole activity. A promising fluconazole-synergizing anticholinergic drug, dicyclomine, increases fungal cell permeability and inhibits nutrient intake when combined with fluconazole. In vivo, this combination doubled the time-to-endpoint of mice with &lt;i&gt;Cryptococcus neoformans&lt;/i&gt; meningitis. Thus, our ability to rapidly identify synergistic and antagonistic drug interactions can potentially alter the patient outcomes.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/53757</link>
	<content:encoded>Eukaryotic 5’−3’ mRNA decay plays important roles during development and in response to stress, regulating gene expression post-transcriptionally. In &lt;i&gt;Caenorhabditis elegans&lt;/i&gt;, deficiency of DCAP-1/DCP1, the essential co-factor of the major cytoplasmic mRNA decapping enzyme, impacts normal development, stress survival and ageing. Here, we show that overexpression of &lt;i&gt;dcap-1&lt;/i&gt; in neurons of worms is sufficient to increase lifespan through the function of the insulin/IGF-like signaling and its effector DAF-16/FOXO transcription factor. Neuronal DCAP-1 affects basal levels of INS-7, an ageing-related insulin-like peptide, which acts in the intestine to determine lifespan. Short-lived &lt;i&gt;dcap-1&lt;/i&gt; mutants exhibit a neurosecretion-dependent upregulation of intestinal &lt;i&gt;ins-7&lt;/i&gt; transcription, and diminished nuclear localization of DAF-16/FOXO. Moreover, neuronal overexpression of DCP1 in &lt;i&gt;Drosophila melanogaster&lt;/i&gt; confers longevity in adults, while neuronal DCP1 deficiency shortens lifespan and affects wing morphogenesis, cell non-autonomously. Our genetic analysis in two model-organisms suggests a critical and conserved function of DCAP-1/DCP1 in developmental events and lifespan modulation.</content:encoded>

A proteomics screen identified 14-3-3 as K14 interacting proteins. Follow-up studies showed that YAP1, a transcriptional effector of Hippo signaling regulated by 14-3-3sigma in skin keratinocytes, shows aberrant subcellular partitioning and function in differentiating &lt;i&gt;Krt14 &lt;/i&gt;C373A keratinocytes. Residue C373 in K14, which is conserved in a subset of keratins, is revealed as a novel regulator of keratin organization and YAP function in early differentiating keratinocytes, with an impact on cell mechanics, homeostasis and barrier function in epidermis.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: Controlling gene activation by enhancers through a drug-inducible topological insulator</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/47980</link>
	<content:encoded>While regulation of gene-enhancer interaction is intensively studied, its application remains limited. Here, we reconstituted arrays of CTCF-binding sites and devised a &lt;span class=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;s&lt;/span&gt;ynthetic &lt;span class=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;t&lt;/span&gt;opological &lt;span class=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;nsulator with &lt;span class=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;t&lt;/span&gt;etO for &lt;span class=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;ch&lt;/span&gt;romatin-engineering (STITCH). By coupling STITCH with tetR linked to the KRAB domain to induce heterochromatin and disable the insulation, we developed a drug-inducible system to control gene activation by enhancers. In human induced pluripotent stem cells, STITCH inserted between &lt;i&gt;MYC&lt;/i&gt; and the enhancer down-regulated &lt;i&gt;MYC.&lt;/i&gt; Progressive mutagenesis of STITCH led to a preferential escalation of the gene-enhancer interaction, corroborating the strong insulation ability of STITCH. STITCH also altered epigenetic states around &lt;i&gt;MYC&lt;/i&gt;. Time-course analysis by drug induction uncovered deposition and removal of H3K27me3 repressive marks follows and reflects, but does not precede and determine, the expression change. Finally, STITCH inserted near &lt;i&gt;NEUROG2&lt;/i&gt; impaired the gene activation in differentiating neural progenitor cells. Thus, STITCH should be broadly useful for functional genetic studies.</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Conservation laws by virtue of scale symmetries in neural systems</title>

In contrast to the symmetries of translation in space, rotation in space, and translation in time, the known laws of physics are not universally invariant under transformation of scale. However, a special case exists in which the action is scale invariant if it satisfies the following two constraints: 1) it must depend upon a scale-free Lagrangian, and 2) the Lagrangian must change under scale in the same way as the inverse time, 1t. Our contribution lies in the derivation of a generalised Lagrangian, in the form of a power series expansion, that satisfies these constraints. This generalised Lagrangian furnishes a normal form for dynamic causal models–state space models based upon differential equations–that can be used to distinguish scale symmetry from scale freeness in empirical data. We establish face validity with an analysis of simulated data, in which we show how scale symmetry can be identified and how the associated conserved quantities can be estimated in neuronal time series.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/YizQiAJ3cF0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Decoding the language of microbiomes using word-embedding techniques, and applications in inflammatory bowel disease</title>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Christine A. Tataru, Maude M. David&lt;/p&gt;

Microbiomes are complex ecological systems that play crucial roles in understanding natural phenomena from human disease to climate change. Especially in human gut microbiome studies, where collecting clinical samples can be arduous, the number of taxa considered in any one study often exceeds the number of samples ten to one hundred-fold. This discrepancy decreases the power of studies to identify meaningful differences between samples, increases the likelihood of false positive results, and subsequently limits reproducibility. Despite the vast collections of microbiome data already available, biome-specific patterns of microbial structure are not currently leveraged to inform studies. Here, we derive microbiome-level properties by applying an embedding algorithm to quantify taxon co-occurrence patterns in over 18,000 samples from the American Gut Project (AGP) microbiome crowdsourcing effort. We then compare the predictive power of models trained using properties, normalized taxonomic count data, and another commonly used dimensionality reduction method, Principal Component Analysis in categorizing samples from individuals with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and healthy controls. We show that predictive models trained using property data are the most accurate, robust, and generalizable, and that property-based models can be trained on one dataset and deployed on another with positive results. Furthermore, we find that properties correlate significantly with known metabolic pathways. Using these properties, we are able to extract known and new bacterial metabolic pathways associated with inflammatory bowel disease across two completely independent studies. By providing a set of pre-trained embeddings, we allow any V4 16S amplicon study to apply the publicly informed properties to increase the statistical power, reproducibility, and generalizability of analysis.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/a2nNMPsolNE&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

We present a flexible, open source R package designed to obtain biological and epidemiological insights from serological datasets. Characterising past exposures for multi-strain pathogens poses a specific statistical challenge: observed antibody responses measured in serological assays depend on multiple unobserved prior infections that produce cross-reactive antibody responses. We provide a general modelling framework to jointly infer infection histories and describe immune responses generated by these infections using antibody titres against current and historical strains. We do this by linking latent infection dynamics with a mechanistic model of antibody kinetics that generates expected antibody titres over time. Our aim is to provide a flexible package to identify infection histories that can be applied to a range of pathogens. We present two case studies to illustrate how our model can infer key immunological parameters, such as antibody titre boosting, waning and cross-reaction, as well as latent epidemiological processes such as attack rates and age-stratified infection risk.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/fu5dew9vVUk&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

It is difficult to predict how antibodies will behave when mixed together, even after each has been independently characterized. Here, we present a statistical mechanical model for the activity of antibody mixtures that accounts for whether pairs of antibodies bind to distinct or overlapping epitopes. This model requires measuring &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; individual antibodies and their n ( n - 1 ) 2 pairwise interactions to predict the 2&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt; potential combinations. We apply this model to epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) antibodies and find that the activity of antibody mixtures can be predicted without positing synergy at the molecular level. In addition, we demonstrate how the model can be used in reverse, where straightforward experiments measuring the activity of antibody mixtures can be used to infer the molecular interactions between antibodies. Lastly, we generalize this model to analyze engineered multidomain antibodies, where components of different antibodies are tethered together to form novel amalgams, and characterize how well it predicts recently designed influenza antibodies.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/kbknkvVoGHw&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Agent-based and continuous models of hopper bands for the Australian plague locust: How resource consumption mediates pulse formation and geometry</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/Whep4EkEAXI/article</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Andrew J. Bernoff, Michael Culshaw-Maurer, Rebecca A. Everett, Maryann E. Hohn, W. Christopher Strickland, Jasper Weinburd&lt;/p&gt;

Locusts are significant agricultural pests. Under favorable environmental conditions flightless juveniles may aggregate into coherent, aligned swarms referred to as hopper bands. These bands are often observed as a propagating wave having a dense front with rapidly decreasing density in the wake. A tantalizing and common observation is that these fronts slow and steepen in the presence of green vegetation. This suggests the collective motion of the band is mediated by resource consumption. Our goal is to model and quantify this effect. We focus on the Australian plague locust, for which excellent field and experimental data is available. Exploiting the alignment of locusts in hopper bands, we concentrate solely on the density variation perpendicular to the front. We develop two models in tandem; an agent-based model that tracks the position of individuals and a partial differential equation model that describes locust density. In both these models, locust are either stationary (and feeding) or moving. Resources decrease with feeding. The rate at which locusts transition between moving and stationary (and vice versa) is enhanced (diminished) by resource abundance. This effect proves essential to the formation, shape, and speed of locust hopper bands in our models. From the biological literature we estimate ranges for the ten input parameters of our models. Sobol sensitivity analysis yields insight into how the band’s collective characteristics vary with changes in the input parameters. By examining 4.4 million parameter combinations, we identify biologically consistent parameters that reproduce field observations. We thus demonstrate that resource-dependent behavior can explain the density distribution observed in locust hopper bands. This work suggests that feeding behaviors should be an intrinsic part of future modeling efforts.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Whep4EkEAXI&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Association test using Copy Number Profile Curves (CONCUR) enhances power in rare copy number variant analysis</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/rHLtXWDqKmY/article</link>

Copy number variants (CNVs) are the gain or loss of DNA segments in the genome that can vary in dosage and length. CNVs comprise a large proportion of variation in human genomes and impact health conditions. To detect rare CNV associations, kernel-based methods have been shown to be a powerful tool due to their flexibility in modeling the aggregate CNV effects, their ability to capture effects from different CNV features, and their accommodation of effect heterogeneity. To perform a kernel association test, a CNV locus needs to be defined so that locus-specific effects can be retained during aggregation. However, CNV loci are arbitrarily defined and different locus definitions can lead to different performance depending on the underlying effect patterns. In this work, we develop a new kernel-based test called CONCUR (i.e., copy number profile curve-based association test) that is free from a definition of locus and evaluates CNV-phenotype associations by comparing individuals’ copy number profiles across the genomic regions. CONCUR is built on the proposed concepts of “copy number profile curves” to describe the CNV profile of an individual, and the “common area under the curve (cAUC) kernel” to model the multi-feature CNV effects. The proposed method captures the effects of CNV dosage and length, accounts for the numerical nature of copy numbers, and accommodates between- and within-locus etiological heterogeneity without the need to define artificial CNV loci as required in current kernel methods. In a variety of simulation settings, CONCUR shows comparable or improved power over existing approaches. Real data analyses suggest that CONCUR is well powered to detect CNV effects in the Swedish Schizophrenia Study and the Taiwan Biobank.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/rHLtXWDqKmY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Many proteins have the potential to aggregate into amyloid fibrils, protein polymers associated with a wide range of human disorders such as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease. The thermodynamic stability of amyloid fibrils, in contrast to that of folded proteins, is not well understood: the balance between entropic and enthalpic terms, including the chain entropy and the hydrophobic effect, are poorly characterised. Using a combination of theory, &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; experiments, simulations of a coarse-grained protein model and meta-data analysis, we delineate the enthalpic and entropic contributions that dominate amyloid fibril elongation. Our prediction of a characteristic temperature-dependent enthalpic signature is confirmed by the performed calorimetric experiments and a meta-analysis over published data. From these results we are able to define the necessary conditions to observe cold denaturation of amyloid fibrils. Overall, we show that amyloid fibril elongation is associated with a negative heat capacity, the magnitude of which correlates closely with the hydrophobic surface area that is buried upon fibril formation, highlighting the importance of hydrophobicity for fibril stability.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/0cgiOtsbdUY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Robustness and parameter geography in post-translational modification systems</title>

Biological systems are acknowledged to be robust to perturbations but a rigorous understanding of this has been elusive. In a mathematical model, perturbations often exert their effect through parameters, so sizes and shapes of parametric regions offer an integrated global estimate of robustness. Here, we explore this “parameter geography” for bistability in post-translational modification (PTM) systems. We use the previously developed “linear framework” for timescale separation to describe the steady-states of a two-site PTM system as the solutions of two polynomial equations in two variables, with eight non-dimensional parameters. Importantly, this approach allows us to accommodate enzyme mechanisms of arbitrary complexity beyond the conventional Michaelis-Menten scheme, which unrealistically forbids product rebinding. We further use the numerical algebraic geometry tools Bertini, Paramotopy, and alphaCertified to statistically assess the solutions to these equations at ∼10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; parameter points in total. Subject to sampling limitations, we find no bistability when substrate amount is below a threshold relative to enzyme amounts. As substrate increases, the bistable region acquires 8-dimensional volume which increases in an apparently monotonic and sigmoidal manner towards saturation. The region remains connected but not convex, albeit with a high visibility ratio. Surprisingly, the saturating bistable region occupies a much smaller proportion of the sampling domain under mechanistic assumptions more realistic than the Michaelis-Menten scheme. We find that bistability is compromised by product rebinding and that unrealistic assumptions on enzyme mechanisms have obscured its parametric rarity. The apparent monotonic increase in volume of the bistable region remains perplexing because the region itself does not grow monotonically: parameter points can move back and forth between monostability and bistability. We suggest mathematical conjectures and questions arising from these findings. Advances in theory and software now permit insights into parameter geography to be uncovered by high-dimensional, data-centric analysis.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/2odOUeyZaqE&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Many scientific disciplines rely on computational methods for data analysis, model generation, and prediction. Implementing these methods is often accomplished by researchers with domain expertise but without formal training in software engineering or computer science. This arrangement has led to underappreciation of sustainability and maintainability of scientific software tools developed in academic environments. Some software tools have avoided this fate, including the scientific library Rosetta. We use this software and its community as a case study to show how modern software development can be accomplished successfully, irrespective of subject area. Rosetta is one of the largest software suites for macromolecular modeling, with 3.1 million lines of code and many state-of-the-art applications. Since the mid 1990s, the software has been developed collaboratively by the RosettaCommons, a community of academics from over 60 institutions worldwide with diverse backgrounds including chemistry, biology, physiology, physics, engineering, mathematics, and computer science. Developing this software suite has provided us with more than two decades of experience in how to effectively develop advanced scientific software in a global community with hundreds of contributors. Here we illustrate the functioning of this development community by addressing technical aspects (like version control, testing, and maintenance), community-building strategies, diversity efforts, software dissemination, and user support. We demonstrate how modern computational research can thrive in a distributed collaborative community. The practices described here are independent of subject area and can be readily adopted by other software development communities.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/-r4oTrychKM&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

&lt;i&gt;Plasmodium vivax&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;falciparum&lt;/i&gt;, the parasites responsible for most human malaria worldwide, exhibit striking biological differences, which have important clinical consequences. Unfortunately, &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;vivax&lt;/i&gt;, unlike &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;falciparum&lt;/i&gt;, cannot be cultivated continuously in vitro, which limits our understanding of its biology and, consequently, our ability to effectively control vivax malaria. Here, we describe single-cell gene expression profiles of 9,215 &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;vivax&lt;/i&gt; parasites from bloodstream infections of &lt;i&gt;Aotus&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Saimiri&lt;/i&gt; monkeys. Our results show that transcription of most &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;vivax&lt;/i&gt; genes occurs during short periods of the intraerythrocytic cycle and that this pattern of gene expression is conserved in other &lt;i&gt;Plasmodium&lt;/i&gt; species. However, we also identify a strikingly high proportion of species-specific transcripts in late schizonts, possibly associated with the specificity of erythrocyte invasion. Our findings provide new and robust markers of blood-stage parasites, including some that are specific to the elusive &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;vivax&lt;/i&gt; male gametocytes, and will be useful for analyzing gene expression data from laboratory and field samples.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/ssSM_xr9rPU&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Different Cortical Gyrification Patterns in Alzheimer's Disease and Impact on Memory Performance</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25741?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study of cortical gyrification in Alzheimer's disease (AD) could help to further understanding of the changes undergone in the brain during neurodegeneration. Here, we aimed to study brain gyrification differences between healthy controls (HC), mild cognitive impairment (MCI) patients, and AD patients, and explore how cerebral gyrification patterns were associated with memory and other cognitive functions.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We applied surface‐based morphometry techniques in 2 large, independent cross‐sectional samples, obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative project. Both samples, encompassing a total of 1,270 participants, were analyzed independently.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unexpectedly, we found that AD patients presented a more gyrificated entorhinal cortex than HC. Conversely, the insular cortex of AD patients was hypogyrificated. A decrease in the gyrification of the insular cortex was also found in older HC participants as compared with younger HC, which argues against the specificity of this finding in AD. However, an increased degree of folding of the insular cortex was specifically associated with better memory function and semantic fluency, only in AD patients. Overall, MCI patients presented an intermediate gyrification pattern. All these findings were consistently observed in the two samples.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The marked atrophy of the medial temporal lobe observed in AD patients may explain the increased folding of the entorhinal cortex. We additionally speculate regarding alternative mechanisms that may also alter its folding. The association between increased gyrification of the insular cortex and memory function, specifically observed in AD, could be suggestive of compensatory mechanisms to overcome the loss of memory function.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Premortem Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy Diagnoses in Professional Football</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25747?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;American‐style football (ASF) has gained attention because of possible links between repetitive head injury and neurodegenerative diseases. Although postmortem pathologic changes consistent with chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) have been reported in ASF players, there are currently no established premortem diagnostic criteria for CTE. Nevertheless, presented with symptoms of cognitive impairment, clinicians treating former players may be inclined to suggest CTE without a thorough exploration of comorbid factors that demonstrate similar clinical phenotypes to putative CTE.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A survey of 3,913 former ASF players aged 24 to 89 was conducted for those who responded by March 2019.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite being a postmortem diagnosis, 108 players (2.8%) self‐reported clinician‐diagnosed CTE. The percentage of players under age 60 years reporting a CTE diagnosis was 2.3% versus 3.7% in participants age 60 or older. Comorbidities in participants self‐reporting CTE were significantly more common, including sleep apnea, hypercholesterolemia, obesity, indicators of past or current depression, hypertension, prescription pain medication use, heart conditions, and low testosterone when compared to non‐CTE respondents. Patterns of reporting for obesity, hypertension, heart conditions, or hypercholesterolemia differed between older and younger participants. Cognitive impairment symptoms were significantly higher in participants self‐reporting CTE.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some former professional football players have been clinically diagnosed with CTE, a postmortem condition. Comorbidities that can affect cognition were associated with CTE diagnoses in both older and younger players. Although underlying neuropathology cannot be ruled out, treatable conditions should be explored in former athletes demonstrating CTE‐linked clinical phenotypes or symptoms as a means of improving cognitive health in these patients.

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: The sensory peripheral nervous system in the tail of a cephalochordate studied by serial blockface scanning electron microscopy</title>

	<content:encoded>&lt;img alt=&quot;The sensory peripheral nervous system in the tail of a cephalochordate studied by serial blockface scanning electron microscopy&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/c13914cf-e635-492c-8e6b-656c3c3af830/cne24913-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cephalochordates (amphioxus or lancelets) are basal in the phylum Chiordata and can exemplify the relatively simple developmental and anatomical starting conditions likely to have evolved into more complex vertebrate features. Here we use serial blockface scanning electron microscopy to reconstruct the sensory peripheral nervous system in the tail of a lancelet. The nerves (glial cell/neurite complexes) branch within the dermis and then exit to the epidermis to associate with the perikarya of two kinds of ciliated sensory neurons. The results indicate that cephalochordate neuroglia have an intramedullary origin. Moreover, we suggest that the peripheral nerves in the dermis are, at least in part, comparable to Rohon‐Beard cells of vertebrates, whereas, in contrast, the placode‐ and neural crest‐derived peripheral neurons of vertebrates are evolutionary novelties that appear to have supplanted the epidermal sensory receptors of cephalochordates.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Serial blockface scanning electron microscopy (SBSEM) is used to describe the sensory peripheral nervous system (PNS) in the tail of a cephalochordate, &lt;i&gt;Asymmetron lucayanum&lt;/i&gt;. The reconstructed region extends from the tail tip to the origin of the most posterior peripheral nerves from the dorsal nerve cord. As peripheral nerves ramify within the dermis, all the nuclei along their course belong to glial cells. Invaginations in the glial cell cytoplasm house the neurites, an association reminiscent of the nonmyelinated Schwann cells of vertebrates. Peripheral nerves pass from the dermis to the epidermis via small fenestrae in the sub‐epidermal collagen fibril layer; most nerves exit abruptly, but a few run obliquely within the collagen fibril layer for many micrometers before exiting. Within the epidermis, each nerve begins ramifying repeatedly, but the branches are too small to be followed to their tips with SBSEM at low magnification (previous studies on other cephalochordates indicate that the branches end freely or in association with epidermal sensory cells). In &lt;i&gt;Asymmetron&lt;/i&gt;, two morphological kinds of sensory cells are scattered in the epidermis, usually singly, but sometimes in pairs, evidently the recent progeny of a single precursor cell. The discussion considers the evolution of the sensory PNS in the phylum Chordata. In cephalochordates, Retzius bipolar neurons with intramedullary perikarya likely correspond to the Rohon‐Beard cells of vertebrates. However, extramedullary neurons originating from ventral epidermis in cephalochordates (and presumably in ancestral chordates) contrast with vertebrate sensory neurons, which arise from placodes and neural crest.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

&lt;p&gt;By combining intracortical electrical microstimulation (ICMS) with intrinsic optical imaging, we find that focal ICMS at single digit locations in monkey cortex (Areas 3a, 3b, 1, 2, and M1) reveals known anatomical connections. This novel method of studying cortical connections is in vivo, rapid, targeted, and mesoscale.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To map in vivo cortical circuitry at the mesoscale, we applied a novel approach to map interareal functional connectivity. Electrical intracortical microstimulation (ICMS) in conjunction with optical imaging of intrinsic signals (OIS) was used map functional connections in somatosensory cortical areas in anesthetized squirrel monkeys. ICMS produced activations that were focal and that displayed responses which were stimulation intensity dependent. ICMS in supragranular layers of Brodmann Areas 3b, 1, 2, 3a, and M1 evoked interareal activation patterns that were topographically appropriate and appeared consistent with known anatomical connectivity. Specifically, ICMS revealed Area 3b connections with Area 1; Area 1 connections with Areas 2 and 3a; Area 2 connections with Areas 1, 3a, and M1; Area 3a connections with Areas M1, 1, and 2; and M1 connections with Areas 3a, 1, and 2. These somatosensory connectivity patterns were reminiscent of feedforward patterns observed anatomically, although feedback contributions are also likely present. Further consistent with anatomical connectivity, intra‐areal and intra‐areal patterns of activation were patchy with patch sizes of 200–300 μm. In summary, ICMS with OIS is a novel approach for mapping interareal and intra‐areal connections in vivo. Comparisons with feedforward and feedback anatomical connectivity are discussed.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.00469</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Human brain connectome studies aim at extracting and analyzing relevant
features associated to pathologies of interest. Usually this consists in
modeling the brain connectome as a graph and in using graph metrics as
features. A fine brain description requires graph metrics computation at the
node level. Given the relatively reduced number of patients in standard
cohorts, such data analysis problems fall in the high-dimension low sample size
framework. In this context, our goal is to provide a machine learning technique
that exhibits flexibility, gives the investigator grip on the features and
covariates, allows visualization and exploration, and yields insight into the
data and the biological phenomena at stake. The retained approach is dimension
reduction in a manifold learning methodology, the originality lying in that one
(or several) reduced variables be chosen by the investigator. The proposed
method is illustrated on two studies, the first one addressing comatose
patients, the second one addressing young versus elderly population comparison.
The method sheds light on the graph metrics and underlying neurobiological
phenomena.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.00288</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Spiking Neural Networks (SNN) are energy-efficient computing architectures
that exchange spikes for processing information, unlike classical Artificial
Neural Networks (ANN). Due to this, SNNs are better suited for real-life
deployments. However, similar to ANNs, SNNs also benefit from deeper
architectures to obtain improved performance. Furthermore, like the deep ANNs,
the memory, compute and power requirements of SNNs also increase with model
size, and model compression becomes a necessity. Knowledge distillation is a
model compression technique that enables transferring the learning of a large
machine learning model to a smaller model with minimal loss in performance. In
this paper, we propose techniques for knowledge distillation in spiking neural
networks for the task of image classification. We present ways to distill
spikes from a larger SNN, also called the teacher network, to a smaller one,
also called the student network, while minimally impacting the classification
accuracy. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method with detailed
experiments on three standard datasets while proposing novel distillation
methodologies and loss functions. We also present a multi-stage knowledge
distillation technique for SNNs using an intermediate network to obtain higher
performance from the student network. Our approach is expected to open up new
avenues for deploying high performing large SNN models on resource-constrained
hardware platforms.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;LSTM language models have been shown to capture syntax-sensitive grammatical
dependencies such as subject-verb agreement with a high degree of accuracy
(Linzen et al., 2016, inter alia). However, questions remain regarding whether
they do so using spurious correlations, or whether they are truly able to match
verbs with their subjects. This paper argues for the latter hypothesis. Using
layer-wise relevance propagation (Bach et al., 2015), a technique that
quantifies the contributions of input features to model behavior, we show that
LSTM performance on number agreement is directly correlated with the model's
ability to distinguish subjects from other nouns. Our results suggest that LSTM
language models are able to infer robust representations of syntactic
dependencies.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Misfolding, aggregation and deposition of α-synuclein (α-syn) are major pathologic characteristics of Parkinson’s disease (PD) and the related synucleinopathy, multiple system atrophy (MSA). The spread of α-syn pathology across brain regions is thought to play a key role in the onset and progression of clinical phenotypes. Thus, there is increasing interest in developing strategies that target and attenuate α-syn aggregation and spread. Recent studies of brain-penetrating polyphenolic acids, namely, 3-hydroxybenzoic acid (3-HBA), 3,4-dihydroxybenzoic acid (3,4-diHBA), and 3-(3-hydroxyphenyl)propionic acid (3-HPPA) that are derived from gut microbiota metabolism of dietary polyphenols, show in vitro ability to effectively modulate α-syn misfolding, oligomerization, and mediate aggregated α-syn neurotoxicity. Here we investigate whether 3-HBA, 4-hydroxybenzoic acid (4-HBA), 3,4-diHBA, or 3-HPPA interfere with α-syn spreading in a cell-based system. Using HEK293 cells overexpressing α-syn-A53T-CFP/YFP, we assessed α-syn seeding activity using Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) to detect and quantify α-syn aggregation. We demonstrated that 3-HPPA, 3,4-diHBA, 3-HBA, and 4-HBA significantly attenuated intracellular α-syn seeding aggregation. To determine whether our compounds could inhibit brain-derived seeding activity, we utilized insoluble α-syn extracted from post-mortem MSA or PD brain specimens. We found that 3-HPPA effectively attenuated MSA-induced aggregation of monomer into high molecular weight aggregates capable of inducing intracellular aggregation. Outcomes from our studies suggest interactions between gut microbiome and certain dietary factors may form the basis for effective therapies that modulate pathologic α-syn propagation. Collectively, our findings provide the basis for future developments of probiotic, prebiotic, or synbiotic approaches for modulating the onset and/or progression of α-synucleinopathies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: Intravascular flow stimulates PKD2 (polycystin-2) channels in endothelial cells to reduce blood pressure</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/56655</link>
	<content:encoded>PKD2 (polycystin-2, TRPP1), a TRP polycystin channel, is expressed in endothelial cells (ECs), but its physiological functions in this cell type are unclear. Here, we generated inducible, EC-specific &lt;i&gt;Pkd2&lt;/i&gt; knockout mice to examine vascular functions of PKD2. Data show that a broad range of intravascular flow rates stimulate EC PKD2 channels, producing vasodilation. Flow-mediated PKD2 channel activation leads to calcium influx that activates SK/IK channels and eNOS serine 1176 phosphorylation in ECs. These signaling mechanisms produce arterial hyperpolarization and vasodilation. In contrast, EC PKD2 channels do not contribute to acetylcholine-induced vasodilation, suggesting stimulus-specific function. EC-specific PKD2 knockout elevated blood pressure in mice without altering cardiac function or kidney anatomy. These data demonstrate that flow stimulates PKD2 channels in ECs, leading to SK/IK channel and eNOS activation, hyperpolarization, vasodilation and a reduction in systemic blood pressure. Thus, PKD2 channels are a major component of functional flow sensing in the vasculature.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/56590</link>
	<content:encoded>Mechanisms regulating the turnover of synaptic vesicle (SV) proteins are not well understood. They are thought to require poly-ubiquitination and degradation through proteasome, endo-lysosomal or autophagy-related pathways. Bassoon was shown to negatively regulate presynaptic autophagy in part by scaffolding Atg5. Here, we show that increased autophagy in &lt;i&gt;Bassoon&lt;/i&gt; knockout neurons depends on poly-ubiquitination and that the loss of Bassoon leads to elevated levels of ubiquitinated synaptic proteins per se. Our data show that &lt;i&gt;Bassoon&lt;/i&gt; knockout neurons have a smaller SV pool size and a higher turnover rate as indicated by a younger pool of SV2. The E3 ligase Parkin is required for increased autophagy in &lt;i&gt;Bassoon&lt;/i&gt;-deficient neurons as the knockdown of &lt;i&gt;Parkin&lt;/i&gt; normalized autophagy and SV protein levels and rescued impaired SV recycling. These data indicate that Bassoon is a key regulator of SV proteostasis and that Parkin is a key E3 ligase in the autophagy-mediated clearance of SV proteins.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: Lipid accumulation controls the balance between surface connection and scission of caveolae</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/55038</link>
	<content:encoded>Caveolae are bulb-shaped invaginations of the plasma membrane (PM) that undergo scission and fusion at the cell surface and are enriched in specific lipids. However, the influence of lipid composition on caveolae surface stability is not well described or understood. Accordingly, we inserted specific lipids into the cell PM via membrane fusion and studied their acute effects on caveolae dynamics. We demonstrate that sphingomyelin stabilizes caveolae to the cell surface, while cholesterol and glycosphingolipids drive caveolae scission from the PM. Whilst all three lipids accumulated specifically in caveolae, cholesterol and sphingomyelin were actively sequestered, whereas glycosphingolipids diffused freely. The ATPase EHD2 restricts lipid diffusion and counteracts lipid-induced scission. We propose that specific lipid accumulation in caveolae generates an intrinsically unstable domain prone to scission if not restrained by EHD2 at the caveolae neck. This work provides a mechanistic link between caveolae and their ability to sense the PM lipid composition.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>What mechanisms underlie facial expression recognition? A popular hypothesis holds that efficient facial expression recognition cannot be achieved by visual analysis alone but additionally requires a mechanism of motor simulation — an unconscious, covert imitation of the observed facial postures and movements. Here, we first discuss why this hypothesis does not necessarily follow from extant empirical evidence. Next, we report experimental evidence against the central premise of this view: we demonstrate that individuals can achieve normotypical efficient facial expression recognition despite a congenital absence of relevant facial motor representations and, therefore, unaided by motor simulation. This underscores the need to reconsider the role of motor simulation in facial expression recognition.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: Intracellular calcium leak lowers glucose storage in human muscle, promoting hyperglycemia and diabetes</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/53999</link>
	<content:encoded>Most glucose is processed in muscle, for energy or glycogen stores. Malignant Hyperthermia Susceptibility (MHS) exemplifies muscle conditions that increase [Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;cytosol&lt;/sub&gt;. 42% of MHS patients have hyperglycemia. We show that phosphorylated glycogen phosphorylase (GP&lt;i&gt;a&lt;/i&gt;), glycogen synthase (GS&lt;i&gt;a&lt;/i&gt;) – respectively activated and inactivated by phosphorylation – and their Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-dependent kinase (PhK), are elevated in microsomal extracts from MHS patients' muscle. Glycogen and glucose transporter GLUT4 are decreased. [Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;cytosol&lt;/sub&gt;, increased to MHS levels, promoted GP phosphorylation. Imaging at ~100 nm resolution located GP&lt;i&gt;a&lt;/i&gt; at sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) junctional cisternae, and &lt;i&gt;apo&lt;/i&gt;-GP at Z disk. MHS muscle therefore has a wide-ranging alteration in glucose metabolism: high [Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;cytosol&lt;/sub&gt; activates PhK, which inhibits GS, activates GP and moves it toward the SR, favoring glycogenolysis. The alterations probably cause these patients' hyperglycemia. For basic studies, MHS emerges as a variable stressor, which forces glucose pathways from the normal to the diseased range, thereby exposing novel metabolic links.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/51322</link>
	<content:encoded>System neuroscience of motor cognition regarding the space beyond immediate reach mandates free, yet experimentally controlled movements. We present an experimental environment (Reach Cage) and a versatile visuo-haptic interaction system (&lt;i&gt;MaCaQuE&lt;/i&gt;) for investigating goal-directed whole-body movements of unrestrained monkeys. Two rhesus monkeys conducted instructed walk-and-reach movements towards targets flexibly positioned in the cage. We tracked 3D multi-joint arm and head movements using markerless motion capture. Movements show small trial-to-trial variability despite being unrestrained. We wirelessly recorded 192 broad-band neural signals from three cortical sensorimotor areas simultaneously. Single unit activity is selective for different reach and walk-and-reach movements. Walk-and-reach targets could be decoded from premotor and parietal but not motor cortical activity during movement planning. The Reach Cage allows systems-level sensorimotor neuroscience studies with full-body movements in a configurable 3D spatial setting with unrestrained monkeys. We conclude that the primate frontoparietal network encodes reach goals beyond immediate reach during movement planning.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: The effect of odor enrichment on olfactory acuity: Olfactometric testing in mice using two mirror-molecular pairs.</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.05.04.076604v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Intelligent systems in nature like the mammalian nervous system benefit from adaptable inputs that can tailor response profiles to their environment that varies in time and space. Study of such plasticity, in all its manifestations, forms a pillar of classical and modern neuroscience. This study is concerned with a novel form of plasticity in the olfactory system referred to as induction. In this process, subjects unable to smell a particular odor, or unable to differentiate similar odors, gain these abilities through mere exposure to the odor(s) over time without the need for attention or feedback (reward or punishment). However, few studies of induction have rigorously documented changes in olfactory threshold for the odor(s) used for &quot;enrichment.&quot; We trained 36 CD-1 mice in an operant-olfactometer (go/no go task) to discriminate a mixture of stereoisomers from a lone stereoisomer using two enantiomeric pairs: limonene and carvone. We also measured each subject's ability to detect one of the stereoisomers of each odor. In order to assess the effect of odor enrichment on enantiomer discrimination and detection, mice were exposed to both stereoisomers of limonene or carvone for 2 to 12 weeks. Enrichment was effected by adulterating the subject's food (passive enrichment) with one pair of enantiomers or by exposing them to the enantiomers in daily operant discrimination testing (active enrichment). We found that neither form of enrichment altered discrimination nor detection. And this result pertained using either within-subject or between-subject experimental designs. Unexpectedly, our threshold measurements were among the lowest ever recorded for any species, which we attributed to the relatively greater amount of practice (task replication) we allowed our mice compared to other reports. Interestingly, discrimination thresholds were no greater (limonene) or only modestly greater (carvone) from detection thresholds suggesting chiral-specific olfactory receptors determine thresholds for these compounds. The super-sensitivity of mice, shown in this study, to the limonene and carvone enantiomers, compared to the much lesser acuity of humans for these compounds, reported elsewhere, may resolve the mystery of why the former group with four-fold more olfactory receptors have tended, in previous studies, to have similar thresholds to the latter group. Finally, our results are consistent with the conclusion that supervised-perceptual learning i.e. that involving repeated feedback for correct and incorrect decisions, rather than induction, is the form of plasticity that allows animals to fully realize the capabilities of their olfactory system.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.05.04.076588v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Recent research has demonstrated that pupillometry is a robust measure for quantifying listening effort. However, pupillary responses in listening situations where multiple cognitive functions are engaged and sustained over a period of time remain hard to interpret. This limits our conceptualisation and understanding of listening effort in realistic situations, because rarely in everyday life are people challenged by one task at a time. Therefore, the purpose of this experiment was to reveal the dynamics of listening effort in a sustained listening condition using a word repeat and recall task. Words were presented in quiet and speech-shaped noise at different signal-to-noise ratios (SNR). Participants were presented with lists of 10 words, and required to repeat each word after its presentation. At the end of the list, participants either recalled as many words as possible or moved on to the next list. Simultaneously, their pupil dilation was recorded throughout the whole experiment. When only word repeating was required, peak pupil dilation (PPD) was bigger in 0dB versus other conditions; whereas when recall was required, PPD showed no difference among SNR levels and PPD in 0dB was smaller than repeat-only condition. Baseline pupil diameter and PPD followed different growth patterns across the 10 serial positions in conditions requiring recall: baseline pupil diameter built up progressively and plateaued in the later positions (but shot up at the onset of recall, i.e. the end of the list); PPD decreased at a pace quicker than in repeat-only condition. The current findings concur with the recent literature in showing that additional cognitive load during a speech intelligibility task could disturb the well-established relation between pupillary response and listening effort. Both the magnitude and temporal pattern of task-evoked pupillary response differ greatly in complex listening conditions, urging for more listening effort studies in complex and realistic listening situations.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.05.04.076539v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>{gamma}-secretase is an important protease complex responsible for the cleavage of over 100 substrates within their transmembrane domains. {gamma}-secretase acts in Alzheimer's disease by cleavage of AMYLOID BETA (A4) PRECURSOR PROTEIN to produce aggregation-prone Amyloid beta peptide. Other {gamma}-secretase substrates such as p75NTR are also relevant to Alzheimer's disease. How {gamma}-secretase cleavage site specificity is determined is still unclear. A previous study using Xenopus laevis to investigate the proteolytic processing of p75NTR and its homolog NRH1 found that transmembrane cleavage of NRH1 was not sensitive to the {gamma}-secretase inhibitor DAPT, suggesting that it is not processed by {gamma}-secretase. To investigate this further, we identified zebrafish orthologues of the genes p75 NTR and NRH1 and developed in vivo assays to assess cleavage of the resultant p75NTR and Nrh1 proteins. Our observations from these assays in zebrafish are consistent with the Xenopus laevis study. Inhibition of {gamma}-secretase by DAPT treatment results in accumulation of uncleaved p75NTR substrate, while cleavage of Nrh1 is not affected. This supports that p75NTR is cleaved by {gamma}-secretase while Nrh1 is cleaved by a separate {gamma}-secretase-like activity. We extended our approach by generating a chimeric Nrh1 protein in which the Nrh1 transmembrane domain was replaced by that of p75NTR, in an attempt to determine whether it is the p75NTR TMD that confers susceptibility for {gamma}-secretase cleavage. Our results from analysis of this chimeric protein revealed that the p75NTR transmembrane domain alone is insufficient to confer {gamma}-secretase cleavage susceptibility. This is not completely unexpected, as there is evidence to suggest that other factors are crucial for selection/cleavage by the {gamma}-secretase complex. We have established a system in which we can now attempt to dissect the structural basis for {gamma}-secretase cleavage specificity and evolution.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>The role of white matter fibers in reading has been established by diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), but DTI cannot identify specific microstructural features driving these relationships. Neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging (NODDI), inhomogeneous magnetization transfer (ihMT) and multicomponent driven equilibrium single-pulse observation of T1/T2 (mcDESPOT) can be used to link more specific aspects of white matter microstructure and reading due to their sensitivity to axonal packing and fiber coherence (NODDI) and myelin (ihMT and mcDESPOT). We applied principal component analysis (PCA) to combine DTI, NODDI, ihMT and mcDESPOT measures (10 in total), identify major features of white matter structure, and link these features to both reading and age. Analysis was performed for nine reading-related tracts in 46 neurotypical 6-16 year olds. We identified three principal components (PCs) which explained 79.5% of variance in our dataset. PC1 probed tissue complexity, PC2 described myelin and axonal packing, while PC3 was related to axonal diameter. Mixed effects models regressions did not identify any relationships between principal components and reading skill. Further Bayes factor analysis revealed that absence of relationships was not due to low power. PC1 suggested increases in tissue complexity with age in the left arcuate fasciculus, while PC2 suggested increases in myelin and axonal packing with age in the bilateral arcuate, inferior longitudinal, inferior fronto-occipital fasciculi, and splenium. Multimodal white matter imaging and PCA produce microstructurally informative, powerful principal components which can be used by future studies of development and cognition.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.05.04.076497v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>The full-body ownership illusion exploits multisensory perception to induce a feeling of ownership for an entire artificial body. Whilst previous research has shown that the synchronous visuotactile stimulation of a single body part is sufficient for illusory ownership over the whole body, the effect of combining multisensory stimulation across multiple body parts remains unknown. Therefore, 48 healthy adults participated in conditions of a full-body ownership illusion involving synchronous or asynchronous visuotactile stimulation to one, two or three body parts simultaneously (2 x 3 design). We developed a novel questionnaire to isolate the sense of ownership of five specific body parts (left leg, right leg, left arm, right arm, and trunk) from the full-body ownership experience and sought not only to test for greater (part and whole) body ownership in synchronous versus asynchronous stimulation, but also, potentially varying degrees of illusion intensity related to the number of body parts stimulated. As expected, illusory full-body ownership and all five body-part ownership ratings were significantly higher following synchronous stimulation (all p values [≤] .01). Since non-stimulated body parts also received significantly higher ownership ratings following synchronous stimulation, the results are consistent with an illusion engaging the entire body. We further noted that ownership ratings for the right body parts (often stimulated) were significantly higher than ownership ratings for the left body parts (never stimulated). Regarding explicit feelings of full-body ownership, subjective ratings were not significantly enhanced by increasing the number of synchronously stimulated body parts (synchronicity x number stimulated interaction; p .099). Instead, median ratings indicated a moderate affirmation (+1) of full-body illusory sensation for all three synchronous conditions; a finding mirrored by full-body illusion onset time. The results support the notion that feelings of full-body ownership are mediated by a generalisation from stimulated part(s)-to-whole, supported by processes related to multisensory body perception.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.05.04.076463v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Across many species, scream calls signal the affective significance of events to other agents. Scream calls were often supposed to be of generic alarming and fearful nature to signal potential threats including their instantaneous, involuntary, and accurate recognition by perceivers. However, scream calls are more diverse in their affective signaling nature than being limited to fearfully alarm a threat, and thus the broader sociobiological relevance of various scream types is unclear. Here we used four different psychoacoustic, perceptual decision-making, and neuroimaging experiments in humans to demonstrate, first, the existence of at least six generic and psycho-acoustically distinctive types of scream calls of both an alarming and a non-alarming nature, rather than being limited to only screams caused by fear or aggression. Second, based on perceptual and processing sensitivity measures for decision-making during scream recognition, we found that alarming screams (with some exceptions) were overall discriminated the worst, were responded to the slowest and were associated with the lower perceptual sensitivity for their recognition compared with non-alarm screams. Third, the neural processing of alarm compared with non-alarm screams during an implicit processing task elicited only minimal neural signal and connectivity in perceivers, contrary to the frequent assumption of a threat processing bias of the primate neural system. These findings show that scream calls are more diverse in their signaling and communicative nature in humans and that especially non-alarming screams, and positive screams in particular, seem to have higher efficiency in the cognitive, neural, and communicative processing in humans.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.05.03.075218v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Objective: There has recently been an increasing interest in local field potential (LFP) for brain-machine interface (BMI) applications due to its desirable properties (signal stability and low bandwidth). LFP is typically recorded with respect to a single unipolar reference which is susceptible to common noise. Several referencing schemes have been proposed to eliminate the common noise, such as bipolar reference, current source density (CSD), and common average reference (CAR). However, to date, there have not been any studies to investigate the impact of these referencing schemes on decoding performance of LFP-based BMIs. Approach: To address this issue, we comprehensively examined the impact of different referencing schemes and LFP features on the performance of hand kinematic decoding using a deep learning method. We used LFPs chronically recorded from the motor cortex area of a monkey while performing reaching tasks. Main results: Experimental results revealed that local motor potential (LMP) emerged as the most informative feature regardless of the referencing schemes. Using LMP as the feature, CAR was found to yield consistently better decoding performance than other referencing schemes over long-term recording sessions. Significance: Overall, our results suggest the potential use of LMP coupled with CAR for enhancing the decoding performance of LFP-based BMIs.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.05.03.074823v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Cortisol is considered the most fundamental stress hormone and is elevated in stress and multiple neuropsychiatric conditions. Prior studies have shown associations of plasma cortisol levels with total cerebral and hippocampal volumes and less consistently with the amygdala. Here, we extend our hypothesis to test associations of plasma cortisol with 1) ventricular 2) hippocampal and 3) amygdalar volumes, in two independent elderly cohorts across a broad cognitive spectrum ranging from normal cognition to Alzheimers disease. We demonstrate elevated cortisol to be associated with larger lateral ventricular volumes and smaller hippocampal volumes, predominantly in the right cerebral hemisphere, regardless of age, sex or cognitive status. We noted a non-significant trend of smaller amygdalar volumes with elevated cortisol. Our findings support smaller brain parenchyma volumes seen with elevated cortisol and may encourage effective strategies reducing cortisol and stress. They may also serve as imaging biomarkers for assessing therapeutic benefits of stress and cortisol lowering interventions aiming to halt or reverse the brain volume alterations and theoretically improve cognition and quality of life.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: α-Synuclein aggregation intermediates form fibril polymorphs with distinct prion-like properties</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.05.03.074765v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>-Synuclein (-Syn) amyloid fibrils in synucleinopathies (such as Parkinson's disease (PD), multiple system atrophy (MSA)) are structurally and functionally different, reminiscent of prion-like strains. However, how a single protein can form different fibril polymorphs in various synucleinopathies is not known. Here, we demonstrate the structure-function relationship of two distinct -Syn fibril polymorphs, the pre-matured fibrils (PMF) and helix-matured fibrils (HMF) based on -Syn aggregation intermediates. These polymorphs not only display the structural differences, including their fibril core structure as demonstrated by solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and H/D-exchange coupled with mass spectrometry but also possess different cellular activities such as seeding, cellular internalization, and cell-to-cell transmission. The HMF with a compact core structure exhibits low seeding potency in cells but readily internalizes and transmits from one cell to another. Whereas the less structured PMF lacks the cell-to-cell transmission ability but induces abundant -Syn pathology and triggers the formation of aggresomes in cells. Overall, the study highlights how the conformational heterogeneity in the aggregation pathway may lead to fibril polymorphs with distinct prion-like behavior in PD.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Criticality as a measure of developing proteinopathy in engineered human neural networks</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.05.03.074666v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>A patterned spread of proteinopathy represents a common characteristic of many neurodegenerative diseases. In Parkinson's disease (PD), misfolded forms of alpha-synuclein proteins aggregate and accumulate in hallmark pathological inclusions termed Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites, which seems to affect selectively vulnerable neuronal populations and propagate within interconnected neuronal networks. Research findings suggest that these proteinopathic inclusions are present at very early timepoints in disease development, even before strong behavioural symptoms of dysfunction arise, but that these underlying pathologies might be masked by homeostatic processes working to maintain the function of the degenerating neural circuits. This study investigates whether inducing the PD-related alpha-synuclein pathology in engineered human neural networks can be associated with changes in network function, and particularly with network criticality states. Self-organised criticality represents the critical point between resilience against perturbation and adaptational flexibility, which appears to be a functional trait in self-organising neural networks, both in vitro and in vivo. By monitoring the developing neural network activity through the use of multielectrode arrays (MEAs) for a period of three weeks following proteinopathy induction, we show that although this developing pathology is not clearly manifest in standard measurements of network function, it may be discerned by differences in network criticality states.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.05.03.074351v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Background: Though aberrant face processing is a hallmark of autistic spectrum disorder (ASD), findings on accompanying brain activity are divergent. Therefore, we conducted an activation likelihood estimation (ALE) meta-analysis of studies examining brain activity during face processing. Methods: We searched PubMed and PsycINFO using combinations of terms as fMRI, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Face Perception. Eligible studies reported on DSM-diagnosed ASD patients, compared to controls (HC), using face stimuli presented in fMRI and reporting whole-brain analysis coordinates. We compared two approaches: convergence of differences (primary analysis) using study-level coordinates from ASD vs. HC contrasts, and differences in convergence (secondary) pooling coordinates within each group separately, and contrasting the resultant ALE-maps. Results: Thirty-five studies (655 ASD and 668 HC) were included. Primary analysis identified a cluster in amygdala/parahippocampus where HC showed greater convergence of activation. Secondary analysis yielded no significant results. Conclusions: Results suggest that ASD dysfunction in face processing relies on structures involved in emotional processing rather than perception. We also demonstrate that the two ALE methodologies lead to divergent results.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Diverse GABAergic neurons organize into subtype-specific sublaminae in the ventral lateral geniculate nucleus</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.05.03.073197v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>In the visual system, retinal axons convey visual information from the outside world to dozens of distinct retinorecipient brain regions and organize that information at several levels, including either at the level of retinal afferents, cytoarchitecture of intrinsic retinorecipient neurons, or a combination of the two. Two major retinorecipient nuclei which are densely innervated by retinal axons are the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN), which is important for classical image-forming vision, and ventral LGN (vLGN), which is associated with non-image-forming vision. The neurochemistry, cytoarchitecture, and retinothalamic connectivity in vLGN remain unresolved, raising fundamental questions of how it receives and processes visual information. To shed light on these important questions, we labeled neurons in vLGN with canonical and novel cell type-specific markers and studied their spatial distribution and morphoelectric properties. Not only did we find a high percentage of cells in vLGN to be GABAergic, we discovered transcriptomically distinct GABAergic cell types reside in the two major laminae of vLGN, the retinorecipient, external vLGN (vLGNe) and the non-retinorecipient, internal vLGN (vLGNi). Within vLGNe, we identified transcriptionally distinct subtypes of GABAergic cells that are distributed into four adjacent sublaminae. Using trans-synaptic viral tracing and in vitro electrophysiology, we found cells in each these vLGNe sublaminae receive monosynaptic inputs from the retina. These results not only identify novel subtypes of GABAergic cells in vLGN, they suggest the subtype-specific laminar distribution of retinorecipient cells in vLGNe may be important for receiving, processing, and transmitting light-derived signals in parallel channels of the subcortical visual system.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Intra cortical microstimulation (ICMS) in the primary visual cortex (V1) can generate the visual perception of phosphenes and evoke saccades directed to the stimulated location in the retinotopic map. Although ICMS is widely used, little is known about the evoked spatio-temporal patterns of neural activity and their relation to neural responses evoked by visual stimuli or saccade generation. To investigate this, we combined ICMS with Voltage Sensitive Dye Imaging in V1 of behaving monkeys and measured neural activity at high spatial (meso-scale) and temporal resolution. Small visual stimuli and ICMS evoked population activity spreading over few mm that propagated to extrastriate areas. The population responses evoked by ICMS showed faster dynamics and different spatial propagation patterns. Neural activity was higher in trials w/saccades compared with trials w/o saccades. In conclusion, our results uncover the spatio-temporal patterns evoked by ICMS and their relation to visual processing and saccade generation.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Heterogeneity of EEG resting-state brain networks in absolute pitch</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.05.03.063206v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>The neural basis of absolute pitch (AP), the ability to effortlessly identify a musical tone without an external reference, is poorly understood. One of the key questions is whether perceptual or cognitive processes underlie the phenomenon as both sensory and higher-order brain regions have been associated with AP. One approach to elucidate the neural underpinnings of a specific expertise is the examination of resting-state networks. Thus, in this paper, we report a comprehensive functional network analysis of intracranial resting-state EEG data in a large sample of AP musicians (n = 54) and non-AP musicians (n = 51). We adopted two analysis approaches: First, we applied an ROI-based analysis to examine the connectivity between the auditory cortex and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) using several established functional connectivity measures. This analysis is a replication of a previous study which reported increased connectivity between these two regions in AP musicians. Second, we performed a whole-brain network-based analysis on the same functional connectivity measures to gain a more complete picture of the brain regions involved in a possibly large-scale network supporting AP ability. In our sample, the ROI-based analysis did not provide evidence for an AP-specific connectivity increase between the auditory cortex and the DLPFC. In contrast, the whole-brain analysis revealed three networks with increased connectivity in AP musicians comprising nodes in frontal, temporal, subcortical, and occipital areas. Commonalities of the networks were found in both sensory and higher-order brain regions of the perisylvian area. Further research will be needed to confirm these exploratory results.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.05.02.074450v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>The spinal cord is a cylinder structure in the vertebra and thought a simplified with the gray matter and white matter. Rexed lamination for the gray matter and regional sub-division for whiter matter are completely termed to date. Anterior commissure locates between the central canal and the anterior median fissure. However, some experimental data may still confront with new confined anatomical interpretation. By using NADPH diaphorase [N-d] enzyme histology, we found a vertical oriented neuronal pathway between the central canal and the anterior median fissure in the sacral spinal cord of young adult and aged dog. We used a term supra fissure area [SFA] to illustrate the region which consisted of the gray commissure and anterior white commissure. The N-d pathway was notably observable in aged animals. The vertical neurites revealed the cerebrospinal fluid [CSF] contacting neurites between the anterior median fissure and the central canal. We further examined the monkey, rat and pigeon in the region for better understanding of the structure and potential function. The neurodegeneration of N-d dystrophy was detected in the [SFA] in the thoracic spinal cord of the aged monkey. N-d positive fibers were detected in anterior fissure of the rat spinal cord. N-d fibrous structures were also detected in the pigeon spinal cord. These results suggested a new pathway of CSF contacting neurons and the neuronal communications about the central canal.</content:encoded>

&lt;p&gt;This review in memoriam of Jack Pettigrew provides an overview of research into the phenomenon of perceptual rivalry, across a wide variety of species including insects, fish, reptiles and primates. Perceptual rivalry is characterized by spontaneous alternations in perceptual state in response to ambiguous or conflicting sensory input.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This review in memoriam of Jack Pettigrew provides an overview of past and current research into the phenomenon of multistable perception across multiple animal species. Multistable perception is characterized by two or more perceptual interpretations spontaneously alternating, or rivalling, when animals are exposed to stimuli with inherent sensory ambiguity. There is a wide array of ambiguous stimuli across sensory modalities, ranging from the configural changes observed in simple line drawings, such as the famous Necker cube, to the alternating perception of entire visual scenes that can be instigated by interocular conflict. The latter phenomenon, called binocular rivalry, in particular caught the attention of the late Jack Pettigrew, who combined his interest in the neuronal basis of perception with a unique comparative biological approach that considered ambiguous sensation as a fundamental problem of sensory systems that has shaped the brain throughout evolution. Here, we examine the research findings on visual perceptual alternation and suppression in a wide variety of species including insects, fish, reptiles and primates. We highlight several interesting commonalities across species and behavioral indicators of perceptual alternation. In addition, we show how the comparative approach provides new avenues for understanding how the brain suppresses opposing sensory signals and generates alternations in perceptual dominance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike the geniculocortical pathway which interconnects only between the lateral geniculate nucleus and primary visual cortex (V1), the pulvinar has long been known to interconnect with most if not all of visual cortex. Here we show that pulvinar interconnectivity is actually more dominant with higher visual cortex (V2) than with V1. Thus, the pulvinocortical pathway does not likely play as big a role in directly modulating V1 activity as previously thought.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The extrageniculate visual pathway, which carries visual information from the retina through the superficial layers of the superior colliculus and the pulvinar, is poorly understood. The pulvinar is thought to modulate information flow between cortical areas, and has been implicated in cognitive tasks like directing visually guided actions. In order to better understand the underlying circuitry, we performed retrograde injections of modified rabies virus in the visual cortex and pulvinar of the Long‐Evans rat. We found a relatively small population of cells projecting to primary visual cortex (V1), compared to a much larger population projecting to higher visual cortex. Reciprocal corticothalamic projections showed a similar result, implying that pulvinar does not play as big a role in directly modulating rodent V1 activity as previously thought.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We comprehensively characterized 5‐HT‐immunoreactive (−ir) innervation throughout the brain of &lt;i&gt;Porichthys notatus&lt;/i&gt;, plainfin midshipman fish, including well‐delineated vocal and auditory nuclei. We report neuroanatomical heterogeneity in populations of the serotonergic raphe nuclei of the brainstem reticular formation, with three discrete subregions in the superior raphe, an intermediate 5‐HT‐ir cell cluster, and an extensive inferior raphe population. This comprehensive atlas offers new insights into the organization of 5‐HT nuclei in teleosts and provides neuroanatomical evidence for serotonin as a modulator of vocal‐acoustic circuitry and behavior in midshipman fish, consistent with findings in vocal tetrapods.

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Serotonin (5‐HT) is a modulator of neural circuitry underlying motor patterning, homeostatic control, and social behavior. While previous studies have described 5‐HT distribution in various teleosts, serotonergic raphe subgroups in fish are not well defined and therefore remain problematic for cross‐species comparisons. Here we used the plainfin midshipman fish, &lt;i&gt;Porichthys notatus&lt;/i&gt;, a well‐studied model for investigating the neural and hormonal mechanisms of vertebrate vocal‐acoustic communication, to redefine raphe subgroups based on both stringent neuroanatomical landmarks as well as quantitative cell measurements. In addition, we comprehensively characterized 5‐HT‐immunoreactive (−ir) innervation throughout the brain, including well‐delineated vocal and auditory nuclei. We report neuroanatomical heterogeneity in populations of the serotonergic raphe nuclei of the brainstem reticular formation, with three discrete subregions in the superior raphe, an intermediate 5‐HT‐ir cell cluster, and an extensive inferior raphe population. 5‐HT‐ir neurons were also observed within the vocal motor nucleus, forming putative contacts on those cells. In addition, three major 5‐HT‐ir cell groups were identified in the hypothalamus and one group in the pretectum. Significant 5‐HT‐ir innervation was found in components of the vocal pattern generator and cranial motor nuclei. All vocal midbrain nuclei showed considerable 5‐HT‐ir innervation, as did thalamic and hindbrain auditory and lateral line areas and vocal‐acoustic integration sites in the preoptic area and ventral telencephalon. This comprehensive atlas offers new insights into the organization of 5‐HT nuclei in teleosts and provides neuroanatomical evidence for serotonin as a modulator of vocal‐acoustic circuitry and behavior in midshipman fish, consistent with findings in vocal tetrapods.&lt;/p&gt;

	<content:encoded>We report here the identification of substrates of the depalmitoylating enzyme PPT1 by quantitative mass spectrometry. We first used a stringent Acyl Resin-Assisted Capture (Acyl RAC) screen in which PPT1 knockout (KO) mouse brain proteins showing increased in vivo palmitoylation are identified as putative PPT1 substrates. We then validated hits by directly depalmitoylating with PPT1 to confirm bona fide substrates. This novel two- step screen identified &amp;gt;100 substrates not previously known to be depalmitoylated by PPT1, including a wide range of channels/transporters, G-proteins, endo/exocytic components, synaptic adhesion molecules, and mitochondrial proteins. Interestingly, many sites of depalmitoylation on transmembrane proteins were located in extracellular domains facing the synaptic cleft. For this group of substrates, depalmitoylation appears to facilitate disulfide bond formation. Collectively, these diverse substrates may explain the many facets of CLN1 disease caused by the loss of PPT1 function.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.05.02.074104v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Extracellular recordings are typically analysed by separating them into two distinct signals: local field potentials (LFPs) and spikes. Understanding the relationship between these two signals is essential for gaining deeper insight into neuronal coding and information processing in the brain and is also relevant to brain-machine interface (BMI) research. Previous studies have shown that spikes, in the form of single-unit activity (SUA) or multiunit activity (MUA), can be inferred solely from LFPs with moderately good accuracy. These spiking activities that are typically extracted via threshold-based technique may not be reliable when the recordings exhibit a low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Another spiking activity in the form of a continuous signal, referred to as entire spiking activity (ESA), can be extracted by a threshold-less, fast, and automated technique and has led to better performance in several tasks. However, its relationship with the LFPs has not been investigated. In this study, we aim to address this issue by employing a deep learning method to infer ESA from LFPs intracortically recorded from the motor cortex area of two monkeys performing different tasks. Results from long-term recording sessions and across different tasks revealed that the inference accuracy of ESA yielded consistently and significantly higher accuracy than that of SUA and MUA. In addition, local motor potential (LMP) was found to be the most highly predictive feature compared to other LFP features. The overall results indicate that LFPs contain substantial information about the spikes, particularly ESA, which could be useful for the development of LFP-based BMIs. The results also suggest the potential use of ESA as an alternative neuronal population activity measure for analysing neural responses to stimuli or behavioural tasks.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.05.02.073999v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Neuropathic pain patients often experience innocuous cooling as excruciating pain. The cell and molecular basis of this cold allodynia is little understood. We used in vivo calcium imaging of sensory ganglia to investigate the activity of peripheral cold-sensing neurons in three mouse models of neuropathic pain: oxaliplatin-induced neuropathy, partial sciatic nerve ligation and ciguatera poisoning. In control mice, cold-sensing neurons were few in number and small in size. In neuropathic animals with cold allodynia, a set of normally silent large-diameter neurons became sensitive to cooling. Many silent cold-sensing neurons expressed the nociceptor markers NaV1.8 and CGRP. Ablating these neurons diminished cold allodynia. Blocking KV1 voltage-gated potassium channels was sufficient to trigger de novo cold sensitivity in silent cold-sensing neurons. Thus silent cold-sensing neurons are unmasked in diverse neuropathic pain states and cold allodynia results from peripheral sensitization caused by altered nociceptor excitability.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Enhanced FGFR3 activity in post-mitotic principal neurons during brain development results in cortical dysplasia and axon miswiring</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.05.02.073924v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abnormal levels of fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) and FGF receptors (FGFRs) have been detected in various neurological disorders. The potent impact of FGF-FGFR in multiple embryonic developmental processes makes it challenging to elucidate their roles in post-mitotic neurons. Taking an alternative approach, we directly examined the impact of aberrant FGFR function after neurogenesis by generating a FGFR gain-of-function (GOF) transgenic mouse which expresses constitutively activated FGFR3 (FGFR3K650E) in post-mitotic glutamatergic neurons. We found that enhanced FGFR activity in glutamatergic neurons results in abnormal radial migration and axonal miswiring. Regarding the lamination phenotype in GOF brains, we found later-born Cux1-positive neurons are dispersed throughout the GOF cortex. Such a cortical migration deficit is likely caused, at least in part, by a significant reduction of the radial processes normally projecting from the radial glia cells (RGCs). In addition, FGFR3 GOF also results in the misrouting of several long-range axonal projections, including the corpus callosum, anterior commissure, and postcommissural fornix. RNA-sequencing analysis of the GOF embryonic cortex reveals significant alterations in several pathways involved in cell cycle regulation and axonal pathfinding. Collectively, our results suggest that FGFR hyperfunction in post-mitotic neurons at the late embryonic stage result in cortical dysplasia and circuit miswiring.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.05.02.073825v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Working memory (WM) consists of two main components: sensory storage and central executive. We studied cortical oscillatory correlates of these two components in a large sample of 156 participants to assess separately the contribution of them to individual differences in WM. The participants were presented with WM tasks of above-average to high complexity. Some of the tasks required only storage in WM, others required storage and mental manipulations. Our data indicate a close relationship between frontal midline theta, central beta activity and the central executive component of WM. The oscillatory counterparts of the central executive determined individual differences in verbal WM performance. In contrast, alpha activity was not related to the individual differences. The results demonstrate that central executive component of WM, rather than sensory storage capacity, play the decisive role in individual WM capacity limits.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Drosophila insulin-like peptide 8 (DILP8) in ovarian follicle cells regulates ovulation and metabolism</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.05.02.073585v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>In Drosophila eight insulin-like peptides (DILP1-8) are encoded on separate genes. These DILPs are characterized by unique spatial and temporal expression patterns during the lifecycle. Whereas functions of several of the DILPs have been extensively investigated at different developmental stages, the role of DILP8 signaling is primarily known from larvae and pupae where it couples organ growth and developmental transitions. In adult female flies, a study showed that a specific set of neurons that express the DILP8 receptor, Lgr3, is involved in regulation of reproductive behavior. Here, we further investigated the expression of dilp8/DILP8 and Lgr3 in adult female flies and the functional role of DILP8 signaling. The only site where we found both dilp8 expression and DILP8 immunolabeling was in follicle cells of mature ovaries. Lgr3 expression was detected in numerous neurons in the brain and ventral nerve cord, a small set of peripheral neurons innervating the abdominal heart, as well as in a set of follicle cells close to the oviduct. Ovulation was affected in dilp8 mutants as well as after dilp8-RNAi using dilp8 and follicle cell Gal4 drivers. More eggs were retained in the ovaries and fewer were laid, indicating that DILP8 is important for ovulation. Our data suggest that DILP8 signals locally to Lgr3 expressing follicle cells as well as systemically to Lgr3 expressing efferent neurons in abdominal ganglia that innervate oviduct muscle. Thus, DILP8 may act at two targets to regulate ovulation: follicle cell rupture and oviduct contractions. Furthermore, we could show that manipulations of dilp8 expression affect food intake and starvation resistance. Possibly this reflects a feedback signaling between ovaries and the CNS that ensures nutrients for ovary development. In summary, it seems that DILP8 signaling in regulation of reproduction is an ancient function, conserved in relaxin signaling in mammals.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Causal roles of frontoparietal cortical areas in feedback control of the limb</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.05.02.072538v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Goal-directed motor corrections are surprisingly fast and complex, but little is known on how they are generated by the central nervous system. Here we show that temporary cooling of dorsal premotor cortex (PMd) or parietal area 5 (A5) in behaving monkeys caused impairments in corrective responses to mechanical perturbations of the forelimb. Deactivation of PMd impaired both spatial accuracy and response speed, whereas deactivation of A5 impaired spatial accuracy, but not response speed. Simulations based on optimal feedback control demonstrated that 'deactivation' of the control policy (reduction of feedback gain) impaired both spatial accuracy and response speed, whereas 'deactivation' in state estimation (reduction of Kalman gain) impaired spatial accuracy but not response speed, paralleling the impairments observed from deactivation of PMd and A5, respectively. Furthermore, combined deactivation of both cortical regions led to additive impairments of individual deactivations, whereas reducing the amount of cooling (i.e. milder cooling) to PMd led to impairments in response speed, but not spatial accuracy, both also predicted by the model simulations. These results provide causal support that higher order motor and somatosensory regions beyond primary somatosensory and primary motor cortex are involved in generating goal-directed motor responses. As well, the computational models suggest that the distinct patterns of impairments associated with these cortical regions reflect their unique functional roles in goal-directed feedback control.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.05.02.072363v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Two thirds of the 302 neurons in C. elegans form bilaterally symmetric pairs in its physical connectome, and similar gross morphological symmetries are seen in the nervous systems of many other animals. A central question is whether and how this morphological symmetry is broken to produce functional asymmetry. Addressing this question, in all but two cases, has been impossible because no promoters are known that can direct gene expression to a single cell within a symmetric pair. Here we develop an efficient genetic code expansion system in C. elegans and use this system to create a photo-activatable version of Cre recombinase. Using this system, we target single neurons within a bilaterally symmetric pair (PLMR and PLML) with a laser. This turns on Cre and thereby switches on expression of an optogenetic channel in a single cell. We hereby overcome the limitation that these neurons cannot be targeted by genetic means. Our approach enables the generation of large numbers of animals for downstream experiments. By globally illuminating groups of freely moving animals to stimulate the targeted neurons that express an optogenetic channel we dissect the individual contributions of PLMR and PLML to the C. elegans touch response. Our results reveal that the individual neurons make asymmetric contributions to this behaviour, and suggest distinct roles for PLMR and PLML in the habituation to repeated stimulation. Our results demonstrate how genetic code expansion and optical targeting can be combined to break the symmetry of neuron pairs in C. elegans and thereby dissect the contributions of individual neurons to behaviour.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.05.02.072215v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Intraocular pressure-sensitive retinal ganglion cell degeneration is a hallmark of glaucoma, the leading cause of irreversible blindness. Converging evidence indicates that age-related bioenergetic insufficiency increases the vulnerability of retinal ganglion cells to intraocular pressure. To investigate further, we used metabolomics and RNA-sequencing to examine early glaucoma in DBA/2J mice. We demonstrate an intraocular pressure-dependent decline in retinal pyruvate levels coupled to dysregulated glucose metabolism prior to detectable optic nerve degeneration. Oral supplementation of pyruvate strongly protected from neurodegeneration in pre-clinical models of glaucoma. We detected mTOR activation at the mechanistic nexus of neurodegeneration and metabolism. Rapamycin-induced inhibition of mTOR robustly prevented glaucomatous neurodegeneration. Bioenergetic enhancement, in combination with intraocular pressure reduction, therefore provides a readily translatable strategy that warrants investigation in clinical trials.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.05.02.064840v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Unilateral damage to the frontoparietal network typically impairs saccade target selection within the contralesional visual hemifield. Severity of deficits and the degree of recovery have been associated with widespread network dysfunction, yet it is not clear how these behavioural and functional changes relate with the underlying structural white matter pathways. Here, we investigated whether recovery after unilateral prefrontal cortex (PFC) lesions was associated with structural white matter remodeling in the distributed frontoparietal network. Diffusion-weighted MRI was acquired in four macaque monkeys before the lesions and at 2-4 months post-lesion, after recovery of deficits in saccade selection of contralesional targets. Probabilistic tractography was used to reconstruct inter- and intra-hemispheric frontoparietal fiber tracts: bilateral superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF) and transcallosal fibers connecting bilateral PFC or bilateral posterior parietal cortex (PPC). After behavioural recovery, tract-specific fractional anisotropy in contralesional SLF and transcallosal PPC increased after small lesions and decreased after larger lesions compared to pre-lesion. These findings indicate that remote fiber tracts may provide optimal compensation after small PFC lesions. However, larger lesions may have induced widespread structural damage and hindered compensatory remodeling in the structural frontoparietal network.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.05.01.073486v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Neuromodulation techniques such as Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) are a promising treatment for memory-related disorders including anxiety, addiction, and dementia. However, the outcome of these treatments appears to be paradoxical, as the use of these techniques can both disrupt and enhance memory even when applied to the same brain target. In this paper, we hypothesize that disruption and enhancement of memory through neuromodulation can be explained by the dropout of engram nodes. We used a convolutional neural network to classify handwritten digits and letters, applying dropout at different stages to simulate DBS effects on engrams. We showed that dropout applied during training improves the accuracy of prediction, whereas dropout applied during testing dramatically decreases accuracy of prediction, which mimics enhancement and disruption of memory, respectively. We further showed that transfer learning of neural networks with dropout had increased accuracy and rate of learning. Dropout during training provided a more robust skeleton network where transfer learning can be applied, mimicking the effects of chronic DBS on memory. Overall, we show that dropout of nodes can be a potential mechanism by which neuromodulation techniques such as DBS can both disrupt and enhance memory and provides a unique perspective on this paradox.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Overconsumption of palatable, energy dense food is considered a key driver of the obesity pandemic. The orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) is critical for reward valuation of gustatory signals, yet how the OFC adapts to obesogenic diets is poorly understood. Here we show that an impairment of astrocyte glutamate clearance following extended access to a cafeteria diet reduces GABA release onto layer II/III pyramidal neurons in the lateral OFC in rats. This decrease in GABA tone is due to an increase in extrasynaptic glutamate, which activates metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluR5) and liberates endocannabinoids. In obese rats, these synaptic impairments were rescued by the nutritional supplement, N-acetylcysteine, which restores glutamate homeostasis. Together, our findings indicate that obesity targets astrocytes to disrupt the delicate balance between excitatory and inhibitory transmission in the lateral OFC.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.05.01.073163v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Functional MRI (fMRI) study of naturalistic conditions, e.g. movie watching, usually focuses on shared responses across subjects. However, individual differences in the responses have been attracting increasing attention in search of group differences or associations with behavioral outcomes. The individual differences have been studied by directly modeling the cross-subject correlation matrix or projecting the relations into a 1-D space. We contend that it is critical to examine whether there are single or multiple consistent components of responses underlying the whole population, because multiple components may undermine the individual relations using the previous methods. We use principal component analysis (PCA) to examine the heterogeneity of brain responses across subjects in terms of the eigenvalues of the covariance matrix, and utilize this approach to study developmental trajectories and gender effects in a movie watching dataset. We identified several brain networks in the parietal cortex that showed a significant second principal component (PC) of regional responses, which were mainly represented the younger children. The second PCs in some networks, i.e. the supramarginal network, resembled a delayed version of the first PCs for 4 seconds (2 TR), indicating delayed responses in the younger children than the older children and adults. However, no apparent gender effects were found in the first and second PCs. The analyses highlight the importance of identifying multiple consistent responses underlying individual differences in responses to naturalistic stimuli. And the PCA-based approach could be complementary to the commonly used intersubject correlation analysis.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>In the rodent whisker system, it is well assumed that VPM and POm encode stimulations of the contralateral whisker pad. However, during tactile exploration usually whiskers are stimulated bilaterally. Accordingly, the integration of tactile information from the two sides of the body seems to be fundamental in the codification of these events. Here, to investigate whether POm could be able to codify these bilateral dynamics, whisker-evoked responses in this thalamic nucleus were examined by in vivo extracellular recordings in anesthetized rats using contralateral and ipsilateral stimuli. Strikingly, we found that POm is also able to respond to tactile stimulation of ipsilateral whiskers. Our findings reveal the implication of POm in the representation of bilateral tactile events by integrating simultaneous signals arising from both whisker pads and demonstrate the implication of the higher-order sensory thalamus in the codification of bilateral sensory events. This can have important implications in bilateral perceptual function.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.05.01.072926v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Exposure to drugs of abuse produces robust transcriptional and epigenetic reorganization within brain reward circuits that outlives the direct effects of the drug and may contribute to addiction. DNA methylation is a covalent epigenetic modification that is altered following stimulant exposure and is critical for behavioral and physiological adaptations to drugs of abuse. Although activity-related loss of DNA methylation requires the Gadd45 (Growth arrest and DNA-damage-inducible) gene family, very little is known about how this family regulates the activity of brain reward circuits or behavioral responses to drugs of abuse. Here, we combined genome-wide transcriptional profiling, pharmacological manipulations, electrophysiological measurements, and CRISPR tools with traditional knockout and behavioral approaches in rodent model systems to dissect the role of Gadd45b in dopamine-dependent epigenetic regulation and cocaine reward. We show that acute cocaine administration induces rapid upregulation of Gadd45b mRNA in the rat nucleus accumbens, and that knockout or site-specific CRISPR/Cas9 gene knockdown of Gadd45b blocks cocaine conditioned place preference. In vitro, dopamine treatment in primary striatal neurons increases Gadd45b mRNA expression through a dopamine receptor type 1 (DRD1)-dependent mechanism. Moreover, shRNA-induced Gadd45b knockdown decreases expression of genes involved in psychostimulant addiction, blocks induction of immediate early genes by DRD1 stimulation, and prevents DRD1-mediated changes in DNA methylation. Finally, we demonstrate that Gadd45b knockdown decreases striatal neuron action potential burst duration in vitro, without altering other electrophysiological characteristics. These results suggest that striatal Gadd45b functions as a dopamine-induced gene that is necessary for cocaine reward memory and DRD1-mediated transcriptional activity.</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Inference on dengue epidemics with Bayesian regime switching models</title>

Dengue, a mosquito-borne infectious disease caused by the dengue viruses, is present in many parts of the tropical and subtropical regions of the world. All four serotypes of dengue viruses are endemic in Singapore, an equatorial city-state. Frequent outbreaks occur, sometimes leading to national epidemics. However, few studies have attempted to characterize breakpoints which precede large rises in dengue case counts. In this paper, Bayesian regime switching (BRS) models were employed to infer epidemic and endemic regimes of dengue transmissions, each containing regime specific autoregressive processes which drive the growth and decline of dengue cases, estimated using a custom built multi-move Gibbs sampling algorithm. Posterior predictive checks indicate that BRS replicates temporal trends in Dengue transmissions well and nowcast accuracy assessed using a post-hoc classification scheme showed that BRS classification accuracy is robust even under limited data with the AUC-ROC at 0.935. LASSO-based regression and bootstrapping was used to account for plausibly high dimensions of climatic factors affecting Dengue transmissions, which was then estimated using cross-validation to conduct statistical inference on long-run climatic effects on the estimated regimes. BRS estimates epidemic and endemic regimes of dengue in Singapore which are characterized by persistence across time, lasting an average of 20 weeks and 66 weeks respectively, with a low probability of transitioning away from their regimes. Climate analysis with LASSO indicates that long-run climatic effects up to 20 weeks ago do not differentiate epidemic and endemic regimes. Lastly, by fitting BRS to simulated disease data generated from a stochastic Susceptible-Infected-Recovered model, mechanistic links between infectivity and regimes classified using BRS were provided. The model proposed could be applied to other localities and diseases under minimal data requirements where transmission counts over time are collected.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/01A53YC4CA4&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Intrinsic and Extrinsic Mechanisms of Thalamic Pathology in Multiple Sclerosis</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25743?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thalamic atrophy is among the earliest brain changes detected in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) and the degree of thalamic atrophy is a strong predictor of disability progression. The causes of thalamic atrophy are not fully understood. Here, we investigate the contributions of thalamic demyelinated lesions, thalamic neuronal loss, and cerebral white matter (WM) lesions to thalamic volume.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We used postmortem in situ magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans of 95 subjects with MS to correlate thalamic lesion volumes with global MRI metrics. We histologically characterized thalamic demyelination patterns and compared neuronal loss and neuritic pathology in the thalami with the extremes of volume.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Grossly apparent thalamic discolorations in cm‐thick brain slices were T2/fluid‐attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) hyperintense, T1‐hypointense, and appeared as perivascular demyelinated lesions with dystrophic neurons/axons. Subependymal demyelinated lesions with axonal loss and microglial/macrophage activation were also observed. The 12 subjects with the least thalamic volume had a 17.6% reduction of median neuronal density in the dorsomedial/ventrolateral and pulvinar nuclei compared with the 14 subjects with the greatest thalamic volume (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.03). After correcting for age, disease duration, sex, and T2 lesion volume, the total (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.20), ovoid (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.31), or subependymal (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.44) MRI thalamic lesion volumes correlated with thalamic volume. Thalamic volume correlated with cerebral T2 lesion volume (Spearman’s rho = −0.65, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.0001 after correcting for age, disease duration, and sex).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our findings suggest the degeneration of efferent/afferent thalamic projections and/or a neurodegenerative process as greater contributors to thalamic atrophy than thalamic demyelinating lesions. ANN NEUROL 2020&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

&lt;p&gt;This study describes the anatomy of a cell bridge (CB) variant consisting of the fusion of the mouse nodose ganglion (NG) and the superior cervical ganglion (SCG). This anastomosis was tubular‐shaped and significantly more prevalent in the ganglionic masses from males (38%) than females (21%). It contained a mixed of vagal afferents (blue, TH‐positive and Hand2‐ and isolectin B4‐negative; purple, TH‐ and Hand2‐negative and isolectin B4‐positive; grey, TH‐ and Hand2‐ and isolectin B4‐negative) and postganglionic sympathetic neurons (green,TH‐ and Hand2‐positive). The two populations of neurons abruptly replaced each other in the middle of the cell bridge. The practical implications of our observations are discussed with respect to studies of the mouse vagal afferents, an area of research of increasing popularity.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While autonomic ganglia have been extensively studied in rats instead of mice, there is renewed interest in the anatomy of the mouse autonomic nervous system. This study examined the prevalence and anatomical features of a cell bridge linking two autonomic ganglia of the neck, namely, the nodose ganglion (NG) and the superior cervical ganglion (SCG) in a cohort of C57BL/6J mice. We identified a cell bridge between the NG and the cranial pole of the SCG. This cell bridge was tubular‐shaped with an average length and width of 700 and 240 μm, respectively. The cell bridge was frequently unilateral and significantly more prevalent in the ganglionic masses from males (38%) than females (21%). On each of its extremities, it contained a mixed of vagal afferents and postganglionic sympathetic neurons. The two populations of neurons abruptly replaced each other in the middle of the cell bridge. We examined the mRNA expression for selected autonomic markers in samples of the NG with or without cell bridge. Our results indicated that the cell bridge was enriched in both markers of postganglionic sympathetic and vagal afferents neurons. Lastly, using FluoroGold microinjection into the NG, we found that the existence of a cell bridge may occasionally lead to the inadvertent contamination of the SCG. In summary, this study describes the anatomy of a cell bridge variant consisting of the fusion of the mouse NG and SCG. The practical implications of our observations are discussed with respect to studies of the mouse vagal afferents, an area of research of increasing popularity.&lt;/p&gt;

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.14942</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Machine learning, particularly in the form of deep learning, has driven most
of the recent fundamental developments in artificial intelligence. Deep
learning is based on computational models that are, to a certain extent,
bio-inspired, as they rely on networks of connected simple computing units
operating in parallel. Deep learning has been successfully applied in areas
such as object/pattern recognition, speech and natural language processing,
self-driving vehicles, intelligent self-diagnostics tools, autonomous robots,
knowledgeable personal assistants, and monitoring. These successes have been
mostly supported by three factors: availability of vast amounts of data,
continuous growth in computing power, and algorithmic innovations. The
approaching demise of Moore's law, and the consequent expected modest
improvements in computing power that can be achieved by scaling, raise the
question of whether the described progress will be slowed or halted due to
hardware limitations. This paper reviews the case for a novel beyond CMOS
hardware technology, memristors, as a potential solution for the implementation
of power-efficient in-memory computing, deep learning accelerators, and spiking
neural networks. Central themes are the reliance on non-von-Neumann computing
architectures and the need for developing tailored learning and inference
algorithms. To argue that lessons from biology can be useful in providing
directions for further progress in artificial intelligence, we briefly discuss
an example based reservoir computing. We conclude the review by speculating on
the big picture view of future neuromorphic and brain-inspired computing
systems.

	<title>eLife: Hfq CLASH uncovers sRNA-target interaction networks linked to nutrient availability adaptation</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/54655</link>
	<content:encoded>By shaping gene expression profiles, small RNAs (sRNAs) enable bacteria to efficiently adapt to changes in their environment. To better understand how &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; acclimatizes to nutrient availability, we performed UV cross-linking, ligation and sequencing of hybrids (CLASH) to uncover Hfq-associated RNA-RNA interactions at specific growth stages. We demonstrate that Hfq CLASH robustly captures &lt;i&gt;bona fide&lt;/i&gt; RNA-RNA interactions identified hundreds of novel sRNA base-pairing interactions, including many sRNA-sRNA interactions and involving 3'UTR-derived sRNAs. We rediscovered known and identified novel sRNA seed sequences. The sRNA-mRNA interactions identified by CLASH have strong base-pairing potential and are highly enriched for complementary sequence motifs, even those supported by only a few reads. Yet, steady state levels of most mRNA targets were not significantly affected upon over-expression of the sRNA regulator. Our results reinforce the idea that the reproducibility of the interaction, not base-pairing potential, is a stronger predictor for a regulatory outcome.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: A big-data approach to understanding metabolic rate and response to obesity in laboratory mice</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/53560</link>
	<content:encoded>Maintaining a healthy body weight requires an exquisite balance between energy intake and energy expenditure. To understand the genetic and environmental factors that contribute to the regulation of body weight, an important first step is to establish the normal range of metabolic values and primary sources contributing to variability. Energy metabolism is measured by powerful and sensitive indirect calorimetry devices. Analysis of nearly 10,000 wild-type mice from two large-scale experiments revealed that the largest variation in energy expenditure is due to body composition, ambient temperature, and institutional site of experimentation. We also analyze variation in 2,329 knockout strains and establish a reference for the magnitude of metabolic changes. Based on these findings, we provide suggestions for how best to design and conduct energy balance experiments in rodents. These recommendations will move us closer to the goal of a centralized physiological repository to foster transparency, rigor and reproducibility in metabolic physiology experimentation.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: Expansion microscopy of C. elegans</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/46249</link>
	<content:encoded>We recently developed expansion microscopy (ExM), which achieves nanoscale-precise imaging of specimens at ~70 nm resolution (with ~4.5x linear expansion) by isotropic swelling of chemically processed, hydrogel-embedded tissue. ExM of &lt;i&gt;C. elegans&lt;/i&gt; is challenged by its cuticle, which is stiff and impermeable to antibodies. Here we present a strategy, expansion of &lt;i&gt;C. elegans&lt;/i&gt; (ExCel), to expand fixed, intact &lt;i&gt;C. elegans&lt;/i&gt;. ExCel enables simultaneous readout of fluorescent proteins, RNA, DNA location, and anatomical structures at resolutions of ~65–75 nm (3.3–3.8x linear expansion). We also developed epitope-preserving ExCel, which enables imaging of endogenous proteins stained by antibodies, and iterative ExCel, which enables imaging of fluorescent proteins after 20x linear expansion. We demonstrate the utility of the ExCel toolbox for mapping synaptic proteins, for identifying previously unreported proteins at cell junctions, and for gene expression analysis in multiple individual neurons of the same animal.</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Tracheal branching in ants is area-decreasing, violating a central assumption of network transport models</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/VNpmP5-VtJc/article</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Ian J. Aitkenhead, Grant A. Duffy, Citsabehsan Devendran, Michael R. Kearney, Adrian Neild, Steven L. Chown&lt;/p&gt;

The structure of tubular transport networks is thought to underlie much of biological regularity, from individuals to ecosystems. A core assumption of transport network models is either area-preserving or area-increasing branching, such that the summed cross-sectional area of all child branches is equal to or greater than the cross-sectional area of their respective parent branch. For insects, the most diverse group of animals, the assumption of area-preserving branching of tracheae is, however, based on measurements of a single individual and an assumption of gas exchange by diffusion. Here we show that ants exhibit neither area-preserving nor area-increasing branching in their abdominal tracheal systems. We find for 20 species of ants that the sum of child tracheal cross-sectional areas is typically less than that of the parent branch (area-decreasing). The radius, rather than the area, of the parent branch is conserved across the sum of child branches. Interpretation of the tracheal system as one optimized for the release of carbon dioxide, while readily catering to oxygen demand, explains the branching pattern. Our results, together with widespread demonstration that gas exchange in insects includes, and is often dominated by, convection, indicate that for generality, network transport models must include consideration of systems with different architectures.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/VNpmP5-VtJc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Cells in microbial colonies integrate information across multiple spatial and temporal scales while sensing environmental cues. A number of photosynthetic cyanobacteria respond in a directional manner to incident light, resulting in the phototaxis of individual cells. Colonies of such bacteria exhibit large-scale changes in morphology, arising from cell-cell interactions, during phototaxis. These interactions occur through type IV pili-mediated physical contacts between cells, as well as through the secretion of complex polysaccharides (‘slime’) that facilitates cell motion. Here, we describe a computational model for such collective behaviour in colonies of the cyanobacterium &lt;i&gt;Synechocystis&lt;/i&gt;. The model is designed to replicate observations from recent experiments on the emergent response of the colonies to varied light regimes. It predicts the complex colony morphologies that arise as a result. We ask if changes in colony morphology during phototaxis can be used to infer if cells integrate information from multiple light sources simultaneously, or respond to these light sources separately at each instant of time. We find that these two scenarios cannot be distinguished from the shapes of colonies alone. However, we show that tracking the trajectories of individual cyanobacteria provides a way of determining their mode of response. Our model allows us to address the emergent nature of this class of collective bacterial motion, linking individual cell response to the dynamics of colony shape.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/KpgkhEb1cf0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Protein solubility is a key aspect for many biotechnological, biomedical and industrial processes, such as the production of active proteins and antibodies. In addition, understanding the molecular determinants of the solubility of proteins may be crucial to shed light on the molecular mechanisms of diseases caused by aggregation processes such as amyloidosis. Here we present SKADE, a novel Neural Network protein solubility predictor and we show how it can provide novel insight into the protein solubility mechanisms, thanks to its neural attention architecture. First, we show that SKADE positively compares with state of the art tools while using just the protein sequence as input. Then, thanks to the neural attention mechanism, we use SKADE to investigate the patterns learned during training and we analyse its decision process. We use this peculiarity to show that, while the attention profiles do not correlate with obvious sequence aspects such as biophysical properties of the aminoacids, they suggest that N- and C-termini are the most relevant regions for solubility prediction and are predictive for complex emergent properties such as aggregation-prone regions involved in beta-amyloidosis and contact density. Moreover, SKADE is able to identify mutations that increase or decrease the overall solubility of the protein, allowing it to be used to perform large scale in-silico mutagenesis of proteins in order to maximize their solubility.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/deKSGXkO29A&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Inferring a simple mechanism for alpha-blocking by fitting a neural population model to EEG spectra</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/o85Qi_mROIs/article</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Agus Hartoyo, Peter J. Cadusch, David T. J. Liley, Damien G. Hicks&lt;/p&gt;

Alpha blocking, a phenomenon where the alpha rhythm is reduced by attention to a visual, auditory, tactile or cognitive stimulus, is one of the most prominent features of human electroencephalography (EEG) signals. Here we identify a simple physiological mechanism by which opening of the eyes causes attenuation of the alpha rhythm. We fit a neural population model to EEG spectra from 82 subjects, each showing a different degree of alpha blocking upon opening of their eyes. Though it has been notoriously difficult to estimate parameters by fitting such models, we show how, by regularizing the differences in parameter estimates between eyes-closed and eyes-open states, we can reduce the uncertainties in these differences without significantly compromising fit quality. From this emerges a parsimonious explanation for the spectral differences between states: Changes to just a single parameter, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;ei&lt;/sub&gt;, corresponding to the strength of a tonic excitatory input to the inhibitory cortical population, are sufficient to explain the reduction in alpha rhythm upon opening of the eyes. We detect this by comparing the shift in each model parameter between eyes-closed and eyes-open states. Whereas changes in most parameters are weak or negligible and do not scale with the degree of alpha attenuation across subjects, the change in &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;ei&lt;/sub&gt; increases monotonically with the degree of alpha blocking observed. These results indicate that opening of the eyes reduces alpha activity by increasing external input to the inhibitory cortical population.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/o85Qi_mROIs&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Extensive evidence links &lt;i&gt;Glutamate receptor&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;ionotropic&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;NMDA2B&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;GRIN2B&lt;/i&gt;), encoding the GluN2B/NR2B subunit of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs), with various neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism spectrum disorders (ASDs), but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. In addition, it remains unknown whether mutations in GluN2B, which starts to be expressed early in development, induces early pathophysiology that can be corrected by early treatments for long-lasting effects. We generated and characterized &lt;i&gt;Grin2b&lt;/i&gt;-mutant mice that carry a heterozygous, ASD-risk C456Y mutation (&lt;i&gt;Grin2b&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+/C456Y&lt;/sup&gt;). In &lt;i&gt;Grin2b&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+/C456Y&lt;/sup&gt; mice, GluN2B protein levels were strongly reduced in association with decreased hippocampal NMDAR currents and NMDAR-dependent long-term depression (LTD) but unaltered long-term potentiation, indicative of mutation-induced protein degradation and LTD sensitivity. Behaviorally, &lt;i&gt;Grin2b&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+/C456Y&lt;/sup&gt; mice showed normal social interaction but exhibited abnormal anxiolytic-like behavior. Importantly, early, but not late, treatment of young &lt;i&gt;Grin2b&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+/C456Y&lt;/sup&gt; mice with the NMDAR agonist D-cycloserine rescued NMDAR currents and LTD in juvenile mice and improved anxiolytic-like behavior in adult mice. Therefore, GluN2B-C456Y haploinsufficiency decreases GluN2B protein levels, NMDAR-dependent LTD, and anxiety-like behavior, and early activation of NMDAR function has long-lasting effects on adult mouse behavior.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/p73rXGnuhRM&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Left Prefrontal Connectivity Links Subthalamic Stimulation with Depressive Symptoms</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25734?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation (STN‐DBS) in Parkinson's disease (PD) not only stimulates focal target structures but also affects distributed brain networks. The impact this network modulation has on non‐motor DBS effects is not well‐characterized. By focusing on the affective domain, we systematically investigate the impact of electrode placement and associated structural connectivity on changes in depressive symptoms following STN‐DBS, which have been reported to improve, worsen, or remain unchanged.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Depressive symptoms before and after STN‐DBS surgery were documented in 116 patients with PD from 3 DBS centers (Berlin, Queensland, and Cologne). Based on individual electrode reconstructions, the volumes of tissue activated (VTAs) were estimated and combined with normative connectome data to identify structural connections passing through VTAs. Berlin and Queensland cohorts formed a training and cross‐validation dataset used to identify structural connectivity explaining change in depressive symptoms. The Cologne data served as the test‐set for which depressive symptom change was predicted.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Structural connectivity was linked to depressive symptom change under STN‐DBS. An optimal connectivity map trained on the Berlin cohort could predict changes in depressive symptoms in Queensland patients and vice versa. Furthermore, the joint training‐set map predicted changes in depressive symptoms in the independent test‐set. Worsening of depressive symptoms was associated with left prefrontal connectivity.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fibers connecting the electrode with left prefrontal areas were associated with worsening of depressive symptoms. Our results suggest that for the left STN‐DBS lead, placement impacting fibers to left prefrontal areas should be avoided to maximize improvement of depressive symptoms.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Neurosurgical Intervention for Supratentorial Intracerebral Hemorrhage</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25732?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The effect of surgical treatment for supratentorial spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) and whether it is modified by key baseline characteristics and timing remains uncertain.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We performed a systematic review and meta‐analysis of randomized controlled trials of surgical treatment of supratentorial spontaneous ICH aimed at clot removal. We searched MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane databases up to February 21, 2019. Primary outcome was good functional outcome at follow‐up; secondary outcomes were death and serious adverse events. We analyzed all types of surgery combined and minimally invasive approaches separately. We pooled risk ratios with 95% confidence intervals and assessed the modifying effect of age, Glasgow Coma Scale, hematoma volume, and timing of surgery with meta‐regression analysis.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We included 21 studies with 4,145 patients; 4 (19%) were of the highest quality. Risk ratio of good functional outcome after any type of surgery was 1.40 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.22–1.60, &lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;2&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sup&gt; = 46%, 20 studies), and after minimally invasive surgery it was 1.47 (95% CI = 1.26–1.72, &lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;2&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sup&gt; = 47%, 12 studies). For death, the risk ratio for any type of surgery was 0.77 (95% CI = 0.68–0.85, &lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;2&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sup&gt; = 23%, 21 studies), and for minimally invasive surgery it was 0.68 (95% CI = 0.56–0.83, &lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;2&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sup&gt; = 14%, 13 studies). Serious adverse events were reported infrequently. Surgery seemed more effective when performed sooner after symptom onset (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.04, 12 studies). Age, Glasgow Coma Scale, and hematoma volume did not modify the effect of surgery.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Surgical treatment of supratentorial spontaneous ICH may be beneficial, in particular with minimally invasive procedures and when performed soon after symptom onset. Further well‐designed randomized trials are needed to demonstrate whether (minimally invasive) surgery improves functional outcome after ICH and to determine the optimal time window of the treatment after symptom onset.

&lt;h2&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Detailed anatomical maps of individual organs and entire animals have served as invaluable entry points for ensuing dissection of their evolution, development, and function. The pharynx of the nematode &lt;i&gt;Caenorhabditis elegans&lt;/i&gt; is a simple neuromuscular organ with a self‐contained, autonomously acting nervous system, composed of 20 neurons that fall into 14 anatomically distinct types. Using serial EM reconstruction, we re‐evaluate here the connectome of the pharyngeal nervous system, providing a novel and more detailed view of its structure and predicted function. Contrasting the previous classification of pharyngeal neurons into distinct inter‐ and motor neuron classes, we provide evidence that most pharyngeal neurons are also likely sensory neurons and most, if not all, pharyngeal neurons also classify as motor neurons. Together with the extensive cross‐connectivity among pharyngeal neurons, which is more widespread than previously realized, the sensory‐motor characteristics of most neurons define a shallow network architecture of the pharyngeal connectome. Network analysis reveals that the patterns of neuronal connections are organized into putative computational modules that reflect the known functional domains of the pharynx. Compared to the somatic nervous system, pharyngeal neurons both physically associate with a larger fraction of their neighbors and create synapses with a greater proportion of their neighbors. We speculate that the overall architecture of the pharyngeal nervous system may be reminiscent of the architecture of ancestral, primitive nervous systems.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Frontiers in Synaptic Neuroscience: Procedures for Culturing and Genetically Manipulating Murine Hippocampal Postnatal Neurons</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsyn.2020.00019</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Neuronal hippocampal cultures are simple and valuable models for studying neuronal function. While embryonic cultures are widely used for different applications, mouse postnatal cultures are still challenging, lack reproducibility and/or exhibit inappropriate neuronal activity. Yet, postnatal cultures have major advantages such as allowing genotyping of pups before culture and reducing the number of experimental animals. Herein we describe a simple and fast protocol for culturing and genetically manipulating hippocampal neurons from P0 to P3 mice. This protocol provides reproducible cultures exhibiting a consistent neuronal development, normal excitatory over inhibitory neuronal ratio and a physiological neuronal activity. We also describe simple and efficient procedures for genetic manipulation of neurons using transfection reagent or lentiviral particles. Overall, this method provides a detailed and validated protocol allowing to explore cellular mechanisms and neuronal activity in postnatal hippocampal neurons in culture.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Synaptic Neuroscience: Autaptic Cultures: Methods and Applications</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsyn.2020.00018</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Neurons typically form daisy chains of synaptic connections with other neurons, but they can also form synapses with themselves. Although such self-synapses, or autapses, are comparatively rare in vivo, they are surprisingly common in dissociated neuronal cultures. At first glance, autapses in culture seem like a mere curiosity. However, by providing a simple model system in which a single recording electrode gives simultaneous access to the pre- and postsynaptic compartments, autaptic cultures have proven to be invaluable in facilitating important and elegant experiments in the area of synaptic neuroscience. Here, I provide detailed protocols for preparing and recording from autaptic cultures (also called micro-island or microdot cultures). Variations on the basic procedure are presented, as well as practical tips for optimizing the outcomes. I also illustrate the utility of autaptic cultures by reviewing the types of experiments that have used them over the past three decades. These examples serve to highlight the power and elegance of this simple model system, and will hopefully inspire new experiments for the interrogation of synaptic function.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Synaptic Plasticity on Motoneurons After Axotomy: A Necessary Change in Paradigm</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2020.00068</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Motoneurons axotomized by peripheral nerve injuries experience profound changes in their synaptic inputs that are associated with a neuroinflammatory response that includes local microglia and astrocytes. This reaction is conserved across different types of motoneurons, injuries, and species, but also displays many unique features in each particular case. These reactions have been amply studied, but there is still a lack of knowledge on their functional significance and mechanisms. In this review article, we compiled data from many different fields to generate a comprehensive conceptual framework to best interpret past data and spawn new hypotheses and research. We propose that synaptic plasticity around axotomized motoneurons should be divided into two distinct processes. First, a rapid cell-autonomous, microglia-independent shedding of synapses from motoneuron cell bodies and proximal dendrites that is reversible after muscle reinnervation. Second, a slower mechanism that is microglia-dependent and permanently alters spinal cord circuitry by fully eliminating from the ventral horn the axon collaterals of peripherally injured and regenerating sensory Ia afferent proprioceptors. This removes this input from cell bodies and throughout the dendritic tree of axotomized motoneurons as well as from many other spinal neurons, thus reconfiguring ventral horn motor circuitries to function after regeneration without direct sensory feedback from muscle. This process is modulated by injury severity, suggesting a correlation with poor regeneration specificity due to sensory and motor axons targeting errors in the periphery that likely render Ia afferent connectivity in the ventral horn nonadaptive. In contrast, reversible synaptic changes on the cell bodies occur only while motoneurons are regenerating. This cell-autonomous process displays unique features according to motoneuron type and modulation by local microglia and astrocytes and generally results in a transient reduction of fast synaptic activity that is probably replaced by embryonic-like slow GABA depolarizations, proposed to relate to regenerative mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Integrative Neuroscience: Day-to-Day Test-Retest Reliability of EEG Profiles in Children With Autism Spectrum Disorder and Typical Development</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnint.2020.00021</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Biomarker development is currently a high priority in neurodevelopmental disorder research. For many types of biomarkers (particularly biomarkers of diagnosis), reliability over short periods is critically important. In the field of autism spectrum disorder (ASD), resting electroencephalography (EEG) power spectral densities (PSD) are well-studied for their potential as biomarkers. Classically, such data have been decomposed into pre-specified frequency bands (e.g., delta, theta, alpha, beta, and gamma). Recent technical advances, such as the Fitting Oscillations and One-Over-F (FOOOF) algorithm, allow for targeted characterization of the features that naturally emerge within an EEG PSD, permitting a more detailed characterization of the frequency band-agnostic shape of each individual’s EEG PSD. Here, using two resting EEGs collected a median of 6 days apart from 22 children with ASD and 25 typically developing (TD) controls during the Feasibility Visit of the Autism Biomarkers Consortium for Clinical Trials, we estimate test-retest reliability based on the characterization of the PSD shape in two ways: (1) Using the FOOOF algorithm we estimate six parameters (offset, slope, number of peaks, and amplitude, center frequency and bandwidth of the largest alpha peak) that characterize the shape of the EEG PSD; and (2) using nonparametric functional data analyses, we decompose the shape of the EEG PSD into a reduced set of basis functions that characterize individual power spectrum shapes. We show that individuals exhibit idiosyncratic PSD signatures that are stable over recording sessions using both characterizations. Our data show that EEG activity from a brief 2-min recording provides an efficient window into characterizing brain activity at the single-subject level with desirable psychometric characteristics that persist across different analytical decomposition methods. This is a necessary step towards analytical validation of biomarkers based on the EEG PSD and provides insights into parameters of the PSD that offer short-term reliability (and thus promise as potential biomarkers of trait or diagnosis) vs. those that are more variable over the short term (and thus may index state or other rapidly dynamic measures of brain function). Future research should address the longer-term stability of the PSD, for purposes such as monitoring development or response to treatment.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Paired Trial Classification: A Novel Deep Learning Technique for MVPA</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00417</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Many recent developments in machine learning have come from the field of “deep learning,” or the use of advanced neural network architectures and techniques. While these methods have produced state-of-the-art results and dominated research focus in many fields, such as image classification and natural language processing, they have not gained as much ground over standard multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) techniques in the classification of electroencephalography (EEG) or other human neuroscience datasets. The high dimensionality and large amounts of noise present in EEG data, coupled with the relatively low number of examples (trials) that can be reasonably obtained from a sample of human subjects, lead to difficulty training deep learning models. Even when a model successfully converges in training, significant overfitting can occur despite the presence of regularization techniques. To help alleviate these problems, we present a new method of “paired trial classification” that involves classifying pairs of EEG recordings as coming from the same class or different classes. This allows us to drastically increase the number of training examples, in a manner akin to but distinct from traditional data augmentation approaches, through the combinatorics of pairing trials. Moreover, paired trial classification still allows us to determine the true class of a novel example (trial) via a “dictionary” approach: compare the novel example to a group of known examples from each class, and determine the final class via summing the same/different decision values within each class. Since individual trials are noisy, this approach can be further improved by comparing a novel individual example with a “dictionary” in which each entry is an average of several examples (trials). Even further improvements can be realized in situations where multiple samples from a single unknown class can be averaged, thus permitting averaged signals to be compared with averaged signals.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Electric stimulators with precise and reliable outputs are an indispensable part of electrophysiological research. From single cells to deep brain or neuromuscular tissue, there are diverse targets for electrical stimulation. Even though commercial systems are available, we state the need for a low-cost, high precision, functional, and modular (hardware, firmware, and software) current stimulation system with the capacity to generate stable and complex waveforms for pre-clinical research. The system presented in this study is a USB controlled 4-channel modular current stimulator that can be expanded and generate biphasic arbitrary waveforms with 16-bit resolution, high temporal precision (μs), and passive charge balancing: the NES STiM (Neuro Electronic Systems Stimulator). We present a detailed description of the system’s structural design, the controlling software, reliability test, and the pre-clinical studies [deep brain stimulation (DBS) in hemi-PD rat model] in which it was utilized. The NES STiM has been tested with MacOS and Windows operating systems. Interfaces to MATLAB source codes are provided. The system is inexpensive, relatively easy to build and can be assembled quickly. We hope that the NES STiM will be used in a wide variety of neurological applications such as Functional Electrical Stimulation (FES), DBS and closed loop neurophysiological research.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00404</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Breast cancer is one of the most prevalent types of cancers worldwide and yet, its pathophysiology is poorly understood. Single-cell electrophysiological studies have provided evidence that membrane depolarization is implicated in the proliferation and metastasis of breast cancer. However, metastatic breast cancer cells are highly dynamic microscopic systems with complexities beyond a single-cell level. There is an urgent need for electrophysiological studies and technologies capable of decoding the intercellular signaling pathways and networks that control proliferation and metastasis, particularly at a population level. Hence, we present for the first time non-invasive in vitro electrical recordings of strongly metastatic MDA-MB-231 and weakly/non-metastatic MCF-7 breast cancer cell lines. To accomplish this, we fabricated an ultra-low noise sensor that exploits large-area electrodes, of 2 mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, which maximizes the double-layer capacitance and concomitant detection sensitivity. We show that the current recorded after adherence of the cells is dominated by the opening of voltage-gated sodium channels (VGSCs), confirmed by application of the highly specific inhibitor, tetrodotoxin (TTX). The electrical activity of MDA-MB-231 cells surpasses that of the MCF-7 cells, suggesting a link between the cells’ bioelectricity and invasiveness. We also recorded an activity pattern with characteristics similar to that of Random Telegraph Signal (RTS) noise. RTS patterns were less frequent than the asynchronous VGSC signals. The RTS noise power spectral density showed a Lorentzian shape, which revealed the presence of a low-frequency signal across MDA-MB-231 cell populations with propagation speeds of the same order as those reported for intercellular Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; waves. Our recording platform paves the way for real-time investigations of the bioelectricity of cancer cells, their ionic/pharmacological properties and relationship to metastatic potential.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The current study aimed to confirm whether probable rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (pRBD) is associated with a specific pattern of striatal dopamine depletion in an international, multicenter, prospective cohort of patients with Parkinson’s disease (PD). Two hundred and seventy de novo, drug-naïve patients with PD underwent dopamine transporter (DAT) single photon emission computed tomography with &lt;sup&gt;123&lt;/sup&gt;I-FP-CIT at baseline and 1, 2, and 4 years after the initial scan. The diagnosis of pRBD was based on the 10-item RBD Screening Questionnaire. Striatal DAT binding levels and their rates of decline were compared between patients with pRBD and those without. At baseline, patients in the PD-pRBD+ group showed lower striatal DAT binding in the caudate (which was more pronounced in the less-affected hemisphere) and in the putamen. During the 4-year follow-up, patients in the PD-pRBD+ group consistently exhibited greater DAT loss than patients in the PD-pRBD− group with comparable disease duration in all four striatal subregions. These patients also exhibited a more rapid decrease in DAT binding in the caudate and a less prominent interhemispheric asymmetry in the putamen. The distinct pattern of striatal DAT depletion may contribute to a more malignant phenotype of PD associated with RBD, specifically faster progression of motor symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Correcting Task fMRI Signals for Variability in Baseline CBF Improves BOLD-Behavior Relationships: A Feasibility Study in an Aging Model</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00336</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Blood Oxygen Level Dependent (BOLD) functional MRI is a complex neurovascular signal whose magnitude depends on baseline physiological factors such as cerebral blood flow (CBF). Because baseline CBF varies across the brain and is altered with aging, the interpretation of stand-alone aging-related BOLD changes can be misleading. The primary objective of this study was to develop a methodology that combines task fMRI and arterial spin labeling (ASL) techniques to sensitize task-induced BOLD activity by covarying out the baseline physiology (i.e., CBF) in an aging model. We recruited 11 younger and 13 older healthy participants who underwent ASL and an overt language fMRI task (semantic category member generation). We measured in-scanner language performance to investigate the effect of BOLD sensitization on BOLD-behavior relationships. The results demonstrate that our correction approach is effective at enhancing the specificity and sensitivity of the BOLD signal in both groups. In addition, the correction strengthens the statistical association between task BOLD activity and behavioral performance. Although CBF has inherent age dependence, our results show that retaining the age factor within CBF aides in greater sensitization of task fMRI signals. From a cognitive standpoint, compared to young adults, the older participants showed a delayed domain-general language-related task activity possibly due to compromised vessel compliance. Further, assessment of functional evolution of corrected BOLD activity revealed biphasic BOLD dynamics in both groups where BOLD deactivation may reflect greater semantic demand or increased premium on domain general executive functioning in response to task difficulty. Although it was promising to note that the predictability of behavior using the proposed methodology outperforms other methodologies (i.e., no correction and normalization by division), and provides moderate stability and adequate power, further work with a larger cohort and other task designs is necessary to improve the stability of predicting associated behavior. In summary, we recommend correction of task fMRI signals by covarying out baseline CBF especially when comparing groups with different neurovascular properties. Given that ASL and BOLD fMRI are well established and widely employed techniques, our proposed multi-modal methodology can be readily implemented into data processing pipelines to obtain more accurate BOLD activation maps.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00305</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Nanotechnology utilizes engineered materials and devices which function with biological systems at the molecular level and could transform the management of neurodegenerative diseases (NDs) by provoking, reacting to, and intermingling with target sites to stimulate physiological responses while minimizing side effects. Blood–brain barrier (BBB) protects the brain from harmful agents, and transporting drugs across the BBB is a major challenge for diagnosis, targeting, and treatment of NDs. The BBB provides severe limitations for diagnosis and treatment of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Parkinson’s disease (PD), and various other neurological diseases. Conventional drug delivery systems generally fail to cross the BBB, thus are inefficient in treatment. Although gradual development through research is ensuring the progress of nanotheranostic approaches from animal to human modeling, aspects of translational applicability and safety are a key concern. This demands a deep understanding of the interaction of body systems with nanomaterials. There are various plant-based nanobioactive compounds which are reported to have applicability in the diagnosis and treatment of these NDs. This review article provides an overview of applications of nanotheranostics in AD and PD. The review also discusses nano-enabled drug delivery systems and their current and potential applications for the treatment of various NDs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: The Pathophysiology of Degenerative Cervical Myelopathy and the Physiology of Recovery Following Decompression</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00138</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Background: Degenerative cervical myelopathy (DCM), also known as cervical spondylotic myelopathy is the leading cause of spinal cord compression in adults. The mainstay of treatment is surgical decompression, which leads to partial recovery of symptoms, however, long term prognosis of the condition remains poor. Despite advances in treatment methods, the underlying pathobiology is not well-known. A better understanding of the disease is therefore required for the development of treatments to improve outcomes following surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Objective: To systematically evaluate the pathophysiology of DCM and the mechanism underlying recovery following decompression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: A total of 13,808 published articles were identified in our systematic search of electronic databases (PUBMED, WEB OF SCIENCE). A total of 51 studies investigating the secondary injury mechanisms of DCM or physiology of recovery in animal models of disease underwent comprehensive review.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Forty-seven studies addressed the pathophysiology of DCM. Majority of the studies demonstrated evidence of neuronal loss following spinal cord compression. A number of studies provided further details of structural changes in neurons such as myelin damage and axon degeneration. The mechanisms of injury to cells included direct apoptosis and increased inflammation. Only four papers investigated the pathobiological changes that occur in spinal cords following decompression. One study demonstrated evidence of axonal plasticity following decompressive surgery. Another study demonstrated ischaemic-reperfusion injury following decompression, however this phenomenon was worse when decompression was delayed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: In preclinical studies, the pathophysiology of DCM has been poorly studied and a number of questions remain unanswered. The physiological changes seen in the decompressed spinal cord has not been widely investigated and it is paramount that researchers investigate the decompressed spinal cord further to enable the development of therapeutic tools, to enhance recovery following surgery.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroinformatics: EEG Signal Reconstruction Using a Generative Adversarial Network With Wasserstein Distance and Temporal-Spatial-Frequency Loss</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fninf.2020.00015</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Applications based on electroencephalography (EEG) signals suffer from the mutual contradiction of high classification performance vs. low cost. The nature of this contradiction makes EEG signal reconstruction with high sampling rates and sensitivity challenging. Conventional reconstruction algorithms lead to loss of the representative details of brain activity and suffer from remaining artifacts because such algorithms only aim to minimize the temporal mean-squared-error (MSE) under generic penalties. Instead of using temporal MSE according to conventional mathematical models, this paper introduces a novel reconstruction algorithm based on generative adversarial networks with the Wasserstein distance (WGAN) and a temporal-spatial-frequency (TSF-MSE) loss function. The carefully designed TSF-MSE-based loss function reconstructs signals by computing the MSE from time-series features, common spatial pattern features, and power spectral density features. Promising reconstruction and classification results are obtained from three motor-related EEG signal datasets with different sampling rates and sensitivities. Our proposed method significantly improves classification performances of EEG signals reconstructions with the same sensitivity and the average classification accuracy improvements of EEG signals reconstruction with different sensitivities. By introducing the WGAN reconstruction model with TSF-MSE loss function, the proposed method is beneficial for the requirements of high classification performance and low cost and is convenient for the design of high-performance brain computer interface systems.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP, ADCYAP1) dysregulation has been associated with multiple stress-related psychopathologies that may be related to altered hippocampal function. In coherence, PACAP- and PAC1 receptor (ADCYAP1R1)-null mice demonstrate changes in hippocampal-dependent behavioral responses, implicating the PACAPergic system function in this structure. Within the hippocampus, the dentate gyrus (DG) may play an important role in discerning the differences between similar contexts, and DG granule cells appear to both highly express PAC1 receptors and receive inputs from PACAP-expressing terminals. Here, we review the evidence from our laboratories and others that PACAP is an important regulator of activity within hippocampal circuits, particularly within the DG. These data are consistent with an increasing literature implicating PACAP circuits in stress-related pathologies such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and implicate the hippocampus, and in particular the DG, as a critical site in which PACAP dysregulation can alter stress-related behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Does Antenatal Betamethasone Alter White Matter Brain Development in Growth Restricted Fetal Sheep?</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00100</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Fetal growth restriction (FGR) is a common complication of pregnancy often associated with neurological impairments. Currently, there is no treatment for FGR, hence it is likely these babies will be delivered prematurely, thus being exposed to antenatal glucocorticoids. While there is no doubt that antenatal glucocorticoids reduce neonatal mortality and morbidities, their effects on the fetal brain, particularly in FGR babies, are less well recognized. We investigated the effects of both short- and long-term exposure to antenatal betamethasone treatment in both FGR and appropriately grown fetal sheep brains. Surgery was performed on pregnant Border-Leicester Merino crossbred ewes at 105–110 days gestation (term ~150 days) to induce FGR by single umbilical artery ligation (SUAL) or sham surgery. Ewes were then treated with a clinical dose of betamethasone (11.4 mg intramuscularly) or saline at 113 and 114 days gestation. Animals were euthanized at 115 days (48 h following the initial betamethasone administration) or 125 days (10 days following the initial dose of betamethasone) and fetal brains collected for analysis. FGR fetuses were significantly smaller than controls (115 days: 1.68 ± 0.11 kg vs. 1.99 ± 0.11 kg, 125 days: 2.70 ± 0.15 kg vs. 3.31 ± 0.20 kg, P &amp;lt; 0.001) and betamethasone treatment reduced body weight in both control (115 days: 1.64 ± 0.10 kg, 125 days: 2.53 ± 0.10 kg) and FGR fetuses (115 days: 1.41 ± 0.10 kg, 125 days: 2.16 ± 0.17 kg, P &amp;lt; 0.001). Brain: body weight ratios were significantly increased with FGR (P &amp;lt; 0.001) and betamethasone treatment (P = 0.002). Within the fetal brain, FGR reduced CNPase-positive myelin staining in the subcortical white matter (SCWM; P = 0.01) and corpus callosum (CC; P = 0.01), increased GFAP staining in the SCWM (P = 0.02) and reduced the number of Olig2 cells in the periventricular white matter (PVWM; P = 0.04). Betamethasone treatment significantly increased CNPase staining in the external capsule (EC; P = 0.02), reduced GFAP staining in the CC (P = 0.03) and increased Olig2 staining in the SCWM (P = 0.04). Here we show that FGR has progressive adverse effects on the fetal brain, particularly within the white matter. Betamethasone exacerbated growth restriction in the FGR offspring, but betamethasone did not worsen white matter brain injury.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00095</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;An intact gut epithelium preserves the immunological exclusion of “non-self” entities in the external environment of the gut lumen. Nonetheless, information flows continuously across this interface, with the host immune, endocrine, and neural systems all involved in monitoring the luminal environment of the gut. Both pathogenic and commensal gastrointestinal (GI) bacteria can modulate centrally-regulated behaviors and brain neurochemistry and, although the vagus nerve has been implicated in the microbiota-gut-brain signaling axis, the cellular and molecular machinery that facilitates this communication is unclear. Studies were carried out in healthy Sprague–Dawley rats to understand cross-barrier communication in the absence of disease. A novel colonic-nerve electrophysiological technique was used to examine gut-to-brain vagal signaling by bacterial products. Calcium imaging and immunofluorescent labeling were used to explore the activation of colonic submucosal neurons by bacterial products. The findings demonstrate that the neuromodulatory molecule, glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), secreted by colonic enteroendocrine L-cells in response to the bacterial metabolite, indole, stimulated colonic vagal afferent activity. At a local level indole modified the sensitivity of submucosal neurons to GLP-1. These findings elucidate a cellular mechanism by which sensory L-cells act as cross-barrier signal transducers between microbial products in the gut lumen and the host peripheral nervous system.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Opposite Roles of δ- and μ-Opioid Receptors in BACE1 Regulation and Alzheimer’s Injury</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00088</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is characterized by amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. Substantial evidence for AD pathogenesis suggests that β-site APP cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) and γ-secretase enzyme initiate the amyloidogenic pathway and produces toxic Aβ peptides that prone to aggregate in the brain. Therefore, the inhibition of BACE1 expression and function is an attractive strategy for AD therapy. In the present work, we made the first finding that activating δ-opioid receptors (DOR) with a specific DOR agonist significantly attenuated BACE1 expression and activity in the highly differentiated PC12 cells with mimicked AD injury, while the application of DOR inhibitor naltrindole reversed the UFP-512 effects, and even caused a major increase in BACE1 expression and activity as well as Aβ42 production in physiological conditions. Knocking-down DOR also enhanced BACE1 protein expression and its activity for APP processing, associating with a significant increase in Aβ42 production. In sharp contrast, activation of μ-opioid receptor (MOR) with DAMGO greatly promoted BACE1 expression and activity with an acceleration of APP cleavage, thus contributing to increased Aβ42 production. DADLE, a less selective DOR agonist that may bind to MOR, had no stable inhibitory effect on BACE1. Similar results were also found in APP mutant (APPswe) SH-SY5Y cell line, providing further validation of the DOR action on BACE1 regulation. Our novel data demonstrated entirely different roles of DOR and MOR in the regulation of BACE1 expression and activity with DOR being neuroprotective against AD injury. These findings provided a novel clue for new strategies of AD therapy via targeting endogenous opioid receptors.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

We show that the adaptor protein, SKAP2, is required for protection against &lt;i&gt;K. pneumoniae&lt;/i&gt; (ATCC 43816) pulmonary infections. &lt;i&gt;Skap2-/-&lt;/i&gt; mice had 100-fold higher bacterial burden when compared to wild-type and burden was controlled by SKAP2 expression in innate immune cells. &lt;i&gt;Skap2-/-&lt;/i&gt; neutrophils and monocytes were present in infected lungs, and the neutrophils degranulated normally in response to &lt;i&gt;K. pneumoniae &lt;/i&gt;infection in mice; however, &lt;i&gt;K. pneumoniae&lt;/i&gt;-stimulated reactive oxygen species (ROS) production &lt;i&gt;in vitro &lt;/i&gt;was abolished. &lt;i&gt;K. pneumoniae&lt;/i&gt;-induced neutrophil ROS response required the activity of SFKs, Syk, Btk, PLCg2, and PKCs. The loss of SKAP2 significantly hindered the &lt;i&gt;K. pneumoniae&lt;/i&gt;-induced phosphorylation of SFKs, Syk, and Pyk2 implicating SKAP2 as proximal to their activation in pathogen-signaling pathways. In conclusion, SKAP2-dependent signaling in neutrophils is essential for &lt;i&gt;K. pneumoniae&lt;/i&gt;-activated ROS production and for promoting bacterial clearance during infection.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: Yap-lin28a axis targets let7-Wnt pathway to restore progenitors for initiating regeneration</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/55771</link>
	<content:encoded>The sox2 expressing (sox2&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) progenitors in adult mammalian inner ear lose the capacity to regenerate while progenitors in the zebrafish lateral line are able to proliferate and regenerate damaged HCs throughout lifetime. To mimic the HC damage in mammals we have established a zebrafish severe injury model to eliminate both progenitors and HCs. The &lt;i&gt;atoh1a&lt;/i&gt; expressing (&lt;i&gt;atoh1a&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) HC precursors were the main population that survived post severe injury, and gained sox2 expression to initiate progenitor regeneration. In response to severe injury,&lt;i&gt; yap&lt;/i&gt; was activated to upregulate &lt;i&gt;lin28a&lt;/i&gt; transcription. Severe-injury-induced progenitor regeneration was disabled in &lt;i&gt;lin28a&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;yap&lt;/i&gt; mutants. In contrary, overexpression of &lt;i&gt;lin28a&lt;/i&gt; initiated the recovery of sox2&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; progenitors. Mechanistically, microRNA &lt;i&gt;let7 &lt;/i&gt;acted downstream of &lt;i&gt;lin28a&lt;/i&gt; to activate Wnt pathway for promoting regeneration. Our findings that lin28a is necessary and sufficient to regenerate the exhausted sox2+ progenitors shed light on restoration of progenitors to initiate HC regeneration in mammals.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: Principles of operation of a cerebellar learning circuit</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/55217</link>
	<content:encoded>We provide behavioral evidence using monkey smooth pursuit eye movements for four principles of cerebellar learning. Using a circuit-level model of the cerebellum, we link behavioral data to learning's neural implementation. The four principles are: (1) early, fast, acquisition driven by climbing fiber inputs to the cerebellar cortex, with poor retention; (2) learned responses of Purkinje cells guide transfer of learning from the cerebellar cortex to the deep cerebellar nucleus, with excellent retention; (3) functionally different neural signals are subject to learning in the cerebellar cortex versus the deep cerebellar nuclei; and (4) negative feedback from the cerebellum to the inferior olive reduces the magnitude of the teaching signal in climbing fibers and limits learning. Our circuit-level model, based on these four principles, explains behavioral data obtained by strategically manipulating the signals responsible for acquisition and recall of direction learning in smooth pursuit eye movements across multiple timescales.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: Effects of fluorescent glutamate indicators on neurotransmitter diffusion and uptake</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/54441</link>
	<content:encoded>Genetically encoded fluorescent glutamate indicators (iGluSnFRs) enable neurotransmitter release and diffusion to be visualized in intact tissue. Synaptic iGluSnFR signal time courses vary widely depending on experimental conditions, often lasting 10-100 times longer than the extracellular lifetime of synaptically released glutamate estimated with uptake measurements. iGluSnFR signals typically also decay much more slowly than the unbinding kinetics of the indicator. To resolve these discrepancies, here we have modeled synaptic glutamate diffusion, uptake and iGluSnFR activation to identify factors influencing iGluSnFR signal waveforms. Simulations suggested that iGluSnFR competes with transporters to bind synaptically released glutamate, delaying glutamate uptake. Accordingly, synaptic transporter currents recorded from iGluSnFR-expressing astrocytes in mouse cortex were slower than those in control astrocytes. Simulations also suggested that iGluSnFR reduces free glutamate levels in extrasynaptic spaces, likely limiting extrasynaptic receptor activation. iGluSnFR and lower-affinity variants nonetheless provide linear indications of vesicle release, underscoring their value for optical quantal analysis.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: DASC, a sensitive classifier for measuring discrete early stages in clathrin-mediated endocytosis</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/53686</link>
	<content:encoded>Clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) in mammalian cells is driven by resilient machinery that includes &amp;gt;70 endocytic accessory proteins (EAP). Accordingly, perturbation of individual EAPs often results in minor effects on biochemical measurements of CME, thus providing inconclusive/misleading information regarding EAP function. Live-cell imaging can detect earlier roles of EAPs preceding cargo internalization; however, this approach has been limited because unambiguously distinguishing abortive coats (ACs) from &lt;i&gt;bona fide&lt;/i&gt; clathrin-coated pits (CCPs) is required but unaccomplished. Here, we develop a thermodynamics-inspired method, “disassembly asymmetry score classification (DASC)”, that resolves ACs from CCPs based on single channel fluorescent movies. After extensive verification, we use DASC-resolved ACs and CCPs to quantify CME progression in 11 EAP knockdown conditions. We show that DASC is a sensitive detector of phenotypic variation in CCP dynamics that is uncorrelated to the variation in biochemical measurements of CME. Thus, DASC is an essential tool for uncovering EAP function.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/53609</link>
	<content:encoded>Biophysical mechanisms underlying collective cell migration of eukaryotic cells have been studied extensively in recent years. One mechanism that induces cells to correlate their motions is contact inhibition of locomotion, by which cells migrating away from the contact site. Here, we report that tail-following behavior at the contact site, termed contact following locomotion (CFL), can induce a non-trivial collective behavior in migrating cells. We show the emergence of a traveling band showing polar order in a mutant &lt;i&gt;Dictyostelium&lt;/i&gt; cell that lacks chemotactic activity. We find that CFL is the cell–cell interaction underlying this phenomenon, enabling a theoretical description of how this traveling band forms. We further show that the polar order phase consists of subpopulations that exhibit characteristic transversal motions with respect to the direction of band propagation. These findings describe a novel mechanism of collective cell migration involving cell–cell interactions capable of inducing traveling band with polar order.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: Dual histone methyl reader ZCWPW1 facilitates repair of meiotic double strand breaks in male mice</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/53360</link>
	<content:encoded>Meiotic crossovers result from homology-directed repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). Unlike yeast and plants, where DSBs are generated near gene promoters, in many vertebrates DSBs are enriched at hotspots determined by the DNA binding activity of the rapidly evolving zinc finger array of PRDM9 (PR domain zinc finger protein 9). PRDM9 subsequently catalyzes tri-methylation of lysine 4 and lysine 36 of Histone H3 in nearby nucleosomes. Here, we identify the dual histone methylation reader ZCWPW1, which is tightly co-expressed during spermatogenesis with &lt;i&gt;Prdm9&lt;/i&gt;, as an essential meiotic recombination factor required for efficient repair of PRDM9-dependent DSBs and for pairing of homologous chromosomes in male mice. In sum, our results indicate that the evolution of a dual histone methylation writer/reader (PRDM9/ZCWPW1) system in vertebrates remodeled genetic recombination hotspot selection from an ancestral static pattern near genes towards a flexible pattern controlled by the rapidly evolving DNA binding activity of PRDM9.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Cell cycle tags allow to restrict target protein expression to specific cell cycle phases. Here, we present an advanced toolbox of cell cycle tag constructs in budding yeast with defined and compatible peak expression that allow comparison of protein functionality at different cell cycle phases. We apply this technology to the question of how and when Mus81-Mms4 and Yen1 nucleases act on DNA replication or recombination structures. Restriction of Mus81-Mms4 to M phase but not S phase allows a &lt;i&gt;wildtype &lt;/i&gt;response to various forms of replication perturbation and DNA damage in S phase, suggesting it acts as a post-replicative resolvase. Moreover, we use cell cycle tags to reinstall cell cycle control to a deregulated version of Yen1, showing that its premature activation interferes with the response to perturbed replication. Curbing resolvase activity and establishing a hierarchy of resolution mechanisms are therefore the principal reasons underlying resolvase cell cycle regulation.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/51912</link>
	<content:encoded>We describe a method for quantifying the contractile forces that tumor spheroids collectively exert on highly nonlinear three-dimensional collagen networks. While three-dimensional traction force microscopy for single cells in a nonlinear matrix is computationally complex due to the variable cell shape, here we exploit the spherical symmetry of tumor spheroids to derive a scale-invariant relationship between spheroid contractility and the surrounding matrix deformations. This relationship allows us to directly translate the magnitude of matrix deformations to the total contractility of arbitrarily sized spheroids. We show that our method is accurate up to strains of 50% and remains valid even for irregularly shaped tissue samples when considering only the deformations in the far field. Finally, we demonstrate that collective forces of tumor spheroids reflect the contractility of individual cells for up to 1 hr after seeding, while collective forces on longer timescales are guided by mechanical feedback from the extracellular matrix.</content:encoded>

High-throughput sequencing of B- and T-cell receptors makes it possible to track immune repertoires across time, in different tissues, and in acute and chronic diseases or in healthy individuals. However, quantitative comparison between repertoires is confounded by variability in the read count of each receptor clonotype due to sampling, library preparation, and expression noise. Here, we present a general Bayesian approach to disentangle repertoire variations from these stochastic effects. Using replicate experiments, we first show how to learn the natural variability of read counts by inferring the distributions of clone sizes as well as an explicit noise model relating true frequencies of clones to their read count. We then use that null model as a baseline to infer a model of clonal expansion from two repertoire time points taken before and after an immune challenge. Applying our approach to yellow fever vaccination as a model of acute infection in humans, we identify candidate clones participating in the response.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/WuV350R5zIY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Uncertainty in the structure and parameters of networks is ubiquitous across computational biology. In constraint-based reconstruction and analysis of metabolic networks, this uncertainty is present both during the reconstruction of networks and in simulations performed with them. Here, we present Medusa, a Python package for the generation and analysis of ensembles of genome-scale metabolic network reconstructions. Medusa builds on the COBRApy package for constraint-based reconstruction and analysis by compressing a set of models into a compact ensemble object, providing functions for the generation of ensembles using experimental data, and extending constraint-based analyses to ensemble scale. We demonstrate how Medusa can be used to generate ensembles and perform ensemble simulations, and how machine learning can be used in conjunction with Medusa to guide the curation of genome-scale metabolic network reconstructions. Medusa is available under the permissive MIT license from the Python Packaging Index (https://pypi.org) and from github (https://github.com/opencobra/Medusa), and comprehensive documentation is available at https://medusa.readthedocs.io/en/latest.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/AD9jIGbNviM&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Marte J. Sætra, Gaute T. Einevoll, Geir Halnes&lt;/p&gt;

In most neuronal models, ion concentrations are assumed to be constant, and effects of concentration variations on ionic reversal potentials, or of ionic diffusion on electrical potentials are not accounted for. Here, we present the electrodiffusive Pinsky-Rinzel (edPR) model, which we believe is the first multicompartmental neuron model that accounts for electrodiffusive ion concentration dynamics in a way that ensures a biophysically consistent relationship between ion concentrations, electrical charge, and electrical potentials in both the intra- and extracellular space. The edPR model is an expanded version of the two-compartment Pinsky-Rinzel (PR) model of a hippocampal CA3 neuron. Unlike the PR model, the edPR model includes homeostatic mechanisms and ion-specific leakage currents, and keeps track of all ion concentrations (Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, and Cl&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;), electrical potentials, and electrical conductivities in the intra- and extracellular space. The edPR model reproduces the membrane potential dynamics of the PR model for moderate firing activity. For higher activity levels, or when homeostatic mechanisms are impaired, the homeostatic mechanisms fail in maintaining ion concentrations close to baseline, and the edPR model diverges from the PR model as it accounts for effects of concentration changes on neuronal firing. We envision that the edPR model will be useful for the field in three main ways. Firstly, as it relaxes commonly made modeling assumptions, the edPR model can be used to test the validity of these assumptions under various firing conditions, as we show here for a few selected cases. Secondly, the edPR model should supplement the PR model when simulating scenarios where ion concentrations are expected to vary over time. Thirdly, being applicable to conditions with failed homeostasis, the edPR model opens up for simulating a range of pathological conditions, such as spreading depression or epilepsy.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/HWagifW_BaU&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GABAergic medium spiny neurons are the main neuronal population in the striatum. Calbindin is preferentially expressed in medium spiny neurons involved in the indirect pathway. The aim of the present work is to analyze the effect of perinatal asphyxia on different subpopulations of GABAergic neurons in the striatum and to assess the outcome of deep therapeutic hypothermia. The uterus of pregnant rats was removed by cesarean section and the fetuses were exposed to hypoxia by immersion in water (19 min) at 37°C (perinatal asphyxia). The hypothermic group was exposed to 10°C during 30 min after perinatal asphyxia. The rats were euthanized at the age of one month (adolescent/adult rats), their brains were dissected out and coronal sections were immunolabeled for calbindin, calretinin, NeuN, and reelin. Reelin+ cells showed no staining in the striatum besides subventricular zone. The perinatal asphyxia (PA) group showed a significant decrease in calbindin neurons and a paradoxical increase in neurons estimated by NeuN staining. Moreover, calretinin+ cells, a specific subpopulation of GABAergic neurons, showed an increase caused by PA. Deep hypothermia reversed most of these alterations probably by protecting calbindin neurons. Similarly, there was a reduction of the diameter of the anterior commissure produced by the asphyxia that was prevented by hypothermic treatment.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Bridging therapy or IV thrombolysis in minor stroke with large vessel occlusion</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25756?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether bridging therapy (intravenous thrombolysis [IVT] followed by endovascular treatment) is superior to IVT alone in minor stroke with large vessel occlusion (LVO) is unknown.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Multicentric retrospective observational study including, in intention‐to‐treat, consecutive IVT‐treated minor strokes (NIHSS≤5) with LVO, with or without additional mechanical thrombectomy. Propensity‐score (inverse probability of treatment weighting) was used to reduce baseline between‐groups differences. The primary outcome was excellent outcome, &lt;i&gt;i.e&lt;/i&gt;., modified Rankin score 0‐1 at 3 months follow‐up.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, 598 patients were included (214 and 384 in the bridging therapy and IVT groups, respectively). Following propensity‐score weighting, the distribution of baseline clinical and radiological variables was similar across the two patient groups. Compared with IVT alone, bridging therapy was not associated with excellent outcome (OR=0.96; 95%CI=0.75‐1.24; &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;=0.76), but was associated with symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage (OR=3.01; 95%CI=1.77‐5.11; &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.0001). Occlusion site was a strong modifier of the effect of bridging therapy on outcome (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;interaction&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;lt;0.0001), with bridging therapy associated with higher odds of excellent outcome in proximal M1 (OR=3.26; 95%CI=1.67‐6.35; &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;=0.0006) and distal M1 (OR=1.69; 95%CI=1.01‐2.82; &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;=0.04) occlusions, but with lower odds of excellent outcome for M2 (OR=0.53; 95%CI=0.38‐0.75; &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;=0.0003) occlusions. Bridging therapy was associated with higher rates of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage in M2 occlusions only (OR=4.40; 95%CI=2.20‐8.83; &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.0001).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although overall outcomes were similar in intended bridging therapy as compared to intended IVT alone in minor strokes with LVO, our results suggest that intended bridging therapy may be beneficial in M1 occlusions, while the benefit‐risk profile may favor IVT alone in M2 occlusions.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>eNeuro: Feedback Adaptation to Unpredictable Force Fields in 250 ms</title>
	<link>http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/7/2/ENEURO.0400-19.2020?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Motor learning and adaptation are important functions of the nervous system. Classical studies have characterized how humans adapt to changes in the environment during tasks such as reaching, and have documented improvements in behavior across movements. However, little is known about how quickly the nervous system adapts to such disturbances. In particular, recent work has suggested that adaptation could be sufficiently fast to alter the control strategies of an ongoing movement. To further address the possibility that learning occurred within a single movement, we designed a series of human reaching experiments to extract from muscles recordings the latency of feedback adaptation. Our results confirmed that participants adapted their feedback responses to unanticipated force fields applied randomly. In addition, our analyses revealed that the feedback response was specifically and finely tuned to the ongoing perturbation not only across trials with the same force field, but also across different kinds of force fields. Finally, changes in muscle activity consistent with feedback adaptation occurred in ~250 ms following reach onset. The adaptation that we observed across trials presented in a random context was similar to the one observed when the force fields could be anticipated, suggesting that these two adaptive processes may be closely linked to each other. In such case, our measurement of 250 ms may correspond to the latency of motor adaptation in the nervous system.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eNeuro: Sex-Selective Effects on Behavior in a Mouse Model of Tuberous Sclerosis Complex</title>
	<link>http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/7/2/ENEURO.0379-19.2020?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is an autosomal dominant genetic disorder that is caused by a mutation in either &lt;i&gt;TSC1&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;TSC2&lt;/i&gt;. TSC affects multiple systems of the body, and patients with TSC display a range of neurologic and behavioral manifestations including seizures, intellectual disability, autism spectrum disorders, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, anxiety, and mood disorders. Whereas behavioral phenotypes of many mouse models have been studied, the effects of sex have, for the most part, not been explored. We studied adult male and female &lt;i&gt;Tsc2&lt;/i&gt; heterozygous and control mice to investigate the influence of sex and genotype on behavior. On a test of social preference, &lt;i&gt;Tsc2&lt;/i&gt; heterozygous mice, regardless of sex, demonstrated lower preference for the stranger mouse than control mice. In the open field, &lt;i&gt;Tsc2&lt;/i&gt; heterozygous males and control females habituated to the open field with decreasing anxiety-like behavior over time, whereas &lt;i&gt;Tsc2&lt;/i&gt; heterozygous females did not show habituation to the open field environment. We did not find any statistically significant effects of genotype on open field activity, learning and memory or motor function. Our results highlight phenotype differences in &lt;i&gt;Tsc2&lt;/i&gt; heterozygous mice, some of which are influenced by sex. A consideration of how sex influences the behavioral phenotypes of TSC is critical to develop a more complete understanding of the disorder and better target future pharmacological treatments.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eNeuro: Progressive Changes in Sleep and Its Relations to Amyloid-{beta} Distribution and Learning in Single App Knock-In Mice</title>
	<link>http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/7/2/ENEURO.0093-20.2020?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s disease (AD) patients often suffer from sleep disturbances. Alterations in sleep, especially rapid eye movement sleep (REMS), can precede the onset of dementia. To accurately characterize the sleep impairments accompanying AD and their underlying mechanisms using animal models, it is crucial to use models in which brain areas are affected in a manner similar to that observed in the actual patients. Here, we focused on &lt;i&gt;App&lt;sup&gt;NL-G-F&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt; mice, in which expression levels and patterns of mutated amyloid precursor protein (APP) follow the endogenous patterns. We characterized the sleep architecture of male &lt;i&gt;App&lt;sup&gt;NL-G-F&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt; homozygous and heterozygous mice at two ages (six and 12 months). At six months, homozygous mice exhibited reduced REMS, which was further reduced at 12 months together with a slight reduction in non-REMS (NREMS). By contrast, heterozygous mice exhibited an overall normal sleep architecture. Homozygous mice also exhibited decreased electroencephalogram  to  power ratio during REMS from six months, resembling the electroencephalogram slowing phenomenon observed in preclinical or early stages of AD. In addition, homozygous mice showed learning and memory impairments in the trace fear conditioning (FC) at both ages, and task performance strongly correlated with REMS amount at 12 months. Finally, histologic analyses revealed that amyloid-β accumulation in the pontine tegmental area and ventral medulla followed a course similar to that of the REMS reduction. These findings support the notion that changes in REMS are an early marker of AD and provide a starting point to address the mechanism of sleep deficits in AD and the effects on cognition.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eNeuro: Hypothalamic MCH Neuron Activity Dynamics during Cataplexy of Narcolepsy</title>
	<link>http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/7/2/ENEURO.0017-20.2020?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Hypothalamic orexin (hypocretin, HCRT) deficiency causes sleep disorder narcolepsy with cataplexy in humans and murine. As another integral group of sleep/wake-regulating neurons in the same brain area, the melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH) neurons’ involvement in cataplexy remains ambiguous. Here we used the live animal deep-brain calcium (Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;) imaging tool to record MCH neuron dynamics during cataplexy by expressing calcium sensor GCaMP6s into genetically defined MCH neurons in orexin knock-out mice, which are a model of human narcolepsy. Similar to wild-type mice, MCH neurons of the narcoleptic mice displayed significantly higher Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; transient fluorescent intensity during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and active waking (AW) episodes compared with non-REM (NREM) sleep. Moreover, MCH neurons displayed significantly lower Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; signals during cataplexy. Importantly, a pre-cataplexy elevation of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; signals from MCH neurons was not a prerequisite for cataplexy initiation. Our results demonstrated the inactivation status of MCH neurons during cataplexy and suggested that MCH neurons are not involved in the initiation and maintenance of cataplexy in orexin knock-out mice.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Post‐Traumatic Stress Disorder is Associated with further Increased Parkinson's Disease Risk in Veterans with Traumatic Brain Injury</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25726?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Determining if traumatic brain injury (TBI) and post‐traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are risk factors for Parkinson's disease (PD). This constitutes a research priority for the Veterans Administration (VA) with implications for screening policy and prevention.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Population‐based, matched case‐control study among veterans using VA health care facilities from October 1, 1999, to September 30, 2013. We identified 176,871 PD cases and 707,484 randomly selected PD‐free matched controls. PD, TBI, and PTSD were ascertained by validated International Classification of Disease 9th revision (ICD)‐9 code‐based algorithms. We examined the association between both risk factors and PD using race‐adjusted conditional logistic regression.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The overall study cohort prevalence for TBI&lt;sub&gt;mild&lt;/sub&gt;, TBI&lt;sub&gt;non‐mild&lt;/sub&gt;, and PTSD was 0.65%, 0.69%, and 5.5%, respectively. Both TBI and PTSD were significantly associated with PD in single‐risk factor race‐adjusted analyses (conditional odds ratio [cOR] = 2.99; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.69–3.32), 3.82 (95% CI: 3.67–3.97), and 2.71 (95% CI: 2.66–2.77) for TBI&lt;sub&gt;mild&lt;/sub&gt;, TBI&lt;sub&gt;non‐mild&lt;/sub&gt;, and PTSD, respectively). There was suggestive positive interaction observed with comorbid PTSD/TBI in dual‐risk factor analyses, with significant 2.69‐fold and 3.70‐fold excess relative PD risk in veterans with TBI&lt;sub&gt;mild&lt;/sub&gt; and TBI&lt;sub&gt;non‐mild&lt;/sub&gt; versus those without TBI when PTSD was present versus 2.17‐fold and 2.80‐fold excess risk when PTSD was absent.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our study was the first to demonstrate that both TBI and PTSD are independently associated with increased relative PD risk in a diverse nationwide cohort of military service veterans, and the first to suggest a potential modest synergistic excess risk in those with comorbid TBI/PTSD. Longitudinal research is needed to confirm these suggestive findings. ANN NEUROL 2020&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience: Multiple Network Disconnection in Anosognosia for Hemiplegia</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2020.00021</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Anosognosia for hemiplegia (AHP) is a complex syndrome whose neural correlates are still under investigation. One hypothesis, mainly based on lesion mapping studies, is that AHP reflects a breakdown of neural systems of the right hemisphere involved in motor function. However, more recent theories have suggested that AHP may represent a disorder of cognitive systems involved in belief updating, self-referential or body processing. Two recent studies, using a method to estimate the degree of white matter disconnection from lesions, have indeed shown that patients with AHP suffer from damage of several long-range white matter pathways in association cortex. Here, we use a similar indirect disconnection approach to study a group of patients with motor deficits without anosognosia (hemiparesis or hemiplegia, HP, n = 35), or motor deficits with AHP (n = 28). The HP lesions came from a database of stroke patients, while cases of AHP were selected from the published literature. Lesions were traced into an atlas from illustrations of the publications using a standard method. There was no region in the brain that was more damaged in AHP than HP. In terms of structural connectivity, AHP patients had a similar pattern of disconnection of motor pathways to HP patients. However, AHP patients also showed significant disconnection of the right temporo-parietal junction, right insula, right lateral and medial prefrontal cortex. These associative cortical regions were connected through several white matter tracts, including superior longitudinal fasciculus III, arcuate, fronto-insular, frontal inferior longitudinal, and frontal aslant. These tracts connected regions of different cognitive networks: default, ventral attention, and cingulo-opercular. These results were not controlled for clinical variables as concomitant symptoms and other disorders of body representation were not always available for co-variate analysis. In conclusion, we confirm recent studies of disconnection demonstrating that AHP is not limited to dysfunction of motor systems, but involves a much wider set of large-scale cortical networks.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00363</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a devastating neurodegenerative disease that affects selected cortical and spinal neuronal populations, leading to progressive paralysis and death. A growing body of evidences suggests that the disease may originate in the cerebral cortex and propagate in a corticofugal manner. In particular, transcranial magnetic stimulation studies revealed that ALS patients present with early cortical hyperexcitability arising from a combination of increased excitability and decreased inhibition. Here, we discuss the possibility that initial cortical circuit dysfunction might act as the main driver of ALS onset and progression, and review recent functional, imaging and transcriptomic studies conducted on ALS patients, along with electrophysiological, pathological and transcriptomic studies on animal and cellular models of the disease, in order to evaluate the potential cellular and molecular origins of cortical hyperexcitability in ALS.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: RAGE Silencing Ameliorates Neuroinflammation by Inhibition of p38-NF-κB Signaling Pathway in Mouse Model of Parkinson’s Disease</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00353</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Accumulating evidence suggested that neuroinflammation played a crucial role in dopaminergic neuronal death in Parkinson’s disease (PD). The receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE), a multi-ligand receptor of the immunoglobulin superfamily, has been proposed as a key molecule in the onset and sustainment of the inflammatory response. Engagement of RAGE contributed to neuroinflammation by upregulating nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) as well as cytokines. The aim of the present study was to investigate the expression of RAGE in 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-treated mice and elucidate the RAGE signal pathway involved in the inflammation. Results showed that RAGE protein and pro-inflammatory cytokines cyclooxygenase type 2 (COX-2) were upregulated in MPTP-treated mice. Further experiments showed that RAGE ablation inhibited phosphorylation of IκB and p38 and protected nigral dopaminergic neurons against cell death in the substantia nigra (SN). These results suggested that RAGE participated in the pathogenesis of PD by neuroinflammation and p38MAPK-NFκB signal pathway may be involved in the process. Moreover, interfering with RAGE signaling pathway may be a reasonable therapeutic option in slowing PD development and progression.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The neurovascular unit (NVU), composed of vascular cells, glial cells, and neurons, is the minimal functional unit of the brain. The NVU maintains integrity of the blood–brain barrier (BBB) and regulates supply of the cerebral blood flow (CBF), both of which are keys to maintaining normal brain function. BBB dysfunction and a decreased CBF are early pathophysiological changes in neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Parkinson’s disease (PD), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). In this review, we primarily focus on the NVU in AD as much research has been performed on the connection between NVU dysfunction and AD. We also discuss the role of NVU dysfunction in the pathophysiological mechanisms of PD and ALS. As most neurodegenerative diseases are difficult to treat, we discuss several potential drug targets that focus on the NVU that may inform novel vascular-targeted therapies for AD, PD, and ALS.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00125</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Despite great advances in brain tumor segmentation and clear clinical need, translation of state-of-the-art computational methods into clinical routine and scientific practice remains a major challenge. Several factors impede successful implementations, including data standardization and preprocessing. However, these steps are pivotal for the deployment of state-of-the-art image segmentation algorithms. To overcome these issues, we present BraTS Toolkit. BraTS Toolkit is a holistic approach to brain tumor segmentation and consists of three components: First, the BraTS Preprocessor facilitates data standardization and preprocessing for researchers and clinicians alike. It covers the entire image analysis workflow prior to tumor segmentation, from image conversion and registration to brain extraction. Second, BraTS Segmentor enables orchestration of BraTS brain tumor segmentation algorithms for generation of fully-automated segmentations. Finally, Brats Fusionator can combine the resulting candidate segmentations into consensus segmentations using fusion methods such as majority voting and iterative SIMPLE fusion. The capabilities of our tools are illustrated with a practical example to enable easy translation to clinical and scientific practice.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Is the Blood Oxygenation Level-Dependent fMRI Response to Motor Tasks Altered in Children After Neonatal Stroke?</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00154</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Functional MRI is increasingly being used in the assessment of brain activation and connectivity following stroke. Many of these studies rely on the Blood Oxygenation Level Dependent (BOLD) contrast. However, the stability, as well as the accuracy of the BOLD response to motor task in the ipsilesional hemisphere, remains ambiguous. In this work, the BOLD signal acquired from both healthy and affected hemispheres was analyzed in 7-year-old children who sustained a Neonatal Arterial Ischemic Stroke (NAIS). Accordingly, a repetitive motor task of the contralesional and the ipsilesional hands was performed by 33 patients with unilateral lesions. These patients were divided into two groups: those without cerebral palsy (NAIS), and those with cerebral palsy (CP). The BOLD signal time course was obtained from distinctly defined regions of interest (ROIs) extracted from the functional activation maps of 30 healthy controls with similar age and demographic characteristics as the patients. An ROI covering both the primary motor cortex (M1) and the primary somatosensory cortex (S1) was also tested. Compared with controls, NAIS patients without CP had similar BOLD amplitude variation for both the contralesional and the ipsilesional hand movements. However, in the case of NAIS patients with CP, a significant difference in the averaged BOLD amplitude was found between the healthy and affected hemisphere. In both cases, no progressive attenuation of the BOLD signal amplitude was observed throughout the task epochs. Besides, results also showed a correlation between the BOLD signal percentage variation of the lesioned hemisphere and the dexterity level. These findings suggest that for patients who sustained a NAIS with no extensive permanent motor impairment, BOLD signal-based data analysis can be a valuable tool for the evaluation of functional brain networks.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Novelty Manipulations, Memory Performance, and Predictive Coding: the Role of Unexpectedness</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00152</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Novelty is central to the study of memory, but the wide range of experimental manipulations aimed to reveal its effects on learning produced inconsistent results. The novelty/encoding hypothesis suggests that novel information undergoes enhanced encoding and thus leads to benefits in memory, especially in recognition performance; however, recent studies cast doubts on this assumption. On the other hand, data from animal studies provided evidence on the robust effects of novelty manipulations on the neurophysiological correlates of memory processes. Conceptualizations and operationalizations of novelty are remarkably variable and were categorized into different subtypes, such as stimulus, context, associative or spatial novelty. Here, we summarize previous findings about the effects of novelty on memory and suggest that predictive coding theories provide a framework that could shed light on the differential influence of novelty manipulations on memory performance. In line with predictive coding theories, we emphasize the role of unexpectedness as a crucial property mediating the behavioral and neural effects of novelty manipulations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Changes in the Effective Connectivity of the Social Brain When Making Inferences About Close Others vs. the Self</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00151</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Previous research showed that the ability to make inferences about our own and other’s mental states rely on common brain pathways; particularly in the case of close relationships (e.g., romantic relationships). Despite the evidence for shared neural representations of self and others, less is known about the distributed processing within these common neural networks, particularly whether there are specific patterns of internode communication when focusing on other vs. self. This study aimed to characterize context-sensitive coupling among social brain regions involved in self and other understanding. Participants underwent an fMRI while watching emotional video vignettes of their romantic partner and elaborated on their partner’s (other-condition) or on their own experience (self-condition). We used dynamic causal modeling (DCM) to quantify the associated changes in effective connectivity (EC) in a network of brain regions involved in social cognition including the temporoparietal junction (TPJ), the posterior cingulate (PCC)/precuneus and middle temporal gyrus (MTG). DCM revealed that: the PCC plays a central coordination role within this network, the bilateral MTG receives driving inputs from other nodes suggesting that social information is first processed in language comprehension regions; the right TPJ evidenced a selective increase in its sensitivity when focusing on the other’s experience, relative to focusing on oneself.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Including Measures of High Gamma Power Can Improve the Decoding of Natural Speech From EEG</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00130</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The human auditory system is highly skilled at extracting and processing information from speech in both single-speaker and multi-speaker situations. A commonly studied speech feature is the amplitude envelope which can also be used to determine which speaker a listener is attending to in those multi-speaker situations. Non-invasive brain imaging (electro-/magnetoencephalography [EEG/MEG]) has shown that the phase of neural activity below 16 Hz tracks the dynamics of speech, whereas invasive brain imaging (electrocorticography [ECoG]) has shown that such processing is strongly reflected in the power of high frequency neural activity (around 70-150 Hz; known as high gamma). The first aim of this study was to determine if high gamma power scalp recorded EEG carries useful stimulus-related information, despite its reputation for having a poor signal to noise ratio. Specifically, linear regression was used to investigate speech envelope and attention decoding in low frequency EEG, high gamma power EEG, and in both EEG signals combined. The second aim was to assess whether the information reflected in high gamma power EEG may be complementary to that reflected in well-established low frequency EEG indices of speech processing. Exploratory analyses were also completed to examine how low frequency and high gamma power EEG may be sensitive to different features of the speech envelope. While low frequency speech tracking was evident for almost all subjects as expected, high gamma power also showed robust speech tracking in some subjects. This same pattern was true for attention decoding using a separate group of subjects who participated in a cocktail party attention experiment. For the subjects who showed speech tracking in high gamma power EEG, the spatiotemporal characteristics of that high gamma tracking differed from that of low-frequency EEG. Furthermore, combining the two neural measures led to improved measures of speech tracking for several subjects. Our results indicated that high gamma power EEG can carry useful information regarding speech processing and attentional selection in some subjects. Combining high gamma power and low frequency EEG can improve the mapping between natural speech and the resulting neural responses.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Longitudinal Morphological and Functional Assessment of RGC Neurodegeneration After Optic Nerve Crush in Mouse</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00109</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The mouse optic nerve crush (ONC) model has been widely used to study optic neuropathies and central nervous system (CNS) axon injury and repair. Previous histological studies of retinal ganglion cell (RGC) somata in retina and axons in ON demonstrate significant neurodegeneration after ONC, but longitudinal morphological and functional assessment of RGCs in living animals is lacking. It is essential to establish these assays to provide more clinically relevant information for early detection and monitoring the progression of CNS neurodegeneration. Here, we present in vivo data gathered by scanning laser ophthalmoscopy (SLO), optical coherence tomography (OCT), and pattern electroretinogram (PERG) at different time points after ONC in mouse eyes and corresponding histological quantification of the RGC somata and axons. Not surprisingly, direct visualization of RGCs by SLO fundus imaging correlated best with histological quantification of RGC somata and axons. Unexpectedly, OCT did not detect obvious retinal thinning until late time points (14 and 28-days post ONC) and instead detected significant retinal swelling at early time points (1–5 days post-ONC), indicating a characteristic initial retinal response to ON injury. PERG also demonstrated an early RGC functional deficit in response to ONC, before significant RGC death, suggesting that it is highly sensitive to ONC. However, the limited progression of PERG deficits diminished its usefulness as a reliable indicator of RGC degeneration.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;White matter (WM) microstructure is a sensitive marker to distinguish individuals at risk of Alzheimer’s disease. The association of objective physical fitness (PF) measures and WM microstructure has not been explored and mixed results reported with physical activity (PA). Longitudinal studies of WM with PA and PF measures have had limited investigation. This study explored the relationship between objective PF measures over 24-months with “normal-appearing” WM microstructure. Data acquired on magnetic resonance imaging was used to measure “normal-appearing” WM microstructure at baseline and 24-months. Clinical variables such as cognitive and blood-based measures were collected longitudinally. Also, as part of the randomized controlled trial of a PA, extensive measures of PA and fitness were obtained over the 24 months. Bilateral corticospinal tracts (CST) and the corpus callosum showed a significant association between PF performance over 24-months and baseline WM microstructural measures. There was no significant longitudinal effect of the intervention or PF performance over 24-months. Baseline WM microstructural measures were significantly associated with PF performance over 24-months in this cohort of participants with vascular risk factors and at risk of Alzheimer’s disease with distinctive patterns for each PF test.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Channelrhodopsin Excitation Contracts Brain Pericytes and Reduces Blood Flow in the Aging Mouse Brain in vivo</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00108</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Brains depend on blood flow for the delivery of oxygen and nutrients essential for proper neuronal and synaptic functioning. French physiologist Rouget was the first to describe pericytes in 1873 as regularly arranged longitudinal amoeboid cells on capillaries that have a muscular coat, implying that these are contractile cells that regulate blood flow. Although there have been &amp;gt;30 publications from different groups, including our group, demonstrating that pericytes are contractile cells that can regulate hemodynamic responses in the brain, the role of pericytes in controlling cerebral blood flow (CBF) has not been confirmed by all studies. Moreover, recent studies using different optogenetic models to express light-sensitive channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) cation channels in pericytes were not conclusive; one, suggesting that pericytes expressing ChR2 do not contract after light stimulus, and the other, demonstrating contraction of pericytes expressing ChR2 after light stimulus. Since two-photon optogenetics provides a powerful tool to study mechanisms of blood flow regulation at the level of brain capillaries, we re-examined the contractility of brain pericytes in vivo using a new optogenetic model developed by crossing our new inducible pericyte-specific CreER mouse line with ChR2 mice. We induced expression of ChR2 in pericytes with tamoxifen, excited ChR2 by 488 nm light, and monitored pericyte contractility, brain capillary diameter changes, and red blood cell (RBC) velocity in aged mice by in vivo two-photon microscopy. Excitation of ChR2 resulted in pericyte contraction followed by constriction of the underlying capillary leading to approximately an 8% decrease (p = 0.006) in capillary diameter. ChR2 excitation in pericytes substantially reduced capillary RBC flow by 42% (p = 0.03) during the stimulation period compared to the velocity before stimulation. Our data suggests that pericytes contract in vivo and regulate capillary blood flow in the aging mouse brain. By extension, this might have implications for neurological disorders of the aging human brain associated with neurovascular dysfunction and pericyte loss such as stroke and Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Lineage tracing involves the identification of all ancestors and descendants of a given cell, and is an important tool for studying biological processes such as development and disease progression. However, in many settings, controlled time-course experiments are not feasible, for example when working with tissue samples from patients. Here we present ImageAEOT, a computational pipeline based on autoencoders and optimal transport for predicting the lineages of cells using time-labeled datasets from different stages of a cellular process. Given a single-cell image from one of the stages, ImageAEOT generates an artificial lineage of this cell based on the population characteristics of the other stages. These lineages can be used to connect subpopulations of cells through the different stages and identify image-based features and biomarkers underlying the biological process. To validate our method, we apply ImageAEOT to a benchmark task based on nuclear and chromatin images during the activation of fibroblasts by tumor cells in engineered 3D tissues. We further validate ImageAEOT on chromatin images of various breast cancer cell lines and human tissue samples, thereby linking alterations in chromatin condensation patterns to different stages of tumor progression. Our results demonstrate the promise of computational methods based on autoencoding and optimal transport principles for lineage tracing in settings where existing experimental strategies cannot be used.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/P97F_QvFAac&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

We shed light on the potential of entorhinal grid cells to efficiently encode variables of dimension greater than two, while remaining faithful to empirical data on their low-dimensional structure. Our model constructs representations of high-dimensional inputs through a combination of low-dimensional random projections and “classical” low-dimensional hexagonal grid cell responses. Without reconfiguration of the recurrent circuit, the same system can flexibly encode multiple variables of different dimensions while maximizing the coding range (per dimension) by automatically trading-off dimension with an exponentially large coding range. It achieves high efficiency and flexibility by combining two powerful concepts, modularity and mixed selectivity, in what we call “mixed modular coding”. In contrast to previously proposed schemes, the model does not require the formation of higher-dimensional grid responses, a cell-inefficient and rigid mechanism. The firing fields observed in flying bats or climbing rats can be generated by neurons that combine activity from multiple grid modules, each representing higher-dimensional spaces according to our model. The idea expands our understanding of grid cells, suggesting that they could implement a general circuit that generates on-demand coding and memory states for variables in high-dimensional vector spaces.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/JtlFgqKoNz0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Mechanical interactions between flowing and coagulated blood (thrombus) are crucial in dictating the deformation and remodeling of a thrombus after its formation in hemostasis. We propose a fully-Eulerian, three-dimensional, phase-field model of thrombus that is calibrated with existing &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; experimental data. This phase-field model considers spatial variations in permeability and material properties within a single unified mathematical framework derived from an energy perspective, thereby allowing us to study effects of thrombus microstructure and properties on its deformation and possible release of emboli under different hemodynamic conditions. Moreover, we combine this proposed thrombus model with a particle-based model which simulates the initiation of the thrombus. The volume fraction of a thrombus obtained from the particle simulation is mapped to an input variable in the proposed phase-field thrombus model. The present work is thus the first computational study to integrate the initiation of a thrombus through platelet aggregation with its subsequent viscoelastic responses to various shear flows. This framework can be informed by clinical data and potentially be used to predict the risk of diverse thromboembolic events under physiological and pathological conditions.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/OYT2XpKBMGM&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

The mechanisms underlying virus emergence are rarely well understood, making the appearance of outbreaks largely unpredictable. Bluetongue virus serotype 8 (BTV-8), an arthropod-borne virus of ruminants, emerged in livestock in northern Europe in 2006, spreading to most European countries by 2009 and causing losses of billions of euros. Although the outbreak was successfully controlled through vaccination by early 2010, puzzlingly, a closely related BTV-8 strain re-emerged in France in 2015, triggering a second outbreak that is still ongoing. The origin of this virus and the mechanisms underlying its re-emergence are unknown. Here, we performed phylogenetic analyses of 164 whole BTV-8 genomes sampled throughout the two outbreaks. We demonstrate consistent clock-like virus evolution during both epizootics but found negligible evolutionary change between them. We estimate that the ancestor of the second outbreak dates from the height of the first outbreak in 2008. This implies that the virus had not been replicating for multiple years prior to its re-emergence in 2015. Given the absence of any known natural mechanism that could explain BTV-8 persistence over this long period without replication, we hypothesise that the second outbreak could have been initiated by accidental exposure of livestock to frozen material contaminated with virus from approximately 2008. Our work highlights new targets for pathogen surveillance programmes in livestock and illustrates the power of genomic epidemiology to identify pathways of infectious disease emergence.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/qHT7Q40nPnc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Genome sequencing (GS) is promising for unsolved leukodystrophies, but its efficacy has not been prospectively studied.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A prospective time‐delayed cross‐over design trial of GS to assess the efficacy of GS as a first‐line diagnostic tool for genetic white matter disorders took place between 12/01/2015 – 09/27/2017. Patients were randomized to receive GS immediately with concurrent standard of care (SoC) testing, or to receive SoC testing for four months followed by GS.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;34 individuals were assessed at interim review&lt;b&gt;.&lt;/b&gt; The genetic origin of two patient's leukoencephalopathy was resolved before randomization. Nine patients stratified to the immediate intervention group and 23 patients to the delayed‐GS arm. The efficacy of GS was significant relative to SoC in the Immediate (5 of 9 [56%] vs. 0 of 9 [0%]; Wild‐Seber p &amp;lt; 0.005) and Delayed (control) arms (14 of 23 [61%] vs 5 of 23 [22%]; Wild‐Seber p &amp;lt; 0.005). The time to diagnosis was significantly shorter in the immediate‐GS group (log rank test, p=0.04). The overall diagnostic efficacy of combined GS and SoC approaches was 26 of 34 (76.5% [95% CI = 58.8% to 89.3%]) in less than 4 months, greater than historical norms of less than 50% over 5 years. Owing to loss of clinical equipoise, the trial design was altered to a single‐arm observational study.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this study, first‐line GS provided earlier and greater diagnostic efficacy in white matter disorders. We provide an evidence‐based diagnostic testing algorithm to enable appropriate clinical GS utilization in this population.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Na,K‐ATPase comprises α (&lt;i&gt;Atp1a&lt;/i&gt;), β (&lt;i&gt;Atp1b&lt;/i&gt;), and FXYD subunits, and each subunit has isoforms. In situ hybridization for α and β subunit isoforms revealed regional‐ and neuronal‐subtype‐specific expression of the isoforms in the mouse brain. The photograph shows &lt;i&gt;Atp1a1&lt;/i&gt; (red) and &lt;i&gt;Atp1a3&lt;/i&gt; (green) expression in the hippocampal dentate gyrus (stained with DAPI, blue).

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Na,K‐ATPase is a ubiquitous molecule contributing to the asymmetrical distribution of Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ions across the plasma membrane and maintenance of the membrane potential, a prerequisite of neuronal activity. Na,K‐ATPase comprises three subunits (α, β, and FXYD). The α subunit has four isoforms in mice, with three of them (α1, α2, and α3) expressed in the brain. However, the functional and biological significances of the different brain isoforms remain to be fully elucidated. Recent studies have revealed the association of &lt;i&gt;Atp1a3&lt;/i&gt;, a gene encoding α3 subunit, with neurological disorders. To map the cellular distributions of the α subunit isoforms and their coexpression patterns, we evaluated the mRNA expression of &lt;i&gt;Atp1a1&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Atp1a2&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;Atp1a3&lt;/i&gt; by in situ hybridization in the mouse brain. &lt;i&gt;Atp1a1&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Atp1a3&lt;/i&gt; were expressed in neurons, whereas &lt;i&gt;Atp1a2&lt;/i&gt; was almost exclusively expressed in glial cells. Most neurons coexpressed &lt;i&gt;Atp1a1&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Atp1a3&lt;/i&gt;, with highly heterogeneous expression levels across the brain regions and neuronal subtypes. We identified parvalbumin (PV)‐expressing GABAergic neurons in the hippocampus, somatosensory cortex, and retrosplenial cortex as an example of a neuronal subtype expressing low &lt;i&gt;Atp1a1&lt;/i&gt; and high &lt;i&gt;Atp1a3&lt;/i&gt;. The expression of &lt;i&gt;Atp1b&lt;/i&gt; isoforms was also heterogeneous across brain regions and cellular subtypes. The PV‐expressing neurons expressed a high level of &lt;i&gt;Atp1b1&lt;/i&gt; and a low level of &lt;i&gt;Atp1b2&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Atp1b3&lt;/i&gt;. These findings provide basic information on the region‐ and neuronal‐subtype‐dependent expression of Na,K‐ATPase α and β subunit isoforms, as well as a rationale for the selective involvement of neurons expressing high levels of &lt;i&gt;Atp1a3&lt;/i&gt; in neurological disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eNeuro: Biophysical Basis of Alpha Rhythm Disruption in Alzheimers Disease</title>
	<link>http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/7/2/ENEURO.0293-19.2020?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Occipital alpha is a prominent rhythm (~10 Hz) detected in electroencephalography (EEG) during wakeful relaxation with closed eyes. The rhythm is generated by a subclass of thalamic pacemaker cells that burst at the alpha frequency, orchestrated by the interplay of hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated channels (HCN) and calcium channels in response to elevated levels of ambient acetylcholine (ACh). These oscillations are known to have a lower peak frequency and coherence in the early stages of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Interestingly, calcium signaling, HCN channel expression and ACh signaling, crucial for orchestrating the alpha rhythm, are also known to be aberrational in AD. In a biophysically detailed network model of the thalamic circuit, we investigate the changes in molecular signaling and the causal relationships between them that lead to a disrupted thalamic alpha in AD. Our simulations show that lowered HCN expression leads to a slower thalamic alpha, which can be rescued by increasing ACh levels, a common therapeutic target of AD drugs. However, this rescue is possible only over a limited range of reduced HCN expression. The model predicts that lowered HCN expression can modify the network activity in the thalamic circuit leading to increased GABA release in the thalamus and disrupt the calcium homeostasis. The changes in calcium signaling make the network more susceptible to noise, causing a loss in rhythmic activity. Based on our results, we propose that reduced frequency and coherence of the occipital alpha rhythm seen in AD may result from downregulated HCN expression, rather than modified cholinergic signaling.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eNeuro: Evidence for Distinct Forms of Compulsivity in the SAPAP3 Mutant-Mouse Model for Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder</title>
	<link>http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/7/2/ENEURO.0245-19.2020?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;The specific mechanisms underlying compulsive behavior in obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) are unknown. It has been suggested that such compulsivity may have its origin in cognitive dysfunction such as impaired processing of feedback information, received after the completion of goal-directed actions. The signal attenuation (SA) task models such a processing deficit in animals by attenuating the association strength between food reward and audiovisual feedback (signal) presented after performance of an operant response. The compulsive-like responding resulting from SA is well characterized in rats, but was so far not established in mice, a species for which powerful genetic OCD models exist. Thus, first, we demonstrate that the SA task can be implemented in mice and show that attenuation of reward-associated response feedback produces similar behavior in C57BL/6 mice as previously reported in rats. Second, we tested the hypothesis that &lt;i&gt;SAPAP3&lt;/i&gt; knock-out mice (SAPAP3&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;), prone to exhibit several OCD-like abnormalities including excessive grooming, show enhanced compulsive-like behavior in the SA task compared with their wild-type (WT) littermates. However, task-related compulsivity measures in SAPAP3&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; and WT did not yield significant differences, neither following SA nor during &quot;regular&quot; extinction of operant behavior. Thus, compulsive-like instrumental behavior following feedback distortion was not potentiated in compulsively grooming mice, implicating specifically that (1) a general deficit in feedback processing is not related to excessive grooming in SAPAP3&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; and (2) different manifestations of compulsivity may be driven by independent mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Our results support earlier studies that suggest distinct morphology and functions for intercollicular nuclei, and provide staining methods that differentiate intercollicular nuclei and are compatible with most modern techniques.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Progressive Multiple Sclerosis Is Associated with Faster and Specific Retinal Layer Atrophy</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25738?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therapeutic development in progressive multiple sclerosis (PMS) has been hampered by a lack of reliable biomarkers to monitor neurodegeneration. Optical coherence tomography (OCT)‐derived retinal measures have been proposed as promising biomarkers to fulfill this role. However, it is unclear whether retinal atrophy persists in PMS, exceeds normal aging, or can be distinguished from relapsing–remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;178 RRMS, 186 PMS, and 66 control participants were followed with serial OCT for a median follow‐up of 3.7 years.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The estimated proportion of peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer (pRNFL) and macular ganglion cell + inner plexiform layer (GCIPL) thinning in multiple sclerosis (MS) attributable to normal aging increased from 42.7% and 16.7% respectively at age 25 years, to 83.7% and 81.1% at age 65 years. However, independent of age, PMS was associated with faster pRNFL (−0.34 ± 0.09%/yr, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001) and GCIPL (−0.27 ± 0.07%/yr, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001) thinning, as compared to RRMS. In both MS and controls, higher baseline age was associated with faster inner nuclear layer (INL) and outer nuclear layer (ONL) thinning. INL and ONL thinning were independently faster in PMS, as compared to controls (INL:−0.09 ± 0.04%/yr, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.03; ONL:−0.12 ± 0.06%/yr, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.04), and RRMS (INL:−0.10 ± 0.04%/yr, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.01; ONL:−0.13 ± 0.05%/yr, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.01), whereas they were similar in RRMS and controls. Unlike RRMS, disease‐modifying therapies (DMTs) did not impact rates of retinal layer atrophy in PMS.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PMS is associated with faster retinal atrophy independent of age. INL and ONL measures may be novel biomarkers of neurodegeneration in PMS that appear to be unaffected by conventional DMTs. The effects of aging on rates of retinal layer atrophy should be considered in clinical trials incorporating OCT outcomes. ANN NEUROL 2020&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Hippocampus: Toll‐like receptor 4 differentially regulates adult hippocampal neurogenesis in an age‐ and sex‐dependent manner</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/hipo.23209?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Toll‐like receptor 4 (TLR4) is primarily responsible for initiating an immune response following pathogen recognition. However, TLR4 is also expressed on neural progenitor cells and has been reported to regulate hippocampal neurogenesis as young male TLR4 knockout mice show increases in cell proliferation and doublecortin positive cells. Whether these effects occur in both sexes and are sustained with normal aging is currently unknown. The present study evaluated whether TLR4 deficiency alters adult hippocampal neurogenesis in young (3–4 months) and aged (18–20 months), male and female, TLR4 deficient (TLR4−/−; B6.B10ScN‐Tlr4lps‐del/JthJ) and wild type (WT) mice. Additionally, neurogenesis within the dorsal and the ventral hippocampal subdivisions was evaluated to determine if TLR4 has differential effects across the hippocampus. Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) was administered to quantify new cell survival as well as cell differentiation. Ki‐67 was measured to evaluate cell proliferation. Results show that young TLR4−/− females had higher rates of proliferation and neuronal differentiation in both the dorsal and ventral hippocampus relative to WT females. Young TLR4−/− males show elevated proliferation and neuronal differentiation mainly in the ventral hippocampus. While young TLR4−/− mice show enhanced neurogenesis compared to young WT mice, the increase was not apparent in the aged TLR4−/− mice. Both aged WT and TLR4−/− mice showed a decrease in proliferation, new cell survival, and neuronal differentiation compared to young WT and TLR4−/− mice. The data collectively indicate that TLR4 regulates hippocampal neurogenesis in young adults, but that these effects are region‐specific in males and that females show broader changes in neurogenesis throughout the hippocampus.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A major challenge in regenerative medicine is replacing cells lost through injury or disease. While significant progress has been made, much remains unknown about the accuracy of native regenerative programs in cell replacement. Here, we capitalized on the regenerative capacity and stereotypic retinal organization of zebrafish to determine the specificity with which retinal Müller glial cells replace lost neuronal cell types. By utilizing a targeted genetic ablation technique, we restricted death to all or to distinct cone photoreceptor types (red, blue or UV‐sensitive cones), enabling us to compare the composition of cones that are regenerated. We found that Müller glia produce cones of all types upon non‐discriminate ablation of these photoreceptors, or upon selective ablation of red or UV cones. Pan‐ablation of cones led to regeneration of the various cone types in relative abundances that resembled those of non‐ablated controls, i.e. red&amp;gt;green&amp;gt;UV ~ blue cones. Moreover, selective loss of red or UV cones biased production toward the cone type that was ablated. In contrast, ablation of blue cones alone largely failed to induce cone production at all, although it did induce cell division in Müller glia. The failure to produce cones upon selective elimination of blue cones may be due to their low abundance compared to other cone types. Alternatively, it may be that blue cone death alone does not trigger a change in progenitor competency to support cone genesis. Our findings add to the growing notion that cell replacement during regeneration does not perfectly mimic programs of cell generation during development.&lt;/p&gt;

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2020.00057</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Brain metabolic DNA (BMD) is continuously synthesized by reverse transcription in presynaptic synaptosomes and astroglia, and is partly transferred to nuclei after acquiring the double stranded configuration. Synthesis and turnover of BMD are markedly dependent on brain activity, as shown by circadian oscillations, environmental enrichment and impoverishment, and a variety of learning protocols. In rodents learning a two-way active avoidance task, BMD synthesis doubles, thus raising the possibility that sequences of learning BMD may differ from control BMD. The hypothesis has now been examined by sequencing cytoplasmic BMD. The present data indicate that most high-quality mapped BMD fragments hosting more than seven sequences are present in all mice. Three of them are exclusively present in learning BMD and four in control BMD. In addition, the annotated genes closest to them are mostly involved in modulating synaptic activity. The data support the conclusion that learning BMD sequences encode brain responses to the modified environment.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Positive Allosteric Modulation of CB1 Cannabinoid Receptor Signaling Enhances Morphine Antinociception and Attenuates Morphine Tolerance Without Enhancing Morphine- Induced Dependence or Reward</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2020.00054</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Opioid analgesics represent a critical treatment for chronic pain in the analgesic ladder of the World Health Organization. However, their use can result in a number of unwanted side-effects including incomplete efficacy, constipation, physical dependence, and overdose liability. Cannabinoids enhance the pain-relieving effects of opioids in preclinical studies and dampen unwanted side-effects resulting from excessive opioid intake. We recently reported that a CB&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; positive allosteric modulator (PAM) exhibits antinociceptive efficacy in models of pathological pain and lacks the adverse side effects of direct CB&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; receptor activation. In the present study, we evaluated whether a CB&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; PAM would enhance morphine’s therapeutic efficacy in an animal model of chemotherapy-induced neuropathic pain and characterized its impact on unwanted side-effects associated with chronic opioid administration. In paclitaxel-treated mice, both the CB&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; PAM GAT211 and the opioid analgesic morphine reduced paclitaxel-induced behavioral hypersensitivities to mechanical and cold stimulation in a dose-dependent manner. Isobolographic analysis revealed that combinations of GAT211 and morphine resulted in anti-allodynic synergism. In paclitaxel-treated mice, a sub-threshold dose of GAT211 prevented the development of tolerance to the anti-allodynic effects of morphine over 20 days of once daily dosing. However, GAT211 did not reliably alter somatic withdrawal signs (i.e., jumps, paw tremors) in morphine-dependent neuropathic mice challenged with naloxone. In otherwise naïve mice, GAT211 also prolonged antinociceptive efficacy of morphine in the tail-flick test and reduced the overall right-ward shift in the ED&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; for morphine to produce antinociception in the tail-flick test, consistent with attenuation of morphine tolerance. Pretreatment with GAT211 did not alter somatic signs of μ opioid receptor dependence in mice rendered dependent upon morphine via subcutaneous implantation of a morphine pellet. Moreover, GAT211 did not reliably alter μ-opioid receptor-mediated reward as measured by conditioned place preference to morphine. Our results suggest that a CB&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; PAM may be beneficial in enhancing and prolonging the therapeutic properties of opioids while potentially sparing unwanted side-effects (e.g., tolerance) that occur with repeated opioid treatment.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neural Technology: A Treatment Option for Symptomatic Chronic Complete Internal Carotid Artery Occlusion: Hybrid Surgery</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00392</link>
	<content:encoded>Background&lt;p&gt;Internal carotid artery occlusion (ICAO) is a relatively uncommon but important cause of transient ischemic attack and cerebral infarction. The majority of cases of symptomatic ICAO requires surgical treatment. In this study we performed an investigation of the efficacy and safety of hybrid surgery which is a surgical method for symptomatic chronic complete ICAO.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;Fifty-five patients with symptomatic chronic ICAO treated by hybrid surgery from 2016 to 2019 were included. We recorded and analyzed the patients’ clinical characteristics, angiographic data, recanalization rate, complications, and outcomes. Catheter angiography or computed tomography angiography was used to assess the patency of the recanalized ICA during follow-up.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;The total success rate of recanalization was 78.2% (43/55). The occlusions were significantly shorter in the success than failure group (5.40 ± 1.50 vs. 7.56 ± 0.99 cm, respectively; P &amp;lt; 0.001). The median duration of ICA occlusion was significantly shorter in the success than failure group (90 vs. 200 days, respectively). The success rates of distal ICA recanalization at the petrous segment or below, cavernous segment, and clinoid segment or above were 100, 33.3, and 14.3%, respectively (P &amp;lt; 0.001). Multivariate analysis showed that the level of distal ICA reconstitution was the only factor affecting the recanalization success rate. Periprocedural complications included hyperperfusion syndrome (n = 1) and laryngeal nerve injury (n = 1). ICA reocclusion occurred in one patient (2.3%). Significant postoperative improvement in symptoms was observed in the success group, with a median modified Rankin scale score of 0 at the 3-month follow-up compared with before recanalization (median, 1) (P&amp;lt;0.001).&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;Hybrid surgery might be safe and effective for patients with symptomatic chronic complete ICAO. The level of distal ICA reconstitution is a predictor of successful recanalization in hybrid operations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Multiple-Hit Hypothesis in Parkinson’s Disease: LRRK2 and Inflammation</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00376</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The multiple hit hypothesis for Parkinson’s disease (PD) suggests that an interaction between multiple (genetic and/or environmental) risk factors is needed to trigger the pathology. Leucine-Rich Repeat Kinase 2 (LRRK2) is an interesting protein to study in this context and is the focus of this review. More than 15 years of intensive research have identified several cellular pathways in which LRRK2 is involved, yet its exact physiological role or contribution to PD is not completely understood. Pathogenic mutations in LRRK2 are the most common genetic cause of PD but most likely require additional triggers to develop PD, as suggested by the reduced penetrance of the LRRK2 G2019S mutation. LRRK2 expression is high in immune cells such as monocytes, neutrophils, or dendritic cells, compared to neurons or glial cells and evidence for a role of LRRK2 in the immune system is emerging. This has led to the hypothesis that an inflammatory trigger is needed for pathogenic LRRK2 mutations to induce a PD phenotype. In this review, we will discuss the link between LRRK2 and inflammation and how this could play an active role in PD etiology.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Alterations of the Motor and Olfactory Functions Related to Parkinson’s Disease in Transgenic Mice With a VMAT2-Deficiency in Dopaminergic Neurons</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00356</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Parkinson’s disease (PD) is one of the most common neurodegenerative diseases, with approximately six million people affected worldwide. Vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2) dysfunction has recently become a hot topic in the pathophysiology of PD, and the advent of transgenic mice has also accelerated the development of behavioral studies in animal models. However, there are only a few systematic behavioral tests that embrace abundant motor and non-motor performance in a unique mutant mouse model which correspond to the varied symptoms observed in human PD. The aim of this study is to evaluate the responsibility of the unique reduction of dopamine in the varied motor and non-motor symptoms of PD via a transgenic mice model. We analyzed neurotransmitter concentrations in the brain tissue of 18-month-old mutant mice, with selective inactivation of one allele of Vmat2 in dopaminergic neurons (VMAT2&lt;sup&gt;DATcre&lt;/sup&gt;-HET) to confirm the selective reduction of dopamine, and then examined behavioral functions. Neurochemical tests showed lower dopamine concentrations in specific brain regions of VMAT2&lt;sup&gt;DATcre&lt;/sup&gt;-HET mice, especially the ventral tegmental area/substantia nigra and striatum, together with relatively unchanging concentrations of norepinephrine and serotonin, demonstrating the dopaminergic specificity of this mouse model. Behavioral tasks showed impairments in several motor functions and major defects in olfactory abilities in the VMAT2&lt;sup&gt;DATcre&lt;/sup&gt;-HET mice. However, no significant changes were found in the majority of non-motor tests, such as emotional performance and sleep patterns. We concluded from this study that the selective inactivation of one allele of the Vmat2 gene in dopaminergic neurons was related to dopamine reduction, resulting in phenotypes resembling some of the major deficits in PD, especially those of motor symptoms and olfactory functions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Toward the Understanding of Topographical and Spectral Signatures of Infant Movement Artifacts in Naturalistic EEG</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00352</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Electroencephalography (EEG) is perhaps the most widely used brain-imaging technique for pediatric populations. However, EEG signals are prone to distortion by motion. Compared to adults, infants’ motion is both more frequent and less stereotypical yet motion effects on the infant EEG signal are largely undocumented. Here, we present a systematic assessment of naturalistic motion effects on the infant EEG signal. EEG recordings were performed with 14 infants (12 analyzed) who passively watched movies whilst spontaneously producing periods of bodily movement and rest. Each infant produced an average of 38.3 s (SD = 14.7 s) of rest and 18.8 s (SD = 17.9 s) of single motion segments for the final analysis. Five types of infant motions were analyzed: Jaw movements, and Limb movements of the Hand, Arm, Foot, and Leg. Significant movement-related distortions of the EEG signal were detected using cluster-based permutation analysis. This analysis revealed that, relative to resting state, infants’ Jaw and Arm movements produced significant increases in beta (∼15 Hz) power, particularly over peripheral sites. Jaw movements produced more anteriorly located effects than Arm movements, which were most pronounced over posterior parietal and occipital sites. The cluster analysis also revealed trends toward decreased power in the theta and alpha bands observed over central topographies for all motion types. However, given the very limited quantity of infant data in this study, caution is recommended in interpreting these findings before subsequent replications are conducted. Nonetheless, this work is an important first step to inform future development of methods for addressing EEG motion-related artifacts. This work also supports wider use of naturalistic paradigms in social and developmental neuroscience.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: 3D-BoxSup: Positive-Unlabeled Learning of Brain Tumor Segmentation Networks From 3D Bounding Boxes</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00350</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Accurate segmentation is an essential task when working with medical images. Recently, deep convolutional neural networks achieved a state-of-the-art performance for many segmentation benchmarks. Regardless of the network architecture, the deep learning-based segmentation methods view the segmentation problem as a supervised task that requires a relatively large number of annotated images. Acquiring a large number of annotated medical images is time consuming, and high-quality segmented images (i.e., strong labels) crafted by human experts are expensive. In this paper, we have proposed a method that achieves competitive accuracy from a “weakly annotated” image where the weak annotation is obtained via a 3D bounding box denoting an object of interest. Our method, called “3D-BoxSup,” employs a positive-unlabeled learning framework to learn segmentation masks from 3D bounding boxes. Specially, we consider the pixels outside of the bounding box as positively labeled data and the pixels inside the bounding box as unlabeled data. Our method can suppress the negative effects of pixels residing between the true segmentation mask and the 3D bounding box and produce accurate segmentation masks. We applied our method to segment a brain tumor. The experimental results on the BraTS 2017 dataset (Menze et al., 2015; Bakas et al., 2017a,b,c) have demonstrated the effectiveness of our method.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00346</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Augmented reality (AR) enhances the user’s environment by projecting virtual objects into the real world in real-time. Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) are systems that enable users to control external devices with their brain signals. BCIs can exploit AR technology to interact with the physical and virtual world and to explore new ways of displaying feedback. This is important for users to perceive and regulate their brain activity or shape their communication intentions while operating in the physical world. In this study, twelve healthy participants were introduced to and asked to choose between two motor-imagery tasks: mental drawing and interacting with a virtual cube. Participants first performed a functional localizer run, which was used to select a single fNIRS channel for decoding their intentions in eight subsequent choice-encoding runs. In each run participants were asked to select one choice of a six-item list. A rotating AR cube was displayed on a computer screen as the main stimulus, where each face of the cube was presented for 6 s and represented one choice of the six-item list. For five consecutive trials, participants were instructed to perform the motor-imagery task when the face of the cube that represented their choice was facing them (therewith temporally encoding the selected choice). In the end of each run, participants were provided with the decoded choice based on a joint analysis of all five trials. If the decoded choice was incorrect, an active error-correction procedure was applied by the participant. The choice list provided in each run was based on the decoded choice of the previous run. The experimental design allowed participants to navigate twice through a virtual menu that consisted of four levels if all choices were correctly decoded. Here we demonstrate for the first time that by using AR feedback and flexible choice encoding in form of search trees, we can increase the degrees of freedom of a BCI system. We also show that participants can successfully navigate through a nested menu and achieve a mean accuracy of 74% using a single motor-imagery task and a single fNIRS channel.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neural Technology: Critical Review of Transcutaneous Vagus Nerve Stimulation: Challenges for Translation to Clinical Practice</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00284</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Several studies have illustrated that transcutaneous vagus nerve stimulation (tVNS) can elicit therapeutic effects that are similar to those produced by its invasive counterpart, vagus nerve stimulation (VNS). VNS is an FDA-approved therapy for the treatment of both depression and epilepsy, but it is limited to the management of more severe, intervention-resistant cases as a second or third-line treatment option due to perioperative risks involved with device implantation. In contrast, tVNS is a non-invasive technique that involves the application of electrical currents through surface electrodes at select locations, most commonly targeting the auricular branch of the vagus nerve (ABVN) and the cervical branch of the vagus nerve in the neck. Although it has been shown that tVNS elicits hypo- and hyperactivation in various regions of the brain associated with anxiety and mood regulation, the mechanism of action and influence of stimulation parameters on clinical outcomes remains predominantly hypothetical. Suppositions are largely based on correlations between the neurobiology of the vagus nerve and its effects on neural activity. However, tVNS has also been investigated for several other disorders, including tinnitus, migraine and pain, by targeting the vagus nerve at sites in both the ear and the neck. As most of the described methods differ in the parameters and protocols applied, there is currently no firm evidence on the optimal location for tVNS or the stimulation parameters that provide the greatest therapeutic effects for a specific condition. This review presents the current status of tVNS with a focus on stimulation parameters, stimulation sites, and available devices. For tVNS to reach its full potential as a non-invasive and clinically relevant therapy, it is imperative that systematic studies be undertaken to reveal the mechanism of action and optimal stimulation modalities.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Influence of 7T GRE-MRI Signal Compartment Model Choice on Tissue Parameters</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00271</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Quantitative assessment of tissue microstructure is important in studying human brain diseases and disorders. Ultra-high field magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data obtained using a multi-echo gradient echo sequence have been shown to contain information on myelin, axonal, and extracellular compartments in tissue. Quantitative assessment of water fraction, relaxation time (T&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;*), and frequency shift using multi-compartment models has been shown to be useful in studying white matter properties via specific tissue parameters. It remains unclear how tissue parameters vary with model selection based on 7T multiple echo time gradient-recalled echo (GRE) MRI data. We applied existing signal compartment models to the corpus callosum and investigated whether a three-compartment model can be reduced to two compartments and still resolve white matter parameters [i.e., myelin water fraction (MWF) and g-ratio]. We show that MWF should be computed using a three-compartment model in the corpus callosum, and the g-ratios obtained using three compartment models are consistent with previous reports. We provide results for other parameters, such as signal compartment frequency shifts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorder Using Central-Moment Features From Low- and High-Order Dynamic Resting-State Functional Connectivity Networks</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00258</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The sliding-window-based dynamic functional connectivity networks (D-FCNs) derived from resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) are effective methods for diagnosing various neurological diseases, including autism spectrum disorder (ASD). However, traditional D-FCNs are low-order networks based on pairwise correlation between brain regions, thus overlooking high-level interactions across multiple regions of interest (ROIs). Moreover, D-FCNs suffer from the temporal mismatching issue, i.e., subnetworks in the same temporal window do not have temporal correspondence across different subjects. To address the above problems, we first construct a novel high-order D-FCNs based on the principle of “correlation’s correlation” to further explore the higher level and more complex interaction relationships among multiple ROIs. Furthermore, we propose to use a central-moment method to extract temporal-invariance properties contained in either low- or high-order D-FCNs. Finally, we design and train an ensemble classifier by fusing the features extracted from conventional FCN, low-order D-FCNs, and high-order D-FCNs for the diagnosis of ASD and normal control subjects. Our method achieved the best ASD classification accuracy (83%), and our results revealed the features extracted from different networks fingerprinting the autistic brain at different connectional levels.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroinformatics: MonkeyCBP: A Toolbox for Connectivity-Based Parcellation of Monkey Brain</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fninf.2020.00014</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Non-human primate models are widely used in studying the brain mechanism underlying brain development, cognitive functions, and psychiatric disorders. Neuroimaging techniques, such as magnetic resonance imaging, play an important role in the examinations of brain structure and functions. As an indispensable tool for brain imaging data analysis, brain atlases have been extensively investigated, and a variety of versions constructed. These atlases diverge in the criteria based on which they are plotted. The criteria range from cytoarchitectonic features, neurotransmitter receptor distributions, myelination fingerprints, and transcriptomic patterns to structural and functional connectomic profiles. Among them, brainnetome atlas is tightly related to brain connectome information and built by parcellating the brain on the basis of the anatomical connectivity profiles derived from structural neuroimaging data. The pipeline for building the brainnetome atlas has been published as a toolbox named ATPP (A Pipeline for Automatic Tractography-Based Brain Parcellation). In this paper, we present a variation of ATPP, which is dedicated to monkey brain parcellation, to address the significant differences in the process between the two species. The new toolbox, MonkeyCBP, has major alterations in three aspects: brain extraction, image registration, and validity indices. By parcellating two different brain regions (posterior cingulate cortex) and (frontal pole) of the rhesus monkey, we demonstrate the efficacy of these alterations. The toolbox has been made public (https://github.com/bheAI/MonkeyCBP_CLI, https://github.com/bheAI/MonkeyCBP_GUI). It is expected that the toolbox can benefit the non-human primate neuroimaging community with high-throughput computation and low labor involvement.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Cortical Activation Patterns of Different Masking Noises and Correlation With Their Masking Efficacy, Determined by Functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00149</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Acoustic therapy in tinnitus treatment is poorly characterized, and efficacy assessment depends on subjective descriptions. Narrow-band noise, notched sound, and white noise have positive therapeutic effects on monotonous tinnitus. Considering the tonotopic characteristics of the auditory system and the spectral characteristics of these three masking sounds, the activation pattern of the auditory cortex and the mechanism of inhibiting tinnitus may be different. This study aimed to compare the activation patterns of three spectrally different masking noises and study the correlation between the masking effects and variational amplitude of oxygenated hemoglobin (HbO) in the corresponding cortical regions. We also assessed near-infrared spectroscopy brain function imaging (NIRS) as an objective assessment tool in acoustic therapy. Patients with persistent non-pulsatile tinnitus and control volunteers without tinnitus were enrolled in this study. The subjects were seated in a sound-proof room, with two optode arrays covering the bilateral temporal lobe. Auditory stimuli were presented; stimulation sequences followed the block design: different noises appeared randomly and repeated in five cycles. Tinnitus match and residual inhibition were performed in the tinnitus group. The data analyses were conducted using the NIRS_SPM toolbox. The group analysis results showed that the narrow-band noise caused a marginally significant decrease in HbO signal in the Brodmann 21 region (BA21), while white noise caused a significant increase in HbO signal in BA21. Notched sound did not cause significant changes in the HbO signal in the temporal cortex. And none of the three masking noises caused significant changes in the HbR signal in the temporal cortex. The depth of residual inhibition induced by the narrow-band noise and white noise significantly correlated with ΔHbO in the region of interest (ROI). However, neither the depth nor duration of the residual inhibition induced by notched sound correlated with the ΔHbO. Thus, NIRS showed three cortical activation patterns induced by three different masking noises, and correlations between residual inhibition effects and change of HbO amplitude were found. NIRS could therefore be applied in objective assessment of acoustic therapy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Functional Use of Directional Local Field Potentials in the Subthalamic Nucleus Deep Brain Stimulation</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00145</link>
	<content:encoded>Background&lt;p&gt;Directional deep brain stimulation (DBS) technology aims to address the limitations, such as stimulation-induced side effects, by delivering selective, focal modulation via segmented contacts. However, DBS programming becomes more complex and time-consuming for clinical feasibility. Local field potentials (LFPs) might serve a functional role in guiding clinical programming.&lt;/p&gt;Objective&lt;p&gt;In this pilot study, we investigated the spectral dynamics of directional LFPs in subthalamic nucleus (STN) and their relationship to motor symptoms of Parkinson’s disease (PD).&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;We recorded intraoperative STN-LFPs from 8-contact leads (Infinity-6172, Abbott Laboratories, Illinois, United States) in 8 PD patients at rest. Directional LFPs were referenced to their common average and time-frequency analysis was computed using a modified Welch periodogram method. The beta band (13–35 Hz) features were extracted and their correlation to preoperative UPDRS-III scores were assessed.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Normalized beta power (13–20 Hz) and normalized peak power (13–35 Hz) were found to be higher in anterior direction despite lack of statistical significance (p &amp;gt; 0.05). Results of the Spearman correlation analysis demonstrated positive trends with bradykinesia/rigidity in dorsoanterior direction (r = 0.659, p = 0.087) and with axial scores in the dorsomedial direction (r = 0.812, p = 0.072).&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;Given that testing all possible combinations of contact pairs and stimulation parameters is not feasible in a single clinic visit, spatio-spectral LFP dynamics obtained from intraoperative recordings might be used as an initial marker to select optimal contact(s).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Most Common Publication Types of Neuroimaging Literature: Papers With High Levels of Evidence Are on the Rise</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00136</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Objective: This study evaluated the bibliometric data of the most common publication types of the neuroimaging literature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: PubMed was searched to identify all published papers with “neuroimaging” as their MeSH Major Topics, and they were further searched by the following publication types: case report, clinical trial, comparative study, editorial, evaluation study, guideline, meta-analysis, multicenter study, randomized controlled trial, review, technical report, and validation study. The proportion of papers belonging to each publication type published in neuroimaging journals was calculated. Year-adjusted mean citation counts for each publication type were computed using data from Web of Science. Publication trend and its correlation with citation performance were assessed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Review and comparative study were the most common publication types. Publication types with the highest proportion in neuroimaging journals were guideline, validation study, and technical reports. Since the year 2000, multicenter study, review, and meta-analysis showed the strongest linear increase in annual publication count. These publication types also had the highest year-adjusted citation counts (4.7–10.0). Publication types with the lowest year-adjusted citation counts were editorial and case report (0.5–1.0). It was estimated that 12.5% of the publications labeled as case reports were incorrectly labeled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: Neuroimaging literature has been expanding with papers of higher levels of evidence, such as meta-analyses, multicenter studies, and randomized controlled trials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Neural Dynamics of Karaoke-Like Voice Imitation in Singing Performance</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00135</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Beyond normal and non-imitative singing, the imitation of the timbre of another singer’s voice, such as in Karaoke singing, involves the demanding reproduction of voice quality features and strongly depends on singing experience and practice. We show that precise voice imitation in a highly proficient and experienced vocal imitator, even in the absence of external auditory voice feedback, largely drew on internal cortico-subcortical auditory resources to control voicing errors based on imagined voice performance. Compared to the experienced vocal imitator, singers of a control group without experience in voice imitation used only sensorimotor feedback and demanding monitoring resources for imitation in the absence of voice feedback, a neural strategy that led, however, to a significantly poorer vocal performance. Thus, only long-term vocal imitation experience allows for the additional use of internal auditory brain resources, which result from training-induced brain plasticity, and which enable accurate vocal performance even under difficult performance conditions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Decreased Functional Connectivity Between the Left Amygdala and Frontal Regions Interferes With Reading, Emotional, and Executive Functions in Children With Reading Difficulties</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00104</link>
	<content:encoded>Introduction&lt;p&gt;Dyslexia is a reading disorder characterized by significant difficulty in reading, as well as reports of altered executive functions (EF). Children with reading difficulties (RD) experience a broad range of social and emotional problems. Recently it was suggested that children with RD have altered functional connections within the amygdala, which is related to emotional processing. Altered brain laterality related to reading was previously reported in children with RD. Hence, we sought to determine the differences in functional connectivity between the right and left emotional network as related to emotional challenges and the other reported difficulties in reading and EF in children with RD compared to typical readers.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;Sixty-four 8 to 12 year old children, 27 children with RD and 37 age-matched typical readers, participated in the study. Reading, emotional, and EF abilities were assessed. Global efficiency of the emotional network was calculated and compared between the groups, and left vs. right functional connectivity of the amygdala was tested using the CONN toolbox. Functional connectivity measures were then associated with measures of reading, emotional, and EF abilities.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Children with RD showed significantly decreased emotional and EF abilities compared to typical readers. A negative correlation between reading, emotional, and EF abilities was determined in both groups. Neuroimaging results showed decreased global efficiency measures within the emotional network in children with RD, who also showed lower functional connectivity between the amygdala and the left and right frontal pole regions. Results also indicated increased functional connectivity of the right vs. left amygdala with left and right pre-central and post-central gyri regions, which were related to decreased reading, emotional, and EF abilities in both typical readers and children with RD.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;The positive relationship between EF and emotional abilities in children with RD strengthens the relationship between EF difficulties and emotional stress, which in turn may lower EF abilities (monitoring, inhibition, and attention) as well as decreased reading abilities. The emotional challenges in children with RD were associated with decreased functional connectivity of the left amygdala with pre/post central gyrus and cognitive-control regions. These findings suggest that although the right hemisphere is thought to be related to emotional stress, it was the decreased control of the left hemisphere that was related to emotional disturbance in children with RD.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Photoreceptor Disc Enclosure Occurs in the Absence of Normal Peripherin-2/rds Oligomerization</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00092</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Mutations in the peripherin-2 gene (PRPH2, also known as rds) cause a heterogeneous range of autosomal dominant retinal diseases. PRPH2 encodes a photoreceptor-specific tetraspanin protein, PRPH2, that is a main structural component of the photoreceptor outer segment. PRPH2 distributes to the rims of outer segment disc membranes as they undergo the process of disc membrane enclosure. Within these rims, PRPH2 exists in homo-oligomeric form or as a hetero-oligomer with another tetraspanin protein, ROM1. While complete loss of PRPH2 prevents photoreceptor outer segment formation, mutations affecting the state of its oligomerization, including C150S, C213Y and Y141C, produce outer segment structural defects. In this study, we addressed whether any of these mutations also affect disc enclosure. We employed recently developed methodology for ultrastructural analysis of the retina, involving tissue processing with tannic acid, to assess the status of disc enclosure in knockin mouse models bearing either one or two alleles of the C150S, C213Y and Y141C PRPH2 mutations. While varying degrees of outer segment structural abnormalities were observed in each of these mouse models, they contained both newly forming “open” discs and mature “enclosed” discs. These data demonstrate that normal PRPH2 oligomerization is not essential for photoreceptor disc enclosure.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Critical Components for Spontaneous Activity and Rhythm Generation in Spinal Cord Circuits in Culture</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00081</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Neuronal excitability contributes to rhythm generation in central pattern generating networks (CPGs). In spinal cord CPGs, such intrinsic excitability partly relies on persistent sodium currents (I&lt;sub&gt;NaP&lt;/sub&gt;), whereas respiratory CPGs additionally depend on calcium-activated cation currents (I&lt;sub&gt;CAN&lt;/sub&gt;). Here, we investigated the contributions of I&lt;sub&gt;NaP&lt;/sub&gt; and I&lt;sub&gt;CAN&lt;/sub&gt; to spontaneous rhythm generation in neuronal networks of the spinal cord and whether they mainly involve Hb9 neurons. We used cultures of ventral and transverse slices from the E13–14 embryonic rodent lumbar spinal cord on multielectrode arrays (MEAs). All cultures showed spontaneous bursts of network activity. Blocking synaptic excitation with the AMPA receptor antagonist CNQX suppressed spontaneous network bursts and left asynchronous intrinsic activity at about 30% of the electrodes. Such intrinsic activity was completely blocked at all electrodes by both the I&lt;sub&gt;NaP&lt;/sub&gt; blocker riluzole as well as by the I&lt;sub&gt;CAN&lt;/sub&gt; blocker flufenamic acid (FFA) and the more specific TRPM4 channel antagonist 9-phenanthrol. All three antagonists also suppressed spontaneous bursting completely and strongly reduced stimulus-evoked bursts. Also, FFA reduced repetitive spiking that was induced in single neurons by injection of depolarizing current pulses to few spikes. Other antagonists of unspecific cation currents or calcium currents had no suppressing effects on either intrinsic activity (gadolinium chloride) or spontaneous bursting (the TRPC channel antagonists clemizole and ML204 and the T channel antagonist TTA-P2). Combined patch-clamp and MEA recordings showed that Hb9 interneurons were activated by network bursts but could not initiate them. Together these findings suggest that both I&lt;sub&gt;NaP&lt;/sub&gt; through Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-channels and I&lt;sub&gt;CAN&lt;/sub&gt; through putative TRPM4 channels contribute to spontaneous intrinsic and repetitive spiking in spinal cord neurons and thereby to the generation of network bursts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00112</link>
	<content:encoded>Objective&lt;p&gt;In this study, we assessed plasma biomarkers to identify cognitive impairment in Parkinson’s disease (PD) patients by applying ultra-sensitive immunomagnetic reduction-based immunoassay (IMR).&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;The study enrolled 60 PD patients and 28 age- and sex-matched normal controls. Complete cognitive function assessments were performed on participants using the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Clinical Dementia Rating. PD patients with an MMSE score of ≦26 were defined as having cognitive impairment. Meanwhile, a 99mTc-TRODAT-1 scan was performed and plasma levels of Aβ-40, Aβ-42, T-tau, and α-synuclein were evaluated using IMR, subsequent correlation analyses were then performed.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Compared with normal adults, PD patients have higher plasma levels of α-synuclein and T-tau, and a lower level of Aβ-40 (p &amp;lt; 0.05). Plasma levels of α-synuclein (r = −0.323, p = 0.002), Aβ-40 (r = 0.276, p = 0.01), and T-tau (r = −0.322, p = 0.002) are significantly correlated with MMSE scores. The TRODAT scan results, including visual inspection and quantification, revealed significant correlations between Aβ-40 and PD. Multiple regression analysis showed that the plasma levels of Aβ-40 (OR = 0.921, 95% CI = 0.879–0.962), α-synuclein (OR = 3.016, 95% CI = 1.703–5.339), and T-tau (OR = 1.069, 95% CI = 1.026–1.115) were independently associated with PD patients with cognitive impairment. The cutoff values for predicting cognitive deficits in PD patients were 45.101 pg/ml of Aβ-40, (Area under curve (AUC) = 0.791), 0.389 pg/ml of α-synuclein, (AUC = 0.790), and 30.555 pg/ml of T-tau (AUC = 0.726).&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;Plasma levels of α-synuclein, Aβ-40, and T-tau are potential biomarkers to detect cognitive impairment in PD patients.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Get Moving! Increases in Physical Activity Are Associated With Increasing Functional Connectivity Trajectories in Typically Aging Adults</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00104</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Background: Physical activity closely relates to cognition and brain structure as we age. However, the neural mechanisms underlying this relationship in humans remain less clear. Functional connectivity (FC), measured by task-free functional MRI (tf-fMRI) is a dynamic marker of network activity and may be a sensitive indicator of the brain’s response to exercise over time. We aimed to test the longitudinal relationship between physical activity and FC trajectories in functionally normal older adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Two hundred and twelve functionally normal, longitudinally-followed older adults completed the Physical Activity Scale for the Elderly (PASE) and tf-fMRI scans at each visit [mean = 1.5 visits (range:1–3)]. We studied FC of the default mode network (DMN), frontal-parietal (FP), subcortical networks (SubCort), and frontal-subcortical inter-network connectivity (FS), given that previous studies implicate these regions in age-related changes. Linear mixed-effects models examined the relationship between within-person changes in PASE and FC (in SD units), covarying for age, sex, education and systemic cardiovascular risk factors (heart rate, BMI and systolic blood pressure). We additionally examined models covarying for DTI fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) of tracts underlying networks of interest, as a marker of cerebrovascular disease. Furthermore, we examined the longitudinal relationship between PASE and neuropsychological trajectories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: In our first model, within-subject increases in physical activity tracked with increasing SubCort (β = 0.33, p = 0.007) and FS inter-network (β = 0.27, p = 0.03) synchrony, while between-subject parameters did not reach significance (β = −0.042 to −0.07, ps &amp;gt; 0.37). No significant longitudinal associations were observed between PASE and DMN (β = −0.02 p = 0.89) or FP networks (β = 0.15, p = 0.23). Adjusting for markers of cerebrovascular health (FA/MD) did not change estimated effects (SubCort: β = 0.31, p = 0.01, FS inter-network: β = 0.28, p = 0.03). Associations between changes in physical activity and neuropsychological trajectories were small (β = −0.14 to 0.002) and did not reach statistical significance (p-values &amp;gt;0.42).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: Our findings suggest that changes in exercise over time are specifically associated with frontal-subcortical processes in older adults. This relationship appears to be independent of cardio- or cerebrovascular disease, possibly driven by a more direct neural response to exercise.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Insula and Amygdala Atrophy Are Associated With Functional Impairment in Subjects With Presbycusis</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00102</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Hearing loss is an important risk factor for dementia. However, the mechanisms that relate these disorders are still unknown. As a proxy of this relationship, we studied the structural brain changes associated with functional impairment in activities of daily living in subjects with age related hearing loss, or presbycusis. One hundred eleven independent, non-demented subjects older than 65 years recruited in the ANDES cohort were evaluated using a combined approach including (i) audiological tests: hearing thresholds and cochlear function measured by pure tone averages and the distortion product otoacoustic emissions respectively; (ii) behavioral variables: cognitive, neuropsychiatric, and functional impairment in activities of daily living measured by validated questionnaires; and (iii) structural brain imaging—assessed by magnetic resonance imaging at 3 Tesla. The mean age of the recruited subjects (69 females) was 73.95 ± 5.47 years (mean ± SD) with an average educational level of 9.44 ± 4.2 years of schooling. According to the audiometric hearing thresholds and presence of otoacoustic emissions, we studied three groups: controls with normal hearing (n = 36), presbycusis with preserved cochlear function (n = 33), and presbycusis with cochlear dysfunction (n = 38). We found a significant association (R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.17) between the number of detected otoacoustic emissions and apathy symptoms. The presbycusis with cochlear dysfunction group had worse performance than controls in global cognition, language and executive functions, and severe apathy symptoms than the other groups. The neuropsychiatric symptoms and language deficits were the main determinants of functional impairment in both groups of subjects with presbycusis. Atrophy of insula, amygdala, and other temporal areas were related with functional impairment, apathy, and language deficits in the presbycusis with cochlear dysfunction group. We conclude that (i) the neuropsychiatric symptoms had a major effect on functional loss in subjects with presbycusis, (ii) cochlear dysfunction is relevant for the association between hearing loss and behavioral impairment, and (iii) atrophy of the insula and amygdala among other temporal areas are related with hearing loss and behavioral impairment.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Freezing of Speech Single Questionnaire as a Screening Tool for Cognitive Dysfunction in Patients With Dementia With Lewy Bodies</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00065</link>
	<content:encoded>Introduction&lt;p&gt;Freezing phenomenon is a striking feature of Parkinson’s disease. However, it has never been studied in people with dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). We designed a freezing of speech single questionnaire (FOSSQ) and investigated the frequency and association of freezing of speech (FOS) in patients with DLB and other types of dementia.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;This is a retrospective analysis of data from the project of history-based artificial intelligent computerized dementia diagnostic system. We compared the frequencies of FOS among non-demented (ND) participants, patients with Alzheimer’s disease (AD), vascular dementia (VaD), and DLB. Further, we explored the association factors of FOS in all the participants.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;We enrolled 666 individuals with the following disease distribution: 190, ND; 230, AD; 183, VaD; and 63, DLB. Compared to individuals with ND (2.1%), patients with AD (6.1%), or VaD (18.0%), DLB (54.0%) showed a significantly higher frequency of positive FOS (all p &amp;lt; 0.001). The association factors of FOS were older age, more severe dementia, more severe motor dysfunction, fluctuating cognition, visual hallucinations, parkinsonism, rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder, attention, mental manipulation, and language.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;Our study showed that the informant-based FOSSQ may be a practical screening tool for discriminating DLB from individuals with ND or other forms of dementia. The FOSSQ can be applied in clinical practice as well as on the artificial intelligent platform.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Many proteins contain multiple folded domains separated by flexible linkers, and the ability to describe the structure and conformational heterogeneity of such flexible systems pushes the limits of structural biology. Using the three-domain protein TIA-1 as an example, we here combine coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations with previously measured small-angle scattering data to study the conformation of TIA-1 in solution. We show that while the coarse-grained potential (Martini) in itself leads to too compact conformations, increasing the strength of protein-water interactions results in ensembles that are in very good agreement with experiments. We show how these ensembles can be refined further using a Bayesian/Maximum Entropy approach, and examine the robustness to errors in the energy function. In particular we find that as long as the initial simulation is relatively good, reweighting against experiments is very robust. We also study the relative information in X-ray and neutron scattering experiments and find that refining against the SAXS experiments leads to improvement in the SANS data. Our results suggest a general strategy for studying the conformation of multi-domain proteins in solution that combines coarse-grained simulations with small-angle X-ray scattering data that are generally most easy to obtain. These results may in turn be used to design further small-angle neutron scattering experiments that exploit contrast variation through &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H/&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;H isotope substitutions.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/xDoZmCABfRI&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Critical role of deadenylation in regulating poly(A) rhythms and circadian gene expression</title>

The mammalian circadian clock is deeply rooted in rhythmic regulation of gene expression. Rhythmic transcriptional control mediated by the circadian transcription factors is thought to be the main driver of mammalian circadian gene expression. However, mounting evidence has demonstrated the importance of rhythmic post-transcriptional controls, and it remains unclear how the transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms collectively control rhythmic gene expression. In mouse liver, hundreds of genes were found to exhibit rhythmicity in poly(A) tail length, and the poly(A) rhythms are strongly correlated with the protein expression rhythms. To understand the role of rhythmic poly(A) regulation in circadian gene expression, we constructed a parsimonious model that depicts rhythmic control imposed upon basic mRNA expression and poly(A) regulation processes, including transcription, deadenylation, polyadenylation, and degradation. The model results reveal the rhythmicity in deadenylation as the strongest contributor to the rhythmicity in poly(A) tail length and the rhythmicity in the abundance of the mRNA subpopulation with long poly(A) tails (a rough proxy for mRNA translatability). In line with this finding, the model further shows that the experimentally observed distinct peak phases in the expression of deadenylases, regardless of other rhythmic controls, can robustly cluster the rhythmic mRNAs by their peak phases in poly(A) tail length and abundance of the long-tailed subpopulation. This provides a potential mechanism to synchronize the phases of target gene expression regulated by the same deadenylases. Our findings highlight the critical role of rhythmic deadenylation in regulating poly(A) rhythms and circadian gene expression.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/n0oLaE6eQOI&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Immunoglobulin genes are formed through V(D)J recombination, which joins the variable (V), diversity (D), and joining (J) germline genes. Since variations in germline genes have been linked to various diseases, personalized immunogenomics focuses on finding alleles of germline genes across various patients. Although reconstruction of V and J genes is a well-studied problem, the more challenging task of reconstructing D genes remained open until the IgScout algorithm was developed in 2019. In this work, we address limitations of IgScout by developing a probabilistic MINING-D algorithm for D gene reconstruction, apply it to hundreds of immunosequencing datasets from multiple species, and validate the newly inferred D genes by analyzing diverse whole genome sequencing datasets and haplotyping heterozygous V genes.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/NHBGsoVGcSo&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Decentralized control of insect walking: A simple neural network explains a wide range of behavioral and neurophysiological results</title>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Malte Schilling, Holk Cruse&lt;/p&gt;

Controlling the six legs of an insect walking in an unpredictable environment is a challenging task, as many degrees of freedom have to be coordinated. Solutions proposed to deal with this task are usually based on the highly influential concept that (sensory-modulated) central pattern generators (CPG) are required to control the rhythmic movements of walking legs. Here, we investigate a different view. To this end, we introduce a sensor based controller operating on artificial neurons, being applied to a (simulated) insectoid robot required to exploit the “loop through the world” allowing for simplification of neural computation. We show that such a decentralized solution leads to adaptive behavior when facing uncertain environments which we demonstrate for a broad range of behaviors never dealt with in a single system by earlier approaches. This includes the ability to produce footfall patterns such as velocity dependent “tripod”, “tetrapod”, “pentapod” as well as various stable intermediate patterns as observed in stick insects and in Drosophila. These patterns are found to be stable against disturbances and when starting from various leg configurations. Our neuronal architecture easily allows for starting or interrupting a walk, all being difficult for CPG controlled solutions. Furthermore, negotiation of curves and walking on a treadmill with various treatments of individual legs is possible as well as backward walking and performing short steps. This approach can as well account for the neurophysiological results usually interpreted to support the idea that CPGs form the basis of walking, although our approach is not relying on explicit CPG-like structures. Application of CPGs may however be required for very fast walking. Our neuronal structure allows to pinpoint specific neurons known from various insect studies. Interestingly, specific common properties observed in both insects and crustaceans suggest a significance of our controller beyond the realm of insects.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/HZgZfDFb6Lg&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

In single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) experiments, the number of individual cells has increased exponentially, and the sequencing depth of each cell has decreased significantly. As a result, analyzing scRNA-seq data requires extensive considerations of program efficiency and method selection. In order to reduce the complexity of scRNA-seq data analysis, we present scedar, a scalable Python package for scRNA-seq exploratory data analysis. The package provides a convenient and reliable interface for performing visualization, imputation of gene dropouts, detection of rare transcriptomic profiles, and clustering on large-scale scRNA-seq datasets. The analytical methods are efficient, and they also do not assume that the data follow certain statistical distributions. The package is extensible and modular, which would facilitate the further development of functionalities for future requirements with the open-source development community. The scedar package is distributed under the terms of the MIT license at https://pypi.org/project/scedar.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/O6vNdbU77Dc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Antibodies are capable of potently and specifically binding individual antigens and, in some cases, disrupting their functions. The key challenge in generating antibody-based inhibitors is the lack of fundamental information relating sequences of antibodies to their unique properties as inhibitors. We develop a pipeline, Antibody Sequence Analysis Pipeline using Statistical testing and Machine Learning (ASAP-SML), to identify features that distinguish one set of antibody sequences from antibody sequences in a reference set. The pipeline extracts feature fingerprints from sequences. The fingerprints represent germline, CDR canonical structure, isoelectric point and frequent positional motifs. Machine learning and statistical significance testing techniques are applied to antibody sequences and extracted feature fingerprints to identify distinguishing feature values and combinations thereof. To demonstrate how it works, we applied the pipeline on sets of antibody sequences known to bind or inhibit the activities of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), a family of zinc-dependent enzymes that promote cancer progression and undesired inflammation under pathological conditions, against reference datasets that do not bind or inhibit MMPs. ASAP-SML identifies features and combinations of feature values found in the MMP-targeting sets that are distinct from those in the reference sets.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/m-Kl0J1aavU&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Oogenesis is a complex developmental process that involves spatiotemporally regulated coordination between the germline and supporting, somatic cell populations. This process has been modeled extensively using the &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; ovary. Although different ovarian cell types have been identified through traditional means, the large-scale expression profiles underlying each cell type remain unknown. Using single-cell RNA sequencing technology, we have built a transcriptomic data set for the adult &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; ovary and connected tissues. Using this data set, we identified the transcriptional trajectory of the entire follicle-cell population over the course of their development from stem cells to the oogenesis-to-ovulation transition. We further identify expression patterns during essential developmental events that take place in somatic and germline cell types such as differentiation, cell-cycle switching, migration, symmetry breaking, nurse-cell engulfment, egg-shell formation, and corpus luteum signaling. Extensive experimental validation of unique expression patterns in both ovarian and nearby, nonovarian cells also led to the identification of many new cell type–and stage-specific markers. The inclusion of several nearby tissue types in this data set also led to our identification of functional convergence in expression between distantly related cell types such as the immune-related genes that were similarly expressed in immune cells (hemocytes) and ovarian somatic cells (stretched cells) during their brief phagocytic role in nurse-cell engulfment. Taken together, these findings provide new insight into the temporal regulation of genes in a cell-type specific manner during oogenesis and begin to reveal the relatedness in expression between cell and tissues types.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/_4UTqoDvHbw&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Operant conditioning (OC) is a classical paradigm and a standard technique used in experimental psychology in which animals learn to perform an action to achieve a reward. By using this paradigm, it is possible to extract learning curves and measure accurately reaction times (RTs). Both these measurements are proxy of cognitive capabilities and can be used to evaluate the effectiveness of therapeutic interventions in mouse models of disease. Here, we describe a fully 3D printable device that is able to perform OC on freely moving mice, while performing real-time tracking of the animal position. We successfully trained six mice, showing stereotyped learning curves that are highly reproducible across mice and reaching &amp;gt;70% of accuracy after 2 d of conditioning. Different products for OC are commercially available, though most of them do not provide customizable features and are relatively expensive. This data demonstrate that this system is a valuable alternative to available state-of-the-art commercial devices, representing a good balance between performance, cost, and versatility in its use.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eNeuro: Impaired Motor Recycling during Action Selection in Parkinsons Disease</title>
	<link>http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/7/2/ENEURO.0492-19.2020?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Behavioral studies have shown that the human motor system recycles motor parameters of previous actions, such as movement amplitude, when programming new actions. Shifting motor plans toward a new action forms a particularly severe problem for patients with Parkinson’s disease (PD), a disorder that, in its early stage, is dominated by basal ganglia dysfunction. Here, we test whether this action selection deficit in Parkinson’s patients arises from an impaired ability to recycle motor parameters shared across subsequent actions. Parkinson’s patients off dopaminergic medication (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 16) and matched healthy controls (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 16) performed a task that involved moving a handheld dowel over an obstacle in the context of a sequence of aiming movements. Consistent with previous research, healthy participants continued making unnecessarily large hand movements after clearing the obstacle (defined as &quot;hand path priming effect&quot;), even after switching movements between hands. In contrast, Parkinson’s patients showed a reduced hand path priming effect, i.e., they performed biomechanically more efficient movements than controls, but only when switching movements between hands. This effect correlated with disease severity, such that patients with more severe motor symptoms had a smaller hand path priming effect. We propose that the basal ganglia mediate recycling of movement parameters across subsequent actions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/7/2/ENEURO.0088-20.2020?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The pond snail &lt;i&gt;Lymnaea stagnalis&lt;/i&gt; learns conditioned taste aversion (CTA) and consolidates it into long-term memory (LTM). One-day food-deprived snails (day 1 snails) show the best CTA learning and memory, whereas more severely food-deprived snails (5 d) do not express good memory. However, previous studies showed that CTA-LTM was indeed formed in 5-d food-deprived snails (day 5 snails), but its recall was prevented by the effects of food deprivation. CTA-LTM recall in day 5 snails was expressed following 7 d of feeding and then 1 d of food deprivation (day 13 snails). In the present study, we thus hypothesized that memory recall occurs because day 13 snails are in an optimal internal state. One day of food deprivation before the memory test in day 13 snails increased the mRNA level of molluscan insulin-related peptide (MIP) in the CNS. Thus, we further hypothesized that an injection of insulin into day 5 snails following seven additional days with access to food (day 12 snails) activates CTA neurons and mimics the food deprivation state before the memory test in day 13 snails. Day 12 snails injected with insulin could recall the memory. In addition, the simultaneous injection of an anti-insulin receptor antibody and insulin into day 12 snails did not allow memory recall. Insulin injection also decreased the hemolymph glucose concentration. Together, the results suggest that an optimal internal state (i.e., a spike in insulin release and specific glucose levels) are necessary for LTM recall following CTA training in snails.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/7/2/ENEURO.0014-20.2020?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;The goal of this study is to investigate how the activation location of persistent inward current (PIC) over motoneuron dendrites is linked to motor output in the closed-loop motor unit. Here, a physiologically realistic model of a motor unit including afferent inputs from muscle spindles was comprehensively analyzed under intracellular stimulation at the soma and synaptic inputs over the dendrites during isometric contractions over a full physiological range of muscle lengths. The motor output of the motor unit model was operationally assessed by evaluating the rate of force development, the degree of force potentiation and the capability of self-sustaining force production. Simulations of the model motor unit demonstrated a tendency for a faster rate of force development, a greater degree of force potentiation, and greater capacity for self-sustaining force production under both somatic and dendritic stimulation of the motoneuron as the PIC channels were positioned farther from the soma along the path of motoneuron dendrites. Interestingly, these effects of PIC activation location on force generation significantly differed among different states of muscle length. The rate of force development and the degree of force potentiation were systematically modulated by the variation of PIC channel location for shorter-than-optimal muscles but not for optimal and longer-than-optimal muscles. Similarly, the warm-up behavior of the motor unit depended on the interplay between PIC channel location and muscle length variation. These results suggest that the location of PIC activation over motoneuron dendrites may be distinctively reflected in the motor performance during shortening muscle contractions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eNeuro: Reduced TUBA1A Tubulin Causes Defects in Trafficking and Impaired Adult Motor Behavior</title>
	<link>http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/7/2/ENEURO.0045-20.2020?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Newly born neurons express high levels of TUBA1A α-tubulin to assemble microtubules for neurite extension and to provide tracks for intracellular transport. In the adult brain, &lt;i&gt;Tuba1a&lt;/i&gt; expression decreases dramatically. A mouse that harbors a loss-of-function mutation in the gene encoding TUBA1A (&lt;i&gt;Tuba1a&lt;sup&gt;ND/+&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt;) allows us to ask whether TUBA1A is important for the function of mature neurons. α-Tubulin levels are about half of wild type in juvenile &lt;i&gt;Tuba1a&lt;sup&gt;ND/+&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt; brains, but are close to normal in older animals. In postnatal day (P)0 cultured neurons, reduced TUBA1A allows for assembly of less microtubules in axons resulting in more pausing during organelle trafficking. While &lt;i&gt;Tuba1a&lt;sup&gt;ND/+&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt; mouse behavior is indistinguishable from wild-type siblings at weaning, &lt;i&gt;Tuba1a&lt;sup&gt;ND/+&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt; mice develop adult-onset ataxia. Neurons important for motor function in &lt;i&gt;Tuba1a&lt;sup&gt;ND/+&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt; remain indistinguishable from wild-type with respect to morphology and number and display no evidence of axon degeneration. &lt;i&gt;Tuba1a&lt;sup&gt;ND/+&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt; neuromuscular junction (NMJ) synapses are the same size as wild-type before the onset of ataxia, but are reduced in size in older animals. Together, these data indicate that the TUBA1A-rich microtubule tracks that are assembled during development are essential for mature neuron function and maintenance of synapses over time.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neural Technology: Tactile Feedback in Closed-Loop Control of Myoelectric Hand Grasping: Conveying Information of Multiple Sensors Simultaneously via a Single Feedback Channel</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00348</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The appropriate sensory information feedback is important for the success of an object grasping and manipulation task. In many scenarios, the need arises for multiple feedback information to be conveyed to a prosthetic hand user simultaneously. The multiple sets of information may either (1) directly contribute to the performance of the grasping or object manipulation task, such as the feedback of the grasping force, or (2) simply form additional independent set(s) of information. In this paper, the efficacy of simultaneously conveying two independent sets of sensor information (the grasp force and a secondary set of information) through a single channel of feedback stimulation (vibrotactile via bone conduction) to the human user in a prosthetic application is investigated. The performance of the grasping task is not dependent to the second set of information in this study. Subject performance in two tasks: regulating the grasp force and identifying the secondary information, were evaluated when provided with either one corresponding information or both sets of feedback information. Visual feedback is involved in the training stage. The proposed approach is validated on human-subject experiments using a vibrotactile transducer worn on the elbow bony landmark (to realize a non-invasive bone conduction interface) carried out in a virtual reality environment to perform a closed-loop object grasping task. The experimental results show that the performance of the human subjects on either task, whilst perceiving two sets of sensory information, is not inferior to that when receiving only one set of corresponding sensory information, demonstrating the potential of conveying a second set of information through a bone conduction interface in an upper limb prosthetic task.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Using fMRI to Assess Brain Activity in People With Down Syndrome: A Systematic Review</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00147</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Background: In the last few years, many investigations have focused on brain activity in general and in populations with different pathologies using non-invasive techniques such as electroencefalography (EEG), positron emission tomography (PET), functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). However, the use of non-invasive techniques to detect brain signals to evaluate the cognitive activity of people with Down syndrome (DS) has not been sufficiently addressed. The objective of this study is to describe the state-of-the-art in fMRI techniques for recording brain signals in people with DS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Method: A systematic review was performed based on PRISMA recommendations; only nine papers on this topic have been published. Three independent researchers selected all relevant information from each paper. Analyses of information concordance showed a high value of agreement between researchers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Although few relevant works have been published, the use of fMRI in people with DS is becoming an appropriate option to study brain function in this population. Of the nine identified papers, five used task designs, and four used resting-state paradigms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: Thus, we emphasize the need to incorporate rigorous cognitive activity procedures in evaluations of the DS population. We suggest several factors (such as head correction movements and paired sample techniques) that must be considered when designing an fMRI study with a task or a resting-state paradigm in a DS population.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neural Circuits: Nonspecific Expression in Limited Excitatory Cell Populations in Interneuron-Targeting Cre-driver Lines Can Have Large Functional Effects</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncir.2020.00016</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Transgenic Cre-recombinase expressing mouse lines are widely used to express fluorescent proteins and opto-/chemogenetic actuators, making them a cornerstone of modern neuroscience. The investigation of interneurons in particular has benefitted from the ability to genetically target specific cell types. However, the specificity of some Cre driver lines has been called into question. Here, we show that nonspecific expression in a subset of hippocampal neurons can have substantial nonspecific functional effects in a somatostatin-Cre (SST-Cre) mouse line. Nonspecific targeting of CA3 pyramidal cells caused large optogenetically evoked excitatory currents in remote brain regions. Similar, but less severe patterns of nonspecific expression were observed in a widely used SST-IRES-Cre line, when crossed with a reporter mouse line. Viral transduction on the other hand yielded more specific expression but still resulted in nonspecific expression in a minority of pyramidal layer cells. These results suggest that a careful analysis of specificity is mandatory before the use of Cre driver lines for opto- or chemogenetic manipulation approaches.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>How did brains evolve to become so complex, and what is their future? Brains pose an explanatory challenge because entropy, which inexorably increases over time, is commonly associated with disorder and simplicity. Recently we showed how evolution is an entropic process, building structures – organisms – which themselves facilitate entropy growth. Here we suggest that key transitional points in evolution extended organisms’ reach into space and time, opening channels into new regions of a complex multi-dimensional state space that also allow entropy to increase.</content:encoded>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Clinico‐genetic, imaging and molecular delineation of COQ8A‐ataxia: 
a multicenter study of 59 patients</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25751?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To foster trial‐readiness of COQ8A‐ataxia, we map the clinico‐genetic, molecular and neuroimaging spectrum of COQ8A‐ataxia in a large worldwide cohort, and provide first progression data, including treatment response to coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cross‐modal analysis of a multicenter cohort of 59 COQ8A patients, including genotype–phenotype correlations, 3D‐protein modelling, &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; mutation analyses, MRI markers, disease progression and CoQ&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; response data.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;59 patients (39 novel) with 44 pathogenic &lt;i&gt;COQ8A&lt;/i&gt; variants (18 novel) were identified. Missense variants demonstrated a pleiotropic range of detrimental effects upon protein modelling and &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; analysis of purified variants. COQ8A‐ataxia presented as variable multisystemic, early‐onset cerebellar ataxia, with complicating features ranging from epilepsy (32%) and cognitive impairment (49%) to exercise intolerance (25%) and hyperkinetic movement disorders (41%), including dystonia and myoclonus as presenting symptoms. Multisystemic involvement was more prevalent in missense than biallelic loss‐of‐function variants (82–93% vs. 53%, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.029). Cerebellar atrophy was universal on MRI (100%), with cerebral atrophy or dentate and pontine T2 hyperintensities observed in 28%. Cross‐sectional (n = 34) and longitudinal (n = 7) assessments consistently indicated mild‐to‐moderate progression of ataxia (SARA: 0.45/year). CoQ&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; treatment led to improvement by clinical report in 14/30 patients, and by quantitative longitudinal assessments in 8/11 patients (SARA: −0.81/year). Explorative sample size calculations indicate that ≥48 patients per arm may suffice to demonstrate efficacy for interventions that reduce progression by 50%.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study provides a deeper understanding of the disease, and paves the way towards large‐scale natural history studies and treatment trials in COQ8A‐ataxia.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: Afferent and efferent connections of the nucleus prethalamicus in the yellowfin goby Acanthogobius flavimanus</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/cne.24935?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;img alt=&quot;Afferent and efferent connections of the nucleus prethalamicus in the yellowfin goby Acanthogobius flavimanus&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/5a7e3cd2-f032-4c42-859a-4a451f7fb3b2/cne24935-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The nucleus prethalamicus (PTh) of the yellowfin goby relays visual information from the optic tectum to as many as thirteen regions of the telencephalon that is amazingly well‐compartmentalized in the goby. The goby is a promising model fish for studying telencephalic circuitries involved in the processing of visual information.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The nucleus prethalamicus (PTh) receives fibers from the optic tectum and then projects to the dorsal telencephalon in the yellowfin goby &lt;i&gt;Acanthogobius flavimanus&lt;/i&gt;. However, it remained unclear whether the PTh is a visual relay nucleus, because the optic tectum receives not only visual but also other sensory modalities. Furthermore, precise telencephalic regions receiving prethalamic input remained unknown in the goby. We therefore investigated the full set of afferent and efferent connections of the PTh by direct tracer injections into the nucleus. Injections into the PTh labeled cells in the optic tectum, ventromedial thalamic nucleus, central and medial parts of the dorsal telencephalon, and caudal lobe of the cerebellum. We found that the somata of most tecto‐prethalamic neurons are present in the stratum periventriculare. Their dendrites ascend to reach the major retinorecipient layers of the tectum. The PTh is composed of two subnuclei (medial and lateral) and topographic organization was appreciated only for tectal projections to the lateral subnucleus (PTh‐l), which also receives sparse retinal projections. In contrast, the medial subnucleus receives fibers only from the medial tectum. We found that the PTh projects to nine subregions in the dorsal telencephalon and four in the ventral telencephalon. Furthermore, cerebellar injections revealed that cerebello‐prethalamic fibers cross the midline twice to innervate the PTh‐l on both sides. The present study is the first detailed report on the full set of the connections of PTh, which suggests that the PTh relays visual information from the optic tectum to the telencephalon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Cataglyphis&lt;/i&gt; ants are known for their outstanding navigational abilities. They return to their inconspicuous nest after far‐reaching foraging trips using path integration, and whenever available, learn and memorize visual features of panoramic sceneries. To achieve this, the ants combine directional visual information from celestial cues and panoramic scenes with distance information from an intrinsic odometer. The largely vision‐based navigation in &lt;i&gt;Cataglyphis&lt;/i&gt; requires sophisticated neuronal networks to process the broad repertoire of visual stimuli. Although &lt;i&gt;Cataglyphis&lt;/i&gt; ants have been subject to many neuroethological studies, little is known about the general neuronal organization of their central brain and the visual pathways beyond major circuits. Here, we provide a comprehensive, three‐dimensional neuronal map of synapse‐rich neuropils in the brain of &lt;i&gt;Cataglyphis nodus&lt;/i&gt; including major connecting fiber systems. In addition, we examined neuronal tracts underlying the processing of visual information in more detail. This study revealed a total of 33 brain neuropils and 30 neuronal fiber tracts including six distinct tracts between the optic lobes and the cerebrum. We also discuss the importance of comparative studies on insect brain architecture for a profound understanding of neuronal networks and their function.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Frontotemporal Dementia: Correlations Between Psychiatric Symptoms and Pathology</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25739?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pathology of frontotemporal dementia, termed frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD), is characterized by distinct molecular classes of aggregated proteins, the most common being TAR DNA‐binding protein‐43 (TDP‐43), tau, and fused in sarcoma (FUS). With a few exceptions, it is currently not possible to predict the underlying pathology based on the clinical syndrome. In this study, we set out to investigate the relationship between pathological and clinical presentation at single symptom level, including neuropsychiatric features.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The presence or absence of symptoms from the current clinical guidelines, together with neuropsychiatric features, such as hallucinations and delusions, were scored and compared across pathological groups in a cohort of 150 brain donors.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our cohort consisted of 68.6% FTLD donors (35.3% TDP‐43, 28% tau, and 5.3% FUS) and 31.3% non‐FTLD donors with a clinical diagnosis of frontotemporal dementia and a different pathological substrate, such as Alzheimer's disease (23%). The presence of hyperorality points to FTLD rather than non‐FTLD pathology (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001). Within the FTLD group, hallucinations in the initial years of the disease were related to TDP‐43 pathology (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.02), including but not limited to chromosome 9 open reading frame 72 (&lt;i&gt;C9orf72&lt;/i&gt;) repeat expansion carriers. The presence of perseverative or compulsive behavior was more common in the TDP‐B and TDP‐C histotypes (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.002).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our findings indicate that neuropsychiatric features are common in FTLD and form an important indicator of underlying pathology. In order to allow better inclusion of patients in targeted molecular trials, the routine evaluation of patients with frontotemporal dementia should include the presence and nature of neuropsychiatric symptoms.

	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jnr.24619?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sleep is an evolutionarily conserved and powerful drive, although its complete functions are still unknown. One possible function of sleep is that it promotes brain development. The amount of sleep is greatest during ages when the brain is rapidly developing, and sleep has been shown to influence critical period plasticity. This supports a role for sleep in brain development and suggests that abnormal sleep in early life may lead to abnormal development. Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is the most prevalent neurodevelopmental disorder in the United States. It is estimated that insomnia affects 44%–86% of the ASD population, predicting the severity of ASD core symptoms and associated behavioral problems. Sleep problems impact the quality of life of both ASD individuals and their caregivers, thus it is important to understand why they are so prevalent. In this review, we explore the role of sleep in early life as a causal factor in ASD. First, we review fundamental steps in mammalian sleep ontogeny and regulation and how sleep influences brain development. Next, we summarize current knowledge gained from studying sleep in animal models of ASD. Ultimately, our goal is to highlight the importance of understanding the role of sleep in brain development and the use of animal models to provide mechanistic insight into the origin of sleep problems in ASD.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;img alt=&quot;Tomosyn regulates the small RhoA GTPase to control the dendritic stability of neurons and the surface expression of AMPA receptors&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/d717ef53-f5a1-4bd5-ad6a-837058a29a26/jnr24608-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tomosyn inhibits RhoA activity via WD40 motif to regulate dendritic stability. Silence or autism spectrum disorder‐associated variants of tomosyn result in reduced dendritic complexity and surface expression of AMPA receptors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tomosyn, a protein encoded by syntaxin‐1‐binding protein 5 (&lt;i&gt;STXBP5&lt;/i&gt;) gene, has a well‐established presynaptic role in the inhibition of neurotransmitter release and the reduction of synaptic transmission by its canonical interaction with the soluble &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;‐ethylmaleimide‐sensitive factor attachment protein receptor machinery. However, the postsynaptic role of tomosyn in dendritic arborization, spine stability, and trafficking of ionotropic glutamate receptors remains to be elucidated. We used short hairpin RNA to knock down tomosyn in mouse primary neurons to evaluate the postsynaptic cellular function and molecular signaling regulated by tomosyn. Knockdown of tomosyn led to an increase of RhoA GTPase activity accompanied by compromised dendritic arborization, loss of dendritic spines, decreased surface expression of AMPA receptors, and reduced miniature excitatory postsynaptic current frequency. Inhibiting RhoA signaling was sufficient to rescue the abnormal dendritic morphology and the surface expression of AMPA receptors. The function of tomosyn regulating RhoA is mediated through the N‐terminal WD40 motif, where two variants each carrying a single nucleotide mutation in this region were found in individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). We demonstrated that these variants displayed loss‐of‐function phenotypes. Unlike the wild‐type tomosyn, these two variants failed to restore the reduced dendritic complexity, spine density, as well as decreased surface expression of AMPA receptors in tomosyn knockdown neurons. This study uncovers a novel role of tomosyn in maintaining neuronal function by inhibiting RhoA activity. Further analysis of tomosyn variants also provides a potential mechanism for explaining cellular pathology in ASD.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

&lt;p&gt;Potential molecular mechanism by which pfn1 regulates microglia polarization and hypoxia/ischemia injuries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microglial polarization to the anti‐inflammatory M2 phenotype is essential in resolving neuroinflammation, making it a promising therapeutic strategy for stroke intervention. The actin cytoskeleton is known to be important for the physiological functions of microglia, including migration and phagocytosis. Profilin 1 (PFN1), an actin‐binding protein, is involved in the dynamic transformation and reorganization of actin. However, the role of PFN1 in microglial polarization and ischemia/reperfusion injury is unclear. The role of PFN1 on microglial polarization was examined &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; in BV2 microglial cells subjected to oxygen‐glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGDR) and &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; in male mice after transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). Knockdown of PFN1 inhibited M1 microglial polarization and promoted M2 microglia polarization 48 hr after OGDR stimulation in BV2 cells and 7 days after MCAO‐induced injury in male mice. RhoA/ROCK pathway was involved in the regulation of PFN1 during microglial polarization. Knockdown of PFN1 also significantly attenuated brain infarcts and edema, improved cerebral blood flow and neurological deficits in MCAO‐injured mice. Inhibition of PFN1 effectively protected the brain against ischemia/reperfusion injuries by promoting M2 microglial polarization &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Chronic&lt;/i&gt; reduction in luteinizing hormone and testosterone (gonadotropin deficiency and hypogonadism). Neuroendocrine dysfunction and mild traumatic brain injury associated with mental health disorder (MHD) diagnosis. Long‐term neuroendocrine dysregulation in a deployed, chronically stressed military population associated with MHDs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) has been linked to mental health disorders (MHDs) and pituitary function alterations. Due to the complex relationship of mTBI, the neuroendocrine system, and MHDs, we propose that neuroendocrine dysfunction (NED) may play a role in negative long‐term health outcomes. The goal of this study was to determine if blast‐concussed service members (SMs) have a stronger likelihood of developing NED. We hypothesized that NED either pre‐ or post‐injury is associated with poor mental and physical health outcomes. Serum samples from the Armed Forces Health Surveillance Branch were obtained from concussed (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 59) and non‐concussed (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 72) SMs treated at the Concussion Restoration Care Center (CRCC) in Afghanistan. Serum was collected within 2 years prior to deployment and one or two times within 3 years following their CRCC visit. Samples were analyzed for luteinizing hormone (LH), testosterone, human growth hormone, cortisol, and prolactin to assess post‐injury neuroendocrine function. Results indicate that SMs who incurred an mTBI exhibited long‐term LH and testosterone deficiencies 3 years following injury compared to controls. Specifically, 47.6% of head‐injured SMs displayed hypofunction in at least one of five hormones at 3 years post‐injury. Anxiety disorders were the most common MHD observed in concussed SMs with hypopituitarism, while there was also a trend for SMs with chronic pituitary dysfunction to have MHD diagnoses. Findings indicate blast‐related mTBI may be associated with long‐term health outcomes following a period of incubation. Neuroendocrine screenings may increase treatment opportunities, inform rehabilitation strategies, and improve overall quality of life for patients.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

&lt;p&gt;The efficacy of circadian manipulation on affective and socio‐cognitive functions were studied in ventral subicular lesioned (VSL) rat model of cognitive impairment. Bilateral VSL resulted in anxiety, depression, and impaired social behavior. Further, these VSL‐induced behavioral deficits were ameliorated by exposure to short photoperiod (06/18 hr light‐dark cycle) for 21 days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Photoperiod (day‐length) has enduring effects on an organism's physiological functions like metabolism and behavioral phenotypes including cognition and affect. Circadian rhythm manipulations are potentially effective non‐pharmacological strategies in the management of central nervous system insults. In our previous study, we demonstrated the efficacy of short photoperiod regime (SPR; 06/18 hr light‐dark cycle) in establishing functional recovery in ventral subicular lesion (VSL) rats. The present study further demonstrates the efficacy of SPR in mitigating anxiety and depression as well as facilitating socio‐cognitive behavior in VSL rats. VSL elevated the basal plasma corticosterone levels, increased anxiety, anhedonia, and behavioral despair with decreased self‐care. The VSL rats also exhibited a considerable degree of impaired social cognition, in terms of altered social preference and social novelty. Exposure to SPR for 21 days mitigated the anxiety‐ and depressive‐like phenotypes as well as improved social cognition significantly. Thus, the study demonstrated the effectiveness of SPR strategy in reversing most of the behavioral deficits caused by VSL. SPR, perhaps, would have regulated the hypothalamo‐pituitary‐adrenal axis responsiveness as we observed a decrease in plasma corticosterone levels following SPR in VSL rats. The study implies the need for developing a task‐dependent SPR strategy to achieve complete behavioral recovery as the functional demands of each behavior is distinct. In summary, the study highlights the efficacy of photoperiod manipulation as a novel, non‐pharmacological approach in mitigating the affective and cognitive deficits associated with neuropsychiatric disorders such as bipolar disorder and Alzheimer's disease wherein circadian rhythm alterations are implicated.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;img alt=&quot;The neural correlates of mindfulness‐induced depression reduction in adults with autism spectrum disorder: A pilot study&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/f99f8c07-5e54-4185-b095-8ccade818924/jnr24600-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mindfulness‐based therapy reduces depression in adults with autism and increases middle cingulate cortex activation during self‐reflection. Greater reductions in depression were associated with greater increases in middle cingulate activation, suggesting a potential therapeutic mechanism of mindfulness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adults with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) experience high rates of depression and anxiety, and some evidence suggests mindfulness‐based stress reduction (MBSR) is effective in reducing these symptoms. However, the neural mechanisms of symptom alleviation, and benefit of MBSR beyond education/support groups are unknown. Maladaptive forms of self‐reflection are linked to ASD, depression, and anxiety. In this pilot study, we hypothesized (a) MBSR would reduce depression and anxiety in adults with ASD and (b) a mechanism of symptom alleviation would be increased blood oxygen level‐dependent signal in neural self‐reflection hubs. Twenty‐eight adults were randomly assigned to an 8‐week MBSR group (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 15) or a support group (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 13) that met for the same amount of time with relaxation education materials. Based on previous self‐reflection literature in ASD, regions of interest (ROIs) were middle cingulate cortex (MCC) and ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC). Only the MBSR group demonstrated significant reductions in depression, and neither group significantly changed in anxiety. Only the MBSR group increased activity of right MCC during self‐reflection, and the increase correlated with depression alleviation. There were no changes in vmPFC for the MBSR group or either ROI for the support/education group. Seed‐to‐voxel connectivity analysis revealed that only the MBSR group increased functional connectivity between right MCC and pre/postcentral gyrus, suggesting MBSR may increase primary sensorimotor input to higher order cognitive brain regions. Taken together, MBSR may be effective for reducing depression in adults with ASD, and the neural mechanism may be increasing frontal circuit involvement during self‐directed thought.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

&lt;p&gt;Electrical synapses in animals can display considerable variability in their permeability and conductances. This study documents how adenosine triphosphate exposure can significantly increase both of these measures in the nervous system of the medicinal leech. These findings highlight a robust mechanism for modifying neuronal circuits and which allows the rapid recruitment of neurons into active networks and promotes the entrainment of synchronized bursting activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gap junctions (GJs) are widely distributed in brains across the animal kingdom. To visualize the GJ‐ coupled networks of two major mechanosensory neurons in the ganglia of medicinal leeches, we injected these cells with the GJ‐permeable tracer Neurobiotin. When diffusion time was limited to only 30 min, tracer coupling was highly variable for both cells, suggesting a possible modulation of GJ permeability. In invertebrates the innexins (homologs of vertebrate pannexins) form the GJs. Because extracellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP) modulates pannexin and leech innexin hemichannel permeability and is released by leech glial cells following injury, we tested the effects of bath application of ATP after the injection of Neurobiotin and observed a significant increase in the number of neurons tracer coupled to the sensory neurons. This effect required the elevation of intracellular Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and could be produced by bath application of caffeine. Conversely, scavenging endogenous extracellular ATP with the ATPase apyrase decreased the number of coupled cells. ATP also increased electrical conductance and tracer permeability between the bilateral Retzius neurons. This modulatory effect of ATP on GJ coupling was blocked by siRNA knockdown of a P1‐like adenosine receptor. Finally, exposure of leech ganglia to extracellular ATP induced a characteristic low frequency (&amp;lt;0.3 Hz) rhythmic bursting activity that was roughly synchronous among multiple neurons, a behavior that was significantly attenuated by the GJ blocker octanol. These findings highlight the mediation by ATP of a robust physiological mechanism for modifying neuronal circuits by rapidly recruiting neurons into active networks and entraining synchronized bursting activity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

&lt;p&gt;In this invited review, we argue for the need to determine whether appetitive and aversive behaviors, be they goal‐directed or habitual, share overlapping neural circuitry. To motivate our argument, we first summarize what is currently known about the neural circuits governing aversive and appetitive behaviors by focusing first on the three hypothesized phases of avoidance learning, and then on goal‐directed and habitual reward seeking. We then provide several reasons to believe that the neural circuits of appetitive and aversive instrumental behaviors are not completely overlapping. We next discuss an experimental strategy to determine the extent of overlap based on a new computational framework that improves the identification of goal‐directed and habitual actions regardless of valence. Finally, we discuss recent work in obsessive‐compulsive disorder that uses this computational framework to determine whether patients perform appetitive and aversive versions of the same task using the same behavioral strategies and neural circuits.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The striatal dopamine system has long been studied in the context of reward learning, motivation, and movement. Given the prominent role dopamine plays in a variety of adaptive behavioral states, as well as diseases like addiction, it is essential to understand the full complexity of dopamine neurons and the striatal systems they target. A growing number of studies are uncovering details of the heterogeneity in dopamine neuron subpopulations. Here, we review that work to synthesize current understanding of dopamine system heterogeneity across three levels, anatomical organization, functions in behavior, and modes of action, wherein we focus on signaling profiles and local mechanisms for modulation of dopamine release. Together, these studies reveal new and emerging dimensions of the striatal dopamine system, informing its contribution to dynamic motivational and decision‐making processes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Habits are an important mechanism by which organisms can automate the control of behavior to alleviate cognitive demand. However, transitions to habitual control are risky because they lead to inflexible responding in the face of change. The question of how the brain controls transitions into habit is thus an intriguing one. How do we regulate when our repeated actions become automated? When is it advantageous or disadvantageous to release actions from cognitive control? Decades of research have identified a variety of methods for eliciting habitual responding in animal models. Progress has also been made to understand which brain areas and neural circuits control transitions into habit. Here, I discuss existing research on behavioral and neural circuit models for habit formation (with an emphasis on striatal circuits), and discuss strategies for combining information from different paradigms and levels of analysis to prompt further progress in the field.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The finding of mirror neurons (MNs) has provided a biological substrate to a new concept of cognition, relating data on actions and perceptions not only to integrate perception in action planning and execution but also as a neural mechanism supporting a wide range of cognitive functions. Here we first summarize data on MN localization and role in primates, then we report findings in normal human subjects: functional magnetic resonance imaging and neurophysiological studies sustain that MNs have a role in motor learning and recognizing actions and intentions of others, and they also support an embodied view of language, empathy, and memory. Then, we detail the results of literature searching on MNs and embodied cognition in Parkinson's disease (PD), frontotemporal dementia (FTD)/amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and in mild cognitive impairment (MCI)/Alzheimer's disease (AD). In PD the network of MN could be altered, but its hyperactivation might support motor and cognitive performances at least in early stages. In the ALS/FTD continuum, preliminary evidence points out to an involvement of the MN network, which could explain language and inter‐subjectivity deficits shown in patients affected by these clinical entities. In the MCI/AD spectrum, a few recent studies suggest a possible progressive involvement from posterior to anterior areas of the MN network, with the brain putting in place compensatory mechanisms in early stages. Reinterpreting neurodegenerative diseases at the light of the new views about brain organization stemming from the discovery of MN could help to better comprehend clinical manifestations and open new pathways to rehabilitation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Angelman syndrome (AS) is a rare neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by severe mental retardation, absence of speech, abnormal motor coordination, abnormal EEG, and spontaneous seizure. AS is caused by a deficiency in the ubiquitin ligase E3A (Ube3a) gene product, known to play a dual role as both ubiquitin ligase and transcription coactivator. In AS animal models, multiple Ube3a substrates are accumulated in neurons. So far, studies in mouse models have either aimed at re‐expressing Ube3a or manipulating downstream signaling pathways. Reintroducing Ube3a in AS mice showed promising results but may have two caveats. First, it may cause an overdosage in the Ube3a expression, which in turn is known to contribute to autism spectrum disorders. Second, in mutation cases, the exogenous Ube3a may have to compete with the mutated endogenous form. Such two caveats left spaces for developing therapies or interventions directed to targets downstream Ube3a. Notably, Ube3a expression is dynamically regulated by neuronal activity and plays a crucial role in synaptic plasticity. The abnormal synaptic plasticity uncovered in AS mice has been frequently rescued, but circuits symptoms like seizure are resistant to treatment. Future investigations are needed to further clarify the function (s) of Ube3a during development. Here I reviewed the recently identified major Ube3a substrates and signaling pathways involved in AS pathology, the Ube3a expression, imprinting and evolution, the AS mouse models that have been generated and inspired therapeutic potentials, and finally proposed some future explorations to better understand the AS pathology.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

&lt;p&gt;Over the past decade, many studies have focused on clarifying the roles of different N‐methyl‐&lt;span class=&quot;smallCaps&quot;&gt;d&lt;/span&gt;‐aspartate (NMDA) receptor subunits in cerebral ischemia, hoping to develop subunit‐selective drugs. Recently, more attention was given to studying the role of GluN2C in ischemia damage, which may lead to the development of new NMDA receptor antagonists for cerebral ischemia. Results showed that GluN2C inhibition or knockout can effectively alleviate the ischemic injury caused by middle cerebral artery occlusion and, contrarily, can aggravate the damage to hippocampal CA1 circuit caused by transient global cerebral ischemia. These results indicate the complicated roles of GluN2C in cerebral ischemia. In this minireview, we focus on these findings, describe the roles of GluN2C from different cell origins in ischemic damage, and explain the above inconsistent experimental results.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Circadian clocks, endogenous oscillators generating daily biological rhythms, have important roles in the nervous system to control diverse cellular processes—not only in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), where the master clocks reside to synchronize all circadian clocks in the body but also in other non‐SCN areas. Accumulating evidence has shown relationships between circadian abnormalities (e.g., sleep disturbances and abnormal rest–activity rhythms) and disease progressions in various neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's (AD) and Parkinson's (PD) disease. Although circadian abnormalities were frequently considered as consequences of disease onsets, recent studies suggest altered circadian clocks as risk factors to develop neurodegenerative diseases via altered production or clearance rates of toxic metabolites like amyloid β. In this review, we will summarize circadian clock‐related pathologies in the most common neurodegenerative diseases in the central nervous system, AD and PD. Then, we will introduce the current clinical trials to rescue circadian abnormalities in AD and PD patients. Finally, a discussion about how to improve targeting circadian clocks to increase treatment efficiencies and specificities will be followed. This discussion will provide insight into circadian clocks as potential therapeutic targets to attenuate onsets and progressions of neurodegenerative diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goal‐directed action refers to selecting behaviors based on the expectation that they will be reinforced with desirable outcomes. It is typically conceptualized as opposing habit‐based behaviors, which are instead supported by stimulus–response associations and insensitive to consequences. The prelimbic prefrontal cortex (PL) is positioned along the medial wall of the rodent prefrontal cortex. It is indispensable for action–outcome‐driven (goal‐directed) behavior, consolidating action–outcome relationships and linking contextual information with instrumental behavior. In this brief review, we will discuss the growing list of molecular factors involved in PL function. Ventral to the PL is the medial orbitofrontal cortex (mOFC). We will also summarize emerging evidence from rodents (complementing existing literature describing humans) that it too is involved in action–outcome conditioning. We describe experiments using procedures that quantify responding based on reward value, the likelihood of reinforcement, or effort requirements, touching also on experiments assessing food consumption more generally. We synthesize these findings with the argument that the mOFC is essential to goal‐directed action when outcome value information is not immediately observable and must be recalled and inferred.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Active reward pursuit is supported by the balance between the cognitive and habitual control of behavior. The cognitive, goal‐directed strategy relies on the prospective evaluation of anticipated consequences, which allows behavior to readily adapt when circumstances change. Repetition of successful actions promotes less cognitively taxing habits, in which behavior is automatically executed without prospective consideration. Disruption in either of these behavioral regulatory systems contributes to the symptoms that underlie many psychiatric disorders. Here, I review recently identified neural substrates, at multiple neural levels, that contribute to habits and outline gaps in knowledge that must be addressed to fully understand the neural mechanisms of behavioral control.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goal‐directed and habitual decision‐making are fundamental processes that support the ongoing adaptive behavior. There is a growing interest in examining their disruption in psychiatric disease, often with a focus on a disease shifting control from one process to the other, usually a shift from goal‐directed to habitual control. However, several different experimental procedures can be used to probe whether decision‐making is under goal‐directed or habitual control, including outcome devaluation and contingency degradation. These different experimental procedures may recruit diverse behavioral and neural processes. Thus, there are potentially many opportunities for these disease phenotypes to manifest as alterations to both goal‐directed and habitual controls. In this review, we highlight the examples of behavioral and neural circuit divergence and similarity, and suggest that interpretation based on behavioral processes recruited during testing may leave more room for goal‐directed and habitual decision‐making to coexist. Furthermore, this may improve our understanding of precisely &lt;i&gt;what&lt;/i&gt; the involved neural mechanisms underlying aspects of goal‐directed and habitual behavior are, as well as how disease affects behavior and these circuits.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Learning leads to changes in population patterns of neural activity. In this study we wanted to examine how these changes in patterns of activity affect the dimensionality of neural responses and information about choices. We addressed these questions by carrying out high channel count recordings in dorsal-lateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC; 768 electrodes) while monkeys performed a two-armed bandit reinforcement learning task. The high channel count recordings allowed us to study population coding while monkeys learned choices between actions or objects. We found that the dimensionality of neural population activity was higher across blocks in which animals learned the values of novel pairs of objects, than across blocks in which they learned the values of actions. The increase in dimensionality with learning in object blocks was related to less shared information across blocks, and therefore patterns of neural activity that were less similar, when compared to learning in action blocks. Furthermore, these differences emerged with learning, and were not a simple function of the choice of a visual image or action. Therefore, learning the values of novel objects increases the dimensionality of neural representations in dlPFC.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/KUb9aJqcgf8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

With the current rapid spread of COVID-19, global health systems are increasingly overburdened by the sheer number of people that need diagnosis, isolation and treatment. Shortcomings are evident across the board, from staffing, facilities for rapid and reliable testing to availability of hospital beds and key medical-grade equipment. The scale and breadth of the problem calls for an equally substantive response not only from frontline workers such as medical staff and scientists, but from skilled members of the public who have the time, facilities and knowledge to meaningfully contribute to a consolidated global response. Here, we summarise community-driven approaches based on Free and Open Source scientific and medical Hardware (FOSH) as well as personal protective equipment (PPE) currently being developed and deployed to support the global response for COVID-19 prevention, patient treatment and diagnostics.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/ljp7gPlfShU&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Trimeric intracellular cation (TRIC) channels have been proposed to modulate Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; release from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and determine oscillatory Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; signals. Here, we report that TRIC-A–mediated amplitude and frequency modulation of ryanodine receptor 2 (RyR2)-mediated Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; oscillations and inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate receptor (IP&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;R)-induced cytosolic signals is based on attenuating store-operated Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; entry (SOCE). Further, TRIC-A–dependent delay in ER Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; store refilling contributes to shaping the pattern of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; oscillations. Upon ER Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; depletion, TRIC-A clusters with stromal interaction molecule 1 (STIM1) and Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-release–activated Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; channel 1 (Orai1) within ER–plasma membrane (PM) junctions and impairs assembly of the STIM1/Orai1 complex, causing a decrease in Orai1-mediated Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; current and SOCE. Together, our findings demonstrate that TRIC-A is a negative regulator of STIM1/Orai1 function. Thus, aberrant SOCE could contribute to muscle disorders associated with loss of TRIC-A.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/QB6hSmTAL_4&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience Research: Structural white matter alterations as compensatory mechanisms in Parkinson's disease: A systematic review of diffusion tensor imaging studies</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jnr.24617?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compensation is described as normal or near to normal performance in Parkinson's disease (PD), despite the ongoing neural loss. Functional compensation typically proceeds in an inverse U‐shaped manner: compensation initiates in the prodromal phase, followed by an increasing episode until plateauing and diminishes in the advanced stages of the disease. The first evidence of the structural compensation was reported by functional magnetic resonance imaging studies. Recent studies, which have used diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) as the basis for their investigation, have shown improved white matter diffusional properties both in motor‐ and non‐motor‐related structures in association with improved clinical scores in patients with PD. The majority of DTI studies have demonstrated microstructural compensation in the prodromal/early stages of PD at the regional scale. However, there have been reports of compensation in later stages of the disease and the whole‐brain/network scale that are probably due to the heterogeneous nature of PD. Although serving as a promising beginning to characterize compensation, lots remain to be clarified in understanding the underlying mechanisms of compensation and its structural pattern in PD. The existing knowledge gap necessitates studies that their main research questions are focused on structural compensation. This requirement becomes more apparent because structural compensation evidence has mostly emerged from the post hoc analysis of data and incidental findings of studies. Thus, future studies are required to investigate compensatory microstructural changes in PD to clarify the exact underlying mechanisms. These studies would also provide a basis to develop clinical improvements in the early diagnosis and management of PD.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience Research: Sex/gender differences in brain function and structure in alcohol use: A narrative review of neuroimaging findings over the last 10 years</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jnr.24625?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the last 10 years, rates of alcohol use disorder (AUD) have increased in women by 84% relative to a 35% increase in men. Rates of alcohol use and high‐risk drinking have also increased in women by 16% and 58% relative to a 7% and 16% increase in men, respectively, over the last decade. This robust increase in drinking among women highlights the critical need to identify the underlying neural mechanisms that may contribute to problematic alcohol consumption across sex/gender (SG), especially given that many neuroimaging studies are underpowered to detect main or interactive effects of SG on imaging outcomes. This narrative review aims to explore the recent neuroimaging literature on SG differences in brain function and structure as it pertains to alcohol across positron emission tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and functional magnetic resonance imaging modalities in humans. Additional work using magnetic resonance spectroscopy, diffusion tensor imaging, and event‐related potentials to examine SG differences in AUD will be covered. Overall, current research on the neuroimaging of AUD, alcohol consumption, or risk of AUD is limited, and findings are mixed regarding the effect of SG on neurochemical, structural, and functional mechanisms associated with AUD. We address SG disparities in the neuroimaging of AUD and propose a call to action to include women in brain imaging research. Future studies are crucial to our understanding of the neurobiological underpinnings of AUD across neural systems and the vulnerability for AUD among women and men.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/7/2/ENEURO.0514-19.2020?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Visuomotor feedback responses vary in intensity throughout a reach, commonly explained by optimal control. Here, we show that the optimal control for a range of movements with the same goal can be simplified to a time-to-target dependent control scheme. We measure our human participants’ visuomotor responses in five reaching conditions, each with different hand or cursor kinematics. Participants only produced different feedback responses when these kinematic changes resulted in different times-to-target. We complement our experimental data with a range of finite and non-finite horizon optimal feedback control (OFC) models, finding that the model with time-to-target as one of the input parameters best replicates the experimental data. Overall, this suggests that time-to-target is a critical control parameter in online feedback control. Moreover, we propose that for a specific task and known dynamics, humans can instantly produce a control signal without any additional online computation allowing rapid response onset and close to optimal control.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eNeuro: Cellular Basis of Bitter-Driven Aversive Behaviors in Drosophila Larva</title>
	<link>http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/7/2/ENEURO.0510-19.2020?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Feeding, a critical behavior for survival, consists of a complex series of behavioral steps. In &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; larvae, the initial steps of feeding are food choice, during which the quality of a potential food source is judged, and ingestion, during which the selected food source is ingested into the digestive tract. It remains unclear whether these steps employ different mechanisms of neural perception. Here, we provide insight into the two initial steps of feeding in &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; larva. We find that substrate choice and ingestion are determined by independent circuits at the cellular level. First, we took 22 candidate bitter compounds and examined their influence on choice preference and ingestion behavior. Interestingly, certain bitter tastants caused different responses in choice and ingestion, suggesting distinct mechanisms of perception. We further provide evidence that certain gustatory receptor neurons (GRNs) in the external terminal organ (TO) are involved in determining choice preference, and a pair of larval pharyngeal GRNs is involved in mediating both avoidance and suppression of ingestion. Our results show that feeding behavior is coordinated by a multistep regulatory process employing relatively independent neural elements. These findings are consistent with a model in which distinct sensory pathways act as modulatory circuits controlling distinct subprograms during feeding.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eNeuro: Priming of Attentional Selection in Macaque Visual Cortex: Feature-Based Facilitation and Location-Based Inhibition of Return</title>
	<link>http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/7/2/ENEURO.0466-19.2020?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Visual search performance varies with stimulus and response history. Priming of pop-out refers to increased accuracy and reduced response time with repeated presentation of particular singleton and distractor features (e.g., a red target among green distractor stimuli), which are abruptly impaired when singleton and distractor features swap (e.g., green target among red distractors). Meanwhile, inhibition of return refers to the slowing of response time when target location repeats. Neurophysiological correlates of both these phenomena have been reported in the frontal eye field (FEF), an area in the frontal lobe contributing to attentional selection and eye movement planning. To understand the mechanistic origin of these adaptive behaviors, we investigated visual cortical area V4, an area providing input to and receiving feedback from FEF, during feature-based priming of pop-out and location-based inhibition of return. Performing a color pop-out task, monkeys exhibited pronounced priming of pop-out and inhibition of return. Neural spiking from V4 revealed earlier target selection associated with priming of pop-out and delayed selection associated with inhibition of return. These results demonstrate substantial involvement of extrastriate visual cortex in behavioral priming and inhibition of return.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eNeuro: Inter-individual Differences in Occipital Alpha Oscillations Correlate with White Matter Tissue Properties of the Optic Radiation</title>
	<link>http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/7/2/ENEURO.0224-19.2020?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Neural oscillations at ~10 Hz, called alpha oscillations, are one of the most prominent components of neural oscillations in the human brain. In recent years, characteristics (power/frequency/phase) of occipital alpha oscillations have been correlated with various perceptual phenomena. However, the relationship between inter-individual differences in alpha oscillatory characteristics and the properties of the underlying brain structures, such as white matter pathways, is unclear. A possibility is that intrinsic occipital alpha oscillations are mediated by thalamocortical interaction; we hypothesized that the most promising candidate for characterizing the intrinsic alpha oscillation is optic radiation (OR), which is the geniculo-cortical pathway carrying signals between the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) and primary visual cortex (V1). We used resting-state magnetoencephalography (MEG) and diffusion-weighted/quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (dMRI/qMRI) to correlate the frequency and power of occipital alpha oscillations with the tissue properties of the OR by focusing on the different characteristics across individuals. We found that the peak alpha frequency (PAF) negatively correlated with intracellular volume fraction (ICVF), reflecting diffusion properties in intracellular (axonal) space, whereas the peak alpha power was not correlated with any tissue properties measurements. No significant correlation was found between OR and beta frequency/amplitude or between other white matter tract connecting parietal and inferotemporal cortex and alpha frequency/amplitude. These results support the hypothesis that an interaction between thalamic nuclei and early visual areas is essential for the occipital alpha oscillatory rhythm.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/7/2/ENEURO.0278-19.2020?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Human observers perceptually discriminate the dynamic deformation of materials in the real world. However, the psychophysical and neural mechanisms responsible for the perception of dynamic deformation have not been fully elucidated. By using a deforming bar as the stimulus, we showed that the spatial frequency of deformation was a critical determinant of deformation perception. Simulating the response of direction-selective units (i.e., MT pattern motion cells) to stimuli, we found that the perception of dynamic deformation was well explained by assuming a higher-order mechanism monitoring the spatial pattern of direction responses. Our model with the higher-order mechanism also successfully explained the appearance of a visual illusion wherein a static bar apparently deforms against a tilted drifting grating. In particular, it was the lower spatial frequencies in this pattern that strongly contributed to the deformation perception. Finally, by manipulating the luminance of the static bar, we observed that the mechanism for the illusory deformation was more sensitive to luminance than contrast cues.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1882, the Italian embryologist Giuseppe Bellonci introduced a nomenclature for structures in the stomatopod crustacean &lt;i&gt;Squilla mantis&lt;/i&gt; that he claimed correspond to insect mushroom bodies, today recognized as cardinal centers that in insects mediate associative memory. The use of Bellonci's terminology has, through a series of misunderstandings and entrenched opinions, led to contesting views regarding whether centers in crustacean and insect brains that occupy corresponding locations and receive comparable multisensory inputs are homologous or homoplasic. The following describes the fate of terms used to denote sensory association neuropils in crustacean species and relates how those terms were deployed in the 1920s and 1930s by the Swedish neuroanatomist Bertil Hanström to claim homology in insects and crustaceans. Yet the same terminology has been repurposed by subsequent researchers to promote the very opposite view: that mushroom bodies are a derived trait of hexapods and that equivalent centers in crustaceans evolved independently.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Hippocampal Interictal Spikes during Sleep Impact Long‐Term Memory Consolidation</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25744?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Non‐rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep is supposed to play a key role in long‐term memory consolidation transferring information from hippocampus to neocortex. However, sleep also activates epileptic activities in medial temporal regions. This study investigated whether interictal hippocampal spikes during sleep would impair long‐term memory consolidation.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Method&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We prospectively measured visual and verbal memory performance in 20 patients with epilepsy investigated with stereoelectroencephalography (SEEG) at immediate, 30‐minute, and 1‐week delays, and studied the correlations between interictal hippocampal spike frequency during waking and the first cycle of NREM sleep and memory performance, taking into account the number of seizures occurring during the consolidation period and other possible confounding factors, such as age and epilepsy duration.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Retention of verbal memory over 1 week was negatively correlated with hippocampal spike frequency during sleep, whereas no significant correlation was found with hippocampal interictal spikes during waking. No significant result was found for visual memory. Regression tree analysis showed that the number of seizures was the first factor that impaired the verbal memory retention between 30 minutes and 1 week. When the number of seizures was below 5, spike frequency during sleep higher than 13 minutes was associated with impaired memory retention over 1 week.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our results show that activation of interictal spikes in the hippocampus during sleep and seizures specifically impair long‐term memory consolidation. We hypothesize that hippocampal interictal spikes during sleep interrupt hippocampal‐neocortical transfer of information. ANN NEUROL 2020&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Synaptic Neuroscience: Presynaptic Calcium Channel Open Probability and Changes in Calcium Influx Throughout the Action Potential Determined Using AP-Waveforms</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsyn.2020.00017</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Action potentials arriving at a nerve terminal activate voltage-gated calcium channels and set the electrical driving force for calcium entry which affects the amount and duration of neurotransmitter release. During propagation, the duration, amplitude, and shape of action potentials often changes. This affects calcium entry, and can cause large changes in neurotransmitter release. Here, we have used a series of amplitude and area matched stimuli to examine how the shape and amplitude of a stimulus affect calcium influx at a presynaptic nerve terminal in the mammalian brain. We identify fundamental differences in calcium entry following calcium channel activation by a standard voltage jump vs. an action potential-like stimulation. We also tested a series of action potential-like stimuli with the same amplitude, duration, and stimulus area, but differing in their rise and decay times. We find that a stimulus that matches the rise and decay times of a physiological action potential produces a calcium channel response that is optimized over a range of peak amplitudes. Next, we determined the relative number of calcium channels that are active at different times during an action potential, which is important in the context of how local calcium domains trigger neurotransmitter release. We find the depolarizing phase of an AP-like stimulus only opens ~20% of the maximum number of calcium channels that can be activated. Channels continue to activate during the falling phase of the action potential, with peak calcium channel activation occurring near 0 mV. Although less than 25% of calcium channels are active at the end of the action potential, these calcium channels will generate a larger local calcium concentration that will increase the release probability for nearby vesicles. Determining the change in open probability of presynaptic calcium channels, and taking into account how local calcium concentration also changes throughout the action potential are both necessary to fully understand how the action potential triggers neurotransmitter release.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Synaptic Neuroscience: Chronic Presence of Oligomeric Aβ Differentially Modulates Spine Parameters in the Hippocampus and Cortex of Mice With Low APP Transgene Expression</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsyn.2020.00016</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s disease is regarded as a synaptopathy with a long presymptomatic phase. Soluble, oligomeric amyloid-β (Aβ) is thought to play a causative role in this disease, which eventually leads to cognitive decline. However, most animal studies have employed mice expressing high levels of the Aβ precursor protein (APP) transgene to drive pathology. Here, to understand how the principal neurons in different brain regions cope with moderate, chronically present levels of Aβ, we employed transgenic mice expressing equal levels of mouse and human APP carrying a combination of three familial AD (FAD)-linked mutations (Swedish, Dutch, and London), that develop plaques only in old age. We analyzed dendritic spine parameters in hippocampal and cortical brain regions after targeted expression of EGFP to allow high-resolution imaging, followed by algorithm-based evaluation of mice of both sexes from adolescence to old age. We report that Aβ species gradually accumulated throughout the life of APP&lt;sub&gt;SDL&lt;/sub&gt; mice, but not the oligomeric forms, and that the amount of membrane-associated oligomers decreased at the onset of plaque formation. We observed an age-dependent loss of thin spines under most conditions as an indicator of a loss of synaptic plasticity in older mice. We further found that hippocampal pyramidal neurons respond to increased Aβ levels by lowering spine density and shifting spine morphology, which reached significance in the CA1 subfield. In contrast, the spine density in cortical pyramidal neurons of APP&lt;sub&gt;SDL&lt;/sub&gt; mice was unchanged. We also observed an increase in the protein levels of PSD-95 and Arc in the hippocampus and cortex, respectively. Our data demonstrated that increased concentrations of Aβ have diverse effects on dendritic spines in the brain and suggest that hippocampal and cortical neurons have different adaptive and compensatory capacity during their lifetime. Our data also indicated that spine morphology differs between sexes in a region-specific manner.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Background&lt;p&gt;Tardive dyskinesia (TD) is a common side effect of antipsychotic treatment. This movement disorder consists of orofacial and limb-truncal components. The present study is aimed at investigating the role of serotonin receptors (HTR) in modulating tardive dyskinesia by genotyping patients with schizophrenia.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;A set of 29 SNPs of genes of serotonin receptors HTR1A, HTR1B, HTR2A, HTR2C, HTR3A, HTR3B, and HTR6 was studied in a population of 449 Caucasians (226 females and 223 males) with verified clinical diagnosis of schizophrenia (according to ICD-10: F20). Five SNPs were excluded because of low minor allele frequency or for not passing the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium test. Affinity of antipsychotics to 5-HT2 receptors was defined according to previous publications. Genotyping was carried out with SEQUENOM Mass Array Analyzer 4.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Statistically significant associations of rs1928040 of HTR2A gene in groups of patients with orofacial type of TD and total diagnosis of TD was found for alleles, and a statistical trend for genotypes. Moreover, statistically significant associations were discovered in the female group for rs1801412 of HTR2C for alleles and genotypes. Excluding patients who used HTR2A, respectively, HTR2C antagonists changed little to the associations of HTR2A polymorphisms, but caused a major change of the magnitude of the association of HTR2C variants. Due to the low patient numbers, these sub-analyses did not have significant results.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;We found significant associations in rs1928040 of HTR2A and for rs1801412 of X-bound HTR2C in female patients. The associations were particularly related to the orofacial type of TD. Excluding patients using relevant antagonists particularly affected rs1801412, but not rs1928040-related associations. This suggest that rs1801412 is directly or indirectly linked to the functioning of HTR2C. Further study of variants of the HTR2C gene in a larger group of male patients who were not using HTR2C antagonists is necessary in order to verify a possible functional role of this receptor.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2020.00062</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Ion channels are expressed throughout nervous system development. The type and diversity of conductances and gating mechanisms vary at different developmental stages and with the progressive maturational status of neural cells. The variety of ion channels allows for distinct signaling mechanisms in developing neural cells that in turn regulate the needed cellular processes taking place during each developmental period. These include neural cell proliferation and neuronal differentiation, which are crucial for developmental events ranging from the earliest steps of morphogenesis of the neural tube through the establishment of neuronal circuits. Here, we compile studies assessing the ontogeny of ionic currents in the developing nervous system. We then review work demonstrating a role for ion channels in neural tube formation, to underscore the necessity of the signaling downstream ion channels even at the earliest stages of neural development. We discuss the function of ion channels in neural cell proliferation and neuronal differentiation and conclude with how the regulation of all these morphogenetic and cellular processes by electrical activity enables the appropriate development of the nervous system and the establishment of functional circuits adapted to respond to a changing environment.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Integrative Neuroscience: Early Inflammatory Signatures Predict Subsequent Cognition in Long-Term Virally Suppressed Women With HIV</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnint.2020.00020</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Immunologic function is an important determinant of cognition. Here we examined the contribution of early immune signatures to cognitive performance among HIV-infected, virally suppressed women (HIV+VS) and in HIV-uninfected (HIV-) women. Specifically, we measured serum inflammatory markers, developed combinatory immune signatures, and evaluated their associations with cognition. Forty-nine HIV+VS women in the Women’s Interagency HIV Study (WIHS) who achieved viral suppression shortly after effective antiretroviral therapy (ART) initiation, and 56 matched HIV− women were selected. Forty-two serum inflammatory markers were measured within 2 years of effective ART initiation for HIV+VS women, and at an initial timepoint for HIV− women. The same inflammatory markers were also measured approximately 1, 7, and 12 years later for all women. Of the 105 women with complete immune data, 83 (34 HIV+VS, 49 HIV−) also had cognitive data available 12 years later at ≥1 time points (median = 3.1). We searched for combinatory immune signatures by adapting a dynamic matrix factorization analytic method that builds upon Tucker decomposition followed by Ingenuity&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt; Pathway Analysis to facilitate data interpretation. Seven combinatory immune signatures emerged based on the Frobenius residual. Three signatures were common between HIV+VS and HIV− women, while four signatures were unique. These inflammatory signatures predicted subsequent cognitive performance in both groups using mixed-effects modeling, but more domain-specific associations were significant in HIV+VS than HIV− women. Leukocyte influx into brain was a major contributor to cognitive function in HIV+VS women, while T cell exhaustion, inflammatory response indicative of depressive/psychiatric disorders, microglial activity, and cytokine signaling predicted both global and domain-specific performance for HIV− women. Our findings suggest that immune signatures may be useful diagnostic, prognostic, and immunotherapeutic targets predictive of subsequent cognitive performance. Importantly, they also provide insight into common and distinct inflammatory mechanisms underlying cognition in HIV− and HIV+VS women.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neural Technology: Linear Predictive Approaches Separate Field Potentials in Animal Model of Parkinson's Disease</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00394</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Parkinson's disease (PD) causes impaired movement and cognition. PD can involve profound changes in cortical and subcortical brain activity as measured by electroencephalography or intracranial recordings of local field potentials (LFP). Such signals can adaptively guide deep-brain stimulation (DBS) as part of PD therapy. However, adaptive DBS requires the identification of triggers of neuronal activity dependent on real time monitoring and analysis. Current methods do not always identify PD-related signals and can entail delays. We test an alternative approach based on linear predictive coding (LPC), which fits autoregressive (AR) models to time-series data. Parameters of these AR models can be calculated by fast algorithms in real time. We compare LFPs from the striatum in an animal model of PD with dopamine depletion in the absence and presence of the dopamine precursor levodopa, which is used to treat motor symptoms of PD. We show that in dopamine-depleted mice a first order AR model characterized by a single LPC parameter obtained by LFP sampling at 1 kHz for just 1 min can distinguish between levodopa-treated and saline-treated mice and outperform current methods. This suggests that LPC may be useful in online analysis of neuronal signals to guide DBS in real time and could contribute to DBS-based treatment of PD.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Subthalamic Single Cell and Oscillatory Neural Dynamics of a Dyskinetic Medicated Patient With Parkinson's Disease</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00391</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Single cell neuronal activity (SUA) and local field potentials (LFP) in the subthalamic nucleus (STN) of unmedicated Parkinson's disease (PD) patients undergoing deep brain stimulation (DBS) surgery have been well-characterized during microelectrode recordings (MER). However, there is limited knowledge about the changes in the firing patterns and oscillations above and within the territories of STN after the intake of dopaminergic medication. Here, for the first time, we report the STN single cell and oscillatory neural dynamics in a medicated patient with idiopathic PD using intraoperative MER. We recorded LFP and SUA with microelectrodes at various depths during bilateral STN-DBS electrode implantation. We isolated 26 neurons in total and observed that tonic and irregular firing patterns of individual neurons predominated throughout the territories of STN. While burst-type firings have been well-characterized in the dorsal territories of STN in unmedicated patients, interestingly, this activity was not observed in our medicated subject. LFP recordings lacked the excessive beta (8–30 Hz) activity, characteristic of the unmedicated state and signal energy was mainly dominated by slow oscillations below 8 Hz. We observed sharp gamma oscillations between 70 and 90 Hz within and above the STN. Despite the presence of a broadband high frequency activity in 200–400 Hz range, no cross-frequency interaction in the form of phase-amplitude coupling was noted between low and high frequency oscillations of LFPs. While our results are in agreement with the previously reported LFP recordings from the DBS lead in medicated PD patients, the sharp gamma peak present throughout the depth recordings and the lack of bursting firings after levodopa intake have not been reported before. The lack of bursting in SUA, the lack of excessive beta activity and cross frequency coupling between HFOs and lower rhythms further validate the link between bursting firing regime of neurons and pathological oscillatory neural activity in PD-STN. Overall, these observations not only validate the existing literature on the PD electrophysiology in healthy/medicated animal models but also provide insights regarding the underlying electro-pathophysiology of levodopa-induced dyskinesias in PD patients through demonstration of multiscale relationships between single cell firings and field potentials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Speech-Induced Suppression for Delayed Auditory Feedback in Adults Who Do and Do Not Stutter</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00150</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Speech-induced suppression is the normal, relative amplitude reduction of the auditory evoked potential for self-, compared to externally-generated, auditory stimulation. It remains controversial as to whether adults who stutter exhibit expected auditory modulation during speech; some studies have reported a significant difference between stuttering and fluent groups in speech-induced suppression during speech movement planning, while others have not. We compared auditory evoked potentials (N1 component) for auditory feedback arising from one’s own voice (Speaking condition) with passive listening to a recording of one’s own voice (Listening condition) in 24 normally-fluent speakers and 16 adults who stutter under various delayed auditory feedback (DAF) time conditions (100 ms, 200 ms, 500 ms, and 1,000 ms). We presented the participant’s own voice with a delay, immediately after presenting it without a delay. Our working hypothesis was that the shorter the delay time, the more likely the delayed sound is perceived as self-generated. Therefore, shorter delay time conditions are proposed to result in relatively enhanced suppression of the auditory system. Results showed that in fluent speakers, the shorter the delay time, the more the auditory evoked potential in the Speaking condition tended to be suppressed. In the Listening condition, there was a larger evoked potential with shorter delay times. As a result, speech-induced suppression was only significant at the short delay time conditions of 100 and 200 ms. Adults who stutter did not show the opposing changes in the Speaking and Listening conditions seen in the fluent group. Although the evoked potential in the Listening condition tended to decrease as the delay time increased, that in the Speaking condition did not show a distinct trend, and there was a significant suppression only at 200 ms delay. For the 200 ms delay condition, speakers with more severe stuttering showed significantly greater speech-induced suppression than those with less severe stuttering. This preliminary study suggests our methods for investigating evoked potentials by presenting own voice with a delay may provide a clue as to the nature of auditory modulation in stuttering.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Investigating the Added Value of FreeSurfer’s Manual Editing Procedure for the Study of the Reading Network in a Pediatric Population</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00143</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Insights into brain anatomy are important for the early detection of neurodevelopmental disorders, such as dyslexia. FreeSurfer is one of the most frequently applied automatized software tools to study brain morphology. However, quality control of the outcomes provided by FreeSurfer is often ignored and could lead to wrong statistical inferences. Additional manual editing of the data may be a solution, although not without a cost in time and resources. Past research in adults on comparing the automatized method of FreeSurfer with and without additional manual editing indicated that although editing may lead to significant differences in morphological measures between the methods in some regions, it does not substantially change the sensitivity to detect clinical differences. Given that automated approaches are more likely to fail in pediatric—and inherently more noisy—data, we investigated in the current study whether FreeSurfer can be applied fully automatically or additional manual edits of T1-images are needed in a pediatric sample. Specifically, cortical thickness and surface area measures with and without additional manual edits were compared in six regions of interest (ROIs) of the reading network in 5-to-6-year-old children with and without dyslexia. Results revealed that additional editing leads to statistical differences in the morphological measures, but that these differences are consistent across subjects and that the sensitivity to reveal statistical differences in the morphological measures between children with and without dyslexia is not affected, even though conclusions of marginally significant findings can differ depending on the method used. Thereby, our results indicate that additional manual editing of reading-related regions in FreeSurfer has limited gain for pediatric samples.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2020.00033</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The perceptron learning algorithm and its multiple-layer extension, the backpropagation algorithm, are the foundations of the present-day machine learning revolution. However, these algorithms utilize a highly simplified mathematical abstraction of a neuron; it is not clear to what extent real biophysical neurons with morphologically-extended non-linear dendritic trees and conductance-based synapses can realize perceptron-like learning. Here we implemented the perceptron learning algorithm in a realistic biophysical model of a layer 5 cortical pyramidal cell with a full complement of non-linear dendritic channels. We tested this biophysical perceptron (BP) on a classification task, where it needed to correctly binarily classify 100, 1,000, or 2,000 patterns, and a generalization task, where it was required to discriminate between two “noisy” patterns. We show that the BP performs these tasks with an accuracy comparable to that of the original perceptron, though the classification capacity of the apical tuft is somewhat limited. We concluded that cortical pyramidal neurons can act as powerful classification devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncir.2020.00018</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The exquisite intricacies of neural circuits are fundamental to an animal’s diverse and complex repertoire of sensory and motor functions. The ability to precisely map neural circuits and to selectively manipulate neural activity is critical to understanding brain function and has, therefore been a long-standing goal for neuroscientists. The recent development of optogenetic tools, combined with transgenic mouse lines, has endowed us with unprecedented spatiotemporal precision in circuit analysis. These advances greatly expand the scope of tractable experimental investigations. Here, in the first half of the review, we will present applications of optogenetics in identifying connectivity between different local neuronal cell types and of long-range projections with both in vitro and in vivo methods. We will then discuss how these tools can be used to reveal the functional roles of these cell-type specific connections in governing sensory information processing, and learning and memory in the visual cortex, somatosensory cortex, and motor cortex. Finally, we will discuss the prospect of new optogenetic tools and how their application can further advance modern neuroscience. In summary, this review serves as a primer to exemplify how optogenetics can be used in sophisticated modern circuit analyses at the levels of synapses, cells, network connectivity and behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neural Circuits: Contribution of 5-HT2 Receptors to the Control of the Spinal Locomotor System in Intact Rats</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncir.2020.00014</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Applying serotonergic (5-HT) agonists or grafting of fetal serotonergic cells into the spinal cord improves locomotion after spinal cord injury. Little is known about the role of 5-HT receptors in the control of voluntary locomotion, so we administered inverse agonists of 5-HT&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (Cyproheptadine; Cypr), 5-HT&lt;sub&gt;2A&lt;/sub&gt; neutral antagonist (Volinanserin; Volin), 5-HT&lt;sub&gt;2C&lt;/sub&gt; neutral antagonist (SB 242084), and 5-HT&lt;sub&gt;2B/2C&lt;/sub&gt; inverse agonist (SB 206553) receptors intrathecally in intact rats and monitored their effects on unrestrained locomotion. An intrathecal cannula was introduced at the low thoracic level and pushed caudally until the tip reached the L2/L3 or L5/L6 spinal segments. Locomotor performance was evaluated using EMG activity of hindlimb muscles during locomotion on a 2 m long runway. Motoneuron excitability was estimated using EMG recordings during dorsi- and plantar flexion at the ankle. Locomotion was dramatically impaired after the blockage of 5-HT&lt;sub&gt;2A&lt;/sub&gt; receptors. The effect of Cypr was more pronounced than that of Volin since in the L5/L6 rats Cypr (but not Volin) induced significant alteration of the strength of interlimb coordination followed by total paralysis. These agents significantly decreased locomotor EMG amplitude and abolished or substantially decreased stretch reflexes. Blocking 5-HT&lt;sub&gt;2B/2C&lt;/sub&gt; receptors had no effect either on locomotion or reflexes. We suggest that in intact rats serotonin controls timing and amplitude of muscle activity by acting on 5-HT&lt;sub&gt;2A&lt;/sub&gt; receptors on both CPG interneurons and motoneurons, while 5-HT&lt;sub&gt;2B/2C&lt;/sub&gt; receptors are not involved in control of the locomotor pattern in lumbar spinal cord.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The adult mammalian central nervous system (CNS) has very limited regenerative capacity upon neural injuries or under degenerative conditions. In recent years, however, significant progress has been made on in vivo cell fate reprogramming for neural regeneration. Resident glial cells can be reprogrammed into neuronal progenitors and mature neurons in the CNS of adult mammals. In this review article, we briefly summarize the current knowledge on innate adult neurogenesis under pathological conditions and then focus on induced neurogenesis through cell fate reprogramming. We discuss how the reprogramming process can be regulated and raise critical issues requiring careful considerations to move the field forward. With emerging evidence, we envision that fate reprogramming-based regenerative medicine will have a great potential for treating neurological conditions such as brain injury, spinal cord injury (SCI), Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Parkinson’s disease (PD), and retinopathy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: CX3CL1 Induces Vertebral Microvascular Barrier Dysfunction via the Src/P115-RhoGEF/ROCK Signaling Pathway</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00096</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Trans-endothelial migration (TEM) of cancer cells is a critical step in metastasis. Micro-vascular barrier disruptions of distant organs play important roles in tumor cells TEM. The spine is a preferred site for multiple cancer cell metastases. Our previous study found that vertebral spongy bone was rich in CX3CL1 and that CX3CL1 can attract fractalkine receptor-expressing tumor cells to the spine. In the present study, we determined whether CX3CL1 was involved in vertebral micro-vascular barrier disruption and promoted tumor cell TEM after circulating tumor cells were arrested in the vertebral micro-vasculature. We examined the role of CX3CL1 in the barrier function of vertebral micro-vascular endothelial cells (VMECs) and explored the molecular mechanisms of CX3CL1-induced VMEC barrier disruption. Our results demonstrated that CX3CL1 led to F-actin formation and ZO-1 disruption in VMECs and induced the vertebral micro-vascular barrier disruption. Importantly, we found that the activation of the Src/P115-RhoGEF/ROCK signaling pathway plays an important role in CX3CL1-induced VMEC stress fiber formation, ZO-1 disruption and then vertebral micro-vascular barrier hyper-permeability. Inhibiting Src/P115-RhoGEF/ROCK signaling in VMECs effectively blocked CX3CL1-induced vertebral vascular endothelial dysfunction and subsequent tumor cell TEM. The results of this study and our previous study indicate that in addition to its chemotaxis, CX3CL1 plays a critical role in regulating vertebral micro-vascular barrier function and tumor cell TEM. CX3CL1 induced VMECs stress fiber formation, ZO-1 disruption and then vascular endothelial hyperpermeability via activation of the Src/P115-RhoGEF/ROCK signaling pathway. The inhibition of the Src/P115-RhoGEF/ROCK signaling pathway in VMECs effectively blocked tumor cells TEMs in vertebral spongy bone and maybe a potential therapeutic strategy for spine metastases in the future.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Going the Extra (Synaptic) Mile: Excitotoxicity as the Road Toward Neurodegenerative Diseases</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00090</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Excitotoxicity is a phenomenon that describes the toxic actions of excitatory neurotransmitters, primarily glutamate, where the exacerbated or prolonged activation of glutamate receptors starts a cascade of neurotoxicity that ultimately leads to the loss of neuronal function and cell death. In this process, the shift between normal physiological function and excitotoxicity is largely controlled by astrocytes since they can control the levels of glutamate on the synaptic cleft. This control is achieved through glutamate clearance from the synaptic cleft and its underlying recycling through the glutamate-glutamine cycle. The molecular mechanism that triggers excitotoxicity involves alterations in glutamate and calcium metabolism, dysfunction of glutamate transporters, and malfunction of glutamate receptors, particularly N-methyl-D-aspartic acid receptors (NMDAR). On the other hand, excitotoxicity can be regarded as a consequence of other cellular phenomena, such as mitochondrial dysfunction, physical neuronal damage, and oxidative stress. Regardless, it is known that the excessive activation of NMDAR results in the sustained influx of calcium into neurons and leads to several deleterious consequences, including mitochondrial dysfunction, reactive oxygen species (ROS) overproduction, impairment of calcium buffering, the release of pro-apoptotic factors, among others, that inevitably contribute to neuronal loss. A large body of evidence implicates NMDAR-mediated excitotoxicity as a central mechanism in the pathogenesis of many neurodegenerative diseases, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Alzheimer’s disease (AD), and epilepsy. In this review article, we explore different causes and consequences of excitotoxicity, discuss the involvement of NMDAR-mediated excitotoxicity and its downstream effects on several neurodegenerative disorders, and identify possible strategies to study new aspects of these diseases that may lead to the discovery of new therapeutic approaches. With the understanding that excitotoxicity is a common denominator in neurodegenerative diseases and other disorders, a new perspective on therapy can be considered, where the targets are not specific symptoms, but the underlying cellular phenomena of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Until now, existing methods for identifying lncRNA related miRNA sponge modules mainly rely on lncRNA related miRNA sponge interaction networks, which may not provide a full picture of miRNA sponging activities in biological conditions. Hence there is a strong need of new computational methods to identify lncRNA related miRNA sponge modules. In this work, we propose a framework, LMSM, to identify LncRNA related MiRNA Sponge Modules from heterogeneous data. To understand the miRNA sponging activities in biological conditions, LMSM uses gene expression data to evaluate the influence of the shared miRNAs on the clustered sponge lncRNAs and mRNAs. We have applied LMSM to the human breast cancer (BRCA) dataset from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). As a result, we have found that the majority of LMSM modules are significantly implicated in BRCA and most of them are BRCA subtype-specific. Most of the mediating miRNAs act as crosslinks across different LMSM modules, and all of LMSM modules are statistically significant. Multi-label classification analysis shows that the performance of LMSM modules is significantly higher than baseline’s performance, indicating the biological meanings of LMSM modules in classifying BRCA subtypes. The consistent results suggest that LMSM is robust in identifying lncRNA related miRNA sponge modules. Moreover, LMSM can be used to predict miRNA targets. Finally, LMSM outperforms a graph clustering-based strategy in identifying BRCA-related modules. Altogether, our study shows that LMSM is a promising method to investigate modular regulatory mechanism of sponge lncRNAs from heterogeneous data.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/l-ra7e3ldqI&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Electrical stimulation of neural systems is a key tool for understanding neural dynamics and ultimately for developing clinical treatments. Many applications of electrical stimulation affect large populations of neurons. However, computational models of large networks of spiking neurons are inherently hard to simulate and analyze. We evaluate a reduced mean-field model of excitatory and inhibitory adaptive exponential integrate-and-fire (AdEx) neurons which can be used to efficiently study the effects of electrical stimulation on large neural populations. The rich dynamical properties of this basic cortical model are described in detail and validated using large network simulations. Bifurcation diagrams reflecting the network’s state reveal asynchronous up- and down-states, bistable regimes, and oscillatory regions corresponding to fast excitation-inhibition and slow excitation-adaptation feedback loops. The biophysical parameters of the AdEx neuron can be coupled to an electric field with realistic field strengths which then can be propagated up to the population description. We show how on the edge of bifurcation, direct electrical inputs cause network state transitions, such as turning on and off oscillations of the population rate. Oscillatory input can frequency-entrain and phase-lock endogenous oscillations. Relatively weak electric field strengths on the order of 1 V/m are able to produce these effects, indicating that field effects are strongly amplified in the network. The effects of time-varying external stimulation are well-predicted by the mean-field model, further underpinning the utility of low-dimensional neural mass models.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/7zMWipN6ZMc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Learning action-oriented models through active inference</title>

Converging theories suggest that organisms learn and exploit probabilistic models of their environment. However, it remains unclear how such models can be learned in practice. The open-ended complexity of natural environments means that it is generally infeasible for organisms to model their environment comprehensively. Alternatively, &lt;i&gt;action-oriented&lt;/i&gt; models attempt to encode a parsimonious representation of adaptive agent-environment interactions. One approach to learning action-oriented models is to learn online in the presence of goal-directed behaviours. This constrains an agent to behaviourally relevant trajectories, reducing the diversity of the data a model need account for. Unfortunately, this approach can cause models to prematurely converge to sub-optimal solutions, through a process we refer to as a &lt;i&gt;bad-bootstrap&lt;/i&gt;. Here, we exploit the normative framework of &lt;i&gt;active inference&lt;/i&gt; to show that efficient action-oriented models can be learned by balancing goal-oriented and epistemic (&lt;i&gt;information-seeking&lt;/i&gt;) behaviours in a principled manner. We illustrate our approach using a simple agent-based model of bacterial chemotaxis. We first demonstrate that learning via goal-directed behaviour indeed constrains models to behaviorally relevant aspects of the environment, but that this approach is prone to sub-optimal convergence. We then demonstrate that epistemic behaviours facilitate the construction of accurate and comprehensive models, but that these models are not tailored to any specific behavioural niche and are therefore less efficient in their use of data. Finally, we show that active inference agents learn models that are parsimonious, tailored to action, and which avoid bad bootstraps and sub-optimal convergence. Critically, our results indicate that models learned through active inference can support adaptive behaviour in spite of, and indeed &lt;i&gt;because of&lt;/i&gt;, their departure from veridical representations of the environment. Our approach provides a principled method for learning adaptive models from limited interactions with an environment, highlighting a route to sample efficient learning algorithms.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/kVx4Eq3TDIk&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eNeuro: Components of Endocannabinoid Signaling System Are Expressed in the Perinatal Mouse Cerebellum and Required for Its Normal Development</title>
	<link>http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/7/2/ENEURO.0471-19.2020?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Endocannabinoid (eCB) signaling system (ECS), encompassing cannabinoid receptors and enzymes involved in the synthesis and degradation of the endogenous cannabinoid signaling lipids, is highly expressed in the cerebellar cortex of adult humans and rodents. In addition to their well-established role in neuromodulation, eCBs have been shown to play key roles in aspects of neurodevelopment in the fore- and mid-brain, including neurogenesis, cell migration, and synapse specification. However, little is known about the role of ECS in cerebellar development. In this study, we conducted immunohistochemical characterization of ECS components through key stages of cerebellar development in mice using antibodies for 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) synthetizing and degrading enzymes and the major brain cannabinoid receptor, cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1), in combination with cerebellar cell markers. Our results reveal a temporally, spatially, and cytologically dynamic pattern of expression. Production, receptor binding, and degradation of eCBs are tightly controlled, thus localization of eCB receptors and the complementary cannabinoid signaling machinery determines the direction, duration, and ultimately the outcome of eCB signaling. To gain insights into the role of eCB signaling in cerebellar development, we characterized gross anatomy of cerebellar midvermis in CB1 knock-out (CB1 KO) mice, as well as their performance in cerebellar-influenced motor tasks. Our results show persistent and selective anatomic and behavioral alterations in CB1 KOs. Consequently, the insights gained from this study lay down the foundation for investigating specific cellular and molecular mechanisms regulated by eCB signaling during cerebellar development.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eNeuro: Differential Scaling of Synaptic Molecules within Functional Zones of an Excitatory Synapse during Homeostatic Plasticity</title>
	<link>http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/7/2/ENEURO.0407-19.2020?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Homeostatic scaling is a form of synaptic plasticity where individual synapses scale their strengths to compensate for global suppression or elevation of neuronal activity. This process can be studied by measuring miniature EPSP (mEPSP) amplitudes and frequencies following the regulation of activity in neuronal cultures. Here, we demonstrate a quantitative approach to characterize multiplicative synaptic scaling using immunolabelling of hippocampal neuronal cultures treated with tetrodotoxin (TTX) or bicuculline to extract scaling factors for various synaptic proteins. This approach allowed us to directly examine the scaling of presynaptic and postsynaptic scaffolding molecules along with neurotransmitter receptors in primary cultures from mouse and rat hippocampal neurons. We show robust multiplicative scaling of synaptic scaffolding molecules namely, Shank2, PSD95, Bassoon, and AMPA receptor subunits and quantify their scaling factors. We use super-resolution microscopy to calculate scaling factors of surface expressed GluA2 within functional zones of the synapse and show that there is differential and correlated scaling of GluA2 levels within the spine, the postsynaptic density (PSD), and the perisynaptic regions. Our method opens a novel paradigm to quantify relative molecular changes of synaptic proteins within distinct subsynaptic compartments from a large number of synapses in response to alteration of neuronal activity, providing anatomic insights into the intricacies of variability in strength of individual synapses.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eNeuro: Effect of Stimulus-Dependent Spike Timing on Population Coding of Sound Location in the Owls Auditory Midbrain</title>
	<link>http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/7/2/ENEURO.0244-19.2020?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;In the auditory system, the spectrotemporal structure of acoustic signals determines the temporal pattern of spikes. Here, we investigated this effect in neurons of the barn owl’s auditory midbrain (&lt;i&gt;Tyto furcata&lt;/i&gt;) that are selective for auditory space and whether it can influence the coding of sound direction. We found that in the nucleus where neurons first become selective to combinations of sound localization cues, reproducibility of spike trains across repeated trials of identical sounds, a metric of across-trial temporal fidelity of spiking patterns evoked by a stimulus, was maximal at the sound direction that elicited the highest firing rate. We then tested the hypothesis that this stimulus-dependent patterning resulted in rate co-modulation of cells with similar frequency and spatial selectivity, driving stimulus-dependent synchrony of population responses. Tetrodes were used to simultaneously record multiple nearby units in the optic tectum (OT), where auditory space is topographically represented. While spiking of neurons in OT showed lower reproducibility across trials compared with upstream nuclei, spike-time synchrony between nearby OT neurons was highest for sounds at their preferred direction. A model of the midbrain circuit explained the relationship between stimulus-dependent reproducibility and synchrony, and demonstrated that this effect can improve the decoding of sound location from the OT output. Thus, stimulus-dependent spiking patterns in the auditory midbrain can have an effect on spatial coding. This study reports a functional connection between spike patterning elicited by spectrotemporal features of a sound and the coding of its location.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eNeuro: Concentration-Dependent Recruitment of Mammalian Odorant Receptors</title>
	<link>http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/7/2/ENEURO.0103-19.2019?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;A fundamental challenge in studying principles of organization used by the olfactory system to encode odor concentration information has been identifying comprehensive sets of activated odorant receptors (ORs) across a broad concentration range inside freely behaving animals. In mammals, this has recently become feasible with high-throughput sequencing-based methods that identify populations of activated ORs &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. In this study, we characterized the mouse OR repertoires activated by the two odorants, acetophenone (ACT) and 2,5-dihydro-2,4,5-trimethylthiazoline (TMT), from 0.01% to 100% (v/v) as starting concentrations using phosphorylated ribosomal protein S6 capture followed by RNA-Seq. We found Olfr923 to be one of the most sensitive ORs that is enriched by ACT. Using a mouse line that genetically labels Olfr923-positive axons, we provided evidence that ACT activates the Olfr923 glomeruli in the olfactory bulb. Through molecular dynamics stimulations, we identified amino acid residues in the Olfr923 binding cavity that facilitate ACT binding. This study sheds light on the active process by which unique OR repertoires may collectively facilitate the discrimination of odorant concentrations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eNeuro: An Indexing Theory for Working Memory Based on Fast Hebbian Plasticity</title>
	<link>http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/7/2/ENEURO.0374-19.2020?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Working memory (WM) is a key component of human memory and cognition. Computational models have been used to study the underlying neural mechanisms, but neglected the important role of short-term memory (STM) and long-term memory (LTM) interactions for WM. Here, we investigate these using a novel multiarea spiking neural network model of prefrontal cortex (PFC) and two parietotemporal cortical areas based on macaque data. We propose a WM indexing theory that explains how PFC could associate, maintain, and update multimodal LTM representations. Our simulations demonstrate how simultaneous, brief multimodal memory cues could build a temporary joint memory representation as an &quot;index&quot; in PFC by means of fast Hebbian synaptic plasticity. This index can then reactivate spontaneously and thereby also the associated LTM representations. Cueing one LTM item rapidly pattern completes the associated uncued item via PFC. The PFC–STM network updates flexibly as new stimuli arrive, thereby gradually overwriting older representations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eNeuro: Unique Organization of Actin Cytoskeleton in Magnocellular Vasopressin Neurons in Normal Conditions and in Response to Salt-Loading</title>
	<link>http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/7/2/ENEURO.0351-19.2020?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Magnocellular neurosecretory cells (MNCs) are intrinsically osmosensitive and can be activated by increases in blood osmolality, triggering the release of antidiuretic hormone vasopressin (VP) to promote water retention. Hence, the activity of magnocellular VP neurons is one of the key elements contributing to the regulation of body fluid homeostasis in healthy organisms. Chronic exposure to high dietary salt leads to excessive activation of VP neurons, thereby elevating levels of circulating VP, which can cause increases in blood pressure contributing to salt-dependent hypertension. However, the molecular basis underlying high-salt diet-induced hyperactivation of magnocellular VP neurons remains not fully understood. Previous studies suggest that magnocellular neurosecretory neurons contain a subcortical layer of actin filaments and pharmacological stabilization of this actin network potentiates osmotically-induced activation of magnocellular neurons. Using super-resolution imaging &lt;i&gt;in situ&lt;/i&gt;, we investigated the organization of the actin cytoskeleton in rat MNCs under normal physiological conditions and after a chronic increase in blood osmolality following 7 d of salt-loading (SL). We found that, in addition to the subcortical layer of actin filaments, magnocellular VP neurons are endowed with a unique network of cytoplasmic actin filaments throughout their somata. Moreover, we revealed that the density of both subcortical and cytoplasmic actin networks in magnocellular VP neurons is dramatically increased following SL. These results suggest that increased osmo-responsiveness of VP neurons following chronic exposure to high dietary salt may be mediated by the modulation of unique actin networks in magnocellular VP neurons, possibly contributing to elevated blood pressure in this condition.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Inducing Partner Preference in Mice by Chemogenetic Stimulation of CA2 Hippocampal Subfield</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2020.00061</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Social recognition is fundamental for social decision making and the establishment of long-lasting affiliative behaviors in behaviorally complex social groups. It is a critical step in establishing a selective preference for a social partner or group member. C57BL/6J lab mice do not form monogamous relationships, and typically do not show prolonged social preferences for familiar mice. The CA2 hippocampal subfield plays a crucial role in social memory and optogenetic stimulation of inputs to the dorsal CA2 field during a short memory acquisition period can enhance and extend social memories in mice. Here, we show that partner preference in mice can be induced by chemogenetic selective stimulation of the monosynaptic projections from the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN) to the CA2 during the cohabitation period. Specifically, male mice spend more time in social contact, grooming and huddling with the partner compared to a novel female. Preference was not induced by prolonging the cohabitation period and allowing more time for social interactions and males to sire pups with the familiar female. These results suggest that PVN-to-CA2 projections are part of an evolutionarily conserved neural circuitry underlying the formation of social preference and may promote behavioral changes with appropriate stimulation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Merosin deficient Congenital Muscular Dystrophy (MDC1A), or LAMA2-related muscular dystrophy (LAMA2-RD), is a recessive disorder resulting from mutations in the LAMA2 gene, encoding for the alpha-2 chain of laminin-211. The disease is predominantly characterized by progressive muscular dystrophy affecting patient motor function and reducing life expectancy. However, LAMA2-RD also comprises a developmentally-associated dysmyelinating neuropathy that contributes to the disease progression, in addition to brain abnormalities; the latter often underappreciated. In this brief review, we present data supporting the impact of peripheral neuropathy in the LAMA2-RD phenotype, including both mouse models and human studies. We discuss the molecular mechanisms underlying nerve abnormalities and involved in the laminin-211 pathway, which affects axon sorting, ensheathing and myelination. We conclude with some final considerations of consequences on nerve regeneration and potential therapeutic strategies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

In this paper, we examine in detail the link between vigilance and rsfMRI measures, such as signal variance and functional connectivity.

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: A Meta-Analysis of Gray Matter Differences Between Bilinguals and Monolinguals</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00146</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Bilingualism is of great interest to the neuroscience of language, and understanding the anatomical changes associated with second language learning help inform theories of bilingual advantage across the lifespan. While the literature on structural differences between bilinguals and monolinguals is robust, relatively few studies of gray matter (GM) have directly compared bilinguals with monolinguals in a whole-brain analysis. Overall, this and heterogeneity of study samples and methodology have led to a lack of clear anatomical support for major theories. Here, we engage in an activation likelihood estimate (ALE) meta-analysis of voxel-based morphometry (VBM) studies of GM for cases that directly compare bilingual and monolingual subjects in a whole-brain analysis. The analysis (sixteen foci, from ten contrasts across eight studies) resulted in one cluster located primarily within the anterior lobe of the right cerebellum. However, when the one pediatric study was removed, the analysis revealed no consistent results across the studies included in this meta-analysis. This suggests that for VBM studies of bilingual and monolingual adults there is considerable heterogeneity of results that complicate the understanding of the bilingual brain. Future studies will need to include larger, more well-defined samples and interrogate more fine-grained anatomical features such as cortical thickness and surface area in order to more fully examine the anatomical changes associated with bilingualism across the lifespan.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Agency and Performance of Reach-to-Grasp With Modified Control of a Virtual Hand: Implications for Rehabilitation</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00126</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;This study investigated how modified control of a virtual hand executing reach-to-grasp affects functional performance and agency (perception of control). The objective of this work was to demonstrate positive relationships between reaching performance and grasping agency and motivate greater consideration of agency in movement rehabilitation. We hypothesized that agency and performance have positive correlation across varying control modes of the virtual hand. In this study, each participant controlled motion of a virtual hand through motion of his or her own hand. Control of the virtual hand was modified according to a specific control mode. Each mode involved the virtual hand moving at a modified speed, having noise, or including a level of automation. These specific modes represent potential control features to adapt for a rehabilitation device such as a prosthetic arm and hand. In this study, significant changes in agency and performance were observed across the control modes. Overall, a significant positive relationship (p &amp;lt; 0.001) was observed between the primary performance metric of reach (tracking a minimum path length trajectory) and an implicit measurement of agency (intentional binding). Intentional binding was assessed through participant perceptions of time-intervals between grasp contact and a sound event. Other notable findings include improved movement efficiency (increased smoothness, reduced acceleration) during expression of higher agency and shift toward greater implicit versus explicit agency with higher control speed. Positively relating performance and agency incentivizes control adaptation of powered movement devices, such as prostheses or exoskeletons, to maximize both user engagement and functional performance. Agency-based approaches may foster user-device integration at a cognitive level and facilitate greater clinical retention of the device. Future work should identify robust and automated methods to adapt device control for increased agency. Objectives include how virtual reality (VR) may identify optimal control of real-world devices and assessing real-time agency from neurophysiological signals.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience: Contextual Integration in Cortical and Convolutional Neural Networks</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2020.00031</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;It has been suggested that neurons can represent sensory input using probability distributions and neural circuits can perform probabilistic inference. Lateral connections between neurons have been shown to have non-random connectivity and modulate responses to stimuli within the classical receptive field. Large-scale efforts mapping local cortical connectivity describe cell type specific connections from inhibitory neurons and like-to-like connectivity between excitatory neurons. To relate the observed connectivity to computations, we propose a neuronal network model that approximates Bayesian inference of the probability of different features being present at different image locations. We show that the lateral connections between excitatory neurons in a circuit implementing contextual integration in this should depend on correlations between unit activities, minus a global inhibitory drive. The model naturally suggests the need for two types of inhibitory gates (normalization, surround inhibition). First, using natural scene statistics and classical receptive fields corresponding to simple cells parameterized with data from mouse primary visual cortex, we show that the predicted connectivity qualitatively matches with that measured in mouse cortex: neurons with similar orientation tuning have stronger connectivity, and both excitatory and inhibitory connectivity have a modest spatial extent, comparable to that observed in mouse visual cortex. We incorporate lateral connections learned using this model into convolutional neural networks. Features are defined by supervised learning on the task, and the lateral connections provide an unsupervised learning of feature context in multiple layers. Since the lateral connections provide contextual information when the feedforward input is locally corrupted, we show that incorporating such lateral connections into convolutional neural networks makes them more robust to noise and leads to better performance on noisy versions of the MNIST dataset. Decomposing the predicted lateral connectivity matrices into low-rank and sparse components introduces additional cell types into these networks. We explore effects of cell-type specific perturbations on network computation. Our framework can potentially be applied to networks trained on other tasks, with the learned lateral connections aiding computations implemented by feedforward connections when the input is unreliable and demonstrate the potential usefulness of combining supervised and unsupervised learning techniques in real-world vision tasks.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neural Circuits: GABAergic Input From the Basal Forebrain Promotes the Survival of Adult-Born Neurons in the Mouse Olfactory Bulb</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncir.2020.00017</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A unique feature of the olfactory system is the continuous generation and integration of new neurons throughout adulthood. Adult-born neuron survival and integration is dependent on activity and sensory experience, which is largely mediated by early synaptic inputs that adult-born neurons receive upon entering the olfactory bulb (OB). As in early postnatal development, the first synaptic inputs onto adult-born neurons are GABAergic. However, the specific sources of early synaptic GABA and the influence of specific inputs on adult-born neuron development are poorly understood. Here, we use retrograde and anterograde viral tracing to reveal robust GABAergic projections from the basal forebrain horizontal limb of the diagonal band of Broca (HDB) to the granule cell layer (GCL) and glomerular layer (GL) of the mouse OB. Whole-cell electrophysiological recordings indicate that these projections target interneurons in the GCL and GL, including adult-born granule cells (abGCs). Recordings from birth-dated abGCs reveal a developmental time course in which HDB GABAergic input onto abGCs emerges as the neurons first enter the OB, and strengthens throughout the critical period of abGC development. Finally, we show that removing GABAergic signaling from HDB neurons results in decreased abGC survival. Together these data show that GABAergic projections from the HDB synapse onto immature abGCs in the OB to promote their survival through the critical period, thus representing a source of long-range input modulating plasticity in the adult OB.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Sonic Hedgehog Signaling Agonist (SAG) Triggers BDNF Secretion and Promotes the Maturation of GABAergic Networks in the Postnatal Rat Hippocampus</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00098</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Sonic hedgehog (Shh) signaling plays critical roles during early central nervous system development, such as neural cell proliferation, patterning of the neural tube and neuronal differentiation. While Shh signaling is still present in the postnatal brain, the roles it may play are, however, largely unknown. In particular, Shh signaling components are found at the synaptic junction in the maturing hippocampus during the first two postnatal weeks. This period is characterized by the presence of ongoing spontaneous synaptic activity at the cellular and network levels thought to play important roles in the onset of neuronal circuit formation and synaptic plasticity. Here, we demonstrate that non-canonical Shh signaling increases the frequency of the synchronized electrical activity called Giant Depolarizing Potentials (GDP) and enhances spontaneous GABA post-synaptic currents in the rodent hippocampus during the early postnatal period. This effect is mediated specifically through the Shh co-receptor Smoothened via intracellular Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; signal and the activation of the BDNF-TrkB signaling pathway. Given the importance of these spontaneous events on neuronal network maturation and refinement, this study opens new perspectives for Shh signaling on the control of early stages of postnatal brain maturation and physiology.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Exercise Attenuates Brain Aging by Rescuing Down-Regulated Wnt/β-Catenin Signaling in Aged Rats</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00105</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Down-regulated Wnt signaling is involved in brain aging with declined cognitive capacity due to its modulation on neuronal function and synaptic plasticity. However, the molecular mechanisms are still unclear. In the present study, the naturally aged rat model was established by feeding rats from 6 months old to 21 months old. The cognitive capacity of aged rats was compared with young rats as the controls and the aged rats upon 12-week exercise interventions including treadmill running, resistance exercise, and alternating exercise with resistance exercise and treadmill running. Wnt signaling was examined in hippocampal tissues of the rats from different groups. Results indicated that the expression of Dickkopf-1 (DKK-1) as an antagonist of Wnt signal pathway, the activation of GSK-3β, and the hyperphosphorylated Tau were markedly increased as the extension of age. Meanwhile, higher p-β-catenin&lt;sup&gt;Ser33, 37, Thr41&lt;/sup&gt; promoted neuronal degradation of aged rats. In contrast, three kinds of exercise interventions rescued the abnormal expression of DKK-1 and synaptophysin such as PSD-93 and PSD-95 in hippocampal tissues of the aged rats; especially 12-week treadmill running suppressed DKK-1 up-regulation, GSK-3β activation, β-catenin phosphorylation, and hyperphosphorylated Tau. In addition, the down-regulated PI3K/AKT and Wnt signal pathways were observed in aged rats, but could be reversed by resistance exercise and treadmill running. Moreover, the increased Bax and reduced Bcl-2 levels in hippocampal tissues of aged rats were also reversed upon treadmill running intervention. Taken together, down-regulated Wnt signaling suppressed PI3K/Akt signal pathway, aggravated synaptotoxicity, induced neuron apoptosis, and accelerated cognitive impairment of aged rats. However, exercise interventions, especially treadmill running, can attenuate their brain aging process via restoring Wnt signaling and corresponding targets.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Hippocampus: Transient appearance of Ca2+‐permeable AMPA receptors is crucial for the production of repetitive LTP‐induced synaptic enhancement (RISE) in cultured hippocampal slices</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/hipo.23206?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have previously shown that repetitive induction of long‐term potentiation (LTP) by glutamate (100 μM, 3 min, three times at 24‐hr intervals) provoked long‐lasting synaptic enhancement accompanied by synaptogenesis in rat hippocampal slice cultures, a phenomenon termed RISE (repetitive LTP‐induced synaptic enhancement). Here, we examined the role of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;‐permeable (CP) AMPA receptors (AMPARs) in the establishment of RISE. We first found a component sensitive to the Joro‐spider toxin (JSTX), a blocker of CP‐AMPARs, in a field EPSP recorded from CA3‐CA1 synapses at 2–3 days after stimulation, but this component was not found for 9–10 days. We also observed that rectification of AMPAR‐mediated current appeared only 2–3 days after stimulation, using a whole‐cell patch clamp recording from CA1 pyramidal neurons. These findings indicate that CP‐AMPAR is transiently expressed in the developing phase of RISE. The blockade of CP‐AMPARs by JSTX for 24 hr at this developing phase inhibited RISE establishment, accompanied by the loss of small synapses at the ultrastructural level. These results suggest that transiently induced CP‐AMPARs play a critical role in synaptogenesis in the developing phase of long‐lasting hippocampal synaptic plasticity, RISE.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Dysregulation of the retromer complex system in Down syndrome</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25752?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of Down syndrome (DS) patients develop Alzheimer's disease (AD) neuropathology by age 40. Although this increased susceptibility to AD in DS is thought to be primarily due to triplication of the amyloid precursor protein located on chromosome 21, the precise molecular mechanisms are not well understood. Recent evidence has implicated defective protein sorting and trafficking secondary to deficiencies in retromer complex proteins in AD pathogenesis. Thus, the objective of the present study is to assess the retromer complex system in DS.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Human post‐mortem brain tissue and fibroblasts from subjects with DS and healthy controls were examined for the various retromer protein components using western blot analysis and RT‐qPCR.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Retromer recognition core proteins were significantly decreased in DS fibroblasts, and in both the hippocampi and cortices of young (age 15‐40 years old) and aged (40‐65 years old) DS subjects compared to controls. Correlation analyses showed a significant inverse relationship between recognition core proteins and levels of soluble forms of Aβ 1‐40 and 1‐42 in both hippocampus (n=33, Spearman=‐0.59 to ‐0.38, p≤0.03 for VPS35, VPS26, VPS29, and VPS26B) and cortex tissue (n=57, Spearman=‐0.46 to ‐0.27, p≤0.04 for VPS35, VPS26, and VPS29) of the same patients.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We conclude that dysregulation of the retromer complex system is an early event in the development of the AD‐like pathology and cognitive decline in DS, and for this reason the system could represent a novel potential therapeutic target for DS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The precuneus (PreC; Brodmann area 7), a key hub within the default mode network (DMN) displays amyloid and tau‐containing neurofibrillary tangle (NFT) pathology during the onset of Alzheimer's disease (AD). PreC layer III projection neurons contain lysosomal hydrolase cathepsin D (CatD), 14)a marker of neurons vulnerable to NFT pathology. Here we applied single population laser capture microdissection coupled with custom‐designed microarray profiling to determine the genetic signature of PreC CatD‐positive‐layer III neurons accrued from postmortem tissue obtained from the Rush Religious Orders Study (RROS) cases with a premortem clinical diagnosis of no cognitive impairment (NCI), mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD. Expression profiling revealed significant differential expression of key transcripts in MCI and AD compared to NCI that underlie signaling defects, including dysregulation of genes within the endosomal‐lysosomal and autophagy pathways, cytoskeletal elements, AD‐related genes, ionotropic and metabotropic glutamate receptors, cholinergic enzyme and receptors, markers of monoamine neurotransmission as well as steroid‐related transcripts. Pervasive defects in both MCI and AD were found in select transcripts within these key gene ontology categories, underscoring the vulnerability of these corticocortical neurons during the onset and progression of dementia. Select PreC dysregulated genes detected via custom‐designed microarray analysis were validated using qPCR. In summary, expression profiling of CatD positive PreC layer III neurons revealed significant dysregulation of a mosaic of genes in MCI and AD that were not previously appreciated in terms of their indication of systems‐wide signaling defects in a key hub of the DMN.&lt;/p&gt;

	<content:encoded>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Altered synaptic function is thought to play a role in many neurodegenerative diseases, but little is known about the underlying mechanisms for synaptic dysfunction. The squid giant synapse (SGS) is a classical model for studying synaptic electrophysiology and ultrastructure, as well as molecular mechanisms of neurotransmission. Here, we conduct a multidisciplinary study of synaptic actions of misfolded human G85R-SOD1 causing familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). G85R-SOD1, but not WT-SOD1, inhibited synaptic transmission, altered presynaptic ultrastructure, and reduced both the size of the readily releasable pool (RRP) of synaptic vesicles and mobility from the reserved pool (RP) to the RRP. Unexpectedly, intermittent high-frequency stimulation (iHFS) blocked inhibitory effects of G85R-SOD1 on synaptic transmission, suggesting aberrant Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; signaling may underlie G85R-SOD1 toxicity. Ratiometric Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; imaging showed significantly increased presynaptic Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; induced by G85R-SOD1 that preceded synaptic dysfunction. Chelating Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; using EGTA prevented synaptic inhibition by G85R-SOD1, confirming the role of aberrant Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; in mediating G85R-SOD1 toxicity. These results extended earlier findings in mammalian motor neurons and advanced our understanding by providing possible molecular mechanisms and therapeutic targets for synaptic dysfunctions in ALS as well as a unique model for further studies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eNeuro: The Impact of Steroid Activation of TRPM3 on Spontaneous Activity in the Developing Retina</title>
	<link>http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/7/2/ENEURO.0175-19.2020?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;In the central nervous system, melastatin transient receptor potential (TRPM) channels function as receptors for the neurosteroid pregnenolone sulfate (PregS). The expression and function of TRPM3 has been explored in adult retina, although its role during development is unknown. We found, during the second postnatal week in mice, TRPM3 immunofluorescence labeled distinct subsets of inner retinal neurons, including a subset of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), similar to what has been reported in the adult. Labeling for a TRPM3 promoter-driven reporter confirmed expression of the TRPM3 gene in RGCs and revealed additional expression in nearly all Müller glial cells. Using two-photon calcium imaging, we show that PregS and the synthetic TRPM3 agonist CIM0216 (CIM) induced prolonged calcium transients in RGCs, which were mostly absent in TRPM3 knock-out (KO) mice. These prolonged calcium transients were not associated with strong membrane depolarizations but induced c-Fos expression. To elucidate the impact of PregS-activation of TRPM3 on retinal circuits we took two sets of physiological measurements. First, PregS induced a robust increase in the frequency but not amplitude of spontaneous postsynaptic currents (PSCs). This increase was absent in the TRPM3 KO mice. Second, PregS induced a small increase in cell participation and duration of retinal waves, but this modulation persisted in TRPM3 KO mice, indicating PregS was acting on wave generating circuits independent of TRPM3 channels. Though baseline frequency of retinal waves was slightly reduced in the TRPM3 KO mice, other properties of waves were indistinguishable from wildtype. Together, these results indicate that the presence of neurosteroids impact spontaneous synaptic activity and retinal waves during development via both TRPM3-dependent and independent mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Extra‐Axial Inflammatory Signal in Parameninges in Migraine with Visual Aura</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25731?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cortical spreading depression (CSD) underlies the neurobiology of migraine with aura (MWA).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Animal studies reveal networks of microvessels linking brain–meninges–bone marrow. CSD activates the trigeminovascular system, evoking a meningeal inflammatory response. Accordingly, this study examines the upregulation of an inflammatory marker in extra‐axial tissues in migraine with visual aura.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We used simultaneously acquired &lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;C‐PBR28 positron emission tomography/magnetic resonance imaging data of 18kDa translocator protein (an inflammatory marker) in MWA patients (n = 11) who experienced headaches and visual aura in the preceding month. We measured mean tracer uptake (standardized uptake value ratio [SUVR]) in 4 regions of interest comprising the meninges plus the adjacent overlying skull bone (parameningeal tissues [PMT]). These data were compared to healthy controls and patients with pain (chronic low back pain).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MWA had significantly higher mean SUVR in PMT overlying occipital cortex than both other groups, although not in the PMT overlying 3 other cortical areas. A positive correlation was also found between the number of visual auras and tracer uptake in occipital PMT.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A strong persistent extra‐axial inflammatory signal was found in meninges and calvarial bone overlying the occipital lobe in migraine with visual auras. Our findings are reminiscent of CSD‐induced meningeal inflammation and provide the first imaging evidence implicating inflammation in the pathophysiology of migraine meningeal symptoms. We suspect that this inflammatory focus results from a signal that migrates from underlying brain and if so, may implicate newly discovered bridging vessels that crosstalk between brain and skull marrow, a finding of potential relevance to migraine and other neuroinflammatory brain disorders.
