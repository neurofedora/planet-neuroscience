	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2012.02659</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Attention is a complex and broad concept, studied across multiple disciplines
spanning artificial intelligence, cognitive science, psychology, neuroscience,
and related fields. Although many of the ideas regarding attention do not
significantly overlap among these fields, there is a common theme of adaptive
control of limited resources. In this work, we review the concept and variants
of attention in artificial neural networks (ANNs). We also discuss the origin
of attention from the neuroscience point of view parallel to that of ANNs.
Instead of having seemingly disconnected dialogues between varied disciplines,
we suggest grounding the ideas on common conceptual frameworks for a systematic
analysis of attention and towards possible unification of ideas in AI and
Neuroscience.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2012.02361</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Over the past few decades, neuroscience experiments have become increasingly
complex and naturalistic. Experimental design has in turn become more
challenging, as experiments must conform to an ever-increasing diversity of
design constraints. In this article we demonstrate how this design process can
be greatly assisted using an optimization tool known as Mixed Integer Linear
Programming (MILP). MILP provides a rich framework for incorporating many types
of real-world design constraints into a neuroimaging experiment. We introduce
the mathematical foundations of MILP, compare MILP to other experimental design
techniques, and provide four case studies of how MILP can be used to solve
complex experimental design challenges.

	<title>arXiv: Computer Science: Neural and Evolutionary Computing: Evolving Character-Level DenseNet Architectures using Genetic Programming. (arXiv:2012.02327v1 [cs.CL])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2012.02327</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;DenseNet architectures have demonstrated impressive performance in image
classification tasks, but limited research has been conducted on using
character-level DenseNet (char-DenseNet) architectures for text classification
tasks. It is not clear what DenseNet architectures are optimal for text
classification tasks. The iterative task of designing, training and testing of
char-DenseNets is an NP-Hard problem that requires expert domain knowledge.
Evolutionary deep learning (EDL) has been used to automatically design CNN
architectures for the image classification domain, thereby mitigating the need
for expert domain knowledge. This study demonstrates the first work on using
EDL to evolve char-DenseNet architectures for text classification tasks. A
novel genetic programming-based algorithm (GP-Dense) coupled with an
indirect-encoding scheme, facilitates the evolution of performant char DenseNet
architectures. The algorithm is evaluated on two popular text datasets, and the
best-evolved models are benchmarked against four current state-of-the-art
character-level CNN and DenseNet models. Results indicate that the algorithm
evolves performant models for both datasets that outperform two of the
state-of-the-art models in terms of model accuracy and three of the
state-of-the-art models in terms of parameter size.

	<title>arXiv: Computer Science: Neural and Evolutionary Computing: Deep Learning for Road Traffic Forecasting: Does it Make a Difference?. (arXiv:2012.02260v1 [cs.LG])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2012.02260</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Deep Learning methods have been proven to be flexible to model complex
phenomena. This has also been the case of Intelligent Transportation Systems
(ITS), in which several areas such as vehicular perception and traffic analysis
have widely embraced Deep Learning as a core modeling technology. Particularly
in short-term traffic forecasting, the capability of Deep Learning to deliver
good results has generated a prevalent inertia towards using Deep Learning
models, without examining in depth their benefits and downsides. This paper
focuses on critically analyzing the state of the art in what refers to the use
of Deep Learning for this particular ITS research area. To this end, we
elaborate on the findings distilled from a review of publications from recent
years, based on two taxonomic criteria. A posterior critical analysis is held
to formulate questions and trigger a necessary debate about the issues of Deep
Learning for traffic forecasting. The study is completed with a benchmark of
diverse short-term traffic forecasting methods over traffic datasets of
different nature, aimed to cover a wide spectrum of possible scenarios. Our
experimentation reveals that Deep Learning could not be the best modeling
technique for every case, which unveils some caveats unconsidered to date that
should be addressed by the community in prospective studies. These insights
reveal new challenges and research opportunities in road traffic forecasting,
which are enumerated and discussed thoroughly, with the intention of inspiring
and guiding future research efforts in this field.

	<title>arXiv: Quantitative Biology: Neurons and Cognition: Inferring neural dynamics during burst suppression using a neurophysiology-inspired switching state-space model. (arXiv:2012.02246v1 [q-bio.QM])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2012.02246</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Burst suppression is an electroencephalography (EEG) pattern associated with
profoundly inactivated brain states characterized by cerebral metabolic
depression. Its distinctive feature is alternation between short temporal
segments of near-isoelectric inactivity (suppressions) and relatively
high-voltage activity (bursts). Prior modeling studies suggest that
burst-suppression EEG is a manifestation of two alternating brain states
associated with consumption (during a burst) and production (during a
suppression) of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). This finding motivates us to
infer latent states characterizing alternating brain states and underlying ATP
kinetics from instantaneous power of multichannel EEG using a switching
state-space model. Our model assumes Gaussian distributed data as a broadcast
network manifestation of one of two global brain states. The two brain states
are allowed to stochastically alternate with transition probabilities that
depend on the instantaneous ATP level, which evolves according to first-order
kinetics. The rate constants governing the ATP kinetics are allowed to vary as
first-order autoregressive processes. Our latent state estimates are determined
from data using a sequential Monte Carlo algorithm. Our
neurophysiology-informed model not only provides unsupervised segmentation of
multi-channel burst-suppression EEG but can also generate additional insights
on the level of brain inactivation during anesthesia.

	<title>arXiv: Computer Science: Neural and Evolutionary Computing: Evolving Character-level Convolutional Neural Networks for Text Classification. (arXiv:2012.02223v1 [cs.CL])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2012.02223</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Character-level convolutional neural networks (char-CNN) require no knowledge
of the semantic or syntactic structure of the language they classify. This
property simplifies its implementation but reduces its classification accuracy.
Increasing the depth of char-CNN architectures does not result in breakthrough
accuracy improvements. Research has not established which char-CNN
architectures are optimal for text classification tasks. Manually designing and
training char-CNNs is an iterative and time-consuming process that requires
expert domain knowledge. Evolutionary deep learning (EDL) techniques, including
surrogate-based versions, have demonstrated success in automatically searching
for performant CNN architectures for image analysis tasks. Researchers have not
applied EDL techniques to search the architecture space of char-CNNs for text
classification tasks. This article demonstrates the first work in evolving
char-CNN architectures using a novel EDL algorithm based on genetic
programming, an indirect encoding and surrogate models, to search for
performant char-CNN architectures automatically. The algorithm is evaluated on
eight text classification datasets and benchmarked against five manually
designed CNN architecture and one long short-term memory (LSTM) architecture.
Experiment results indicate that the algorithm can evolve architectures that
outperform the LSTM in terms of classification accuracy and five of the
manually designed CNN architectures in terms of classification accuracy and
parameter count.

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Quantitative Multi-Parameter Mapping Optimized for the Clinical Routine</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.611194</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Using quantitative multi-parameter mapping (MPM), studies can investigate clinically relevant microstructural changes with high reliability over time and across subjects and sites. However, long acquisition times (20 min for the standard 1-mm isotropic protocol) limit its translational potential. This study aimed to evaluate the sensitivity gain of a fast 1.6-mm isotropic MPM protocol including post-processing optimized for longitudinal clinical studies. 6 healthy volunteers (35±7 years old; 3 female) were scanned at 3T to acquire the following whole-brain MPM maps with 1.6 mm isotropic resolution: proton density (PD), magnetization transfer saturation (MT), longitudinal relaxation rate (R1), and transverse relaxation rate (R2&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;). MPM maps were generated using two RF transmit field (B1+) correction methods: (1) using an acquired B1+ map and (2) using a data-driven approach. Maps were generated with and without Gibb's ringing correction. The intra-/inter-subject coefficient of variation (CoV) of all maps in the gray and white matter, as well as in all anatomical regions of a fine-grained brain atlas, were compared between the different post-processing methods using Student's t-test. The intra-subject stability of the 1.6-mm MPM protocol is 2–3 times higher than for the standard 1-mm sequence and can be achieved in less than half the scan duration. Intra-subject variability for all four maps in white matter ranged from 1.2–5.3% and in gray matter from 1.8 to 9.2%. Bias-field correction using an acquired B1+ map significantly improved intra-subject variability of PD and R1 in the gray (42%) and white matter (54%) and correcting the raw images for the effect of Gibb's ringing further improved intra-subject variability in all maps in the gray (11%) and white matter (10%). Combining Gibb's ringing correction and bias field correction using acquired B1+ maps provides excellent stability of the 7-min MPM sequence with 1.6 mm resolution suitable for the clinical routine.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Electrical Stimulation Mapping of Brain Function: A Comparison of Subdural Electrodes and Stereo-EEG</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.611291</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Despite technological and interpretative advances, the non-invasive modalities used for pre-surgical evaluation of patients with drug-resistant epilepsy (DRE), fail to generate a concordant anatomo-electroclinical hypothesis for the location of the seizure onset zone in many patients. This requires chronic monitoring with intracranial electroencephalography (EEG), which facilitates better localization of the seizure onset zone, and allows evaluation of the functional significance of cortical regions-of-interest by electrical stimulation mapping (ESM). There are two principal modalities for intracranial EEG, namely subdural electrodes and stereotactic depth electrodes (stereo-EEG). Although ESM is considered the gold standard for functional mapping with subdural electrodes, there have been concerns about its utility with stereo-EEG. This is mainly because subdural electrodes allow contiguous sampling of the dorsolateral convexity of cerebral hemispheres, and permit delineation of the extent of eloquent functional areas on the cortical surface. Stereo-EEG, while having relatively sparse sampling on the cortical surface, offers the ability to access the depth of sulci, mesial and basal surfaces of cerebral hemispheres, and deep structures such as the insula, which are largely inaccessible to subdural electrodes. As stereo-EEG is increasingly the preferred modality for intracranial monitoring, we find it opportune to summarize the literature for ESM with stereo-EEG in this narrative review. Emerging evidence shows that ESM for defining functional neuroanatomy is feasible with stereo-EEG, but probably requires a different approach for interpretation and clinical decision making compared to ESM with subdural electrodes. We have also compared ESM with stereo-EEG and subdural electrodes, for current thresholds required to evoke desired functional responses vs. unwanted after-discharges. In this regard, there is preliminary evidence that ESM with stereo-EEG may be safer than ESM with subdural grids. Finally, we have highlighted important unanswered clinical and scientific questions for ESM with stereo-EEG in the hope to encourage future research and collaborative efforts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Hippocampal Neurotransmitter Inhibition Suppressed During Gaming Explained by Skill Rather Than Gamer Status</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.585764</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Goal-directed spatial decision making video games combine spatial mapping, memory, and reward; all of which can involve hippocampal excitation through suppression of an inhibitory neurotransmitter, γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA). In this study, GABA was measured before and after 30 min of video game play within a voxel around the hippocampus. It was predicted that all participants would experience a decrease in GABA during gaming as a result of in-game rewards; and, those who were most competitive with the goal-directed spatial decision making game would display lower hippocampal GABA concentrations after gaming. Those who were not competitive, because they were too skilled or not skilled enough, would demonstrate higher hippocampal GABA concentrations after gaming. While there were no significant differences in hippocampal GABA before and after gaming for gamers and non-gamers alike, there was a significant quadratic regression between performance on a spatial working memory task and post-gaming hippocampal GABA concentrations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Characterization of the Stages of Creative Writing With Mobile EEG Using Generalized Partial Directed Coherence</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.577651</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Two stages of the creative writing process were characterized through mobile scalp electroencephalography (EEG) in a 16-week creative writing workshop. Portable dry EEG systems (four channels: TP09, AF07, AF08, TP10) with synchronized head acceleration, video recordings, and journal entries, recorded mobile brain-body activity of Spanish heritage students. Each student's brain-body activity was recorded as they experienced spaces in Houston, Texas (“Preparation” stage), and while they worked on their creative texts (“Generation” stage). We used Generalized Partial Directed Coherence (gPDC) to compare the functional connectivity among both stages. There was a trend of higher gPDC in the Preparation stage from right temporo-parietal (TP10) to left anterior-frontal (AF07) brain scalp areas within 1–50 Hz, not reaching statistical significance. The opposite directionality was found for the Generation stage, with statistical significant differences (p &amp;lt; 0.05) restricted to the delta band (1–4 Hz). There was statistically higher gPDC observed for the inter-hemispheric connections AF07–AF08 in the delta and theta bands (1–8 Hz), and AF08 to TP09 in the alpha and beta (8–30 Hz) bands. The left anterior-frontal (AF07) recordings showed higher power localized to the gamma band (32–50 Hz) for the Generation stage. An ancillary analysis of Sample Entropy did not show significant difference. The information transfer from anterior-frontal to temporal-parietal areas of the scalp may reflect multisensory interpretation during the Preparation stage, while brain signals originating at temporal-parietal toward frontal locations during the Generation stage may reflect the final decision making process to translate the multisensory experience into a creative text.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Testing the Specificity of Predictors of Reading, Spelling and Maths: A New Model of the Association Among Learning Skills Based on Competence, Performance and Acquisition</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.573998</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In a previous study (Zoccolotti et al., 2020) we examined reading, spelling, and maths skills in an unselected group of 129 Italian children attending fifth grade by testing various cognitive predictors; results showed a high degree of predictors’ selectivity for each of these three behaviors. In the present study, we focused on the specificity of the predictors by performing cross-analyses on the same dataset; i.e., we predicted spelling and maths skills based on reading predictors, reading based on maths predictors and so on. Results indicated that some predictors, such as the Orthographic Decision and the Arithmetic Facts tests, predicted reading, spelling and maths skills in similar ways, while others predicted different behaviors but only for a specific parameter, such as fluency but not accuracy (as in the case of RAN), and still others were specific for a single behavior (e.g., Visual-auditory Pseudo-word Matching test predicted only spelling skills). To interpret these results, we propose a novel model of learning skills separately considering factors in terms of competence, performance and acquisition (automatization). Reading, spelling and calculation skills would depend on the development of discrete and different abstract competences (accounting for the partial dissociations among learning disorders reported in the literature). By contrast, overlap among behaviors would be accounted for by defective acquisition in automatized responses to individual “instances”; this latter skill is item specific but domain independent. Finally, performance factors implied in task’s characteristics (such as time pressure) may contribute to the partial association among learning skills. It is proposed that this new model may provide a useful base for interpreting the diffuse presence of comorbidities among learning disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Long Term Follow-Up on Pediatric Cases With Congenital Myasthenic Syndromes—A Retrospective Single Centre Cohort Study</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.560860</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Introduction: Congenital myasthenic syndromes (CMS) refer to a heterogenic group of neuromuscular transmission disorders. CMS-subtypes are diverse regarding exercise intolerance and muscular weakness, varying from mild symptoms to life-limiting forms with neonatal onset. Long-term follow-up studies on disease progression and treatment-response in pediatric patients are rare.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Patients and Methods: We analyzed retrospective clinical and medication data in a cohort of 32 CMS-patients including the application of a standardized, not yet validated test (CMS-ST) to examine muscular strength and endurance in 21 patients at the last follow-up. Findings obtained in our cohort were compared with long-term follow-up studies of (adult) CMS-cohorts from the literature by considering the underlying molecular mechanisms. Outcomes of CMS-ST were compared to results of normal clinical assessment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Thirty-two pediatric patients with defects in eight different CMS-genes were followed by a median time of 12.8 years. Fifty-nine percentage of patients manifested with first symptoms as neonates, 35% as infants. While 53% of patients presented a reduced walking distance, 34% were wheelchair-bound. Even under adequate therapy with pyridostigmine (PS) and 3,4-diaminopyridine, CHAT-mutations led to the progression of muscular weakness partly in combination with persistent respiratory and bulbar symptoms. RAPSN, CHRND, and CHRNB1 patients with neonatal manifestation, early respiratory problems, and bulbar symptoms showed a good and maintained treatment response. CHAT and CHRNE patients required higher PS dosages, whereas RAPSN patients needed a lower mean dosage at the last follow-up. The benefits of short-term medication and long-term progression of symptoms were highly dependent on the specific genetic defect. CMS-ST was carried out in 17/21 patients, determined affected muscle groups including bulbar and ocular symptoms, some of which were not reported by the patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: Our findings and comparison with the literature- suggest a better treatment-response and less severe progression of symptoms present in patients suffering from mutations in CMS-genes directly associated with receptor deficiency, while patients with defects leading to synaptopathy and presynaptic defects tend to have worse outcomes. Assessment of affected muscular groups and clinical symptoms by CMS-ST may be a useful tool for optimal therapeutic management of the patients, especially for future clinical studies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Brain Temperature Alters Contributions of Excitatory and Inhibitory Inputs to Evoked Field Potentials in the Rat Frontal Cortex</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.593027</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Changes in brain temperature have been reported to affect various brain functions. However, little is known about the effects of temperature on the neural activity at the network level, where multiple inputs are integrated. In this study, we recorded cortical evoked potentials while altering the local brain temperature in anesthetized rats. We delivered electrical stimulations to the midbrain dopamine area and measured the evoked potentials in the frontal cortex, the temperature of which was locally altered using a thermal control device. We focused on the maximum negative peaks, which was presumed to result mainly from polysynaptic responses, to examine the effect of local temperature on network activity. We showed that focal cortical cooling increased the amplitude of evoked potentials (negative correlation, &amp;gt;17°C); further cooling decreased their amplitude. This relationship would be graphically represented as an inverted-U-shaped curve. The pharmacological blockade of GABAergic inhibitory inputs eliminated the negative correlation (&amp;gt;17°C) and even showed a positive correlation when the concentration of GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptor antagonist was sufficiently high. Blocking the glutamatergic excitatory inputs decreased the amplitude but did not cause such inversion. Our results suggest that the negative correlation between the amplitude of evoked potentials and the near-physiological local temperature is caused by the alteration of the balance of contribution between excitatory and inhibitory inputs to the evoked potentials, possibly due to higher temperature sensitivity of inhibitory inputs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Endolymphatic Potential Measured From Developing and Adult Mouse Inner Ear</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.584928</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The mammalian inner ear has two major parts, the cochlea is responsible for hearing and the vestibular organ is responsible for balance. The cochlea and vestibular organs are connected by a series of canals in the temporal bone and two distinct extracellular fluids, endolymph and perilymph, fill different compartments of the inner ear. Stereocilia of mechanosensitive hair cells in the cochlea and vestibular end organs are bathed in the endolymph, which contains high K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ions and possesses a positive potential termed endolymphatic potential (ELP). Compartmentalization of the fluids provides an electrochemical gradient for hair cell mechanotransduction. In this study, we measured ELP from adult and neonatal C57BL/6J mice to determine how ELP varies and develops in the cochlear and vestibular endolymph. We measured ELP and vestibular microphonic response from saccules of neonatal mice to determine when vestibular function is mature. We show that ELP varies considerably in the cochlear and vestibular endolymph of adult mice, ranging from +95 mV in the basal turn to +87 mV in the apical turn of the cochlea, +9 mV in the saccule and utricle, and +3 mV in the semicircular canal. This suggests that ELP is indeed a local potential, despite the fact that endolymph composition is similar. We further show that vestibular ELP reaches adult-like magnitude around post-natal day 6, ~12 days earlier than maturation of cochlear ELP (i.e., endocochlear potential). Maturation of vestibular ELP coincides with the maturation of vestibular microphonic response recorded from the saccular macula, suggesting that maturation of vestibular function occurs much earlier than maturation of hearing in mice.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroanatomy: A Protocol for Cortical Type Analysis of the Human Neocortex Applied on Histological Samples, the Atlas of Von Economo and Koskinas, and Magnetic Resonance Imaging</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnana.2020.576015</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The human cerebral cortex is parcellated in hundreds of areas using neuroanatomy and imaging methods. Alternatively, cortical areas can be classified into few cortical types according to their degree of laminar differentiation. Cortical type analysis is based on the gradual and systematic variation of laminar features observed across the entire cerebral cortex in Nissl stained sections and has profound implications for understanding fundamental aspects of evolution, development, connections, function, and pathology of the cerebral cortex. In this protocol paper, we explain the general principles of cortical type analysis and provide tables with the fundamental features of laminar structure that are studied for this analysis. We apply cortical type analysis to the micrographs of the Atlas of the human cerebral cortex of von Economo and Koskinas and provide tables and maps with the areas of this Atlas and their corresponding cortical type. Finally, we correlate the cortical type maps with the T1w/T2w ratio from widely used reference magnetic resonance imaging scans. The analysis, tables and maps of the human cerebral cortex shown in this protocol paper can be used to predict patterns of connections between areas according to the principles of the Structural Model and determine their level in cortical hierarchies. Cortical types can also predict the spreading of abnormal proteins in neurodegenerative diseases to the level of cortical layers. In summary, cortical type analysis provides a theoretical and practical framework for directed studies of connectivity, synaptic plasticity, and selective vulnerability to neurologic and psychiatric diseases in the human neocortex.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Early Dendritic Dystrophy in Human Brains With Primary Age-Related Tauopathy</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.596894</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Dystrophic neurites (DNs) are found in many neurological conditions such as traumatic brain injury and age-related neurodegenerative diseases. In Alzheimer’s disease (AD) specifically, senile plaques containing silver-stained DNs were already described in the original literature defining this disease. These DNs could be both axonal and dendritic in origin, while axonal dystrophy relative to plaque formation has been more extensively studied. Here, we demonstrate an early occurrence of dendritic dystrophy in the hippocampal CA1 and subicular regions in human brains (n = 23) with primary age-related tauopathy (PART), with neurofibrillary tangle (NFT) burden ranging from Braak stages I to III in the absence of cerebral β-amyloid (Aβ) deposition. In Bielschowsky’s silver stain, segmented fusiform swellings on the apical dendrites of hippocampal and subicular pyramidal neurons were observed in all the cases, primarily over the stratum radiatum (s.r.). The numbers of silver-stained neuronal somata and dendritic swellings counted over CA1 to subiculum were positively correlated among the cases. Swollen dendritic processes were also detected in sections immunolabeled for phosphorylated tau (pTau) and sortilin. In aged and AD brains with both Aβ and pTau pathologies, silver- and immunolabeled dystrophic-like dendritic profiles occurred around and within individual neuritic plaques. These findings implicate that dendritic dystrophy can occur among hippocampal pyramidal neurons in human brains with PART. Therefore, as with the case of axonal dystrophy reported in literature, dendritic dystrophy can develop prior to Alzheimer-type plaque and tangle formation in the human brain.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Metabolic Disorder of Extracellular Matrix Mediated by Decorin Upregulation Is Associated With Brain Arteriovenous Malformation Diffuseness</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.584839</link>
	<content:encoded>Background and Objective&lt;p&gt;Diffuse brain arteriovenous malformations (BAVMs) are mixed up with normal brain parenchyma and therefore increase the difficulty of surgical resection, leading to poor surgical prognosis. Since the mechanism underlying BAVM diffuseness remains unknown, a quantitative proteomic analysis was performed to investigate the altered expression of proteins in diffuse BAVMs compared to compact ones.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;We performed proteomic analysis on five diffuse BAVMs and five compact BAVMs. Bioinformatics analysis was conducted to identify potential signals related to BAVM diffuseness. Candidate proteins were then investigated in BAVM specimens using immunofluorescence and Western blot analysis. Tube formation assays were used to investigate the effects of candidate proteins on the angiogenesis of human umbilical endothelial cells (HUVECs). Finally, Masson, Sirius red staining, and immunofluorescence were used to evaluate the characteristics of extracellular matrix (ECM) in BAVM tissues.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;A total of 58 proteins were found to be differentially expressed between diffuse and compact BAVMs via proteomic analysis. TGF-β (transforming growth factor-beta) signaling pathway, ECM–receptor pathway, relaxin signaling pathway, and several other pathways were associated with BAVM diffuseness. The TGF-β signaling pathway is associated with angiogenesis; the role of this pathway in the formation of diffuse BAVMs was investigated, and the decorin (DCN) upregulation played an important role in this process. Immunofluorescence showed that DCN was significantly upregulated within and around the malformed vessels of diffuse BAVMs. Functional assays showed that exogenous DCN could promote the tube formation ability of HUVECs through inhibiting the TGF-β signaling pathway and overproducing ECM. Histological staining demonstrated the overproduction of ECM in diffuse BAVMs.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;TGF-β signaling pathway inhibited by DCN in vascular endothelial cells is related to BAVM diffuseness. The metabolic disorder of ECM caused by DCN upregulation may significantly contribute to the formation of diffuse BAVMs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: The Role of Chronic Inflammatory Bone and Joint Disorders in the Pathogenesis and Progression of Alzheimer's Disease</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.583884</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Late-onset Alzheimer's Disease (LOAD) is a devastating neurodegenerative disorder that causes significant cognitive debilitation in tens of millions of patients worldwide. Throughout disease progression, abnormal secretase activity results in the aberrant cleavage and subsequent aggregation of neurotoxic Aβ plaques in the cerebral extracellular space and hyperphosphorylation and destabilization of structural tau proteins surrounding neuronal microtubules. Both pathologies ultimately incite the propagation of a disease-associated subset of microglia—the principle immune cells of the brain—characterized by preferentially pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion and inhibited AD substrate uptake capacity, which further contribute to neuronal degeneration. For decades, chronic neuroinflammation has been identified as one of the cardinal pathophysiological driving features of AD; however, despite a number of works postulating the underlying mechanisms of inflammation-mediated neurodegeneration, its pathogenesis and relation to the inception of cognitive impairment remain obscure. Moreover, the limited clinical success of treatments targeting specific pathological features in the central nervous system (CNS) illustrates the need to investigate alternative, more holistic approaches for ameliorating AD outcomes. Accumulating evidence suggests significant interplay between peripheral immune activity and blood-brain barrier permeability, microglial activation and proliferation, and AD-related cognitive decline. In this work, we review a narrow but significant subset of chronic peripheral inflammatory conditions, describe how these pathologies are associated with the preponderance of neuroinflammation, and posit that we may exploit peripheral immune processes to design interventional, preventative therapies for LOAD. We then provide a comprehensive overview of notable treatment paradigms that have demonstrated considerable merit toward treating these disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.05.413179v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Microglia have been implicated in synapse remodeling by phagocytosis of synaptic elements in the adult brain. However, the underlying mechanism of such process is ill-defined. By examining microglia-neuronal interaction in the ventral hippocampus, we found a significant reduction in spine synapse number during the light phase of the light/dark cycle accompanied by increased microglial phagocytosis. This was followed by a transient rise in microglial production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and uncoupling protein 2 (Ucp2) expression, which is a regulator of mitochondrial ROS generation. Conditional ablation of microglial Ucp2 hindered phasic elimination of spine synapses, increased accumulations of ROS and lysosome-lipid droplet complexes leading to hippocampal circuitry disruption assessed by electrophysiology, and, altered anxiety-like behavior. These observations unmasked a novel and chronotypical interaction between microglia and neurons involved in control of brain functions.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Co-released Norepinephrine and Galanin Act on Different Timescales to Promote Stress-Induced Anxiety-Like Behavior</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.05.413138v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Background: Both the noradrenergic and galaninergic systems have been implicated in stress-related neuropsychiatric disorders, and these two neuromodulators are co-released from the stress-responsive locus coeruleus (LC); however, the individual contributions of LC-derived norepinephrine (NE) and galanin to behavioral stress responses are unclear. Here we aimed to disentangle the functional roles of co-released NE and galanin in stress-induced behavior. Methods: We used foot shock, optogenetics, and behavioral pharmacology in wild-type (WT) mice and mice lacking either NE (Dbh-/-) or galanin (GalcKO-Dbh) specifically in noradrenergic neurons to isolate the roles of these co-transmitters in regulating anxiety-like behavior in the elevated zero maze (EZM) either immediately or 24 h following stress. Results: Foot shock and optogenetic LC stimulation produced immediate anxiety-like behavior in WT mice, and the effects of foot shock persisted for 24 h. NE-deficient mice were resistant to the anxiogenic effects of acute stress and optogenetic LC stimulation, while mice lacking noradrenergic-derived galanin displayed typical increases in anxiety-like behavior. However, when tested 24 h after foot shock, both Dbh-/- and GalcKO-Dbh mice lacked normal expression of anxiety-like behavior. Pharmacological rescue of NE, but not galanin, in knockout mice during EZM testing was anxiogenic. In contrast, restoring galanin, but not NE, signaling during foot shock normalized stress-induced anxiety-like behavior 24 h later. Conclusions: These results indicate that NE and noradrenergic-derived galanin play complementary, but distinguishable roles in behavioral responses to stress. NE is required for the expression of acute stress-induced anxiety, while noradrenergic-derived galanin mediates more persistent responses following a stressor.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.05.413047v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>The primate cerebral cortex is organized into specialized areas representing different functional modalities (e.g., vision, audition, touch) and their associations along a continuous surface. The functional maps of these areas, however, are often investigated in a single modality at a time. Here, we developed and applied to awake primates a polarization-enhanced wide-field optical imaging method for measuring cortical hemodynamics through the intact skull. Adjacent somatosensory, auditory, and visual cortices were noninvasively localized and rapidly parcellated in awake marmosets (Callithrix jacchus), a primate model featuring a smooth cortex. Detailed somatotopy, tonotopy, and retinotopy were also mapped out on an individual-subject basis, with a new pure-tone-responsive tonotopic gradient discovered outside the auditory core. Moreover, the motion-sensitive extent surrounding the primate-specific MT/V5 and the location of a face-sensitive patch were both revealed with respect to retinotopy. This approach provides a powerful tool for mapping the functional landscape across modalities in a single non-human primate subject, and thus opens new opportunities for probing how primate cortical system is organized to enable real-world behaviors.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.05.412981v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Long-Term Depression (LTD) is well known to be initiated by either NMDA or mGlu receptor activation. Here we report that sustained activation of GluK2 subunit-containing kainate receptors leads to AMPA receptor endocytosis and a novel form of long-term depression (KAR-LTDAMPAR) in hippocampal neurons. The KAR-evoked loss of surface AMPA receptors is blocked by the ionotropic KAR inhibitor UBP 310 indicating that KAR-LTDAMPAR requires KAR channel activity. Interestingly, however, blockade of PKC or PKA also reduces GluA2 surface expression and occludes the effect of KAR activation. In acute hippocampal slices kainate application caused a significant and long lasting depression of AMPA EPSCs in CA1. These data, together with our previously reported KAR-LTPAMPAR, demonstrate that KARs can bidirectionally regulate synaptic AMPARs and synaptic plasticity via different signaling pathways.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.05.412965v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Calcium imaging has led to discoveries about neural correlates of behavior in subcortical neurons, including dopamine (DA) neurons. However, spike inference methods have not been tested in most populations of subcortical neurons. To address this gap, we simultaneously performed calcium imaging and electrophysiology in DA neurons in brain slices, and applied a recently developed spike inference algorithm to the GCaMP fluorescence. This revealed that individual spikes can be inferred accurately in this population. Next, we inferred spikes in vivo from calcium imaging from these neurons during Pavlovian conditioning, as well as during navigation in virtual reality. In both cases, we quantitatively recapitulated previous in vivo electrophysiological observations. Our work provides a validated approach to infer spikes from calcium imaging in DA neurons, and implies that aspects of both tonic and phasic spike patterns can be recovered.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.05.412932v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Precise development of the dendritic architecture is a critical determinant of mature neuronal circuitry. MicroRNA-mediated regulation of protein synthesis plays a crucial role in dendritic morphogenesis but the role of miRISC protein components in this process is less studied. Here, we show an important role of a core miRISC protein GW182 in the regulation of dendritic growth. We have identified a distinct brain region specific Spatio-temporal expression pattern of GW182 during rat postnatal development. We found that the window of peak GW182 expression coincides with the period of extensive dendritic growth, both in the hippocampus and cerebellum. Perturbation of GW182 function results in reduced dendritic growth in cultured hippocampal neurons during a specific temporal window. We found that GW182 affects dendritic growth by regulating global somato-dendritic translation, and consequently, affects the actin cytoskeletal arrangement in developing neurons. We identified LIMK1 as one of the key actin modulator candidates whose expression is regulated by GW182, in turn affecting dendritic arborization. Taken together, our data reveal a previously undescribed neurodevelopmental expression pattern of GW182 and its role in dendritic morphogenesis, through both translational control and actin cytoskeletal rearrangement.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.05.412791v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>When retaining a sequence of auditory tones in working memory (WM), two forms of information - frequency (content) and ordinal position (structure) - have to be maintained in the brain. Here, we employed a time-resolved multivariate decoding analysis on content and structure information separately to examine their neural representations in human auditory WM. We demonstrate that content and structure are stored in a dissociated manner and show distinct characteristics. First, each tone is associated with two separate codes in parallel, characterizing its frequency and ordinal position, respectively. Second, during retention, a structural retrocue reactivates structure but not content, whereas a following white noise triggers content but not structure. Third, structure representation remains unchanged whereas content undergoes a transformation throughout memory progress. Finally, content reactivations during retention correlate with WM behavior. Overall, our results support a factorized content-structure representation in auditory WM, which might help efficient memory formation and storage by generalizing stable structure to new auditory inputs.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.04.412551v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>There is evidence that the autonomic nervous system provides important constraints over ongoing cognitive function, however there is currently a lack of direct empirical evidence for how this interaction manifests in the brain. Here, we examine the role of ascending arousal and attentional load on large-scale network dynamics by combining pupillometry, functional MRI, and graph theoretical analysis to analyze data from a visual motion-tracking task with a parametric load manipulation. We found that attentional load effects were observable in measures of pupil diameter and in a set of brain regions that parametrically modulated their BOLD activity and meso-scale network-level integration. In addition, the regional patterns of network configuration were predicted by the distribution of the adrenergic receptor density. Our results provide confirmatory evidence for adaptive gain theory and strengthen the relationship between ascending noradrenergic tone, large-scale network integration, and cognitive task performance.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Task dependence of neural representations of global scene properties but not scene categories in the prefrontal cortex</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.04.412445v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Natural scenes deliver rich sensory information about the world. Decades of research has shown that the scene-selective network in the visual cortex represents various aspects of scenes. It is, however, unknown how such complex scene information is processed beyond the visual cortex, such as in the prefrontal cortex. It is also unknown how task context impacts the process of scene perception, modulating which scene content is represented in the brain. In this study, we investigate these questions using scene images from four natural scene categories, which also depict two types of global scene properties, temperature (warm or cold), and sound-level (noisy or quiet). A group of healthy human subjects from both sexes participated in the present study using fMRI. In the study, participants viewed scene images under two different task conditions; temperature judgment and sound-level judgment. We analyzed how different scene attributes (scene categories, temperature, and sound-level information) are represented across the brain under these task conditions. Our findings show that global scene properties are only represented in the brain, especially in the prefrontal cortex, when they are task-relevant. However, scene categories are represented in the brain, in both the parahippocampal place area and the prefrontal cortex, regardless of task context. These findings suggest that the prefrontal cortex selectively represents scene content according to task demands, but this task selectivity depends on the types of scene content; task modulates neural representations of global scene properties but not of scene categories.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>In studies of vision and audition, stimuli can be chosen to span the visible or audible spectrum; in olfaction, the axes and boundaries defining the analogous odorous space are unknown. Features governing the physical transport of molecules to olfactory receptors are sufficient to reliably classify novel molecules as odorous or odorless (AUROC = 0.97). Applying this model to a database of all possible small organic molecules, we estimate that over 30 billion possible compounds are odorous, 6 orders of magnitude larger than current estimates of 10,000. Remarkably, nearly all transport-capable molecules are odorous, suggesting broad collective tuning of olfactory receptors. Defining the boundaries of odor perception will enable design of experiments that representatively sample olfactory space and efficient search for novel odor compounds.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: The impact of 1/f activity and baseline correction on the results and interpretation of time-frequency analyses of EEG/MEG data: A cautionary tale</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.04.412031v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Typically, time-frequency analysis (TFA) of electrophysiological data is aimed at isolating narrowband signals (oscillatory activity) from broadband non-oscillatory (1/f) activity, so that changes in oscillatory activity resulting from experimental manipulations can be assessed. A widely used method to do this is to convert the data to the decibel (dB) scale through baseline division and log transformation. This procedure assumes that, for each frequency, sources of power (i.e., oscillations and 1/f activity) scale by the same factor relative to the baseline (multiplicative model). This assumption may be incorrect when signal and noise are independent contributors to the power spectrum (additive model). Using resting-state EEG data from 80 participants, we found that the level of 1/f activity and alpha power are not positively correlated within participants, in line with the additive but not the multiplicative model. Then, to assess the effects of dB conversion on data that violate the multiplicativity assumption, we simulated a mixed design study with one between-subject (noise level, i.e., level of 1/f activity) and one within-subject (signal amplitude, i.e., amplitude of oscillatory activity added onto the background 1/f activity) factor. The effect size of the noise level by signal amplitude interaction was examined as a function of noise difference between groups, following dB conversion. Findings revealed that dB conversion led to the over- or under-estimation of the true interaction effect when groups differing in 1/f levels were compared, and it also led to the emergence of illusory interactions when none were present. This is because signal amplitude was systematically underestimated in the noisier compared to the less noisy group. Hence, we recommend testing whether the level of 1/f activity differs across groups or conditions and using multiple baseline correction strategies to validate results if it does. Such a situation may be particularly common in aging, developmental, or clinical studies.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.04.411975v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>The peripheral nervous system responds to a wide variety of sensory stimuli, a process that requires great neuronal diversity. These diverse peripheral sensory neurons are closely associated with glial cells that originate from the neural crest (NC). However, the molecular nature and origins of diversity among peripheral glia is not understood. Here we used single cell RNA sequencing to profile and compare developing and mature glia from somatosensory lumbar dorsal root ganglia (DRG) and auditory spiral ganglia (SG). We found that the glial precursors (GPs) differ in their transcriptional profile and prevalence in these two systems. Despite their unique features, somatosensory and auditory GPs undergo convergent differentiation to generate myelinating and non-myelinating Schwann cells that are molecularly uniform. By contrast, although satellite glia surround the neuronal cell bodies in both ganglia, we found that those in the SG express multiple myelination-associated genes, while DRG satellite cells express components that suppress myelination. Lastly, we identified a set of glial signature genes that are also expressed by placode-derived supporting cells, providing new insights into commonalities among glia across the nervous system. This comprehensive survey of gene expression in peripheral glia constitutes a valuable resource for understanding how glia acquire specialized functions and how their roles differ across sensory modalities.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.04.411827v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Hereditary degeneration of photoreceptors has been linked to over-activation of Ca2+-permeable channels, excessive Ca2+-influx, and downstream activation of Ca2+-dependent calpain-type proteases. Unfortunately, after more than 20 years of pertinent research, unequivocal evidence proving significant and reproducible photoreceptor protection with Ca2+-channel blockers is still lacking. Here, we show that both D- and L-cis enantiomers of the anti-hypertensive drug diltiazem were highly effective at blocking photoreceptor Ca2+-influx, most probably by blocking the pores of Ca2+-permeable channels. Yet, unexpectedly, this block neither reduced activity of calpain-type proteases, nor did it result in photoreceptor protection. Remarkably, application of the L-cis enantiomer of diltiazem even led to a strong increase in photoreceptor cell death. These findings shed doubt on the previously proposed links between Ca2+ and retinal degeneration and are highly relevant for future therapy development as they may serve to refocus research efforts towards alternative, Ca2+-independent degenerative mechanisms.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.04.411454v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>A ramp to threshold activity of frontal Eye Field (FEF) movement-related neurons best explains the reaction time of single saccades. How such activity is modulated by a concurrent saccade plan is not known. Borrowing from psychological theories of capacity sharing that are designed to explain the concurrent planning of two decisions, we show that processing bottlenecks are brought about by decreasing the growth rate and increasing the threshold of saccade-related activity. Further, rate perturbation affects both saccade plans, indicating a capacity-sharing mechanism of processing bottlenecks, where both the saccade plans compete for processing capacity. To understand how capacity sharing was neurally instantiated, we designed a model in which movement fields that instantiate two saccade plans, mutually inhibit each other. In addition to predicting the greater reaction times for both saccades and changes in growth rate and threshold activity observed experimentally, we observed a greater separation of the two neural trajectories in neural state space, which was verified experimentally. Finally, we show that in contrast to movement related neurons, visual activity in FEF neurons are not affected by the presence of multiple saccade targets, indicating that inhibition amongst movement-related neurons instantiates capacity sharing. Taken together, we show how psychology-inspired models of capacity sharing can be mapped onto neural responses to understand the control of rapid saccade sequences.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>In order to develop object recognition algorithms, which can approach human-level recognition performance, researchers have been studying how the human brain performs recognition in the past five decades. This has already inspired AI-based object recognition algorithms, such as convolutional neural networks, which are among the most successful object recognition platforms today and can approach human performance in specific tasks. However, it is not yet clearly known how recorded brain activations convey information about object category processing. One main obstacle has been the lack of large feature sets, to evaluate the information contents of multiple aspects of neural activations. Here, we com-pared the information contents of a large set of 25 features, extracted from time series of electroencephalography (EEG) recorded from human participants doing an object recognition task. We could characterize the most informative aspects of brain activations about object categories. Among the evaluated features, event-related potential (ERP) components of N1 and P2a were among the most in-formative features with the highest information in the Theta frequency bands. Upon limiting the analysis time window, we observed more information for fea-tures detecting temporally informative patterns in the signals. The results of this study can constrain previous theories about how the brain codes object category information.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;We investigated whether Early Posterior Negativity (EPN) indicated the subjective dilation of time when judging the duration of arousing stimuli. Participants performed a visual temporal bisection task along with high-level and low-level arousing auditory stimuli, while we simultaneously recorded EEG. In accordance with previous studies, arousing stimuli were temporally overestimated and led to higher EPN amplitude. Yet, we observed that time dilation and EPN amplitude were significantly correlated and this effect cannot be explained by confounds from stimulus valence. We interpret our findings in terms of the pacemaker–accumulator model of human timing, and suggest that EPN indicates an arousal-based increasing of the speed of our mental clock.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Activation of central 5HT2A receptor in brain inhibited the seizure-induced respiratory arrest in the DBA/1 mouse SUDEP model</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.04.410969v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) is the fatal cause leading to the death of epilepsy patients with anti-epileptic drug resistance. However, the underlying mechanism of SUDEP remains to be elusive. Our previous study demonstrated that enhancement of serotonin (5-HT) synthesis by intraperitoneal (IP) injection of 5-hydroxytryptophan in brain significantly reduced the incidence of seizure-induced respiratory arrest (S-IRA) in DBA/1 mice SUDEP models. Given that 5HT2A receptor (5HT2AR) acts an important role in mediating respiration system in brain, we hypothesized that 5HT2AR is of great significance to modulate S-IRA and SUDEP. To test this hypothesis, we examined whether the decreased incidence S-IRA evoked by either acoustic stimulation or PTZ by blocking 5HT2AR by administration with ketanserin (KET), a selective antagonist of 5HT2AR, in DBA/1 mice SUDEP models to test the role of 5HT2AR modulating S-IRA. Our results suggested that the decreased incidence of S-IRA by 5-Hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP), a precursor for central nervous system (CNS) serotonin (5-HT) synthesis, was significantly reversed by IP and intracerebroventricularly (ICV) injection of ketanserin in our models. Thus, our data suggested that 5-HT2AR in the brain may be a potential and specific target to prevent SUDEP.</content:encoded>

Integrated into their bacterial hosts’ genomes, prophage sequences exhibit a wide diversity of length and gene content, from highly degraded cryptic sequences to intact, functional prophages that retain a full complement of lytic-function genes. We apply three approaches—bioinformatics, analytical modelling and computational simulation—to understand the diverse gene content of prophages. In the bioinformatics work, we examine the distributions of over 50,000 annotated prophage genes identified in 1384 prophage sequences, comparing the gene repertoires of intact and incomplete prophages. These data indicate that genes involved in the replication, packaging, and release of phage particles have been preferentially lost in incomplete prophages, while tail fiber, transposase and integrase genes are significantly enriched. Consistent with these results, our mathematical and computational approaches predict that genes involved in phage lytic function are preferentially lost, resulting in shorter prophages that often retain genes that benefit the host. Informed by these models, we offer novel hypotheses for the enrichment of integrase and transposase genes in cryptic prophages. Overall, we demonstrate that functional and cryptic prophages represent a diversity of genetic sequences that evolve along a parasitism-mutualism continuum.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/36v3ylChupQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Infectious disease surveillance systems provide vital data for guiding disease prevention and control policies, yet the formalization of methods to optimize surveillance networks has largely been overlooked. Decisions surrounding surveillance design parameters—such as the number and placement of surveillance sites, target populations, and case definitions—are often determined by expert opinion or deference to operational considerations, without formal analysis of the influence of design parameters on surveillance objectives. Here we propose a simulation framework to guide evidence-based surveillance network design to better achieve specific surveillance goals with limited resources. We define evidence-based surveillance design as an optimization problem, acknowledging the many operational constraints under which surveillance systems operate, the many dimensions of surveillance system design, the multiple and competing goals of surveillance, and the complex and dynamic nature of disease systems. We describe an analytical framework—the Disease Surveillance Informatics Optimization and Simulation (DIOS) framework—for the identification of optimal surveillance designs through mathematical representations of disease and surveillance processes, definition of objective functions, and numerical optimization. We then apply the framework to the problem of selecting candidate sites to expand an existing surveillance network under alternative objectives of: (1) improving spatial prediction of disease prevalence at unmonitored sites; or (2) estimating the observed effect of a risk factor on disease. Results of this demonstration illustrate how optimal designs are sensitive to both surveillance goals and the underlying spatial pattern of the target disease. The findings affirm the value of designing surveillance systems through quantitative and adaptive analysis of network characteristics and performance. The framework can be applied to the design of surveillance systems tailored to setting-specific disease transmission dynamics and surveillance needs, and can yield improved understanding of tradeoffs between network architectures.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/MDSl_12VOh4&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Control of filament length by a depolymerizing gradient</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/41N23r0QzBk/article</link>

Cells assemble microns-long filamentous structures from protein monomers that are nanometers in size. These structures are often highly dynamic, yet in order for them to function properly, cells maintain them at a precise length. Here we investigate length-dependent depolymerization as a mechanism of length control. This mechanism has been recently proposed for flagellar length control in the single cell organisms Chlamydomonas and Giardia. Length dependent depolymerization can arise from a concentration gradient of a depolymerizing protein, such as kinesin-13 in Giardia, along the length of the flagellum. Two possible scenarios are considered: a linear and an exponential gradient of depolymerizing proteins. We compute analytically the probability distributions of filament lengths for both scenarios and show how these distributions are controlled by key biochemical parameters through a dimensionless number that we identify. In Chlamydomonas cells, the assembly dynamics of its two flagella are coupled via a shared pool of molecular components that are in limited supply, and so we investigate the effect of a limiting monomer pool on the length distributions. Finally, we compare our calculations to experiments. While the computed mean lengths are consistent with observations, the noise is two orders of magnitude smaller than the observed length fluctuations.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/41N23r0QzBk&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Jennifer Lu, Steven L. Salzberg&lt;/p&gt;

GC skew is a phenomenon observed in many bacterial genomes, wherein the two replication strands of the same chromosome contain different proportions of guanine and cytosine nucleotides. Here we demonstrate that this phenomenon, which was first discovered in the mid-1990s, can be used today as an analysis tool for the 15,000+ complete bacterial genomes in NCBI’s Refseq library. In order to analyze all 15,000+ genomes, we introduce a new method, SkewIT (Skew Index Test), that calculates a single metric representing the degree of GC skew for a genome. Using this metric, we demonstrate how GC skew patterns are conserved within certain bacterial phyla, e.g. Firmicutes, but show different patterns in other phylogenetic groups such as Actinobacteria. We also discovered that outlier values of SkewIT highlight potential bacterial mis-assemblies. Using our newly defined metric, we identify multiple mis-assembled chromosomal sequences in previously published complete bacterial genomes. We provide a SkewIT web app https://jenniferlu717.shinyapps.io/SkewIT/ that calculates SkewI for any user-provided bacterial sequence. The web app also provides an interactive interface for the data generated in this paper, allowing users to further investigate the SkewI values and thresholds of the Refseq-97 complete bacterial genomes. Individual scripts for analysis of bacterial genomes are provided in the following repository: https://github.com/jenniferlu717/SkewIT.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/bj6bsqIaDCQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Bacteria use protein-protein interactions to infect their hosts and hijack fundamental pathways, which ensures their survival and proliferation. Hence, the infectious capacity of the pathogen is closely related to its ability to interact with host proteins. Here, we show that hubs in the host-pathogen interactome are isolated in the pathogen network by adapting the geometry of the interacting interfaces. An imperfect mimicry of the eukaryotic interfaces allows pathogen proteins to actively bind to the host’s target while preventing deleterious effects on the pathogen interactome. Understanding how bacteria recognize eukaryotic proteins may pave the way for the rational design of new antibiotic molecules.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/cLM7oZ8muM4&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Metabolic networks undergo gene expression regulation in response to external nutrient signals. In microbes, the synthesis of enzymes that are used to transport and catabolize less preferred carbon sources is repressed in the presence of a preferred carbon source. For most microbes, glucose is a preferred carbon source, and it has long been believed that as long as glucose is present in the environment, the expression of genes related to the metabolism of alternative carbon sources is shut down, due to catabolite repression. However, recent studies have shown that the induction of the galactose (GAL) metabolic network does not solely depend on the exhaustion of glucose. Instead, the GAL genes respond to the external concentration ratio of galactose to glucose, a phenomenon of unknown mechanism that we termed ratio-sensing. Using mathematical modeling, we found that ratio-sensing is a general phenomenon that can arise from competition between two carbon sources for shared transporters, between transcription factors for binding to communal regulatory sequences of the target genes, or a combination of the aforementioned two levels of competition. We analyzed how the parameters describing the competitive interaction influenced ratio-sensing behaviors in each scenario and found that the concatenation of both layers of signal integration could expand the dynamical range of ratio-sensing. Finally, we investigated the influence of circuit topology on ratio-sensing and found that incorporating negative auto-regulation and/or coherent feedforward loop motifs to the basic signal integration unit could tune the sensitivity of the response to the external nutrient signals. Our study not only deepened our understanding of how ratio-sensing is achieved in yeast GAL metabolic regulation, but also elucidated design principles for ratio-sensing signal processing that can be used in other biological settings, such as being introduced into circuit designs for synthetic biology applications.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/kKsLHVVuvdM&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Biology: Loss of hepatic aldolase B activates Akt and promotes hepatocellular carcinogenesis by destabilizing the Aldob/Akt/PP2A protein complex</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~3/6LXKvgNqrUI/article</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Xuxiao He, Min Li, Hongming Yu, Guijun Liu, Ningning Wang, Chunzhao Yin, Qiaochu Tu, Goutham Narla, Yongzhen Tao, Shuqun Cheng, Huiyong Yin&lt;/p&gt;

Loss of hepatic fructose-1, 6-bisphosphate aldolase B (Aldob) leads to a paradoxical up-regulation of glucose metabolism to favor hepatocellular carcinogenesis (HCC), but the upstream signaling events remain poorly defined. Akt is highly activated in HCC, and targeting Akt is being explored as a potential therapy for HCC. Herein, we demonstrate that Aldob suppresses Akt activity and tumor growth through a protein complex containing Aldob, Akt, and protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), leading to inhibition of cell viability, cell cycle progression, glucose uptake, and metabolism. Interestingly, Aldob directly interacts with phosphorylated Akt (p-Akt) and promotes the recruitment of PP2A to dephosphorylate p-Akt, and this scaffolding effect of Aldob is independent of its enzymatic activity. Loss of Aldob or disruption of Aldob/Akt interaction in Aldob R304A mutant restores Akt activity and tumor-promoting effects. Consistently, Aldob and p-Akt expression are inversely correlated in human HCC tissues, and Aldob down-regulation coupled with p-Akt up-regulation predicts a poor prognosis for HCC. We have further discovered that Akt inhibition or a specific small-molecule activator of PP2A (SMAP) efficiently attenuates HCC tumorigenesis in xenograft mouse models. Our work reveals a novel nonenzymatic role of Aldob in negative regulation of Akt activation, suggesting that directly inhibiting Akt activity or through reactivating PP2A may be a potential therapeutic approach for HCC treatment.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/6LXKvgNqrUI&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Hippocampus: The effects of hippocampal and area parahippocampalis lesions on the processing and retention of serial‐order behavior, autoshaping, and spatial behavior in pigeons</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/hipo.23287?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We examined the role of the avian hippocampus and area parahippocampalis in serial‐order behavior and a variety of other tasks known to be sensitive to hippocampal damage in mammals. Damage to the hippocampus and area parahippocampalis caused impairments in autoshaping and performance on an analogue of a radial‐arm maze task, but had no effect on acquisition of 2‐item, 3‐item, and 4‐item serial‐order lists. Additionally, the lesions had no effect on the retention of 3‐items lists, or on the ability to perform novel derived lists composed of elements from lists they had previously learned. The impairments in autoshaping and spatial behavior are consistent with the findings in mammals. The absence of impairments on the serial‐order task may also be consistent once one considers that damage to the hippocampus in mammals seems to affect more internally‐organized rather than externally‐organized serial‐order tasks. Together, the findings support the view that the avian hippocampal complex serves a function very similar to the mammalian hippocampus, a finding that is interesting given that the architecture of the avian hippocampus differs dramatically from that of the mammalian hippocampus.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

&lt;p&gt;We identified a novel population of inhibitory prodynorphin neurons in the brainstem which we named LJA5. LJA5 neurons selectively target lamina I of the spinal cord, and other sensory nuclei including the lateral parabrachial and periaqueductal gray. Activation of LJA5 neurons reduces pain and itch.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sensory information is transmitted from peripheral nerves, through the spinal cord, and up to the brain (“bottom up” pathway). Some of this information may be modulated by “top‐down” projections from the brain to the spinal cord. Discovering endogenous mechanisms for reducing pain and itch holds enormous potential for developing new treatments. However, neurons mediating the top‐down inhibition of pain are not well understood, nor has any such pathway been identified for itch sensation. Here, we identify a novel population of GABAergic neurons in the ventral brainstem, distinguished by prodynorphin expression, which we named LJA5. LJA5 neurons provide the only known inhibitory projection specifically to lamina I of the spinal cord, which contains sensory neurons that transmit pain and itch information up to the brain. Chemogenetically activating LJA5 neurons in male mice reduces capsaicin‐induced pain and histamine‐induced itch. Identifying this new pathway opens new treatment opportunities for chronic, refractory pain, and pruritis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>arXiv: Computer Science: Neural and Evolutionary Computing: Recursive Tree Grammar Autoencoders. (arXiv:2012.02097v1 [cs.LG])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2012.02097</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Machine learning on tree data has been mostly focused on trees as input. Much
less research has covered trees as output, like in chemical molecule
optimization or hint generation for intelligent tutoring systems. In this work,
we propose recursive tree grammar autoencoders (RTG-AEs), which encode trees
via a bottom-up parser and decode trees via a tree grammar, both controlled by
a neural network that minimizes the variational autoencoder loss. The resulting
encoding and decoding functions can then be employed in subsequent tasks, such
as optimization and time series prediction. Our key message is that combining
grammar knowledge with recursive processing improves performance compared to
using either grammar knowledge or non-sequential processing, but not both. In
particular, we show experimentally that our model improves autoencoding error,
training time, and optimization score on four benchmark datasets compared to
baselines from the literature.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2012.01867</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Feedforward neural networks offer a promising approach for solving
differential equations. However, the reliability and accuracy of the
approximation still represent delicate issues that are not fully resolved in
the current literature. Computational approaches are in general highly
dependent on a variety of computational parameters as well as on the choice of
optimisation methods, a point that has to be seen together with the structure
of the cost function. The intention of this paper is to make a step towards
resolving these open issues. To this end we study here the solution of a simple
but fundamental stiff ordinary differential equation modelling a damped system.
We consider two computational approaches for solving differential equations by
neural forms. These are the classic but still actual method of trial solutions
defining the cost function, and a recent direct construction of the cost
function related to the trial solution method. Let us note that the settings we
study can easily be applied more generally, including solution of partial
differential equations. By a very detailed computational study we show that it
is possible to identify preferable choices to be made for parameters and
methods. We also illuminate some interesting effects that are observable in the
neural network simulations. Overall we extend the current literature in the
field by showing what can be done in order to obtain reliable and accurate
results by the neural network approach. By doing this we illustrate the
importance of a careful choice of the computational setup.

	<title>arXiv: Computer Science: Neural and Evolutionary Computing: Scalable Transfer Evolutionary Optimization: Coping with Big Task Instances. (arXiv:2012.01830v1 [cs.NE])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2012.01830</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In today's digital world, we are confronted with an explosion of data and
models produced and manipulated by numerous large-scale IoT/cloud-based
applications. Under such settings, existing transfer evolutionary optimization
frameworks grapple with satisfying two important quality attributes, namely
scalability against a growing number of source tasks and online learning
agility against sparsity of relevant sources to the target task of interest.
Satisfying these attributes shall facilitate practical deployment of transfer
optimization to big source instances as well as simultaneously curbing the
threat of negative transfer. While applications of existing algorithms are
limited to tens of source tasks, in this paper, we take a quantum leap forward
in enabling two orders of magnitude scale-up in the number of tasks; i.e., we
efficiently handle scenarios with up to thousands of source problem instances.
We devise a novel transfer evolutionary optimization framework comprising two
co-evolving species for joint evolutions in the space of source knowledge and
in the search space of solutions to the target problem. In particular,
co-evolution enables the learned knowledge to be orchestrated on the fly,
expediting convergence in the target optimization task. We have conducted an
extensive series of experiments across a set of practically motivated discrete
and continuous optimization examples comprising a large number of source
problem instances, of which only a small fraction show source-target
relatedness. The experimental results strongly validate the efficacy of our
proposed framework with two salient features of scalability and online learning
agility.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2012.01748</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Echo States Networks (ESN) and Long-Short Term Memory networks (LSTM) are two
popular architectures of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) to solve machine
learning task involving sequential data. However, little have been done to
compare their performances and their internal mechanisms on a common task. In
this work, we trained ESNs and LSTMs on a Cross-Situationnal Learning (CSL)
task. This task aims at modelling how infants learn language: they create
associations between words and visual stimuli in order to extract meaning from
words and sentences. The results are of three kinds: performance comparison,
internal dynamics analyses and visualization of latent space. (1) We found that
both models were able to successfully learn the task: the LSTM reached the
lowest error for the basic corpus, but the ESN was quicker to train.
Furthermore, the ESN was able to outperform LSTMs on datasets more challenging
without any further tuning needed. (2) We also conducted an analysis of the
internal units activations of LSTMs and ESNs. Despite the deep differences
between both models (trained or fixed internal weights), we were able to
uncover similar inner mechanisms: both put emphasis on the units encoding
aspects of the sentence structure. (3) Moreover, we present \textit{Recurrent
States Space Visualisations} (RSSviz), a method to visualize the structure of
latent state space of RNNs, based on dimension reduction (using UMAP). This
technique enables us to observe a fractal embedding of sequences in the LSTM.
RSSviz is also useful for the analysis of ESNs (i) to spot difficult examples
and (ii) to generate animated plots showing the evolution of activations across
learning stages. Finally, we explore qualitatively how the RSSviz could provide
an intuitive visualisation to understand the influence of hyperparameters on
the reservoir dynamics prior to ESN training.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2012.01698</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;As demonstrated in many areas of real-life applications, neural networks have
the capability of dealing with high dimensional data. In the fields of optimal
control and dynamical systems, the same capability was studied and verified in
many published results in recent years. Towards the goal of revealing the
underlying reason why neural networks are capable of solving some high
dimensional problems, we develop an algebraic framework and an approximation
theory for compositional functions and their neural network approximations. The
theoretical foundation is developed in a way so that it supports the error
analysis for not only functions as input-output relations, but also numerical
algorithms. This capability is critical because it enables the analysis of
approximation errors for problems for which analytic solutions are not
available, such as differential equations and optimal control. We identify a
set of key features of compositional functions and the relationship between the
features and the complexity of neural networks. In addition to function
approximations, we prove several formulae of error upper bounds for neural
networks that approximate the solutions to differential equations,
optimization, and optimal control.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2012.01637</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The synchronization of different $\gamma$-rhythms arising in different brain
areas has been implicated in various cognitive functions. Here, we focus on the
effect of the ubiquitous neuronal heterogeneity on the synchronization of PING
(pyramidal-interneuronal network gamma) and ING (interneuronal network gamma)
rhythms. The synchronization properties of rhythms depends on the response of
their collective phase to external input. We therefore determined the
macroscopic phase-response curve for finite-amplitude perturbations (fmPRC),
using numerical simulation of all-to-all coupled networks of integrate-and-fire
(IF) neurons exhibiting either PING or ING rhythms. We show that the intrinsic
neuronal heterogeneity can qualitatively modify the fmPRC. While the
phase-response curve for the individual IF-neurons is strictly positive (type
I), the fmPRC can be biphasic and exhibit both signs (type II). Thus, for PING
rhythms, an external excitation to the excitatory cells can, in fact, delay the
collective oscillation of the network, even though the same excitation would
lead to an advance when applied to uncoupled neurons. This paradoxical delay
arises when the external excitation modifies the internal dynamics of the
network by causing additional spikes of inhibitory neurons, whose delaying
within-network inhibition outweighs the immediate advance caused by the
external excitation. These results explain how intrinsic heterogeneity allows
the PING rhythm to become synchronized with a periodic forcing or another PING
rhythm for a wider range in the mismatch of their frequencies. We demonstrate a
similar mechanism for the synchronization of ING rhythms. Our results identify
a potential function of neuronal heterogeneity in the synchronization of
coupled $\gamma$-rhythms, which may play a role in neural information transfer
via communication through coherence.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Advances in deep learning have resulted in state-of-the-art performance for
many audio classification tasks but, unlike humans, these systems traditionally
require large amounts of data to make accurate predictions. Not every person or
organization has access to those resources, and the organizations that do, like
our field at large, do not reflect the demographics of our country. Enabling
people to use machine learning without significant resource hurdles is
important, because machine learning is an increasingly useful tool for solving
problems, and can solve a broader set of problems when put in the hands of a
broader set of people. Few-shot learning is a type of machine learning designed
to enable the model to generalize to new classes with very few examples. In
this research, we address two audio classification tasks (speaker
identification and activity classification) with the Prototypical Network
few-shot learning algorithm, and assess performance of various encoder
architectures. Our encoders include recurrent neural networks, as well as one-
and two-dimensional convolutional neural networks. We evaluate our model for
speaker identification on the VoxCeleb dataset and ICSI Meeting Corpus,
obtaining 5-shot 5-way accuracies of 93.5% and 54.0%, respectively. We also
evaluate for activity classification from audio using few-shot subsets of the
Kinetics~600 dataset and AudioSet, both drawn from Youtube videos, obtaining
51.5% and 35.2% accuracy, respectively.

numerically by direct modeling of the stochastic dynamics of a neuron with

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;We investigate the classification performance of K-nearest neighbors (K-NN)

empirically that a DNN's prediction for a given test example depends on the

derive a realizable analytic expression that approximates the multi-class K-NN
classification error in the presence of label noise, which is of independent

first-order approximation for the DNN error. Finally, we demonstrate
empirically the proximity of the developed expression to the observed
performance of K-NN and DNN classifiers. Our result may explain the already
observed surprising resistance of DNN to some types of label noise. It also
characterizes an important factor of it showing that the more concentrated the

Here, Patterson et al. test 919 companion animals in northern Italy and find that some dogs and cats from COVID-19 positive households can test positive for COVID-19 neutralizing antibodies, with dogs significantly more likely to do so if they came from COVID-19 positive households.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ncomms/rss/current/~4/BiW_oT0XI2c&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;A reliable measure of PSP-specific midbrain atrophy, the midbrain-to-pons ratio (MTPR) has been reported to support the differential diagnosis of progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) from idiopathic Parkinson’s disease (IPD). Since longitudinal analyses are lacking so far, the present study aimed to evaluate the diagnostic value of the relative change of MTPR (relΔt_MTPR) over a 1-year period in patients with PSP, IPD, and healthy controls (HC).&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec2&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Methods&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Midsagittal individual MRIs of patients with PSP (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 15), IPD (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 15), and healthy controls (HC; &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 15) were assessed and the MTPR at baseline and after 1 year were defined. The diagnostic accuracy of the MTPR and its relative change were evaluated using ROC curve analyses.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec3&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;PSP-patients had a significantly lower MTPR at baseline (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;M&lt;/em&gt; = 0.45 ± 0.06), compared to both non-PSP groups (F (2, 41) = 62.82, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001), with an overall predictive accuracy of 95.6% for an MTPR ≤ 0.54. PSP-patients also presented a significantly stronger 1-year decline in MTPR compared to IPD (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001). Though predictive accuracy of relΔ&lt;sub class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;_MTPR for PSP (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;M&lt;/em&gt; = − 4.74% ± 4.48) from IPD (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;M&lt;/em&gt; =  + 1.29 ± 3.77) was good (76.6%), ROC analysis did not reveal a significant improvement of diagnostic accuracy by combining the MTPR and relΔ&lt;sub class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;_MTPR (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.670). Still, specificity for PSP increased, though not significantly (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.500).&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec4&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;The present results indicate that the relΔ&lt;sub class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;_MTPR is a potentially useful tool to support the differential diagnosis of PSP from IPD. For its relative 1-year change, still, more evaluation is needed.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Journal of Neurology: The erythrocyte sedimentation rate in male adolescents and subsequent risk of Parkinson’s disease: an observational study</title>
	<link>http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s00415-020-10324-5</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Systemic inflammation may be implicated in the pathophysiology of Parkinson’s disease (PD). Since PD occurs usually in later life, most studies of causal factors are conducted in older populations, so potentially important influences from early life cannot be adequately captured. We investigated whether the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) in early adulthood is associated with the subsequent development of PD in men. As part of Swedish national conscription testing conducted from 1968 through 1983 (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;N&lt;/em&gt; = 716,550), the erythrocyte sedimentation rate, as a measure of inflammation, was measured in 659,278 young men. The cohort was observed for subsequent PD events (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;N&lt;/em&gt; = 1513) through December 2016. Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate the hazard ratios (HR) with 95% CI with adjustment for potential confounders. Individuals with higher ESRs were significantly less likely to be diagnosed with PD, as ESR was linearly and inversely associated with PD risk. The magnitude of the association between ESR and PD risk was similar for increases up to 15 mm/h, leveled off thereafter, and was non-significant for ESR values &amp;gt; 20 mm/h. The HR for PD with basic adjustments (age at conscription, year of conscription, test center and erythrocyte volume fraction) was 0.94 (95% CI 0.89–0.99, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; = 0.02) per log&lt;sub class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; increase in ESR, corresponding to a two-fold increase in ESR. Further adjustments for potential confounders (parental education, systolic and diastolic blood pressures, and IQ) scarcely altered the HR. The results suggest a prospective association between high ESR and reduced risk for PD.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Gene Therapy Vector Encoding Neuropeptide Y and Its Receptor Y2 for Future Treatment of Epilepsy: Preclinical Data in Rats</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2020.603409</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Gene therapy to treat pharmacoresistant temporal lobe epilepsy in humans is now being developed using an AAV vector (CG01) that encodes the combination of neuropeptide Y and its antiepileptic receptor Y2. With this in mind, the present study aimed to provide important preclinical data on the effects of CG01 on the duration of transgene expression, cellular tropism, and potential side effects on body weight and cognitive function. The CG01 vector was administered unilaterally into the dorsal and ventral hippocampus of adult male rats and expression of both transgenes was found to remain elevated without a sign of decline at 6 months post-injection. CG01 appeared to mediate expression selectively in hippocampal neurons, without expression in astrocytes or oligodendrocytes. No effects were seen on body weight as well as on short- or long-term memory as revealed by testing in the Y-maze or Morris water maze tests. Thus these data show that unilateral CG01 vector treatment as future gene therapy in pharmacoresistant temporal lobe epilepsy patients should result in stable and long-term expression predominantly in neurons and be well tolerated without side effects on body weight and cognitive function.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Aberrant Brain Network Integration and Segregation in Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy Revealed by Structural Connectomics</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.585588</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) is one of the most common forms of peripheral neuropathy, and its incidence has been increasing. Mounting evidence has shown that patients with DPN have been associated with widespread alterations in the structure, function and connectivity of the brain, suggesting possible alterations in large-scale brain networks. Using structural covariance networks as well as advanced graph-theory-based computational approaches, we investigated the topological abnormalities of large-scale brain networks for a relatively large sample of patients with DPN (N = 67) compared to matched healthy controls (HCs; N = 88). Compared with HCs, the structural covariance networks of patients with DPN showed an increased characteristic path length, clustering coefficient, sigma, transitivity, and modularity, suggestive of inefficient global integration and increased local segregation. These findings may improve our understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying alterations in the central nervous system of patients with DPN from the perspective of large-scale structural brain networks.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Training and Transfer of Cue Updating in Older Adults Is Limited: Evidence From Behavioral and Neuronal Data</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.565927</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Cognitive control processes, such as updating task-relevant information while switching between multiple tasks, are substantially impaired in older adults. However, it has also been shown that these cognitive control processes can be improved by training interventions, e.g., by training in task switching. Here, we applied an event-related potential (ERP) approach to identify whether a cognitive training improves task-preparatory processes such as updating of relevant task goals. To do so, we applied a pretest-training-posttest design with eight training sessions. Two groups of older adults were either trained in task switching (treatment group) or in performing single tasks (control group) and we compared their performance to a group of untrained younger adults. To foster cue updating in the treatment group, we applied a cue-based switching task in which the two task cues were randomly selected prior to target presentation so that participants had time to prepare for the upcoming task. In contrast, the control group also received task cues but those were redundant as only one task had to be performed. We also examined whether training in cue updating during task switching can be transferred to a similar cognitive control task measuring updating of context information, namely a modified version of the AX-Continuous Performance Task (AX-CPT). The results revealed training-specific improvements in task switching, that is, a larger improvement in blocks requiring switching in comparison to single tasks at the behavioral level. In addition, training specific-effects were also found at the neuronal level. Older adults trained in cue updating while switching showed a reduction in mixing costs in the cue-related P3, indicating an improvement in preparatory updating processes. Additionally, P3 topography changed with training from a very broad to a parietally focused scalp distribution similar to the one found in younger adults. However, we did not obtain training-specific improvements in context updating in the AX-CPT neither at the behavioral level nor at the neuronal level. Results are discussed in the context of the ongoing debate on whether transfer of cognitive training improvements is possible.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience: Evaluation of Synergy Extrapolation for Predicting Unmeasured Muscle Excitations from Measured Muscle Synergies</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2020.588943</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Electromyography (EMG)-driven musculoskeletal modeling relies on high-quality measurements of muscle electrical activity to estimate muscle forces. However, a critical challenge for practical deployment of this approach is missing EMG data from muscles that contribute substantially to joint moments. This situation may arise due to either the inability to measure deep muscles with surface electrodes or the lack of a sufficient number of EMG channels. Muscle synergy analysis (MSA) is a dimensionality reduction approach that decomposes a large number of muscle excitations into a small number of time-varying synergy excitations along with time-invariant synergy weights that define the contribution of each synergy excitation to all muscle excitations. This study evaluates how well missing muscle excitations can be predicted using synergy excitations extracted from muscles with available EMG data (henceforth called “synergy extrapolation” or SynX). The method was evaluated using a gait data set collected from a stroke survivor walking on an instrumented treadmill at self-selected and fastest-comfortable speeds. The evaluation process started with full calibration of a lower-body EMG-driven model using 16 measured EMG channels (collected using surface and fine wire electrodes) per leg. One fine wire EMG channel (either iliopsoas or adductor longus) was then treated as unmeasured. The synergy weights associated with the unmeasured muscle excitation were predicted by solving a nonlinear optimization problem where the errors between inverse dynamics and EMG-driven joint moments were minimized. The prediction process was performed for different synergy analysis algorithms (principal component analysis and non-negative matrix factorization), EMG normalization methods, and numbers of synergies. SynX performance was most influenced by the choice of synergy analysis algorithm and number of synergies. Principal component analysis with five or six synergies consistently predicted unmeasured muscle excitations the most accurately and with the greatest robustness to EMG normalization method. Furthermore, the associated joint moment matching accuracy was comparable to that produced by initial EMG-driven model calibration using all 16 EMG channels per leg. SynX may facilitate the assessment of human neuromuscular control and biomechanics when important EMG signals are missing.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Molecular and Functional Characterization of Neurogenin-2 Induced Human Sensory Neurons</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.600895</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Sensory perception is fundamental to everyday life, yet understanding of human sensory physiology at the molecular level is hindered due to constraints on tissue availability. Emerging strategies to study and characterize peripheral neuropathies in vitro involve the use of human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) differentiated into dorsal root ganglion (DRG) sensory neurons. However, neuronal functionality and maturity are limited and underexplored. A recent and promising approach for directing hPSC differentiation towards functionally mature neurons involves the exogenous expression of Neurogenin-2 (NGN2). The optimized protocol described here generates sensory neurons from hPSC-derived neural crest (NC) progenitors through virally induced NGN2 expression. NC cells were derived from hPSCs via a small molecule inhibitor approach and enriched for migrating NC cells (66% SOX10+ cells). At the protein and transcript level, the resulting NGN2 induced sensory neurons (&lt;sub&gt;NGN2&lt;/sub&gt;iSNs) express sensory neuron markers such as BRN3A (82% BRN3A+ cells), ISLET1 (91% ISLET1+ cells), TRKA, TRKB, and TRKC. Importantly, &lt;sub&gt;NGN2&lt;/sub&gt;iSNs repetitively fire action potentials (APs) supported by voltage-gated sodium, potassium, and calcium conductances. In-depth analysis of the molecular basis of &lt;sub&gt;NGN2&lt;/sub&gt;iSN excitability revealed functional expression of ion channels associated with the excitability of primary afferent neurons, such as Nav1.7, Nav1.8, Kv1.2, Kv2.1, BK, Cav2.1, Cav2.2, Cav3.2, ASICs and HCN among other ion channels, for which we provide functional and transcriptional evidence. Our characterization of stem cell-derived sensory neurons sheds light on the molecular basis of human sensory physiology and highlights the suitability of using hPSC-derived sensory neurons for modeling human DRG development and their potential in the study of human peripheral neuropathies and drug therapies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: A Potential Mechanism of Sodium Channel Mediating the General Anesthesia Induced by Propofol</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.593050</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;General anesthesia has revolutionized healthcare over the past 200 years and continues to show advancements. However, many phenomena induced by general anesthetics including paradoxical excitation are still poorly understood. Voltage-gated sodium channels (Na&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;) were believed to be one of the proteins targeted during general anesthesia. Based on electrophysiological measurements before and after propofol treatments of different concentrations, we mathematically modified the Hodgkin–Huxley sodium channel formulations and constructed a thalamocortical model to investigate the potential roles of Na&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;. The ion channels of individual neurons were modeled using the Hodgkin–Huxley type equations. The enhancement of propofol-induced GABAa current was simulated by increasing the maximal conductance and the time-constant of decay. Electroencephalogram (EEG) was evaluated as the post-synaptic potential from pyramidal (PY) cells. We found that a left shift in activation of Na&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt; was induced primarily by a low concentration of propofol (0.3–10 μM), while a left shift in inactivation of Na&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt; was induced by an increasing concentration (0.3–30 μM). Mathematical simulation indicated that a left shift of Na&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt; activation produced a Hopf bifurcation, leading to cell oscillations. Left shift of Na&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt; activation around a value of 5.5 mV in the thalamocortical models suppressed normal bursting of thalamocortical (TC) cells by triggering its chaotic oscillations. This led to irregular spiking of PY cells and an increased frequency in EEG readings. This observation suggests a mechanism leading to paradoxical excitation during general anesthesia. While a left shift in inactivation led to light hyperpolarization in individual cells, it inhibited the activity of the thalamocortical model after a certain depth of anesthesia. This finding implies that high doses of propofol inhibit the network partly by accelerating Na&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt; toward inactivation. Additionally, this result explains why the application of sodium channel blockers decreases the requirement for general anesthetics. Our study provides an insight into the roles that Na&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt; plays in the mechanism of general anesthesia. Since the activation and inactivation of Na&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt; are structurally independent, it should be possible to avoid side effects by state-dependent binding to the Na&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt; to achieve precision medicine in the future.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Effects of Early Changes in Blood Pressure During Intravenous Thrombolysis on the Prognosis of Acute Ischemic Stroke Patients</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.601471</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Background: Intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) therapy is currently one of the best medical treatments available for patients with acute ischemic stroke. Studies have shown that blood pressure (BP) changes in patients treated with IVT are significantly correlated with prognosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Objective: Our study aimed to determine the relationship between BP changes during recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) infusion and the 3-month prognosis evaluated using the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) and determine the factors influencing BP changes during rt-PA infusion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Consecutive patients who were treated with IVT and admitted to our stroke center between May 2015 and October 2017 were analyzed retrospectively. Patients were divided into two groups according to their 3-month prognosis status: patients with mRS ≤ 2 were defined as “favorable outcome group” and those with mRS ≥ 3 as “unfavorable outcome group”. First, the factors affecting prognosis after thrombolysis were analyzed. Second, we analyzed the relationship between BP and the prognosis. BP was taken before and at regular intervals of 15 min during the rt-PA infusion (1 h). The average value of BP during thrombolysis was calculated and compared to the baseline BP. BP decrease was defined as the difference between the baseline BP and the average BP, provided it was greater than 0 mmHg. Third, univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to identify factors that may contribute to BP decrease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: In total, 458 patients were included. Patients with a lower baseline National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score (8.25 ± 5.57 vs. 13.51 ± 7.42, P &amp;lt; 0.001), a higher Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score (ASPECTS; 8.65 ± 1.82 vs. 8.13 ± 2.00, P = 0.005), decreased BP during thrombolysis (69.4% vs. 59.8%, P = 0.037), and steady BP (SD &amp;lt; 10 mmHg) were more likely to have a favorable outcome (73.9% vs. 60.6%, P = 0.019). High baseline BP (OR &amp;gt; 1), hypertension history (OR &amp;lt; 1), and baseline ASPECTS (OR &amp;gt; 1) were independent factors of BP change during thrombolysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: Patients with decreased or steady BP during thrombolysis were more likely to have a favorable outcome. Baseline ASPECTS, baseline NIHSS score, and hypertension history influenced BP changes during thrombolysis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Neural Generators Underlying Temporal Envelope Processing Show Altered Responses and Hemispheric Asymmetry Across Age</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.596551</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Speech understanding problems are highly prevalent in the aging population, even when hearing sensitivity is clinically normal. These difficulties are attributed to changes in central temporal processing with age and can potentially be captured by age-related changes in neural generators. The aim of this study is to investigate age-related changes in a wide range of neural generators during temporal processing in middle-aged and older persons with normal audiometric thresholds. A minimum-norm imaging technique is employed to reconstruct cortical and subcortical neural generators of temporal processing for different acoustic modulations. The results indicate that for relatively slow modulations (&amp;lt;50 Hz), the response strength of neural sources is higher in older adults than in younger ones, while the phase-locking does not change. For faster modulations (80 Hz), both the response strength and the phase-locking of neural sources are reduced in older adults compared to younger ones. These age-related changes in temporal envelope processing of slow and fast acoustic modulations are possibly due to loss of functional inhibition, which is accompanied by aging. Both cortical (primary and non-primary) and subcortical neural generators demonstrate similar age-related changes in response strength and phase-locking. Hemispheric asymmetry is also altered in older adults compared to younger ones. Alterations depend on the modulation frequency and side of stimulation. The current findings at source level could have important implications for the understanding of age-related changes in auditory temporal processing and for developing advanced rehabilitation strategies to address speech understanding difficulties in the aging population.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Acupuncture Treatment Reduces Incidence of Parkinson's Disease in Patients With Depression: A Population-Based Retrospective Cohort Study in Taiwan</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.591640</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Depression is a risk factor for subsequent Parkinson's disease (PD). Some patients with depression undergo acupuncture treatment because of other diseases in Taiwan. Therefore, the present study used data from Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD) to investigate the incidence of PD in patients having depression with and without acupuncture treatment. We conducted a retrospective study of a matched cohort of 48,981 patients with newly diagnosed depression between 2000 and 2012 who were selected from the NHIRD. The 1:1 propensity score method was utilized to match an equal number of patients (N = 9,189) in the acupuncture and non-acupuncture cohorts. We employed Cox proportional hazard models to evaluate the risk of PD. The cumulative incidence of PD in both cohorts was estimated using the Kaplan–Meier method, and the difference was examined through a log-rank test. Patients with depression who received acupuncture treatment demonstrated a lower risk of PD [adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) = 0.39, 95% confidence interval = 0.31–0.49] than those who did not undergo acupuncture treatment, after adjusting for age, sex, insurance amount, geographic region, urbanization levels, comorbidities, and drugs. The cumulative incidence of PD was significantly lower in the acupuncture cohort than in the non-acupuncture cohort (log-rank test, p &amp;lt; 0.001). The database did not indicate the severity of depression and acupoints. The results suggest that acupuncture treatment significantly reduced the development of PD in patients with depression; however, a future study should be conducted to provide more objective evidence.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: The Influence of Aging, Hearing, and Tinnitus on the Morphology of Cortical Gray Matter, Amygdala, and Hippocampus</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.553461</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Age related hearing loss (presbycusis) is a natural process represented by elevated auditory thresholds and decreased speech intelligibility, especially in noisy conditions. Tinnitus is a phantom sound that also potentially leads to cortical changes, with its highest occurrence coinciding with the clinical onset of presbycusis. The aim of our project was to identify age, hearing loss and tinnitus related structural changes, within the auditory system and associated structures. Groups of subjects with presbycusis and tinnitus (22 subjects), with only presbycusis (24 subjects), young tinnitus patients with normal hearing (10 subjects) and young controls (17 subjects), underwent an audiological examination to characterize hearing loss and tinnitus. In addition, MRI (3T MR system, analysis in Freesurfer software) scans were used to identify changes in the cortical and subcortical structures. The following areas of the brain were analyzed: Heschl gyrus (HG), planum temporale (PT), primary visual cortex (V1), gyrus parahippocampus (PH), anterior insula (Ins), amygdala (Amg), and hippocampus (HP). A statistical analysis was performed in R framework using linear mixed-effects models with explanatory variables: age, tinnitus, laterality and hearing. In all of the cortical structures, the gray matter thickness decreased significantly with aging without having an effect on laterality (differences between the left and right hemispheres). The decrease in the gray matter thickness was faster in the HG, PT and Ins in comparison with the PH and V1. Aging did not influence the surface of the cortical areas, however there were differences between the surface size of the reported regions in the left and right hemispheres. Hearing loss caused only a borderline decrease of the cortical surface in the HG. Tinnitus was accompanied by a borderline decrease of the Ins surface and led to an increase in the volume of Amy and HP. In summary, aging is accompanied by a decrease in the cortical gray matter thickness; hearing loss only has a limited effect on the structure of the investigated cortical areas and tinnitus causes structural changes which are predominantly within the limbic system and insula, with the structure of the auditory system only being minimally affected.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/62944</link>
	<content:encoded>Large spines are stable and important for memory trace formation. The majority of large spines also contains synaptopodin (SP), an actin-modulating and plasticity-related protein. Since SP stabilizes F-actin, we speculated that the presence of SP within large spines could explain their long lifetime. Indeed, using 2-photon time-lapse imaging of SP-transgenic granule cells in mouse organotypic tissue cultures we found that spines containing SP survived considerably longer than spines of equal size without SP. Of note, SP-positive (SP+) spines that underwent pruning first lost SP before disappearing. Whereas the survival time courses of SP+ spines followed conditional two-stage decay functions, SP-negative (SP-) spines and all spines of SP-deficient animals showed single-phase exponential decays. This was also the case following afferent denervation. These results implicate SP as a major regulator of long-term spine stability: SP clusters stabilize spines, and the presence of SP indicates spines of high stability.</content:encoded>

Previous analyses have identified homologous 'Gustatory Receptor-Like (GRL)' proteins across Animalia, but the evolutionary origin of this novel class of ion channels is unknown. We describe a survey of unicellular eukaryotic genomes for GRLs, identifying several candidates in fungi, protists and algae that contain many structural features characteristic of animal GRLs. The existence of these proteins in unicellular eukaryotes, together with &lt;i&gt;ab initio &lt;/i&gt;protein structure predictions, provide evidence for homology between GRLs and a family of uncharacterized plant proteins containing the DUF3537 domain.

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/62374</link>
	<content:encoded>Phylogenetic analysis of morphological data proceeds from a fixed set of primary homology statements, the character-by-taxon matrix. However, there are cases where multiple conflicting homology statements can be justified from comparative anatomy. The upper jaw bones of placoderms have traditionally been considered homologous to the palatal vomer-dermopalatine series of osteichthyans. The discovery of 'maxillate' placoderms led to the alternative hypothesis that 'core' placoderm jaw bones are premaxillae and maxillae lacing external (facial) laminae. We introduce a BEAST2 package for simultaneous inference of homology and phylogeny, and find strong evidence for the latter hypothesis. Phenetic analysis of reconstructed ancestors suggests that maxillate placoderms are the most plesiomorphic known gnathostomes, and the shared cranial architecture of arthrodire placoderms, maxillate placoderms and osteichthyans is inherited. We suggest that the gnathostome ancestor possessed maxillae and premaxillae with facial and palatal laminae, and that these bones underwent divergent evolutionary trajectories in placoderms and osteichthyans.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/61771</link>
	<content:encoded>In biological contexts as diverse as development, apoptosis, and synthetic microbial consortia, collections of cells or sub-cellular components have been shown to overcome the slow signaling speed of simple diffusion by utilizing diffusive relays, in which the presence of one type of diffusible signaling molecule triggers participation in the emission of the same type of molecule. This collective effect gives rise to fast-traveling diffusive waves. Here, in the context of cell signaling, we show that system dimensionality – the shape of the extracellular medium and the distribution of cells within it – can dramatically affect the wave dynamics, but that these dynamics are insensitive to details of cellular activation. As an example, we show that neutrophil swarming experiments exhibit dynamical signatures consistent with the proposed signaling motif. We further show that cell signaling relays generate much steeper concentration profiles than does simple diffusion, which may facilitate neutrophil chemotaxis.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: A self-balancing circuit centered on MoOsm1 kinase governs adaptive responses to host-derived ROS in Magnaporthe oryzae</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/61605</link>
	<content:encoded>The production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is a ubiquitous defense response in plants. Adapted pathogens evolved mechanisms to counteract the deleterious effects of host-derived ROS and promote infection. How plant pathogens regulate this elaborate response against ROS burst remains unclear. Using the rice blast fungus &lt;i&gt;Magnaporthe oryzae&lt;/i&gt;, we uncovered a self-balancing circuit controlling response to ROS in planta and virulence. During infection, ROS induces phosphorylation of the high osmolarity glycerol pathway kinase MoOsm1 and its nuclear translocation. There, MoOsm1 phosphorylates transcription factor MoAtf1 and dissociates MoAtf1-MoTup1 complex. This releases MoTup1-mediated transcriptional repression on oxidoreduction-pathway genes and activates the transcription of MoPtp1/2 protein phosphatases. In turn, MoPtp1/2 dephosphorylate MoOsm1, restoring the circuit to its initial state. Balanced interactions among proteins centered on MoOsm1 provide a means to counter host-derived ROS. Our findings thereby reveal new insights into how &lt;i&gt;M. oryzae&lt;/i&gt; utilizes a phosphor-regulatory circuitry to face plant immunity during infection.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Atlantic herring is widespread in North Atlantic and adjacent waters and is one of the most abundant vertebrates on earth. This species is well suited to explore genetic adaptation due to minute genetic differentiation at selectively neutral loci. Here we report hundreds of loci underlying ecological adaptation to different geographic areas and spawning conditions. Four of these represent megabase inversions confirmed by long read sequencing. The genetic architecture underlying ecological adaptation in herring deviates from expectation under a classical infinitesimal model for complex traits because of large shifts in allele frequencies at hundreds of loci under selection.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: A statistical framework for assessing pharmacological response and biomarkers using uncertainty estimates</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/60352</link>
	<content:encoded>High-throughput testing of drugs across molecular-characterised cell lines can identify candidate treatments and discover biomarkers. However, the cells' response to a drug is typically quantified by a summary statistic from a best-fit dose-response curve, whilst neglecting the uncertainty of the curve fit and the potential variability in the raw readouts. Here, we model the experimental variance using Gaussian Processes, and subsequently, leverage uncertainty estimates to identify associated biomarkers with a new Bayesian framework. Applied to &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; screening data on 265 compounds across 1,074 cancer cell lines, our models identified 24 clinically established drug response biomarkers, and provided evidence for 6 novel biomarkers by accounting for association with low uncertainty. We validated our uncertainty estimates with an additional drug screen of 26 drugs, 10 cell lines with 8 to 9 replicates. Our method is applicable to any dose-response data without replicates, and improves biomarker discovery for precision medicine.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: Activation of the archaeal ion channel MthK is exquisitely regulated by temperature</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/59055</link>
	<content:encoded>Physiological response to thermal stimuli in mammals is mediated by a structurally diverse class of ion channels, many of which exhibit polymodal behavior. To probe the diversity of biophysical mechanisms of temperature-sensitivity, we characterized the temperature-dependent activation of MthK, a two transmembrane calcium-activated potassium channel from thermophilic archaebacteria. Our functional complementation studies show that these channels are more efficient at rescuing K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; transport at 37°C than at 24°C. Electrophysiological activity of the purified MthK is extremely sensitive (Q&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;gt;100) to heating particularly at low-calcium concentrations whereas channels lacking the calcium-sensing RCK domain are practically insensitive. By analyzing single-channel activities at limiting calcium concentrations, we find that temperature alters the coupling between the cytoplasmic RCK domains and the pore domain. These findings reveal a hitherto unexplored mechanism of temperature-dependent regulation of ion channel gating and shed light on ancient origins of temperature-sensitivity.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Previously we showed that cryo fixation of adult mouse brain tissue gave a truer representation of brain ultrastructure in comparison with a standard chemical fixation method (Korogod et al 2005). Extracellular space matched physiological measurements, there were larger numbers of docked vesicles and less glial coverage of synapses and blood capillaries. Here, using the same preservation approaches we compared the morphology of dendritic spines. We show that the length of the spine and the volume of its head is unchanged, however, the spine neck width is thinner by more than 30 % after cryo fixation. In addition, the weak correlation between spine neck width and head volume seen after chemical fixation was not present in cryo-fixed spines. Our data suggest that spine neck geometry is independent of the spine head volume, with cryo fixation showing enhanced spine head compartmentalization and a higher predicted electrical resistance between spine head and parent dendrite.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/54838</link>
	<content:encoded>Goal-directed behaviors are essential for normal function and significantly impaired in neuropsychiatric disorders. Despite extensive associations between genetic mutations and these disorders, the molecular contributions to goal-directed dysfunction remain unclear. We examined mice with constitutive and brain region-specific mutations in Neurexin1α, a neuropsychiatric disease-associated synaptic molecule, in value-based choice paradigms. We found Neurexin1α knockouts exhibited reduced selection of beneficial outcomes and impaired avoidance of costlier options. Reinforcement modeling suggested this was driven by deficits in updating and representation of value. Disruption of Neurexin1α within telencephalic excitatory projection neurons, but not thalamic neurons, recapitulated choice abnormalities of global Neurexin1α knockouts. Furthermore, this selective forebrain excitatory knockout of Neurexin1α perturbed value-modulated neural signals within striatum, a central node in feedback-based reinforcement learning. By relating deficits in value-based decision-making to region-specific Nrxn1α disruption and changes in value-modulated neural activity, we reveal potential neural substrates for the pathophysiology of neuropsychiatric disease-associated cognitive dysfunction.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.04.412163v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Accurate memory formation has been hypothesized to depend on both rapid Hebbian plasticity for initial encoding, and slower homeostatic mechanisms that prevent runaway excitation and subsequent loss of memory specificity. Here, we tested the role of synaptic scaling in shaping the specificity of conditioned taste aversion (CTA) memory, a Hebbian plasticity-dependent form of associative learning. We found that CTA memory initially generalized to non-conditioned tastants (generalized aversion), becoming specific to the conditioned tastant only over the course of many hours. Blocking synaptic scaling in the gustatory cortex (GC) prolonged the duration of the initial generalized aversion and enhanced the persistence of synaptic strength increases observed after CTA. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that synaptic scaling is important for sculpting the specificity of an associative memory and suggest that the relative strengths of Hebbian and homeostatic plasticity can modulate the balance between stable memory formation and generalization.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>AMPA receptors (AMPARs) mediate excitatory neurotransmission in the CNS and their subunit composition determines synaptic efficacy. Whereas AMPAR subunits GluA1-GluA3 have been linked to particular forms of synaptic plasticity and learning, the functional role of GluA4 remains elusive. Here we used electrophysiological, computational and behavioral approaches to demonstrate a crucial function of GluA4 for synaptic excitation and associative memory formation in the cerebellum. Notably, GluA4-knockout mice had ~80% reduced mossy fiber to granule cell synaptic transmission. The fidelity of granule cell spike output was markedly decreased despite attenuated tonic inhibition and increased NMDA receptor-mediated transmission. Computational modeling revealed that GluA4 facilitates pattern separation that is important for associative learning. On a behavioral level, while locomotor coordination was generally spared, GluA4-knockout mice failed to form associative memories during delay eyeblink conditioning. These results demonstrate an essential role for GluA4-containing AMPARs in cerebellar information processing and associative learning.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.04.411868v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Phosphodiesterase-10A (PDE10A) hydrolyze the secondary messengers cGMP and cAMP which play a critical role in neurodevelopment and brain functions. PDE10A is linked to progression of neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimers, Parkinsons, Huntingtons diseases etc and a critical role in cognitive functions. The present study was undertaken to determine the possible neuroprotective effects and the associated mechanism of papaverine (PAP) against quinolinic acid (QUIN) induced excitotoxicity using human primary cortical neurons. Cytotoxicity potential of PAP was analysed using MTS assay. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) and mitochondrial membrane potential were measured by DCF-DA and JC10 staining, respectively. Caspase 3/7 and cAMP levels using ELISA kits. Effect of PAP on the CREB, BNDF and synaptic proteins such as SAP-97, synaptophysin, synapsin-I, PSD-95 expression was analysed by Western blotting technique. Pre-treatment with PAP increased intracellular cAMP and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) levels, restored mitochondrial membrane potential, and decreased ROS and caspase3/7 content in QUIN exposed neurons. PAP up-regulated CREB and BDNF, and synaptic proteins expression. In summary, these data indicate that PDE10A involves in QUIN mediated neurotoxicity and its inhibition can elicit neuroprotection by reducing the oxidative stress and protecting synaptic proteins via upregulation of cAMP signalling cascade.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.04.411819v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Psychiatric disease often produces symptoms that have divergent effects on neural activity. For example, in drug dependence, dysfunctional value-based decision-making and compulsive-like actions have been linked to hypo- and hyper-activity of orbital frontal cortex (OFC)-basal ganglia circuits, respectively, however, the underlying mechanisms are unknown. Here we show that alcohol dependence enhanced activity in OFC terminals in dorsal striatum (OFC-DS) associated with actions, but reduced activity of the same terminals during periods of outcome retrieval, corresponding with a loss of outcome control over decision-making. Disrupted OFC-DS terminal activity was due to a dysfunction of dopamine-type 1 receptors on spiny projection neurons (D1R SPNs) that resulted in increased retrograde endocannabinoid (eCB) signaling at OFC-D1R SPN synapses reducing OFC-DS transmission. Blocking CB1 receptors restored OFC-DS activity in vivo and rescued outcome-based control over decision-making. These findings demonstrate a circuit-, synapse-, and computation specific mechanism gating OFC activity following the induction of alcohol dependence.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.04.411629v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>How animals learn to discriminate between different sensory stimuli is an intriguing question. An important, common step towards discrimination is the enhancement of differences between the representations of relevant stimuli. This can be part of the learning process. In rodents, the olfactory bulb, which is known to contribute to this pattern separation, exhibits extensive structural synaptic plasticity even in adult animals: reciprocal connections between excitatory mitral cells and inhibitory granule cells are persistently formed and eliminated, correlated with mitral cell and granule cell activity. Here we present a Hebbian-type model for this plasticity. It captures the experimental observation that the same learning protocol that enhanced the discriminability of similar stimuli actually reduced that of dissimilar stimuli. The model predicts that the learned bulbar network structure is remembered across training with additional stimuli, unless the new stimuli interfere with the representations of previously learned ones.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.04.410787v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Different ion channel combinations can yield equivalent neuronal excitability. This degeneracy facilitates robust regulation of excitability by enabling a disruptive change in one channel to be offset by compensatory changes in other channels. But various aspects of excitability plus other cellular properties require regulation. Coordinately regulating multiple properties via control of overlapping sets of ion channels is no easy task. Here we demonstrate that of the many ion channel combinations producing the target value for one property (the single-output solution set), few combinations produce the target value for other properties. Combinations producing the target value for two or more properties (the multi-output solution set) correspond to the intersection between single-output solution sets. We demonstrate that for multi-output solution sets to be degenerate, the number of controllable ion channels (nin) must exceed the number of regulated properties (nout). We further demonstrate how the dimensionality of solution space shapes ion channel correlations that emerge during homeostatic regulation and how homeostatic regulation may fail given the heightened challenge of simultaneously regulating many properties.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.04.410035v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>The occipital face area (OFA) is hierarchically one of the first stages of the face processing network. It has originally been thought to be involved in early, structural processing steps, but currently more and more studies challenge this view and propose that it also takes part in higher face processing, such as identification and recognition. Here we tested whether the OFA is involved in the initial steps of recognition memory and plays a causal role in the differential processing of familiar and unfamiliar faces. We used an offline, inhibitory continuous theta-burst stimulation (cTBS) protocol over the right OFA and the vertex as control site. An electroencephalographic (EEG) recording of event-related potentials (ERPs), elicited by visually presented familiar (famous) and unfamiliar faces was performed before and after stimulation. We observed a difference in ERPs for famous and unfamiliar faces in a time-window corresponding to the N250 component. Importantly, this difference was significantly increased by cTBS of the right OFA, suggesting its causal role in the differential processing of familiar and unfamiliar faces. The enhancement occurred focally, at electrodes close to the right hemispheric cTBS site, as well as over similar occipito-temporal sites of the contralateral hemisphere. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study showing the causal role of the rOFA in the differential processing of familiar and unfamiliar faces, using combined cTBS and EEG recording methods. These results are discussed with respect to the nature of familiar face representations, supported by an extensive, bilateral network.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.04.383604v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Two commonly used approaches to study interactions among neurons are spike count correlation, which describes pairs of neurons, and dimensionality reduction, applied to a population of neurons. While both approaches have been used to study trial-to-trial correlated neuronal variability, they are often used in isolation and have not been directly related. We first established concrete mathematical and empirical relationships between pairwise correlation and metrics of population-wide covariability based on dimensionality reduction. Applying these insights to macaque V4 population recordings, we found that the previously reported decrease in mean pairwise correlation associated with attention stemmed from three distinct changes in population-wide covariability. Overall, our work builds the intuition and formalism to bridge between pairwise correlation and population-wide covariability and presents a cautionary tale about the inferences one can make about population activity by using a single statistic, whether it be mean pairwise correlation or dimensionality.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>The late indirect (I) waves recruited by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) over primary motor cortex (M1) can be modulated using I-wave periodicity repetitive TMS (iTMS). The purpose of this study was to determine if the response to iTMS is influenced by different interstimulus intervals (ISIs) targeting late I-waves, and whether these responses were associated with individual variations in intracortical excitability. 17 young (27.2 {+/-} 6.4 years, 12 females) healthy adults received iTMS at late I-wave intervals (4.0, 4.5 &amp;amp; 5.0 ms) in three separate sessions. Changes due to each intervention were examined with motor evoked potential (MEP) amplitudes and short-interval intracortical facilitation (SICF) using both posterior-anterior (PA) and anterior-posterior (AP) TMS current directions. Changes in MEP amplitude and SICF were influenced by iTMS ISI, with the greatest facilitation for ISIs at 4 and 5 ms with PA TMS, and 4 ms with AP TMS. Maximum SICF at baseline (irrespective of ISI) was associated with increased iTMS response, but only for PA stimulation. These results suggest that modifying iTMS parameters targeting late I-waves can influence M1 plasticity. They also suggest that maximum SICF may be a means by which responders to iTMS targeting the late I-waves could be identified.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>In recent years, multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) has been hugely beneficial for cognitive neuroscience by making new experiment designs possible and by increasing the inferential power of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), electroencephalography (EEG), and other neuroimaging methodologies. In a similar time frame, &quot;deep learning&quot; (a term for the use of artificial neural networks with convolutional, recurrent, or similarly sophisticated architectures) has produced a parallel revolution in the field of machine learning and has been employed across a wide variety of applications. Traditional MVPA also uses a form of machine learning, but most commonly with much simpler techniques based on linear calculations; a number of studies have applied deep learning techniques to neuroimaging data, but we believe that those have barely scratched the surface of the potential deep learning holds for the field. In this paper, we provide a brief introduction to deep learning for those new to the technique, explore the logistical pros and cons of using deep learning to analyze neuroimaging data -- which we term &quot;deep MVPA,&quot; or dMVPA -- and introduce a new software toolbox (the &quot;Deep Learning In Neuroimaging: Exploration, Analysis, Tools, and Education&quot; package, DeLINEATE for short) intended to facilitate dMVPA for neuroscientists (and indeed, scientists more broadly) everywhere.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.03.410902v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>We introduce a connectomics metric that integrates information on structural connectivity (SC) from diffusion MRI tractography and functional connectivity (FC) from resting-state functional MRI, at individual subject level. The metric is based on the ability of SC to broadly predict FC using a simple linear predictive model; for each connection in the brain, the metric quantifies the deviation from that model. For the metric to capture underlying physiological properties, we minimise systematic measurement errors and processing biases in both SC and FC, and address several challenges with the joint analysis. This also includes a data-driven normalisation approach. The combined metric may provide new information by indirectly assessing white matter structural properties that cannot be inferred from diffusion MRI alone, and/or complex interregional neural interactions that cannot be inferred from functional MRI alone. To demonstrate the utility of the metric, we used young adult data from the Human Connectome Project to examine all bilateral pairs of ipsilateral connections, i.e. each left-hemisphere connection in the brain was paired with its right-hemisphere homologue. We detected a minority of bilateral pairs where the metric value is significantly different across hemispheres, which we suggest reflects cases of ipsilateral connections that have distinct functional specialisation in each hemisphere. The pairs with significant effects spanned all cortical lobes, and also included several cortico-subcortical connections. Our findings highlight the potential in a joint analysis of structural and functional measures of connectivity, both for clinical applications and to help in the interpretation of results from standard functional connectivity analysis.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Kisspeptin-expressing neurons in the rostral periventricular region of the third ventricle (RP3V) play an essential role in female reproduction. However, adult male mice were reported to have very few Kisspeptin-expressing neurons in the RP3V compared to females. This led to the hypothesis that Kiss1RP3V neurons are responsible for the ability of females, but not males, to generate a surge of LH, triggering ovulation and steroid synthesis in the female. Using mouse genetics and cell type-specific gene expression analysis, we show that male mice harbor almost as many Kiss1RP3V neurons as the female and that gene expression in these neurons is very similar. Specific activation of male Kiss1RP3V neurons expressing viral-encoded hM3Dq caused a surge in serum testosterone levels. These results demonstrate that Kiss1RP3V neurons are present in the adult male and fully capable of regulating the hypothalamic/pituitary/gonadal axis. We suggest that these neurons may continue to play a role in reproductive behavior in adult male mice.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Previous research has shown the potential values of Bayesian methods in fMRI analysis. For instance, the result from Bayes Factor-applied second-level fMRI analysis showed the better sensitivity in terms of the hit rate while maintaining the reasonable level of selectivity in term of the false positive rate compared with frequentist second-level fMRI analysis. Moreover, the employment of the multiple comparison correction method to update the default prior distribution significantly improved the performance of Bayesian second-level fMRI analysis. However, the previous studies have utilized the default prior distribution that did not consider the nature of each individual study. Thus, in the present study, a method to adjust the Cauchy prior distribution based on a priori information, such as the result from relevant previous studies, was proposed and tested. A Cauchy prior distribution was adjusted based on the contrast, noise strength, and proportion of true positives that were estimated from the meta-analysis of relevant previous studies. In the present study, both the simulated images and real contrast images from two previous studies were used to evaluate the performance of the proposed method. The results showed that the employment of the prior adjustment method resulted in the improvement of the performance of Bayesian second-level fMRI analysis.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Predictability of cortical-cortical connections in the mammalian brain</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.03.410803v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Despite a five-order magnitude range in size, the mammalian brain exhibits many shared anatomical and functional characteristics that should translate into cortical network commonalities. Here we develop a framework employing machine learning to quantify the degree of predictability of the weighted interareal cortical matrix. Data were obtained with retrograde tract-tracing experiments supplemented by projection length measurements. Using this framework with consistent and edge-complete empirical datasets in the macaque and mouse cortex, we show that there is significant amount of predictability embedded in the interareal cortical networks of both species. At the binary level, links are predictable with an Area Under the ROC curve of at least 0.8 for the macaque. At the weighted level, strengths of the medium and strong links are predictable with at least 85-90% accuracy in mouse and 70-80% in macaque, whereas weak links are not predictable in either species. These observations suggest that the formation and evolution of the cortical network at the mesoscale is to a large extent, rule-based, motivating further research on the architectural invariants of the cortical connectome.</content:encoded>

The extent to which brain functions are localized or distributed is a foundational question in neuroscience. In the human brain, common fMRI methods such as cluster correction, atlas parcellation, and anatomical searchlight are biased by design toward finding localized representations. Here we introduce the functional searchlight approach as an alternative to anatomical searchlight analysis, the most commonly used exploratory multivariate fMRI technique. Functional searchlight removes any anatomical bias by grouping voxels based only on functional similarity and ignoring anatomical proximity. We report evidence that visual and auditory features from deep neural networks and semantic features from a natural language processing model, as well as object representations, are more widely distributed across the brain than previously acknowledged and that functional searchlight can improve model-based similarity and decoding accuracy. This approach provides a new way to evaluate and constrain computational models with brain activity and pushes our understanding of human brain function further along the spectrum from strict modularity toward distributed representation&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/9YAIwQx3Ksw&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is responsible for the ongoing global pandemic that has infected more than 31 million people in more than 180 countries worldwide. Like other coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 is thought to have been transmitted to humans from wild animals. Given the scale and widespread geographical distribution of the current pandemic and confirmed cases of cross-species transmission, the question of the extent to which this transmission is possible emerges, as well as what molecular features distinguish susceptible from non-susceptible animal species. Here, we investigated the structural properties of several ACE2 orthologs bound to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. We found that species known not to be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection have non-conservative mutations in several ACE2 amino acid residues that disrupt key polar and charged contacts with the viral spike protein. Our models also allow us to predict affinity-enhancing mutations that could be used to design ACE2 variants for therapeutic purposes. Finally, our study provides a blueprint for modeling viral-host protein interactions and highlights several important considerations when designing these computational studies and analyzing their results.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/H1dwCO1hk_o&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: The two kinds of free energy and the Bayesian revolution</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/t1EnEmD_Z_E/article</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Sebastian Gottwald, Daniel A. Braun&lt;/p&gt;

The concept of free energy has its origins in 19th century thermodynamics, but has recently found its way into the behavioral and neural sciences, where it has been promoted for its wide applicability and has even been suggested as a fundamental principle of understanding intelligent behavior and brain function. We argue that there are essentially two different notions of free energy in current models of intelligent agency, that can both be considered as applications of Bayesian inference to the problem of action selection: one that appears when trading off accuracy and uncertainty based on a general maximum entropy principle, and one that formulates action selection in terms of minimizing an error measure that quantifies deviations of beliefs and policies from given reference models. The first approach provides a normative rule for action selection in the face of model uncertainty or when information processing capabilities are limited. The second approach directly aims to formulate the action selection problem as an inference problem in the context of Bayesian brain theories, also known as Active Inference in the literature. We elucidate the main ideas and discuss critical technical and conceptual issues revolving around these two notions of free energy that both claim to apply at all levels of decision-making, from the high-level deliberation of reasoning down to the low-level information processing of perception.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/t1EnEmD_Z_E&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Quantifying the impact of COVID-19 control measures using a Bayesian model of physical distancing</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/jsdpN4ctAD8/article</link>

Extensive non-pharmaceutical and physical distancing measures are currently the primary interventions against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) worldwide. It is therefore urgent to estimate the impact such measures are having. We introduce a Bayesian epidemiological model in which a proportion of individuals are willing and able to participate in distancing, with the timing of distancing measures informed by survey data on attitudes to distancing and COVID-19. We fit our model to reported COVID-19 cases in British Columbia (BC), Canada, and five other jurisdictions, using an observation model that accounts for both underestimation and the delay between symptom onset and reporting. We estimated the impact that physical distancing (social distancing) has had on the contact rate and examined the projected impact of relaxing distancing measures. We found that, as of April 11 2020, distancing had a strong impact in BC, consistent with declines in reported cases and in hospitalization and intensive care unit numbers; individuals practising physical distancing experienced approximately 0.22 (0.11–0.34 90% CI [credible interval]) of their normal contact rate. The threshold above which prevalence was expected to grow was 0.55. We define the “contact ratio” to be the ratio of the estimated contact rate to the threshold rate at which cases are expected to grow; we estimated this contact ratio to be 0.40 (0.19–0.60) in BC. We developed an R package ‘covidseir’ to make our model available, and used it to quantify the impact of distancing in five additional jurisdictions. As of May 7, 2020, we estimated that New Zealand was well below its threshold value (contact ratio of 0.22 [0.11–0.34]), New York (0.60 [0.43–0.74]), Washington (0.84 [0.79–0.90]) and Florida (0.86 [0.76–0.96]) were progressively closer to theirs yet still below, but California (1.15 [1.07–1.23]) was above its threshold overall, with cases still rising. Accordingly, we found that BC, New Zealand, and New York may have had more room to relax distancing measures than the other jurisdictions, though this would need to be done cautiously and with total case volumes in mind. Our projections indicate that intermittent distancing measures—if sufficiently strong and robustly followed—could control COVID-19 transmission. This approach provides a useful tool for jurisdictions to monitor and assess current levels of distancing relative to their threshold, which will continue to be essential through subsequent waves of this pandemic.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/jsdpN4ctAD8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Phosphorylation of specific substrates by protein kinases is a key control mechanism for vital cell-fate decisions and other cellular processes. However, discovering specific kinase-substrate relationships is time-consuming and often rather serendipitous. Computational predictions alleviate these challenges, but the current approaches suffer from limitations like restricted kinome coverage and inaccuracy. They also typically utilise only local features without reflecting broader interaction context. To address these limitations, we have developed an alternative predictive model. It uses statistical relational learning on top of phosphorylation networks interpreted as knowledge graphs, a simple yet robust model for representing networked knowledge. Compared to a representative selection of six existing systems, our model has the highest kinome coverage and produces biologically valid high-confidence predictions not possible with the other tools. Specifically, we have experimentally validated predictions of previously unknown phosphorylations by the LATS1, AKT1, PKA and MST2 kinases in human. Thus, our tool is useful for focusing phosphoproteomic experiments, and facilitates the discovery of new phosphorylation reactions. Our model can be accessed publicly via an easy-to-use web interface (LinkPhinder).&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Blm5do8tkYQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Biology: Transmembrane tumor necrosis factor alpha attenuates pressure-overload cardiac hypertrophy via tumor necrosis factor receptor 2</title>

Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) plays an important pathogenic role in cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure (HF); however, anti-TNF is paradoxically negative in clinical trials and even worsens HF, indicating a possible protective role of TNF-α in HF. TNF-α exists in transmembrane (tmTNF-α) and soluble (sTNF-α) forms. Herein, we found that TNF receptor 1 (TNFR1) knockout (KO) or knockdown (KD) by short hairpin RNA or small interfering RNA (siRNA) significantly alleviated cardiac hypertrophy, heart dysfunction, fibrosis, and inflammation with increased tmTNF-α expression, whereas TNFR2 KO or KD exacerbated the pathological phenomena with increased sTNF-α secretion in transverse aortic constriction (TAC)- and isoproterenol (ISO)-induced cardiac hypertrophy in vivo and in vitro, respectively, indicating the beneficial effects of TNFR2 associated with tmTNF-α. Suppressing TNF-α converting enzyme by TNF-α Protease Inhibitor-1 (TAPI-1) to increase endogenous tmTNF-α expression significantly alleviated TAC-induced cardiac hypertrophy. Importantly, direct addition of exogenous tmTNF-α into cardiomyocytes in vitro significantly reduced ISO-induced cardiac hypertrophy and transcription of the pro-inflammatory cytokines and induced proliferation. The beneficial effects of tmTNF-α were completely blocked by TNFR2 KD in H9C2 cells and TNFR2 KO in primary myocardial cells. Furthermore, we demonstrated that tmTNF-α displayed antihypertrophic and anti-inflammatory effects by activating the AKT pathway and inhibiting the nuclear factor (NF)-κB pathway via TNFR2. Our data suggest that tmTNF-α exerts cardioprotective effects via TNFR2. Specific targeting of tmTNF-α processing, rather than anti-TNF therapy, may be more useful for the treatment of hypertrophy and HF.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/wGLFWOTcSFY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Biology: Primate phylogenomics uncovers multiple rapid radiations and ancient interspecific introgression</title>

Our understanding of the evolutionary history of primates is undergoing continual revision due to ongoing genome sequencing efforts. Bolstered by growing fossil evidence, these data have led to increased acceptance of once controversial hypotheses regarding phylogenetic relationships, hybridization and introgression, and the biogeographical history of primate groups. Among these findings is a pattern of recent introgression between species within all major primate groups examined to date, though little is known about introgression deeper in time. To address this and other phylogenetic questions, here, we present new reference genome assemblies for 3 Old World monkey (OWM) species: &lt;i&gt;Colobus angolensis&lt;/i&gt; ssp. &lt;i&gt;palliatus&lt;/i&gt; (the black and white colobus), &lt;i&gt;Macaca nemestrina&lt;/i&gt; (southern pig-tailed macaque), and &lt;i&gt;Mandrillus leucophaeus&lt;/i&gt; (the drill). We combine these data with 23 additional primate genomes to estimate both the species tree and individual gene trees using thousands of loci. While our species tree is largely consistent with previous phylogenetic hypotheses, the gene trees reveal high levels of genealogical discordance associated with multiple primate radiations. We use strongly asymmetric patterns of gene tree discordance around specific branches to identify multiple instances of introgression between ancestral primate lineages. In addition, we exploit recent fossil evidence to perform fossil-calibrated molecular dating analyses across the tree. Taken together, our genome-wide data help to resolve multiple contentious sets of relationships among primates, while also providing insight into the biological processes and technical artifacts that led to the disagreements in the first place.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/6Y1ZCNOvZtY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Biology: Subpopulations of sensorless bacteria drive fitness in fluctuating environments</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~3/nIOLnI4Rd8g/article</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Thomas Julou, Ludovit Zweifel, Diana Blank, Athos Fiori, Erik van Nimwegen&lt;/p&gt;

Populations of bacteria often undergo a lag in growth when switching conditions. Because growth lags can be large compared to typical doubling times, variations in growth lag are an important but often overlooked component of bacterial fitness in fluctuating environments. We here explore how growth lag variation is determined for the archetypical switch from glucose to lactose as a carbon source in &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt;. First, we show that single-cell lags are bimodally distributed and controlled by a single-molecule trigger. That is, gene expression noise causes the population before the switch to divide into subpopulations with zero and nonzero &lt;i&gt;lac&lt;/i&gt; operon expression. While “sensorless” cells with zero preexisting &lt;i&gt;lac&lt;/i&gt; expression at the switch have long lags because they are unable to sense the lactose signal, any nonzero &lt;i&gt;lac&lt;/i&gt; operon expression suffices to ensure a short lag. Second, we show that the growth lag at the population level depends crucially on the fraction of sensorless cells and that this fraction in turn depends sensitively on the growth condition before the switch. Consequently, even small changes in basal expression can significantly affect the fraction of sensorless cells, thereby population lags and fitness under switching conditions, and may thus be subject to significant natural selection. Indeed, we show that condition-dependent population lags vary across wild &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; isolates. Since many sensory genes are naturally low expressed in conditions where their inducer is not present, bimodal responses due to subpopulations of sensorless cells may be a general mechanism inducing phenotypic heterogeneity and controlling population lags in switching environments. This mechanism also illustrates how gene expression noise can turn even a simple sensory gene circuit into a bet hedging module and underlines the profound role of gene expression noise in regulatory responses.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/nIOLnI4Rd8g&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

&lt;p&gt;Body–brain isomorphism of pig rostrum and cortical rostrum gyrus.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Physiological studies of the last century mapped a somatosensory cortical gyrus representing the pig's rostrum. Here, we describe the extraordinary correspondence of this gyrus to the rostrum. The pig rostrum is packed with microvibrissae (~470 per hemi‐rostrum) and innervated by a prominent infraorbital nerve, containing about 80,000 axons. The pig's rostrum has three major skin‐folds. The nostrils have a rectangular medial wall and a funnel‐like lateral opening, nasal channels run obliquely from lateral (surface) to medial (inside). The rostrum gyrus mimics rostrum geometry in great detail. The putative representation of skin folds coincides with blood sinus and folds of the rostrum gyrus. The putative nostril representation is an oblique sulcus running from lateral (surface) to medial (inside). As observed in rodents, Layer 4 is thin in the nostril sulcus. The side of the nostril sulcus representing the medial wall of the nostril is rectangular, whereas the side of the nostril sulcus representing the lateral wall is funnel‐like. Proportions and geometry of the rostrum and the rostrum gyrus are similar, albeit with a collapsed nostril and a larger interindividual variability in the gyrus. The pig's cortical rostrum gyrus receives dense thalamic innervation, has a thin Layer 1 and contains roughly 8 million neurons. With all that, the rostrum gyrus looks like a model of the pig rostrum at a scale of ~1:2. Our findings are reminiscent of the raccoon cortex with its forepaw‐like somatosensory forepaw‐representation. Representing highly relevant afferents in three‐dimensional body‐part‐models might facilitate isomorphic cortical computations in large‐brained tactile specialists.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: A Pilot Randomized, Controlled, Double‐Blind Trial of Bumetanide to Treat Neonatal Seizures</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25959?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the absence of controlled trials, treatment of neonatal seizures has changed minimally despite poor drug efficacy. We tested bumetanide added to phenobarbital to treat neonatal seizures in the first trial to include a standard‐therapy control group.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A randomized, double‐blind, dose‐escalation design was employed. Neonates with postmenstrual age 33 to 44 weeks at risk of or with seizures were eligible. Subjects with electroencephalography (EEG)‐confirmed seizures after ≥20 and &amp;lt;40mg/kg phenobarbital were randomized to receive additional phenobarbital with either placebo (control) or 0.1, 0.2, or 0.3mg/kg bumetanide (treatment). Continuous EEG monitoring data from ≥2 hours before to ≥48 hours after study drug administration (SDA) were analyzed for seizures.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Subjects were randomized to treatment (n = 27) and control (n = 16) groups. Pharmacokinetics were highly variable among subjects and altered by hypothermia. The only statistically significant adverse event was diuresis in treated subjects (48% vs 13%, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.02). One treated (4%) and 3 control subjects died (19%, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.14). Among survivors, 2 of 26 treated subjects (8%) and 0 of 13 control subjects had hearing impairment, as did 1 nonrandomized subject. Total seizure burden varied widely, with much higher seizure burden in treatment versus control groups (median = 3.1 vs 1.2 min/h, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.006). There was significantly greater reduction in seizure burden 0 to 4 hours and 2 to 4 hours post‐SDA (both &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.01) compared with 2‐hour baseline in treatment versus control groups with adjustment for seizure burden.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although definitive proof of efficacy awaits an appropriately powered phase 3 trial, this randomized, controlled, multicenter trial demonstrated an additional reduction in seizure burden attributable to bumetanide over phenobarbital without increased serious adverse effects. Future trials of bumetanide and other drugs should include a control group and balance seizure severity. ANN NEUROL 2020&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Subtype diagnosis of sporadic Creutzfeldt‐Jakob disease with diffusion MRI</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25983?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sporadic Creutzfeldt‐Jakob disease (sCJD) comprises several subtypes as defined by genetic and prion protein characteristics, which are associated with distinct clinical and pathological phenotypes. To date, no clinical test can reliably diagnose the subtype. We established two procedures for the antemortem diagnosis of sCJD subtype using diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MRI of 1458 patients referred to the National Prion Disease Pathology Surveillance Center were collected through its consultation service. One neuroradiologist blind to the diagnosis scored 12 brain regions and generated a lesion profile. We selected 487 patients with autopsy‐confirmed diagnosis of “pure” sCJD subtype and at least one positive diffusion MRI examination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We designed and tested two data‐driven procedures for subtype diagnosis: the first procedure —“Prion Subtype Classification Algorithm with MRI” (PriSCA_MRI)— uses only MRI examinations; the second —“PriSCA_MRI+Gen”— includes knowledge of the prion protein codon 129 genotype, a major determinant of sCJD subtypes. Both procedures were tested on first and the last MRI follow‐up.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PriSCA_MRI classified the three most prevalent subtypes with 82% accuracy. PriSCA_MRI+Gen raised the accuracy to 89% and identified all subtypes. Individually, the two most prevalent sCJD subtypes, MM1 and VV2, were diagnosed with both procedures with accuracies up to 95% and 97%, respectively. The performances of both procedures did not change in 168 patients with longitudinal MRI studies when the last examination was used.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study provides the first practical algorithms for antemortem diagnosis of sCJD subtypes. MRI diagnosis of subtype is likely to be attainable at early disease stages to prognosticate clinical course and design future therapeutic trials.&lt;/p&gt;

	<content:encoded>&lt;img alt=&quot;Graph theory analysis of the dopamine D2 receptor network in Parkinson’s disease patients with cognitive decline&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/42374ad7-a3ef-424a-9b55-da4b2f6ea303/jnr24760-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Graph theory analysis can be used to detect subtle changes in brain networks that may be missed by regional comparisons. The present study found evidence that compensatory network reorganization likely occurs in a frontal dopamine D2 receptor network to preserve cognitive function in Parkinson's disease patients without cognitive impairment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cognitive decline in Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common sequela of the disorder that has a large impact on patient well‐being. Its physiological etiology, however, remains elusive. Our study used graph theory analysis to investigate the large‐scale topological patterns of the extrastriatal dopamine D2 receptor network. We used positron emission tomography with [&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;C]FLB‐457 to measure the binding potential of cortical dopamine D2 receptors in two networks: the meso‐cortical dopamine network and the meso‐limbic dopamine network. We also investigated the application of partial volume effect correction (PVEC) in conjunction with graph theory analysis. Three groups were investigated in this study divided according to their cognitive status as measured by the Montreal Cognitive Assessment score, with a score ≤25 considered cognitively impaired: (a) healthy controls (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 13, 11 female), (b) cognitively unimpaired PD patients (PD‐CU, &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 13, 5 female), and (c) PD patients with mild cognitive impairment (PD‐MCI, &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 17, 4 female). In the meso‐cortical network, we observed increased small‐worldness, normalized clustering, and local efficiency in the PD‐CU group compared to the PD‐MCI group, as well as a hub shift in the PD‐MCI group. Compensatory reorganization of the meso‐cortical dopamine D2 receptor network may be responsible for some of the cognitive preservation observed in PD‐CU. These results were found without PVEC applied and PVEC proved detrimental to the graph theory analysis. Overall, our findings demonstrate how graph theory analysis can be used to detect subtle changes in the brain that would otherwise be missed by regional comparisons of receptor density.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

&lt;p&gt;Endocannabinoids (eCBs) elicit inhibitory modulation of synaptic transmission at various brain sites. We now show that neither a CB&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;/CB&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; receptor agonist WIN55212 nor an eCB affect GABA release from axon terminals of cerebellar Purkinje cells (PCs) making synaptic contacts with their target neurons, globular cells in the cerebellar cortex and principal neurons in the deep cerebellar nuclei. The finding is in sharp contrast to the fact that PCs receive abundant excitatory and inhibitory inputs that are under eCB‐mediated presynaptic modulation, suggesting that the synapse type‐selective action of eCBs in the cerebellar neural circuitry allows the precise control of motor coordination and learning associated with the cerebellum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Endocannabinoids (eCBs) act as ubiquitous modulators of synaptic transmission via the activation of cannabinoid receptors (CBRs). Cerebellar Purkinje cells (PCs) make strong inhibitory synaptic contacts not only with neurons in the deep cerebellar nuclei (DCN) but also with Lugaro cells and globular cells, whose cell bodies are located underneath the PC layer. However, little is known about the modulatory actions of eCBs on GABA release from PC axon terminals. Here, we examined the effects of eCBs on the GABAergic transmission at PC‐globular cell synapses and PC‐large DCN neuron synapses electrophysiologically using mouse cerebellar slices. We showed that the types 1 and 2 CBR agonist WIN55212 did not affect either spontaneous or miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) in globular cells under control conditions and in a state of enhanced synaptic activity. By contrast, another G&lt;sub&gt;i/o&lt;/sub&gt; protein‐coupled receptor agonist, baclofen, significantly reduced the miniature IPSC frequency in globular cells. WIN55212 had no effects on IPSCs in large DCN neurons. A type 2 CBR agonist, HU308, also had no effects on IPSCs in either globular cells or large DCN neurons. Moreover, the PCs' target neurons did not elicit depolarization‐induced suppression of inhibition. These results suggest the lack of a functional role of CBRs at PCs' axon terminals. This is in sharp contrast to the fact that PCs receive abundant excitatory and inhibitory inputs that are under eCB‐mediated presynaptic inhibitory modulation. The actions of eCBs are selective to distinct synapses and possibly contribute to information processes and rigorous signal transmission in the cerebellum.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

&lt;p&gt;We find that the levels of the m6A methylase Mettl3 are upregulated following spinal cord injury (SCI) in both zebrafish and mice. Additionally, Mettl3 disruption leads to poor motor function recovery in zebrafish SCI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RNA methylation is involved in multiple physiological and pathological processes. However, the role of RNA methylation in spinal cord regeneration has not been reported. In this study, we find an altered m6A (N6‐methyladenosine) RNA methylation profiling following zebrafish spinal cord injury (SCI), in line with an altered transcription level of the m6A methylase Mettl3. Interestingly, many of the differential m6A‐tagged genes associated with neural regeneration are hypomethylated, but their transcription levels are upregulated in SCI. Moreover, we find that METTL3 may be important for spinal cord regeneration. We also show a conserved feature of METTL3 changes in mouse SCI model, in which the expression of METTL3 is increased in both astrocytes and neural stem cells. Together, our results indicate that m6A RNA methylation is dynamic and conserved following SCI and may contribute to spinal cord regeneration.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2012.01409</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;It has been demonstrated that cellular automata had the highest computational
capacity at the edge of chaos, the parameter at which their behavior
transitioned from ordered to chaotic. This same concept has been applied to
reservoir computers; a number of researchers have stated that the highest
computational capacity for a reservoir computer is at the edge of chaos,
although others have suggested that this rule is not universally true. Because
many reservoir computers do not show chaotic behavior but merely become
unstable, it is felt that a more accurate term for this instability transition
is the &quot;edge of stability&quot;Here I find two examples where the computational
capacity of a reservoir computer decreases as the edge of stability is
approached; in one case, because generalized synchronization breaks down, and
in the other case because the reservoir computer is a poor match to the problem
being solved. The edge of stability as an optimal operating point for a
reservoir computer is not in general true, although it may be true in some
cases.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Can neural networks learn goal-directed behaviour using similar strategies to
the brain, by combining the relationships between the current state of the
organism and the consequences of future actions? Recent work has shown that
recurrent neural networks trained on goal based tasks can develop
representations resembling those found in the brain, entorhinal cortex grid
cells, for instance. Here we explore the evolution of the dynamics of their
internal representations and compare this with experimental data. We observe
that once a recurrent network is trained to learn the structure of its
environment solely based on sensory prediction, an attractor based landscape
forms in the network's representation, which parallels hippocampal place cells
in structure and function. Next, we extend the predictive objective to include
Q-learning for a reward task, where rewarding actions are dependent on delayed
cue modulation. Mirroring experimental findings in hippocampus recordings in
rodents performing the same task, this training paradigm causes nonlocal neural
activity to sweep forward in space at decision points, anticipating the future
path to a rewarded location. Moreover, prevalent choice and cue-selective
neurons form in this network, again recapitulating experimental findings.
Together, these results indicate that combining predictive, unsupervised
learning of the structure of an environment with reinforcement learning can
help understand the formation of hippocampus-like representations containing
both spatial and task-relevant information.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;By studying the underlying policies of decision-making agents, we can learn
about their shortcomings and potentially improve them. Traditionally, this has
been done either by examining the agent's implementation, its behaviour while
it is being executed, its performance with a reward/fitness function or by
visualizing the density of states the agent visits. However, these methods fail
to describe the policy's behaviour in complex, high-dimensional environments or
do not scale to thousands of policies, which is required when studying training
algorithms. We propose policy supervectors for characterizing agents by the
distribution of states they visit, adopting successful techniques from the area
of speech technology. Policy supervectors can characterize policies regardless
of their design philosophy (e.g. rule-based vs. neural networks) and scale to
thousands of policies on a single workstation machine. We demonstrate method's
applicability by studying the evolution of policies during reinforcement
learning, evolutionary training and imitation learning, providing insight on
e.g. how the search space of evolutionary algorithms is also reflected in
agent's behaviour, not just in the parameters.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In this paper, we explore a process called neural teleportation, a
mathematical consequence of applying quiver representation theory to neural
networks. Neural teleportation &quot;teleports&quot; a network to a new position in the
weight space, while leaving its function unchanged. This concept generalizes
the notion of positive scale invariance of ReLU networks to any network with
any activation functions and any architecture. In this paper, we shed light on
surprising and counter-intuitive consequences neural teleportation has on the
loss landscape. In particular, we show that teleportation can be used to
explore loss level curves, that it changes the loss landscape, sharpens global
minima and boosts back-propagated gradients. From these observations, we
demonstrate that teleportation accelerates training when used during
initialization regardless of the model, its activation function, the loss
function, and the training data. Our results can be reproduced with the code

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2012.01074</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Objective: To evaluate the impact on Electroencephalography (EEG)
classification of different kinds of attention mechanisms in Deep Learning (DL)
models. Methods: We compared three attention-enhanced DL models, the brand-new
InstaGATs, an LSTM with attention and a CNN with attention. We used these
models to classify normal and abnormal (i.e., artifactual or pathological) EEG
patterns. Results: We achieved the state of the art in all classification
problems, regardless the large variability of the datasets and the simple
architecture of the attention-enhanced models. We could also prove that,
depending on how the attention mechanism is applied and where the attention
layer is located in the model, we can alternatively leverage the information
contained in the time, frequency or space domain of the dataset. Conclusions:
with this work, we shed light over the role of different attention mechanisms
in the classification of normal and abnormal EEG patterns. Moreover, we
discussed how they can exploit the intrinsic relationships in the temporal,
frequency and spatial domains of our brain activity. Significance: Attention
represents a promising strategy to evaluate the quality of the EEG information,
and its relevance, in different real-world scenarios. Moreover, it can make it
easier to parallelize the computation and, thus, to speed up the analysis of
big electrophysiological (e.g., EEG) datasets.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Assessing the empirical performance of Multi-Objective Evolutionary
Algorithms (MOEAs) is vital when we extensively test a set of MOEAs and aim to
determine a proper ranking thereof. Multiple performance indicators, e.g., the
generational distance and the hypervolume, are frequently applied when
reporting the experimental data, where typically the data on each indicator is
analyzed independently from other indicators. Such a treatment brings
conceptual difficulties in aggregating the result on all performance
indicators, and it might fail to discover significant differences among
algorithms if the marginal distributions of the performance indicator overlap.
Therefore, in this paper, we propose to conduct a multivariate
$\mathcal{E}$-test on the joint empirical distribution of performance
indicators to detect the potential difference in the data, followed by a
post-hoc procedure that utilizes the linear discriminative analysis to
determine the superiority between algorithms. This performance analysis's
effectiveness is supported by an experimentation conducted on four algorithms,
16 problems, and 6 different numbers of objectives.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Optimization aims at selecting a feasible set of parameters in an attempt to
solve a particular problem, being applied in a wide range of applications, such

among others. Nevertheless, traditional iterative optimization methods use the
evaluation of gradients and Hessians to find their solutions, not being
practical due to their computational burden and when working with non-convex
functions. Recent biological-inspired methods, known as meta-heuristics, have
arisen in an attempt to fulfill these problems. Even though they do not
guarantee to find optimal solutions, they usually find a suitable solution. In
this paper, we proposed a Python-based meta-heuristic optimization framework
denoted as Opytimizer. Several methods and classes are implemented to provide a

	<title>arXiv: Computer Science: Neural and Evolutionary Computing: Morphological Network: How Far Can We Go with Morphological Neurons?. (arXiv:1901.00109v3 [cs.LG] UPDATED)</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1901.00109</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In recent years, the idea of using morphological operations as networks has
received much attention. Mathematical morphology provides very efficient and
useful image processing and image analysis tools based on basic operators like
dilation and erosion, defined in terms of kernels. Many other morphological
operations are built up using the dilation and erosion operations. Although the
learning of structuring elements such as dilation or erosion using the
backpropagation algorithm is not new, the order and the way these morphological
operations are used is not standard. In this paper, we have theoretically
analyzed the use of morphological operations for processing 1D feature vectors
and shown that this gets extended to the 2D case in a simple manner. Our
theoretical results show that a morphological block represents a sum of hinge
functions. Hinge functions are used in many places for classification and
regression tasks (Breiman (1993)). We have also proved a universal
approximation theorem -- a stack of two morphological blocks can approximate
any continuous function over arbitrary compact sets. To experimentally validate
the efficacy of this network in real-life applications, we have evaluated its
performance on satellite image classification datasets since morphological
operations are very sensitive to geometrical shapes and structures. We have
also shown results on a few tasks like segmentation of blood vessels from
fundus images, segmentation of lungs from chest x-ray and image dehazing. The
results are encouraging and further establishes the potential of morphological
networks.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Electroencephalographic (EEG) Burst Suppression (BSUPP) is a discontinuous pattern characterized by episodes of low voltage disrupted by bursts of cortical synaptic activity. It can occur while delivering high-dose anesthesia. Current research suggests an association between BSUPP and the occurrence of postoperative delirium in the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) and beyond. We investigated burst micro-architecture to further understand how age influences the neurophysiology of this pharmacologically-induced state. We analyzed a subset of EEG recordings (n = 102) taken from a larger data set previously published. We selected the initial burst that followed a visually identified “silent second,” i.e., at least 1 s of iso-electricity of the EEG during propofol induction. We derived the (normalized) power spectral density [(n)PSD], the alpha band power, the maximum amplitude, the maximum slope of the EEG as well as the permutation entropy (PeEn) for the first 1.5 s of the initial burst of each patient. In the old patients &amp;gt;65 years, we observed significantly lower (p &amp;lt; 0.001) EEG power in the 1–15 Hz range. In general, their EEG contained a significantly higher amount of faster oscillations (&amp;gt;15 Hz). Alpha band power (p &amp;lt; 0.001), EEG amplitude (p = 0.001), and maximum EEG slope (p = 0.045) all significantly decreased with age, whereas PeEn increased (p = 0.008). Hence, we can describe an age-related change in features during EEG burst suppression. Sub-group analysis revealed no change in results based on pre-medication. These EEG changes add knowledge to the impact of age on cortical synaptic activity. In addition to a reduction in EEG amplitude, age-associated burst features can complicate the identification of excessive anesthetic administration in patients under general anesthesia. Knowledge of these neurophysiologic changes may not only improve anesthesia care through improved detection of burst suppression but might also provide insight into changes in neuronal network organization in patients at risk for age-related neurocognitive problems.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Synaptic Neuroscience: The α5 Nicotinic Acetylcholine Receptor Subunit Differentially Modulates α4β2* and α3β4* Receptors</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsyn.2020.607959</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Nicotine, the principal reinforcing compound in tobacco, acts in the brain by activating neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs). This review summarizes our current knowledge regarding how the α5 accessory nAChR subunit, encoded by the CHRNA5 gene, differentially modulates α4β2&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; and α3β4&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; receptors at the cellular level. Genome-wide association studies have linked a gene cluster in chromosomal region 15q25 to increased susceptibility to nicotine addiction, lung cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and peripheral arterial disease. Interestingly, this gene cluster contains a non-synonymous single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the human CHRNA5 gene, causing an aspartic acid (D) to asparagine (N) substitution at amino acid position 398 in the α5 nAChR subunit. Although other SNPs have been associated with tobacco smoking behavior, efforts have focused predominantly on the D398 and N398 variants in the α5 subunit. In recent years, significant progress has been made toward understanding the role that the α5 nAChR subunit—and the role of the D398 and N398 variants—plays on nAChR function at the cellular level. These insights stem primarily from a wide range of experimental models, including receptors expressed heterologously in Xenopus oocytes, various cell lines, and neurons derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), as well as endogenous receptors in genetically engineered mice and—more recently—rats. Despite providing a wealth of available data, however, these studies have yielded conflicting results, and our understanding of the modulatory role that the α5 subunit plays remains incomplete. Here, we review these reports and the various techniques used for expression and analysis in order to examine how the α5 subunit modulates key functions in α4β2&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; and α3β4&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; receptors, including receptor trafficking, sensitivity, efficacy, and desensitization. In addition, we highlight the strikingly different role that the α5 subunit plays in Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; signaling between α4β2&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; and α3β4&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; receptors, and we discuss whether the N398 α5 subunit variant can partially replace the D398 variant.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Synaptic Neuroscience: Transient Enhanced GluA2 Expression in Young Hippocampal Neurons of a Fragile X Mouse Model</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsyn.2020.588295</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;AMPA-type glutamate receptors (AMPARs) are tetrameric ligand-gated channels made up of combinations of GluA1-4 subunits and play important roles in synaptic transmission and plasticity. Here, we have investigated the development of AMPAR-mediated synaptic transmission in the hippocampus of the Fmr1 knock-out (KO) mouse, a widely used model of Fragile X syndrome (FXS). FXS is the leading monogenic cause of intellectual disability and autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and it is considered a neurodevelopmental disorder. For that reason, we investigated synaptic properties and dendritic development in animals from an early stage when synapses are starting to form up to adulthood. We found that hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons in the Fmr1-KO mouse exhibit a higher AMPAR-NMDAR ratio early in development but reverses to normal values after P13. This increase was accompanied by a larger presence of the GluA2-subunit in synaptic AMPARs that will lead to altered Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; permeability of AMPARs that could have a profound impact upon neural circuits, learning, and diseases. Following this, we found that young KO animals lack Long-term potentiation (LTP), a well-understood model of synaptic plasticity necessary for proper development of circuits, and exhibit an increased frequency of spontaneous miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents, a measure of synaptic density. Furthermore, post hoc morphological analysis of recorded neurons revealed altered dendritic branching in the KO group. Interestingly, all these anomalies are transitory and revert to normal values in older animals. Our data suggest that loss of FMRP during early development leads to temporary upregulation of the GluA2 subunit and this impacts synaptic plasticity and altering morphological dendritic branching.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: The Neuromuscular Junction in Health and Disease: Molecular Mechanisms Governing Synaptic Formation and Homeostasis</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2020.610964</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The neuromuscular junction (NMJ) is a highly specialized synapse between a motor neuron nerve terminal and its muscle fiber that are responsible for converting electrical impulses generated by the motor neuron into electrical activity in the muscle fibers. On arrival of the motor nerve action potential, calcium enters the presynaptic terminal, which leads to the release of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine (ACh). ACh crosses the synaptic gap and binds to ACh receptors (AChRs) tightly clustered on the surface of the muscle fiber; this leads to the endplate potential which initiates the muscle action potential that results in muscle contraction. This is a simplified version of the events in neuromuscular transmission that take place within milliseconds, and are dependent on a tiny but highly structured NMJ. Much of this review is devoted to describing in more detail the development, maturation, maintenance and regeneration of the NMJ, but first we describe briefly the most important molecules involved and the conditions that affect their numbers and function. Most important clinically worldwide, are myasthenia gravis (MG), the Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS) and congenital myasthenic syndromes (CMS), each of which causes specific molecular defects. In addition, we mention the neurotoxins from bacteria, snakes and many other species that interfere with neuromuscular transmission and cause potentially fatal diseases, but have also provided useful probes for investigating neuromuscular transmission. There are also changes in NMJ structure and function in motor neuron disease, spinal muscle atrophy and sarcopenia that are likely to be secondary but might provide treatment targets. The NMJ is one of the best studied and most disease-prone synapses in the nervous system and it is amenable to in vivo and ex vivo investigation and to systemic therapies that can help restore normal function.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: New Insights Into Drug Discovery Targeting Tau Protein</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2020.590896</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Microtubule-associated protein tau is characterized by the fact that it is an intrinsically disordered protein due to its lack of a stable conformation and high flexibility. Intracellular inclusions of fibrillar forms of tau with a β-sheet structure accumulate in the brain of patients with Alzheimer's disease and other tauopathies. Accordingly, detachment of tau from microtubules and transition of tau from a disordered state to an abnormally aggregated state are essential events preceding the onset of tau-related diseases. Many reports have shown that this transition is caused by post-translational modifications, including hyperphosphorylation and acetylation. The misfolded tau is self-assembled and forms a tau oligomer before the appearance of tau inclusions. Animal and pathological studies using human samples have demonstrated that tau oligomer formation contributes to neuronal loss. During the progression of tauopathies, tau seeds are released from cells and incorporated into other cells, leading to the propagation of pathological tau aggregation. Accumulating evidence suggests several potential approaches for blocking tau-mediated toxicity: (1) direct inhibition of pathological tau aggregation and (2) inhibition of tau post-translational modifications that occur prior to pathological tau aggregation, (3) inhibition of tau propagation and (4) stabilization of microtubules. In addition to traditional low-molecular-weight compounds, newer drug discovery approaches such as the development of medium-molecular-weight drugs (peptide- or oligonucleotide-based drugs) and high-molecular-weight drugs (antibody-based drugs) provide alternative pathways to preventing the formation of abnormal tau. Of particular interest are recent studies suggesting that tau droplet formation by liquid-liquid phase separation may be the initial step in aberrant tau aggregation, as well results that implicate roles for tau in dendritic and nuclear functions. Here, we review the mechanisms through which drugs can target tau and consider recent clinical trials for the treatment of tauopathies. In addition, we discuss the utility of these newer strategies and propose future directions for research on tau-targeted therapeutics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Neurogenetic and Neuroepigenetic Mechanisms in Cognitive Health and Disease</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2020.589109</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Over the last two decades, the explosion of experimental, computational, and high-throughput technologies has led to critical insights into how the brain functions in health and disease. It has become increasingly clear that the vast majority of brain activities result from the complex entanglement of genetic factors, epigenetic changes, and environmental stimuli, which, when altered, can lead to neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric disorders. Nevertheless, a complete understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying neuronal activities and higher-order cognitive processes continues to elude neuroscientists. Here, we provide a concise overview of how the interaction between the environment and genetic as well as epigenetic mechanisms shapes complex neuronal processes such as learning, memory, and synaptic plasticity. We then consider how this interaction contributes to the development of neurodegenerative and psychiatric disorders, and how it can be modeled to predict phenotypic variability and disease risk. Finally, we outline new frontiers in neurogenetic and neuroepigenetic research and highlight the challenges these fields will face in their quest to decipher the molecular mechanisms governing brain functioning.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neural Technology: Reduced Information Transmission of Medial Prefrontal Cortex to Basolateral Amygdala Inhibits Exploratory Behavior in Depressed Rats</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.608587</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Depression is a mental and neurological disease that reduces the desire for exploration. Dysregulation of the information transmission between medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and basolateral amygdala (BLA) is associated with depression. However, which direction of information transmission (mPFC-BLA or BLA-mPFC) related to the decline of exploratory interests in depression is unclear. Therefore, it is important to determine what specific changes occur in mPFC and BLA information transmission in depressed rats during exploratory behavior. In the present study, local field potentials (LFPs) were recorded via multi-electrodes implanted in the mPFC and BLA for the control and depression groups of rats when they were exploring in an open field. The theta band was determined to be the characteristic band of exploratory behavior. The direct transfer function (DTF) was used to calculate the mPFC and BLA bidirectional information flow (IF) to measure information transmission. Compared with the control group, the theta IF of mPFC-BLA in the depression group was significantly reduced, and there was no significant difference in theta IF of BLA-mPFC between the two groups. Our results indicated that the reduction of mPFC-BLA information transmission can inhibit the exploratory behavior of depressed rats.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Dopaminergic System Alteration in Anxiety and Compulsive Disorders: A Systematic Review of Neuroimaging Studies</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.608520</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Objective: The dopaminergic system is involved in many psychiatric disorders as a GABAergic, serotonergic, and glutamatergic system. A systematic review and meta-analysis was performed to elucidate the alteration of the dopaminergic system in anxiety and compulsive disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: The databases of Pubmed, Embase, and ScienceDirect were searched and articles reporting the involvement of the dopaminergic system in patients with anxiety disorder and obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) were recognized. The key research data were extracted from the included articles and standardized mean differences were calculated using meta-analyses if there were more than two studies with obtainable data. Sensitivity analyses were further performed to detect the stability of results, and the qualities of all the included studies were assessed using the Newcastle Ottawa scale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Finally, we identified 8 and 11 studies associated with anxiety disorder and OCD for further analysis, respectively. Most consistently, the striatal dopamine D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; receptor (D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;R) of OCD patients had decreased while no significant correlation was found between striatal D2R and disease severity. The striatal dopamine transporter (DAT) had not been significantly altered in both the anxiety disorder and OCD patients. The heterogeneity values from the meta-analyses were extremely high while those results remained stable after sensitivity analyses. Inconsistent data were found in the striatal D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;R of patients with anxiety disorder. Limited data had suggested that dopamine synthesis increased in most regions of the cerebral cortex and cerebellum in OCD patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: The most convincing finding was that the D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; receptor decreased in patients with obsessive compulsive disorder. The dopamine transporter may have no relationship with anxiety and compulsive disorder.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Altered Gray Matter Volume and Functional Connectivity in Human Immunodeficiency Virus-Infected Adults</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.601063</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;People living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) (PLWH) are at high risk of neurocognitive impairment. The pathogenesis of neurocognitive impairment remains unclear, and there is still no diagnostic biomarker. By coupling three-dimensional T1-weighted imaging and resting-state functional imaging, we explored structural and functional alterations in PLWH and examined whether such imaging alterations had the potential to denote neurocognitive function. A total of 98 PLWH and 47 seronegative controls aged 20–53 years were recruited. Structural alterations were first explored between HIV-negative controls and PLWH. Subsequently, brain regions showing gray matter alterations were used as seeds for separate whole-brain functional connectivity (FC) analysis. Finally, the relationships between imaging alterations and cognitive function were explored. PLWH suffered from thalamus, occipital lobe, and hippocampus/parahippocampus atrophy. Visual cortices in PLWH showed decreased anticorrelation with the posterior cingulate cortex and left angular gyrus of the default mode network. FC within the visual cortices (between the left calcarine and right calcarine) and in the thalamic prefrontal circuit and between the thalamus and somatosensory association cortex were also altered. In addition, FC between the left thalamus and right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in the cognitively impaired group was significantly different from that in the cognitively normal group in PLWH. Partial correlation analysis uncorrected for multiple comparisons suggested that some imaging alterations can be associated with neurocognition. Our study supports the presence of brain atrophy and functional reconfiguration in PLWH. Imaging alterations can be associated with neurocognitive function. We hold that neuroimaging is a promising approach in evaluating PLWH and might have the potential to clarify the pathogenesis of HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Dynamic Changes in the Gut Microbiome at the Acute Stage of Ischemic Stroke in a Pig Model</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.587986</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Stroke is a major cause of death and long-term disability affecting seven million adults in the United States each year. Recently, it has been demonstrated that neurological diseases, associated pathology, and susceptibility changes correlated with changes in the gut microbiota. However, changes in the microbial community in stroke has not been well characterized. The acute stage of stroke is a critical period for assessing injury severity, therapeutic intervention, and clinical prognosis. We investigated the changes in the gut microbiota composition and diversity using a middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion ischemic stroke pig model. Ischemic stroke was induced by cauterization of the MCA in pigs. Blood samples were collected prestroke and 4 h, 12 h, 1 day, and 5 days poststroke to evaluate circulating proinflammatory cytokines. Fecal samples were collected prestroke and 1, 3, and 5 days poststroke to assess gut microbiome changes. Results showed elevated systemic inflammation with increased plasma levels of tumor necrosis factor alpha at 4 h and interleukin-6 at 12 h poststroke, relative to prestroke. Microbial diversity and evenness were reduced at 1 day poststroke compared to prestroke. Microbial diversity at 3 days poststroke was negatively correlated with lesion volume. Moreover, beta-diversity analysis revealed trending overall differences over time, with the most significant changes in microbial patterns observed between prestroke and 3 days poststroke. Abundance of the Proteobacteria was significantly increased, while Firmicutes decreased at 3 days poststroke, compared to prestroke populations. Abundance of the lactic acid bacteria Lactobacillus was reduced at 3 days poststroke. By day 5, the microbial pattern returned to similar values as prestroke, suggesting the plasticity of gut microbiome in an acute period of stroke in a pig model. These findings provide a basis for characterizing gut microbial changes during the acute stage of stroke, which can be used to assess stroke pathology and the potential development of therapeutic targets.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neural Technology: Physiological Synchrony in EEG, Electrodermal Activity and Heart Rate Detects Attentionally Relevant Events in Time</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.575521</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Interpersonal physiological synchrony (PS), or the similarity of physiological signals between individuals over time, may be used to detect attentionally engaging moments in time. We here investigated whether PS in the electroencephalogram (EEG), electrodermal activity (EDA), heart rate and a multimodal metric signals the occurrence of attentionally relevant events in time in two groups of participants. Both groups were presented with the same auditory stimulus, but were instructed to attend either to the narrative of an audiobook (audiobook-attending: AA group) or to interspersed emotional sounds and beeps (stimulus-attending: SA group). We hypothesized that emotional sounds could be detected in both groups as they are expected to draw attention involuntarily, in a bottom-up fashion. Indeed, we found this to be the case for PS in EDA or the multimodal metric. Beeps, that are expected to be only relevant due to specific “top-down” attentional instructions, could indeed only be detected using PS among SA participants, for EDA, EEG and the multimodal metric. We further hypothesized that moments in the audiobook accompanied by high PS in either EEG, EDA, heart rate or the multimodal metric for AA participants would be rated as more engaging by an independent group of participants compared to moments corresponding to low PS. This hypothesis was not supported. Our results show that PS can support the detection of attentionally engaging events over time. Currently, the relation between PS and engagement is only established for well-defined, interspersed stimuli, whereas the relation between PS and a more abstract self-reported metric of engagement over time has not been established. As the relation between PS and engagement is dependent on event type and physiological measure, we suggest to choose a measure matching with the stimulus of interest. When the stimulus type is unknown, a multimodal metric is most robust.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.562581</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In humans, a considerable number of the autopsy samples of cognitively normal individuals aged between 57 and 102 years have revealed the presence of amyloid plaques, one of the typical signs of AD, indicating that many of us use mechanisms that defend ourselves from the toxic consequences of Aß. The human APP NL/F (hAPP NL/F) knockin mouse appears as the ideal mouse model to identify these mechanisms, since they have high Aß42 levels at an early age and moderate signs of disease when old. Here we show that in these mice, the brain levels of the hemoprotein Neuroglobin (Ngb) increase with age, in parallel with the increase in Aß42. In vitro, in wild type neurons, exogenous Aß increases the expression of Ngb and Ngb over-expression prevents Aß toxicity. In vivo, in old hAPP NL/F mice, Ngb knockdown leads to dendritic tree simplification, an early sign of Alzheimer’s disease. These results could indicate that Alzheimer’s symptoms may start developing at the time when defense mechanisms start wearing out. In agreement, analysis of plasma Ngb levels in aged individuals revealed decreased levels in those whose cognitive abilities worsened during a 5-year longitudinal follow-up period.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neural Technology: Amplitude of fNIRS Resting-State Global Signal Is Related to EEG Vigilance Measures: A Simultaneous fNIRS and EEG Study</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.560878</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Recently, functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) has been utilized to image the hemodynamic activities and connectivity in the human brain. With the advantage of economic efficiency, portability, and fewer physical constraints, fNIRS enables studying of the human brain at versatile environment and various body positions, including at bed side and during exercise, which complements the use of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). However, like fMRI, fNIRS imaging can be influenced by the presence of a strong global component. Yet, the nature of the global signal in fNIRS has not been established. In this study, we investigated the relationship between fNIRS global signal and electroencephalogram (EEG) vigilance using simultaneous recordings in resting healthy subjects in high-density and whole-head montage. In Experiment 1, data were acquired at supine, sitting, and standing positions. Results found that the factor of body positions significantly affected the amplitude of the resting-state fNIRS global signal, prominently in the frequency range of 0.05–0.1 Hz but not in the very low frequency range of less than 0.05 Hz. As a control, the task-induced fNIRS or EEG responses to auditory stimuli did not differ across body positions. However, EEG vigilance plays a modulatory role in the fNIRS signals in the frequency range of less than 0.05 Hz: resting-state sessions of low EEG vigilance measures are associated with high amplitudes of fNIRS global signals. Moreover, in Experiment 2, we further examined the epoch-to-epoch fluctuations in concurrent fNIRS and EEG data acquired from a separate group of subjects and found a negative temporal correlation between EEG vigilance measures and fNIRS global signal amplitudes. Our study for the first time revealed that vigilance as a neurophysiological factor modulates the resting-state dynamics of fNIRS, which have important implications for understanding and processing the noises in fNIRS signals.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroinformatics: A Spelling Paradigm With an Added Red Dot Improved the P300 Speller System Performance</title>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The traditional P300 speller system uses the flashing row or column spelling paradigm. However, the classification accuracy and information transfer rate of the P300 speller are not adequate for real-world application. To improve the performance of the P300 speller, we devised a new spelling paradigm in which the flashing row or column of a virtual character matrix is covered by a translucent green circle with a red dot in either the upper or lower half (GC-RD spelling paradigm). We compared the event-related potential (ERP) waveforms with a control paradigm (GC spelling paradigm), in which the flashing row or column of a virtual character matrix was covered by a translucent green circle only. Our experimental results showed that the amplitude of P3a at the parietal area and P3b at the frontal–central–parietal areas evoked by the GC-RD paradigm were significantly greater than those induced by the GC paradigm. Higher classification accuracy and information transmission rates were also obtained in the GC-RD system. Our results indicated that the added red dots increased attention and visuospatial information, resulting in an amplitude increase in both P3a and P3b, thereby improving the performance of the P300 speller system.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Effect of Gender on Development of Hippocampal Subregions From Childhood to Adulthood</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.611057</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The hippocampus is known to be comprised of several subfields, but the developmental trajectories of these subfields are under debate. In this study, we analyzed magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data from a cross-sectional sample (198 healthy Chinese) using an automated segmentation tool to delineate the development of the hippocampal subregions from 6 to 26 years of age. We also examined whether gender and hemispheric differences influence the development of these subregions. For the whole hippocampus, the trajectory of development was observed to be an inverse-u. A significant increase in volume with age was found for most of the subregions, except for the L/R-parasubiculum, L/R-fimbria, and L-HATA. Gender-related differences were also found in the development of most subregions, especially for the hippocampal tail, CA1, molecular layer HP, GC-DG, CA3, and CA4, which showed a consistent increase in females and an early increase followed by a decrease in males. A comparison of the average volumes showed that the right whole hippocampus was significantly larger, along with the R-presubiculum, R-hippocampal-fissure, L/R-CA1, and L/R-molecular layer HP in males in comparison to females. Additionally, the average volume of the right hemisphere was shown to be significantly larger for the hippocampal tail, CA1, molecular layer HP, GC-DG, CA3, and CA4. However, for the presubiculum, parasubiculum, and fimbria, the left side was shown to be larger. In conclusion, the hippocampal subregions appear to develop in various ways from childhood to adulthood, with both gender and hemispheric differences affecting their development.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Effector-Specific Characterization of Brain Dynamics in Manual vs. Oculomotor Go/NoGo Tasks</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.600667</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Motor inhibitory control (IC), the ability to suppress unwanted actions, has been previously shown to rely on domain-general IC processes that are involved in a wide range of IC tasks. Nevertheless, the existence of effector-specific regions and activation patterns that would differentiate manual vs. oculomotor response inhibition remains unknown. In this study, we investigated the brain dynamics supporting these two response effectors with the same IC task paradigm. We examined the behavioral performance and electrophysiological activity in a group of healthy young people (n = 25) with a Go/NoGo task using the index finger for the manual modality and the eyes for the oculomotor modality. By computing topographic analysis of variance, we found significant differences between topographies of scalp recorded potentials of the two response effectors between 250 and 325 ms post-stimulus onset. The source estimations localized this effect within the left precuneus, a part of the superior parietal lobule, showing stronger activity in the oculomotor modality than in the manual modality. Behaviorally, we found a significant positive correlation in response time between the two modalities. Our collective results revealed that while domain-general IC processes would be engaged across different response effectors in the same IC task, effector-specific activation patterns exist. In this case, the stronger activation of the left precuneus likely accounts for the increased demand for visual attentional processes in the oculomotor Go/NoGo task.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Advancing Brain-Computer Interface Applications for Severely Disabled Children Through a Multidisciplinary National Network: Summary of the Inaugural Pediatric BCI Canada Meeting</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.593883</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Thousands of youth suffering from acquired brain injury or other early-life neurological disease live, mature, and learn with only limited communication and interaction with their world. Such cognitively capable children are ideal candidates for brain-computer interfaces (BCI). While BCI systems are rapidly evolving, a fundamental gap exists between technological innovators and the patients and families who stand to benefit. Forays into translating BCI systems to children in recent years have revealed that kids can learn to operate simple BCI with proficiency akin to adults. BCI could bring significant boons to the lives of many children with severe physical impairment, supporting their complex physical and social needs. However, children have been neglected in BCI research and a collaborative BCI research community is required to unite and push pediatric BCI development forward. To this end, the pediatric BCI Canada collaborative network (BCI-CAN) was formed, under a unified goal to cooperatively drive forward pediatric BCI innovation and impact. This article reflects on the topics and discussions raised in the foundational BCI-CAN meeting held in Toronto, ON, Canada in November 2019 and suggests the next steps required to see BCI impact the lives of children with severe neurological disease and their families.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Individual Differences in Brain Responses: New Opportunities for Tailoring Health Communication Campaigns</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.565973</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Prevention neuroscience investigates the brain basis of attitude and behavior change. Over the years, an increasingly structurally and functionally resolved “persuasion network” has emerged. However, current studies have only identified a small handful of neural structures that are commonly recruited during persuasive message processing, and the extent to which these (and other) structures are sensitive to numerous individual difference factors remains largely unknown. In this project we apply a multi-dimensional similarity-based individual differences analysis to explore which individual factors—including characteristics of messages and target audiences—drive patterns of brain activity to be more or less similar across individuals encountering the same anti-drug public service announcements (PSAs). We demonstrate that several ensembles of brain regions show response patterns that are driven by a variety of unique factors. These results are discussed in terms of their implications for neural models of persuasion, prevention neuroscience and message tailoring, and methodological implications for future research.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Prefrontal Cortex and Amygdala Subregion Morphology Are Associated With Obesity and Dietary Self-control in Children and Adolescents</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.563415</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A prefrontal control system that is less mature than the limbic reward system in adolescence is thought to impede self-regulatory abilities, which could contribute to poor dietary choices and obesity. We, therefore, aimed to examine whether structural morphology of the prefrontal cortex (PFC; involved in cognitive control) and the amygdala (a key brain region for reward-related processing) are associated with dietary decisions and obesity in children and adolescents. Seventy-one individuals between the ages of 8–22 years (17.35 ± 4.76 years, 51% female, 56% were overweight or obese) participated in this study; each participant completed a computer-based food choice task and a T1- and T2-weighted structural brain scans. Two indices of obesity were assessed, including age- and sex-specific body mass index (BMIz) and waist-to-height ratio (WHtR). The behavioral task included rating 60 food stimuli for tastiness, healthiness, and liking. Based on each participant’s self-ratings, 100 binary food choices were then made utilizing a computer mouse. Dietary “self-control” was calculated as the proportion of trials where the individual chose the healthier food item (vs. the tastier food item) over the total number of trials. Cortical thickness and amygdala subnuclei volumes were quantified using FreeSurfer 6.0 and CIT168 atlas, respectively. We found that WHtR was negatively associated with the thickness of bilateral superior frontal, left superior temporal, right insula, and right inferior temporal regions (p &amp;lt; 0.05, corrected for multiple comparisons). We also found WHtR to be positively associated with the volume of the central nucleus (CEN) region of the amygdala (p = 0.006), after adjusting for the hemisphere, age, sex, and intracranial volumes. A similar data pattern was observed when BMIz was used. Moreover, we found that across all participants, thinner right superior frontal cortex and larger left CEN volumes predicted lower dietary self-control. These results suggest that differential development of the PFC and amygdala relate to obesity and dietary self-control. Further longitudinal studies are merited to determine causal relationships among altered PFC to amygdala neural circuitry, dietary self-control, and obesity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Challenges in Modeling Human Neural Circuit Formation via Brain Organoid Technology</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.607399</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Human brain organoids are three-dimensional self-organizing tissues induced from pluripotent cells that recapitulate some aspects of early development and some of the early structure of the human brain in vitro. Brain organoids consist of neural lineage cells, such as neural stem/precursor cells, neurons, astrocytes and oligodendrocytes. Additionally, brain organoids contain fluid-filled ventricle-like structures surrounded by a ventricular/subventricular (VZ/SVZ) zone-like layer of neural stem cells (NSCs). These NSCs give rise to neurons, which form multiple outer layers. Since these structures resemble some aspects of structural arrangements in the developing human brain, organoid technology has attracted great interest in the research fields of human brain development and disease modeling. Developmental brain disorders have been intensely studied through the use of human brain organoids. Relatively early steps in human brain development, such as differentiation and migration, have also been studied. However, research on neural circuit formation with brain organoids has just recently began. In this review, we summarize the current challenges in studying neural circuit formation with organoids and discuss future perspectives.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Monitoring Astrocytic Ca2+ Activity in Freely Behaving Mice</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.603095</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Monitoring astrocytic Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; activity is essential to understand the physiological and pathological roles of astrocytes in the brain. However, previous commonly used methods for studying astrocytic Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; activities can be applied in only anesthetized or head-fixed animals, which significantly affects in vivo astrocytic Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; dynamics. In the current study, we combined optic fiber recordings with genetically encoded Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; indicators (GECIs) to monitor astrocytic activity in freely behaving mice. This approach enabled selective and reliable measurement of astrocytic Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; activity, which was verified by the astrocyte-specific labeling of GECIs and few movement artifacts. Additionally, astrocytic Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; activities induced by locomotion or footshock were stably recorded in the cortices and hippocampi of freely behaving mice. Furthermore, this method allowed for the longitudinal study of astrocytic activities over several weeks. This work provides a powerful approach to record astrocytic activity selectively, stably, and chronically in freely behaving mice.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Sevoflurane Exposure Induces Neuronal Cell Parthanatos Initiated by DNA Damage in the Developing Brain via an Increase of Intracellular Reactive Oxygen Species</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.583782</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The safety of volatile anesthetics in infants and young children has been drawing increasing concern due to its potential neurotoxicity in the developing brain. Neuronal death is considered a major factor associated with developmental neurotoxicity after exposure to volatile anesthetics sevoflurane, but its mechanism remains elusive. Parthanatos, a new type of programmed cell death, resulting from poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP-1) hyperactivation in response to DNA damage, was found to account for the pathogenesis of multiple neurological disorders. However, the role of Parthanatos in sevoflurane-induced neonatal neuronal cell death has not been investigated. To test it, neuronal cells treated with 2, 4, and 8% sevoflurane for 6, 12, and 24 h and postnatal day 7 rats exposed to 2.5% sevoflurane for 6 h were used in the present study. Our results found sevoflurane exposure induced neuronal cell death, which was accompanied by PARP-1 hyperactivation, cytoplasmic polymerized ADP-ribose (PAR) accumulation, mitochondrial depolarization, and apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) nuclear translocation in the neuronal cells and hippocampi of rats. Pharmacological or genetic inhibition of PAPR-1 significantly alleviated sevoflurane-induced neuronal cell death and accumulation of PAR polymer and AIF nuclear translocation, which were consistent with the features of Parthanatos. We observed in vitro and in vivo that sevoflurane exposure resulted in DNA damage, given that 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) and phosphorylation of histone variant H2AX (γH2AX) were improved. Moreover, we detected that sevoflurane exposure was associated with an overproduction of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS). Inhibition of ROS with antioxidant NAC markedly alleviated DNA damage caused by sevoflurane, indicating that ROS participated in the regulation of sevoflurane-induced DNA damage. Additionally, sevoflurane exposure resulted in upregulation of Parthanatos-related proteins and neuronal cell death, which were significantly attenuated by pretreatment with NAC. Therefore, these results suggest that sevoflurane exposure induces neuronal cell Parthanatos initiated by DNA damage in the developing brain via the increase of intracellular ROS.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Astrocytic Sonic Hedgehog Alleviates Intracerebral Hemorrhagic Brain Injury via Modulation of Blood-Brain Barrier Integrity</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.575690</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Background: Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is a fatal subtype of stroke that lacks effective therapy. Blood-brain barrier (BBB) damage is a hallmark of ICH-induced brain injury that leads to edema formation, leukocytes infiltration, influx of blood components into the perihematomal (PHE) region, and eventually brain injury. Astrocytes are essential for the formation and maintenance of the BBB by providing secreted molecules that contribute to the association between these cells. Sonic hedgehog (SHH) derived from astrocytes promotes the maturity and integrity of the BBB by upregulating tight junctions (TJs) in brain capillary endothelial cells (ECs). However, the effect of SHH on BBB in ICH has not been investigated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Cyclopamine (CYC) is a potent, selective inhibitor that specifically blocks the SHH signaling pathway. Here, we used pharmacological inhibitions (CYC and its derivatives) to determine a critical role of the SHH signaling pathway in promoting BBB integrity after ICH by mechanisms of regulating the TJ proteins in vivo and in vitro.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: The expression of astrocytic SHH was upregulated in mouse brains after ICH. Compared with the vehicle-treated group, inhibition of the SHH signaling pathway with CYC and its derivatives treatments aggravated neurological function deficits, brain edema, hematoma volume, and BBB impairment by downregulating TJs in ECs through the SHH-Gli-1 axis in vivo and in vitro.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: SHH signaling pathway at the level of the BBB provides a barrier-promoting effect, suggesting that the SHH signaling pathway may function as a potential therapeutic target for restoring BBB function in ICH.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.575082</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Myelin disruption is a feature of natural aging and Alzheimer’s disease (AD). In the CNS, myelin is produced by oligodendrocytes, which are generated throughout life by oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs). Here, we examined age-related changes in OPCs in APP/PS1 mice, a model for AD-like pathology, compared with non-transgenic (Tg) age-matched controls. The analysis was performed in the CA1 area of the hippocampus following immunolabeling for NG2 with the nuclear dye Hoescht, to identify OPC and OPC sister cells, a measure of OPC replication. The results indicate a significant decrease in the number of OPCs at 9 months in APP/PS1 mice, compared to age-matched controls, without further decline at 14 months. Also, the number of OPC sister cells declined significantly at 14 months in APP/PS1 mice, which was not observed in age-matched controls. Notably, OPCs also displayed marked morphological changes at 14 months in APP/PS1 mice, characterized by an overall shrinkage of OPC process domains and increased process branching. The results indicate that OPC disruption is a pathological sign in the APP/PS1 mouse model of AD.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Temporal Progression of Excitotoxic Calcium Following Distal Middle Cerebral Artery Occlusion in Freely Moving Mice</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.566789</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Ischemic stroke is recognized as one of the leading causes of adult disability, morbidity, and death worldwide. Following stroke, acute neuronal excitotoxicity can lead to many deleterious consequences, one of which is the dysregulation of intracellular calcium ultimately culminating in cell death. However, to develop neuroprotective treatments that target neuronal excitotoxicity, it is essential to know the therapeutic time window for intervention following an ischemic event. To address this question, the current study aimed to characterize the magnitude and temporal progression of neuronal intracellular calcium observed following distal middle cerebral artery occlusion (dMCAO) in mice. Using the calcium fluorescence indicator, GCaMP, we tracked neuronal population response in freely moving animals immediately following dMCAO in both the core infarct and peri-infarct regions. Our results demonstrate that calcium excitotoxicity following artery occlusion can be generally characterized by two phases: a transient increase in activity that lasts tens of minutes, followed by a long, slow sustained increase in fluorescence signal. The first phase is primarily thought to represent neuronal hyperexcitability, defining our therapeutic window, while the second may represent gradual cell death. Importantly, we show that the level of intracellular calcium following artery occlusion correlated with the infarct size at 24 h demonstrating a direct connection between excitotoxicity and cell death in our stroke model. In addition, we show that administration of the NMDA antagonist MK-801 resulted in both a decrease in calcium signal and a subsequent reduction in the infarct size. Altogether, this study represents the first demonstration in freely moving animals characterizing the temporal progression of toxic calcium signaling following artery occlusion. In addition, these results define a critical time window for neuroprotective therapeutic intervention in mice.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: A Model of Germinal Matrix Hemorrhage in Preterm Rat Pups</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.535320</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Germinal matrix hemorrhage (GMH) is a serious complication in extremely preterm infants associated with neurological deficits and mortality. The purpose of the present study was to develop and characterize a grade III and IV GMH model in postnatal day 5 (P5) rats, the equivalent of preterm human brain maturation. P5 Wistar rats were exposed to unilateral GMH through intracranial injection into the striatum close to the germinal matrix with 0.1, 0.2, or 0.3 U of collagenase VII. During 10 days following GMH induction, motor functions and body weight were assessed and brain tissue collected at P16. Animals were tested for anxiety, motor coordination and motor asymmetry on P22–26 and P36–40. Using immunohistochemical staining and neuropathological scoring we found that a collagenase dose of 0.3 U induced GMH. Neuropathological assessment revealed that the brain injury in the collagenase group was characterized by dilation of the ipsilateral ventricle combined with mild to severe cellular necrosis as well as mild to moderate atrophy at the levels of striatum and subcortical white matter, and to a lesser extent, hippocampus and cortex. Within 0.5 h post-collagenase injection there was clear bleeding at the site of injury, with progressive increase in iron and infiltration of neutrophils in the first 24 h, together with focal microglia activation. By P16, blood was no longer observed, although significant gray and white matter brain infarction persisted. Astrogliosis was also detected at this time-point. Animals exposed to GMH performed worse than controls in the negative geotaxis test and also opened their eyes with latency compared to control animals. At P40, GMH rats spent more time in the center of open field box and moved at higher speed compared to the controls, and continued to show ipsilateral injury in striatum and subcortical white matter. We have established a P5 rat model of collagenase-induced GMH for the study of preterm brain injury. Our results show that P5 rat pups exposed to GMH develop moderate brain injury affecting both gray and white matter associated with delayed eye opening and abnormal motor functions. These animals develop hyperactivity and show reduced anxiety in the juvenile stage.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.603179</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Introduction: The goal of this study was to investigate and compare the classification performance of machine learning with behavioral data from standard neuropsychological tests, a cognitive task, or both.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: A neuropsychological battery and a simple 5-min cognitive task were administered to eight individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), eight individuals with mild Alzheimer's disease (AD), and 41 demographically match controls (CN). A fully connected multilayer perceptron (MLP) network and four supervised traditional machine learning algorithms were used.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Traditional machine learning algorithms achieved similar classification performances with neuropsychological or cognitive data. MLP outperformed traditional algorithms with the cognitive data (either alone or together with neuropsychological data), but not neuropsychological data. In particularly, MLP with a combination of summarized scores from neuropsychological tests and the cognitive task achieved ~90% sensitivity and ~90% specificity. Applying the models to an independent dataset, in which the participants were demographically different from the ones in the main dataset, a high specificity was maintained (100%), but the sensitivity was dropped to 66.67%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Discussion: Deep learning with data from specific cognitive task(s) holds promise for assisting in the early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease, but future work with a large and diverse sample is necessary to validate and to improve this approach.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Regional Gray Matter Volume Identifies High Risk of Unsafe Driving in Healthy Older People</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.592979</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In developed countries, the number of traffic accidents caused by older drivers is increasing. Approximately half of the older drivers who cause fatal accidents are cognitively normal. Thus, it is important to identify older drivers who are cognitively normal but at high risk of causing fatal traffic accidents. However, no standardized method for assessing the driving ability of older drivers has been established. We aimed to establish an objective assessment of driving ability and to clarify the neural basis of unsafe driving in healthy older people. We enrolled 32 healthy older individuals aged over 65 years and classified unsafe drivers using an on-road driving test. We then utilized a machine learning approach to distinguish unsafe drivers from safe drivers based on clinical features and gray matter volume data. Twenty-one participants were classified as safe drivers and 11 participants as unsafe drivers. A linear support vector machine classifier successfully distinguished unsafe drivers from safe drivers with 87.5% accuracy (sensitivity of 63.6% and specificity of 100%). Five parameters (age and gray matter volume in four cortical regions, including the left superior part of the precentral sulcus, the left sulcus intermedius primus [of Jensen], the right orbital part of the inferior frontal gyrus, and the right superior frontal sulcus), were consistently selected as features for the final classification model. Our findings indicate that the cortical regions implicated in voluntary orienting of attention, decision making, and working memory may constitute the essential neural basis of driving behavior.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Deficiency of Mitochondrial Functions and Peroxidation of Frontoparietal Cortex Enhance Isoflurane Sensitivity in Aging Mice</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.583542</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Background: Hypersensitivity to general anesthetics may predict poor postoperative outcomes, especially among the older subjects. Therefore, it is essential to elucidate the mechanism underlying hypersensitivity to volatile anesthetics in the aging population. Given the fact that isoflurane sensitivity increases with aging, we hypothesized that deficiencies of mitochondrial function and elevated oxidative levels in the frontoparietal cortex may contribute to the enhanced sensitivity to isoflurane in aging mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Isoflurane sensitivity in aging mice was determined by the concentration of isoflurane that is required for loss of righting reflex (LORR). Mitochondrial bioenergetics of the frontoparietal cortex was measured using a Seahorse XFp analyzer. Protein oxidation and lipid oxidation in the frontoparietal cortex were assessed using the Oxyblot protein oxidation detection kit and thiobarbituric acid reactive substance (TBARS) assay, respectively. Contributions of mitochondrial complex II inhibition by malonate and peroxidation by ozone to isoflurane sensitivity were tested in vivo. Besides, effects of antioxidative therapy on mitochondrial function and isoflurane sensitivity in mice were also measured.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: The mean concentration of isoflurane that is required for LORR in aging mice (14–16 months old) was 0.83% ± 0.13% (mean ± SD, n = 80). Then, the mice were divided into three groups as sensitive group (S group, mean − SD), medium group (M group), and resistant group (R group, mean + SD) based on individual concentrations of isoflurane required for LORR. Activities of mitochondrial complex II and complex IV in mice of the S group were significantly lower than those of the R group, while frontoparietal cortical malondialdehyde (MDA) levels were higher in the mice of S group. Both inhibition of mitochondrial complexes and peroxidation significantly decreased the concentration of isoflurane that is required for LORR in vivo. After treatment with idebenone, the levels of lipid oxidation were alleviated and mitochondrial function was restored in aging mice. The concentration of isoflurane that required for LORR was also elevated after idebenone treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: Decreased mitochondrial functions and higher oxidative stress levels in the frontoparietal cortex may contribute to the hypersensitivity to isoflurane in aging mice.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Aberrant Amplitude of Low-Frequency Fluctuations in Different Frequency Bands in Patients With Parkinson’s Disease</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.576682</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Previous studies reported abnormal spontaneous neural activity in Parkinson’s disease (PD) patients using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (R-fMRI). However, the frequency-dependent neural activity in PD is largely unknown. Here, 35 PD patients and 35 age- and education-matched healthy controls (HCs) underwent R-fMRI scanning to investigate abnormal spontaneous neural activity of PD using the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF) approach within the conventional band (typical band: 0.01–0.08 Hz) and specific frequency bands (slow-5: 0.010–0.027 Hz and slow-4: 0.027–0.073 Hz). Compared with HCs, PD patients exhibited increased ALFF in the parieto-temporo-occipital regions, such as the bilateral inferior temporal gyrus/fusiform gyrus (ITG/FG) and left angular gyrus/posterior middle temporal gyrus (AG/pMTG), and displayed decreased ALFF in the left cerebellum, right precuneus, and left postcentral gyrus/supramarginal gyrus (PostC/SMG) in the typical band. PD patients showed greater increased ALFF in the left caudate/putamen, left anterior cingulate cortex/medial superior frontal gyrus (ACC/mSFG), left middle cingulate cortex (MCC), right ITG, and left hippocampus, along with greater decreased ALFF in the left pallidum in the slow-5 band, whereas greater increased ALFF in the left ITG/FG/hippocampus accompanied by greater decreased ALFF in the precentral gyrus/PostC was found in the slow-4 band (uncorrected). Additionally, the left caudate/putamen was positively correlated with levodopa equivalent daily dose (LEDD), Hoehn and Yahr (HY) stage, and disease duration. Our results suggest that PD is related to widespread abnormal brain activities and that the abnormalities of ALFF in PD are associated with specific frequency bands. Future studies should take frequency band effects into account when examining spontaneous neural activity in PD.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: Preserving inhibition with a disinhibitory microcircuit in the retina</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/62618</link>
	<content:encoded>Previously, we found that in the mammalian retina, inhibitory inputs onto starburst amacrine cells (SACs) are required for robust direction selectivity of On-Off direction-selective ganglion cells (On-Off DSGCs) against noisy backgrounds (Chen et al., 2016). However, the source of the inhibitory inputs to SACs and how this inhibition confers noise resilience of DSGCs are unknown. Here, we show that when visual noise is present in the background, the motion-evoked inhibition to an On-Off DSGC is preserved by a disinhibitory motif consisting of a serially connected network of neighboring SACs presynaptic to the DSGC. This preservation of inhibition by a disinhibitory motif arises from the interaction between visually evoked network dynamics and short-term synaptic plasticity at the SAC-DSGC synapse. While the disinhibitory microcircuit is well studied for its disinhibitory function in brain circuits, our results highlight the algorithmic flexibility of this motif beyond disinhibition due to the mutual influence between network and synaptic plasticity mechanisms.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: BAD inactivation exacerbates rheumatoid arthritis pathology by promoting survival of sublining macrophages</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/56309</link>
	<content:encoded>The resistance of synovial sublining macrophages to apoptosis has a crucial role in joint inflammation and destruction in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). However, the underlying mechanism is incompletely understood. Here we report that inactivation of the pro-apoptotic BCL-2 family protein BAD is essential for survival of synovial sublining macrophage in RA. Genetic disruption of &lt;i&gt;Bad&lt;/i&gt; leads to more severe joint inflammation and cartilage and bone damage with reduced apoptosis of synovial sublining macrophages in collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) and TNFα transgenic (TNF-Tg) mouse models. Conversely, &lt;i&gt;Bad&lt;sup&gt;3SA/3SA&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt; mice, in which BAD can no longer be inactivated by phosphorylation, are protected from collagen-induced arthritis. Mechanistically, phosphorylation-mediated inactivation of BAD specifically protects synovial sublining macrophages from apoptosis in highly inflammatory environment of arthritic joints in CIA and TNF-Tg mice, and in patients with RA, thereby contributing to RA pathology. Our findings put forward a model in which inactivation of BAD confers the apoptosis resistance on synovial sublining macrophages, thereby contributing to the development of arthritis, suggesting that BAD may be a potential therapeutic target for RA.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: Viral-induced alternative splicing of host genes promotes influenza replication</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/55500</link>
	<content:encoded>Viral infection induces the expression of numerous host genes that impact the outcome of infection. Here we show that infection of human lung epithelial cells with Influenza A virus (IAV) also induces a broad program of alternative splicing of host genes. While these splicing-regulated genes are not enriched for canonical regulators of viral infection, we find that many of these genes do impact replication of IAV. Moreover, in several cases, specific inhibition of the IAV-induced splicing pattern also attenuates viral infection. We further show that approximately a quarter of the IAV-induced splicing events are regulated by hnRNP K, a host protein required for efficient splicing of the IAV M transcript in nuclear speckles. Finally, we find an increase in hnRNP K in nuclear speckles upon IAV infection, which may alter accessibility of hnRNP K for host transcripts thereby leading to a program of host splicing changes that promote IAV replication.</content:encoded>

Elucidating the causal mechanisms responsible for disease can reveal potential therapeutic targets for pharmacological intervention and, accordingly, guide drug repositioning and discovery. In essence, the topology of a network can reveal the impact a drug candidate may have on a given biological state, leading the way for enhanced disease characterization and the design of advanced therapies. Network-based approaches, in particular, are highly suited for these purposes as they hold the capacity to identify the molecular mechanisms underlying disease. Here, we present drug2ways, a novel methodology that leverages multimodal causal networks for predicting drug candidates. Drug2ways implements an efficient algorithm which reasons over causal paths in large-scale biological networks to propose drug candidates for a given disease. We validate our approach using clinical trial information and demonstrate how drug2ways can be used for multiple applications to identify: i) single-target drug candidates, ii) candidates with polypharmacological properties that can optimize multiple targets, and iii) candidates for combination therapy. Finally, we make drug2ways available to the scientific community as a Python package that enables conducting these applications on multiple standard network formats.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/rXk8npby5VA&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Orientation processing by synaptic integration across first-order tactile neurons</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/Z7j_lNkTbBw/article</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Etay Hay, J. Andrew Pruszynski&lt;/p&gt;

Our ability to manipulate objects relies on tactile inputs from first-order tactile neurons that innervate the glabrous skin of the hand. The distal axon of these neurons branches in the skin and innervates many mechanoreceptors, yielding spatially-complex receptive fields. Here we show that synaptic integration across the complex signals from the first-order neuronal population could underlie human ability to accurately (&amp;lt; 3°) and rapidly process the orientation of edges moving across the fingertip. We first derive spiking models of human first-order tactile neurons that fit and predict responses to moving edges with high accuracy. We then use the model neurons in simulating the peripheral neuronal population that innervates a fingertip. We train classifiers performing synaptic integration across the neuronal population activity, and show that synaptic integration across first-order neurons can process edge orientations with high acuity and speed. In particular, our models suggest that integration of fast-decaying (AMPA-like) synaptic inputs within short timescales is critical for discriminating fine orientations, whereas integration of slow-decaying (NMDA-like) synaptic inputs supports discrimination of coarser orientations and maintains robustness over longer timescales. Taken together, our results provide new insight into the computations occurring in the earliest stages of the human tactile processing pathway and how they may be critical for supporting hand function.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Z7j_lNkTbBw&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Biology: ClipKIT: A multiple sequence alignment trimming software for accurate phylogenomic inference</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~3/vxjeiNr5ESs/article</link>

Highly divergent sites in multiple sequence alignments (MSAs), which can stem from erroneous inference of homology and saturation of substitutions, are thought to negatively impact phylogenetic inference. Thus, several different trimming strategies have been developed for identifying and removing these sites prior to phylogenetic inference. However, a recent study reported that doing so can worsen inference, underscoring the need for alternative alignment trimming strategies. Here, we introduce ClipKIT, an alignment trimming software that, rather than identifying and removing putatively phylogenetically uninformative sites, instead aims to identify and retain parsimony-informative sites, which are known to be phylogenetically informative. To test the efficacy of ClipKIT, we examined the accuracy and support of phylogenies inferred from 14 different alignment trimming strategies, including those implemented in ClipKIT, across nearly 140,000 alignments from a broad sampling of evolutionary histories. Phylogenies inferred from ClipKIT-trimmed alignments are accurate, robust, and time saving. Furthermore, ClipKIT consistently outperformed other trimming methods across diverse datasets, suggesting that strategies based on identifying and retaining parsimony-informative sites provide a robust framework for alignment trimming.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/vxjeiNr5ESs&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

RNA interference (RNAi) is an antiviral pathway common to many eukaryotes that detects and cleaves foreign nucleic acids. In mammals, mitochondrially localized proteins such as mitochondrial antiviral signaling (MAVS), retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I), and melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5 (MDA5) mediate antiviral responses. Here, we report that mitochondrial dysfunction in &lt;i&gt;Caenorhabditis elegans&lt;/i&gt; activates RNAi-directed silencing via induction of a pathway homologous to the mammalian RIG-I helicase viral response pathway. The induction of RNAi also requires the conserved RNA decapping enzyme EOL-1/DXO. The transcriptional induction of &lt;i&gt;eol-1&lt;/i&gt; requires DRH-1 as well as the mitochondrial unfolded protein response (UPR&lt;sup&gt;mt&lt;/sup&gt;). Upon mitochondrial dysfunction, EOL-1 is concentrated into foci that depend on the transcription of mitochondrial RNAs that may form double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), as has been observed in mammalian antiviral responses. Enhanced RNAi triggered by mitochondrial dysfunction is necessary for the increase in longevity that is induced by mitochondrial dysfunction.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/Rqj5R3MuVoI&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Biology: YAP/TAZ deficiency reprograms macrophage phenotype and improves infarct healing and cardiac function after myocardial infarction</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~3/H9OMCm_gjTg/article</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Masum M. Mia, Dasan Mary Cibi, Siti Aishah Binte Abdul Ghani, Weihua Song, Nicole Tee, Sujoy Ghosh, Junhao Mao, Eric N. Olson, Manvendra K. Singh&lt;/p&gt;

Adverse cardiac remodeling after myocardial infarction (MI) causes structural and functional changes in the heart leading to heart failure. The initial post-MI pro-inflammatory response followed by reparative or anti-inflammatory response is essential for minimizing the myocardial damage, healing, and scar formation. Bone marrow–derived macrophages (BMDMs) are recruited to the injured myocardium and are essential for cardiac repair as they can adopt both pro-inflammatory or reparative phenotypes to modulate inflammatory and reparative responses, respectively. Yes-associated protein (YAP) and transcriptional coactivator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ) are the key mediators of the Hippo signaling pathway and are essential for cardiac regeneration and repair. However, their functions in macrophage polarization and post-MI inflammation, remodeling, and healing are not well established. Here, we demonstrate that expression of YAP and TAZ is increased in macrophages undergoing pro-inflammatory or reparative phenotype changes. Genetic deletion of &lt;i&gt;YAP/TAZ&lt;/i&gt; leads to impaired pro-inflammatory and enhanced reparative response. Consistently, YAP activation enhanced pro-inflammatory and impaired reparative response. We show that YAP/TAZ promote pro-inflammatory response by increasing interleukin 6 (&lt;i&gt;IL6&lt;/i&gt;) expression and impede reparative response by decreasing Arginase-I (&lt;i&gt;Arg1&lt;/i&gt;) expression through interaction with the histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3)-nuclear receptor corepressor 1 (NCoR1) repressor complex. These changes in macrophages polarization due to &lt;i&gt;YAP/TAZ&lt;/i&gt; deletion results in reduced fibrosis, hypertrophy, and increased angiogenesis, leading to improved cardiac function after MI. Also, YAP activation augmented MI-induced cardiac fibrosis and remodeling. In summary, we identify YAP/TAZ as important regulators of macrophage-mediated pro-inflammatory or reparative responses post-MI.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/H9OMCm_gjTg&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

&lt;p&gt;Traumatic contusion to the primary somatosensory and motor cortices is delivered to the exposed left forebrain. Sensorimotor dysfunction is tested every other day for the first week post‐injury (PI) and weekly thereafter up to 8 weeks PI. The impacted cortical area was harvested at 4 hours (h), 12h, 24h, 7 days (d), 14d, and 8 weeks PI and sampled for cytokine and chemokine levels using multiplex electro‐chemiluminescent immunoassays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Traumatic brain injury is a leading cause of mortality and morbidity in the United States. Acute trauma to the brain triggers chronic secondary injury mechanisms that contribute to long‐term neurological impairment. We have developed a single, unilateral contusion injury model of sensorimotor dysfunction in adult mice. By targeting a topographically defined neurological circuit with a mild impact, we are able to track sustained behavioral deficits in sensorimotor function in the absence of tissue cavitation or neuronal loss in the contused cortex of these mice. Stereological histopathology and multiplex enzyme‐linked immunosorbent assay proteomic screening confirm contusion resulted in chronic gliosis and the robust expression of innate immune cytokines and monocyte attractant chemokines IL‐1β, IL‐5, IL‐6, TNFα, CXCL1, CXCL2, CXCL10, CCL2, and CCL3 in the contused cortex. In contrast, the expression of neuroinflammatory proteins with adaptive immune functions was not significantly modulated by injury. Our data support widespread activation of innate but not adaptive immune responses, confirming an association between sensorimotor dysfunction with innate immune activation in the absence of tissue or neuronal loss in our mice.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hippocampal theta oscillations have been implicated in spatial memory function in both rodents and humans. What is less clear is how hippocampal theta interacts with higher frequency oscillations to support long‐term memory. Here we asked 10 presurgical epilepsy patients undergoing intracranial EEG recording to perform a long‐term spatial memory task in desktop virtual reality and found that increased theta power in two discrete bands (“low” 2‐5 Hz and “high” 6‐11 Hz) during cued retrieval was associated with improved task performance. Similarly, increased coupling between “low” theta phase and gamma amplitude during the same period was associated with improved task performance. Finally, low and high gamma amplitude appeared to peak at different phases of the theta cycle; providing a novel connection between human hippocampal function and rodent data. These results help to elucidate the role of theta oscillations and theta‐gamma phase‐amplitude coupling in human long‐term memory.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The amygdaloid complex (AC) is involved in very relevant cognitive and emotional pathways and exhibits changes in aging and in some neurological and psychiatric disorders. The quantitative estimators of AC could be useful to understand the impact of amygdaloid pathology in these processes, both globally and for each nucleus in particular, and their neurons. The present study analyzes morphometric and stereological estimators in the whole AC and its three main nuclei (lateral [La], basal [Ba], and accessory basal [AB]) in six &lt;i&gt;Macaca fascicularis&lt;/i&gt; monkeys. All the brains were fixed and sectioned in the coronal plane; Nissl‐stained sections were used for estimation of size and form parameters in both, the AC, and the La, Ba, and AB nuclei separately. The study includes stereological estimates of the volume and surface area of the AC; also, volume of the neurons in the amygdaloid nuclei was estimated using the point‐sampled intercepts method. Our results show that the AB nucleus is smaller than both the La and Ba nuclei in both morphometric and stereological estimators. Brain hemispheric side had not significant influence on any of quantitative estimates. The neuron volume was higher in the AB nucleus relative to LA and Ba of the nuclei. These data describe some quantitative parameters of the amygdaloid complex and their main nuclei that could help us to detect small changes in neurodegenerative and other pathological processes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

&lt;p&gt;Rabies virus‐based monosynaptic circuit tracing allows the exploration of cell‐type specificity of both long‐distance and local connections in the central nervous system. We provide anatomical evidence of the cell type‐ and layer‐specific convergence in dLGN core and shell neurons. These findings suggest that dLGN core neurons integrate and process more multimodal information along with visual information than dLGN shell neurons and that LGN core and shell neurons integrate different types of information, send their own convergent information to discrete populations of the V1, and differentially contribute to visual perception and behavior.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over 40 distinct types of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) generate parallel processing pathways in the visual system. In mice, two subdivisions of the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN), the core and the shell, organize distinct parallel channels to transmit visual information from the retina to the primary visual cortex (V1). To investigate how the dLGN core and shell differentially integrate visual information and other modalities, we mapped synaptic input sources to each dLGN subdivision at the cell‐type level with G‐deleted rabies viral vectors. The monosynaptic circuit tracing revealed that dLGN core neurons received inputs from alpha‐RGCs, Layer 6 neurons of the V1, the superficial and intermediate layers of the superior colliculus (SC), the internal ventral LGN, the lower layer of the external ventral LGN (vLGNe), the intergeniculate leaf, the thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN), and the pretectal nucleus (PT). Conversely, shell neurons received inputs from alpha‐RGCs and direction‐selective ganglion cells of the retina, Layer 6 neurons of the V1, the superficial layer of the SC, the superficial and lower layers of the vLGNe, the TRN, the PT, and the parabigeminal nucleus. The present study provides anatomical evidence of the cell type‐ and layer‐specific convergence in dLGN core and shell neurons. These findings suggest that dLGN core neurons integrate and process more multimodal information along with visual information than shell neurons and that LGN core and shell neurons integrate different types of information, send their own convergent information to discrete populations of the V1, and differentially contribute to visual perception and behavior.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

topological approach to information processing in the cortex of brain in
consistence with the ion electricity of the gray matter and a supplementary

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;This paper proposes a novel topological learning framework that can integrate
networks of different sizes and topology through persistent homology. This is
possible through the introduction of a new topological loss function that
enables such challenging task. The use of the proposed loss function bypasses
the intrinsic computational bottleneck associated with matching networks. We
validate the method in extensive statistical simulations with ground truth to
assess the effectiveness of the topological loss in discriminating networks
with different topology. The method is further applied to a twin brain imaging
study in determining if the brain network is genetically heritable. The
challenge is in overlaying the topologically different functional brain
networks obtained from the resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging
(fMRI) onto the template structural brain network obtained through the
diffusion tensor imaging (DTI).

	<title>arXiv: Quantitative Biology: Neurons and Cognition: Single trial ERP amplitudes reveal the time course of acquiring representations of novel faces in individual participants. (arXiv:2012.00667v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2012.00667</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The neural correlates of face individuation - the acquisition of memory
representations for novel faces - have been studied only in coarse detail and
disregarding individual differences between learners. In their seminal study,
(Tanaka, Curran, Porterfield, &amp;amp; Collins, 2006) required the identification of a
particular novel face across 70 trials and found that the N250 component in the
ERP became more negative from the first to the second half of the experiment,
where it reached a similar amplitude as a well-known face. We were unable to
directly replicate this finding in our study when we used the original split of
trials. However, when we applied a different split of trials we observed very
similar changes in N250 amplitude. Then, we developed and applied a new
two-step explorative-confirmative non-parametric method based on permutation
testing to determine the time course of face individuation in individual
participants based on single-trial N250 amplitudes. We show that the assumption
of a steep initial increase of N250 amplitude across multiple presentations of
the target face, followed by a plateau, yields plausible results in fitting
linear trends for most participants. The transition point from initial
acquisition to the plateau phase differed strongly between participants and
tended to be earlier when performance in target face recognition was better.
Hence, face individuation may be accounted for by a biphasic process of early,
fast acquisition, followed by a slower, asymptotic consolidation or maintenance
phase. The current approach might be fruitfully applied to further
investigations into face individuation and their neural correlates

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2012.00596</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;With the increasing demand to efficiently deploy DNNs on mobile edge devices,
it becomes much more important to reduce unnecessary computation and increase
the execution speed. Prior methods towards this goal, including model
compression and network architecture search (NAS), are largely performed
independently and do not fully consider compiler-level optimizations which is a
must-do for mobile acceleration. In this work, we first propose (i) a general
category of fine-grained structured pruning applicable to various DNN layers,
and (ii) a comprehensive, compiler automatic code generation framework
supporting different DNNs and different pruning schemes, which bridge the gap
of model compression and NAS. We further propose NPAS, a compiler-aware unified
network pruning, and architecture search. To deal with large search space, we
propose a meta-modeling procedure based on reinforcement learning with fast
evaluation and Bayesian optimization, ensuring the total number of training
epochs comparable with representative NAS frameworks. Our framework achieves
6.7ms, 5.9ms, 3.9ms ImageNet inference times with 78.2%, 75% (MobileNet-V3
level), and 71% (MobileNet-V2 level) Top-1 accuracy respectively on an
off-the-shelf mobile phone, consistently outperforming prior work.

	<title>arXiv: Computer Science: Neural and Evolutionary Computing: Solvable Model for Inheriting the Regularization through Knowledge Distillation. (arXiv:2012.00194v2 [cs.LG] UPDATED)</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2012.00194</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In recent years the empirical success of transfer learning with neural
networks has stimulated an increasing interest in obtaining a theoretical
understanding of its core properties. Knowledge distillation where a smaller
neural network is trained using the outputs of a larger neural network is a
particularly interesting case of transfer learning. In the present work, we
introduce a statistical physics framework that allows an analytic
characterization of the properties of knowledge distillation (KD) in shallow
neural networks. Focusing the analysis on a solvable model that exhibits a
non-trivial generalization gap, we investigate the effectiveness of KD. We are
able to show that, through KD, the regularization properties of the larger
teacher model can be inherited by the smaller student and that the yielded
generalization performance is closely linked to and limited by the optimality
of the teacher. Finally, we analyze the double descent phenomenology that can
arise in the considered KD setting.

                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Non-dystrophic myotonias (NDM) are heterogeneous diseases caused by mutations in &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;CLCN1&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;SCN4A&lt;/em&gt;. The study aimed to describe the clinical and genetic spectrum of NDM in a large German cohort.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec2&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Methods&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;We retrospectively identified all patients with genetically confirmed NDM diagnosed in our center. The following data were analyzed: demographics, family history, muscular features, cardiac involvement, CK, EMG, genotype, other tested genes, treatment perceived efficacy.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec3&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;70 patients (age 40.2 years ± 14.9; 52.8% males) were included in our study (48 NDM-CLCN1, 22 NDM-SCN4A). The most frequent presenting symptoms were myotonia (NDM-CLCN1 83.3%, NDM-SCN4A 72.2%) and myalgia (NDM-CLCN1 57.4%, NDM-SCN4A 52.6%). Besides a more prominent facial involvement in NDM-SCN4A and cold-sensitivity in NDM-CLCN1, no other significant differences were observed between groups. Cardiac arrhythmia or conduction defects were documented in sixNDM-CLCN1 patients (three of them requiring a pacemaker) and one patient with NDM-SCN4A. CK was normal in 40% of patients. Myotonic runs in EMG were detected in 89.1% of CLCN1 and 78.9% of SCN4A. 50% of NDM-CLCN1 patients had the classic c.2680C&amp;gt;T (p.Arg894*) mutation. 12 new genetic variants are reported. About 50% of patients were not taking any anti-myotonic drug at the last follow-up. The anti-myotonic drugs with the best patient’s perceived efficacy were mexiletine and lamotrigine.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec4&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;This study highlights the relevant clinical overlap between NDM-CLCN1 and NDM-SCN4A patients and warrants the use of early and broad genetic investigation for the precise identification of the NDM subtype. Besides the clinical and genetic heterogeneity, the limited response to current anti-myotonic drugs constitutes a continuing challenge.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience: Not Part of the Temporal Lobe, but Still of Importance? Substantia Nigra and Subthalamic Nucleus in Epilepsy</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2020.581826</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The most researched brain region in epilepsy research is the temporal lobe, and more specifically, the hippocampus. However, numerous other brain regions play a pivotal role in seizure circuitry and secondary generalization of epileptic activity: The substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr) and its direct input structure, the subthalamic nucleus (STN), are considered seizure gating nuclei. There is ample evidence that direct inhibition of the SNr is capable of suppressing various seizure types in experimental models. Similarly, inhibition via its monosynaptic glutamatergic input, the STN, can decrease seizure susceptibility as well. This review will focus on therapeutic interventions such as electrical stimulation and targeted drug delivery to SNr and STN in human patients and experimental animal models of epilepsy, highlighting the opportunities for overcoming pharmacoresistance in epilepsy by investigating these promising target structures.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Hypoxia-Ischemia Induced Age-Dependent Gene Transcription Effects at Two Development Stages in the Neonate Mouse Brain</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2020.587815</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Human brain lesions in the perinatal period result in life-long neuro-disabilities impairing sensory-motor, cognitive, and behavior functions for years. Topographical aspects of brain lesions depend on gestational age at the time of insult in preterm or term infants and impaired subsequent steps of brain development and maturation. In mice, the Rice-Vannucci procedure of neonate hypoxia-ischemia (HI) was used at 5 days (P5) or P10, mimicking the development of 30 week-gestation fetus/preterm newborn, or full-term infant, respectively. Transcription response to HI was assessed at 3, 6, 12, and 24 h after insult, using micro-array technology. Statistical Pathway and Gene Ontology terms enrichments were investigated using DAVID&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt;, Revigo&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt; and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt;) to identify a core of transcription response to HI, age-specific regulations, and interactions with spontaneous development. Investigations were based on direction, amplitude, and duration of responses, basal expression, and annotation. Five major points deserve attention; (i) inductions exceeded repressions (60/40%) at both ages, (ii) only 20.3% (393/1938 records) were common to P5 and P10 mice, (iii) at P5, HI effects occurred early and decreased 24 h after insult whereas they were delayed at P10 and increased 24 h after insult, (iv) common responses at P5 and P10 involved inflammation, immunity, apoptosis, and angiogenesis. (v) age-specific effects occurred with higher statistical significance at P5 than at P10. Transient repression of 12 genes encoding cholesterol biosynthesis enzymes was transiently observed 12 h after HI at P5. Synaptogenesis appeared inhibited at P5 while induced at P10, showing reciprocal effects on glutamate receptors. Specific involvement of Il-1 (interleukin-1) implicated in the firing of inflammation was observed at P10. This study pointed out age-differences in HI responses kinetics, e.g., a long-lasting inflammatory response at P10 compared to P5. Whether the specific strong depression of cholesterol biosynthesis genes that could account for white matter-specific vulnerability at P5 or prevent delayed inflammation needs further investigation. Determination of putative involvement of Il-1 and the identification of upstream regulators involved in the delayed inflammation firing at P10 appears promising routes of research in the understandings of age-dependent vulnerabilities in the neonatal brain.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: The Q336H MAPT Mutation Linked to Pick’s Disease Leads to Increased Binding of Tau to the Microtubule Network via Altered Conformational and Phosphorylation Effects</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2020.569395</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Tauopathies are neurodegenerative disorders characterized by Tau aggregation. Genetic studies on familial cases allowed for the discovery of mutations in the MAPT gene that increase Tau propensity to detach from microtubules and to form insoluble cytoplasmic Tau aggregates. Recently, the rare mutation Q336H has been identified to be associated with Pick’s disease (PiD) and biochemical analyses demonstrated its ability to increase the microtubules (MTs) polymerization, thus revealing an opposite character compared to other Tau mutations studied so far. Here we investigated the biophysical and molecular properties of Tau&lt;sup&gt;Q336H&lt;/sup&gt; in living cells by the employment of the conformational Tau biosensor CST. We found that this mutation alters Tau conformation on microtubules, stabilizes its binding to tubulin, and is associated with a paradoxical lower level of Tau phosphorylation. Moreover, we found that this mutation impacts the cytoskeletal complexity by increasing the tubulin filament length and the number of branches. However, despite these apparently non-pathological traits, we observed the formation of intracellular inclusions confirming that Q336H leads to aggregation. Our results suggest that the Tau aggregation process might be triggered by molecular mechanisms other than Tau destabilization or post-translational modifications which are likely to be detrimental to neuronal function in vivo.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Fetal Cortical Plate Segmentation Using Fully Convolutional Networks With Multiple Plane Aggregation</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.591683</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Fetal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has the potential to advance our understanding of human brain development by providing quantitative information of cortical plate (CP) development in vivo. However, for a reliable quantitative analysis of cortical volume and sulcal folding, accurate and automated segmentation of the CP is crucial. In this study, we propose a fully convolutional neural network for the automatic segmentation of the CP. We developed a novel hybrid loss function to improve the segmentation accuracy and adopted multi-view (axial, coronal, and sagittal) aggregation with a test-time augmentation method to reduce errors using three-dimensional (3D) information and multiple predictions. We evaluated our proposed method using the ten-fold cross-validation of 52 fetal brain MR images (22.9–31.4 weeks of gestation). The proposed method obtained Dice coefficients of 0.907 ± 0.027 and 0.906 ± 0.031 as well as a mean surface distance error of 0.182 ± 0.058 mm and 0.185 ± 0.069 mm for the left and right, respectively. In addition, the left and right CP volumes, surface area, and global mean curvature generated by automatic segmentation showed a high correlation with the values generated by manual segmentation (R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;gt; 0.941). We also demonstrated that the proposed hybrid loss function and the combination of multi-view aggregation and test-time augmentation significantly improved the CP segmentation accuracy. Our proposed segmentation method will be useful for the automatic and reliable quantification of the cortical structure in the fetal brain.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: MMP13 Expression Is Increased Following Mutant α-Synuclein Exposure and Promotes Inflammatory Responses in Microglia</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.585544</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;α-Synuclein is a 140-amino acid protein that readily misfolds and is associated with the Lewy body pathology found in sporadic and genetic forms of Parkinson's disease. We and others have shown that wild-type α-synuclein is a damage-associated molecular pattern that directly elicits a proinflammatory response in microglia through toll-like receptor activation. Here we investigated the direct effect of oligomeric mutant α-synuclein (A53T) on microglia morphology and activation. We found that misfolded A53T increased quantitative measures of amoeboid cell morphology, NFκB nuclear translocation and the expression of prototypical proinflammatory molecules. We also demonstrated that A53T increased expression of MMP13, a matrix metalloproteinase that remodels the extracellular matrix. To better understand the role of MMP13 in synucleinopathies, we further characterized the role of MMP13 in microglial signaling. We showed exposure of microglia to MMP13 induced a change in morphology and promoted the release of TNFα and MMP9. Notably, IL1β was not released indicating that the pathway involved in MMP13 activation of microglia may be different than the A53T pathway. Lastly, MMP13 increased the expression of CD68 suggesting that the lysosomal pathway might be altered by this MMP. Taken together this study shows that mutant α-synuclein directly induces a proinflammatory phenotype in microglia, which includes the expression of MMP13. In turn, MMP13 directly alters microglia supporting the need for multi-target therapies to treat Parkinson's disease patients.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Gray Matter Volume and Functional Connectivity in Hypochondriasis: A Magnetic Resonance Imaging and Support Vector Machine Analysis</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.596157</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Objective: Patients with hypochondriasis hold unexplainable beliefs and a fear of having a lethal disease, with poor compliances and treatment response to psychotropic drugs. Although several studies have demonstrated that patients with hypochondriasis demonstrate abnormalities in brain structure and function, gray matter volume (GMV) and functional connectivity (FC) in hypochondriasis still remain unclear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: The present study collected T1-weighted and resting-state functional magnetic resonance images from 21 hypochondriasis patients and 22 well-matched healthy controls (HCs). We first analyzed the difference in the GMV between the two groups. We then used the regions showing a difference in GMV between two groups as seeds to perform functional connectivity (FC) analysis. Finally, a support vector machine (SVM) was applied to the imaging data to distinguish hypochondriasis patients from HCs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Compared with the HCs, the hypochondriasis group showed decreased GMV in the left precuneus, and increased GMV in the left medial frontal gyrus. FC analyses revealed decreased FC between the left medial frontal gyrus and cuneus, and between the left precuneus and cuneus. A combination of both GMV and FC in the left precuneus, medial frontal gyrus, and cuneus was able to discriminate the hypochondriasis patients from HCs with a sensitivity of 0.98, specificity of 0.93, and accuracy of 0.95.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: Our study suggests that smaller left precuneus volumes and decreased FC between the left precuneus and cuneus seem to play an important role of hypochondriasis. Future studies are needed to confirm whether this finding is generalizable to patients with hypochondriasis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Altered Functional Connectivity in White and Gray Matter in Patients With Multiple Sclerosis</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.563048</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Background: Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has been widely used to assess neural activity changes in gray matter (GM) in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS); however, brain function alterations in white matter (WM) relatively remain under-explored.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Purpose: This work aims to identify the functional connectivity in both the WM and the GM of patients with MS using fMRI and the correlations between these functional changes and cumulative disability as well as the lesion ratio.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Materials and Methods: For this retrospective study, 37 patients with clinically definite MS and 43 age-matched healthy controls were included between 2010 and 2014. Resting-state fMRI was performed. The WFU Pick and JHU Eve atlases were used to define 82 GM and 48 WM regions in common spaces, respectively. The time courses of blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signals were averaged over each GM or WM region. The averaged time courses for each pair of GM and WM regions were correlated. All 82 × 48 correlations for each subject formed a functional correlation matrix.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Compared with the healthy controls, the MS patients had a decreased temporal correlation between the WM and the GM regions. Five WM bundles and four GM regions had significantly decreased mean correlation coefficients (CCs). More specifically, the WM functional alterations were negatively correlated with the lesion volume in the bilateral fornix, and the mean GM-averaged CCs of the WM bundles were inversely correlated with the lesion ratio (r = −0.36, P = 0.012). No significant correlation was found between WM functional alterations and the paced auditory serial addition test score, Expanded Disease Severity Scale score, and Multiple Sclerosis Severity Score (MSSS) in MS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: These findings highlight current gaps in our knowledge of the WM functional alterations in patients with MS and may link WM function with pathological mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Application of Referencing Techniques in EEG-Based Recordings of Contact Heat Evoked Potentials (CHEPS)</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.559969</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Evoked potentials in the amplitude-time spectrum of the electroencephalogram are commonly used to assess the extent of brain responses to stimulation with noxious contact heat. The magnitude of the N- and P-waves are used as a semi-objective measure of the response to the painful stimulus: the higher the magnitude, the more painful the stimulus has been perceived. The strength of the N-P-wave response is also largely dependent on the chosen reference electrode site. The goal of this study was to examine which reference technique excels both in practical and theoretical terms when analyzing noxious contact heat evoked potentials (CHEPS) in the amplitude-time spectrum. We recruited 21 subjects (10 male, 11 female, mean age of 55.79 years). We applied seven noxious contact heat stimuli using two temperatures, 51°C, and 54°C, to each subject. During EEG analysis, we aimed to identify the referencing technique which produces the highest N-wave and P-wave amplitudes with as little artifactual influence as possible. For this purpose, we applied the following six referencing techniques: mathematically linked A1/A2 (earlobes), average reference, REST, AFz, Pz, and mathematically linked PO7/PO8. We evaluated how these techniques impact the N-P amplitudes of CHEPS based on our data from healthy subjects. Considering all factors, we found that mathematically linked earlobes to be the ideal referencing site to use when displaying and evaluating CHEPS in the amplitude-time spectrum.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: γ-Secretase Modulatory Proteins: The Guiding Hand Behind the Running Scissors</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.614690</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Described as the “proteasome of the membrane” or the “scissors in the membrane,” γ-secretase has notoriously complicated biology, and even after decades of research, the full extent of its regulatory mechanism remains unclear. γ-Secretase is an intramembrane aspartyl protease complex composed of four obligatory subunits: Nicastrin (NCT), Presenilin (PS), Presenilin Enhancer-2 (Pen-2), and Anterior pharynx-defective-1 (Aph-1). γ-Secretase cleaves numerous type 1 transmembrane substrates, with no apparent homology, and plays major roles in broad biological pathways such as development, neurogenesis, and cancer. Notch and the amyloid precursor protein (APP) and are undoubtedly the best-studied γ-secretase substrates because of their role in cancer and Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and therefore became the focus of increasing studies as an attractive therapeutic target. The regulation of γ-secretase is intricate and involves the function of multiple cellular entities. Recently, γ-secretase modulatory proteins (GSMPs), which are non-essential subunits and yet modulate γ-secretase activity and specificity, have emerged as an important component in guiding γ-secretase. GSMPs are responsive to cellular and environmental changes and therefore, provide another layer of regulation of γ-secretase. This type of enzymatic regulation allows for a rapid and fine-tuning of γ-secretase activity when appropriate signals appear enabling a temporal level of regulation. In this review article, we discuss the latest developments on GSMPs and implications on the development of effective therapeutics for γ-secretase-associated diseases such as AD and cancer.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Fornix Integrity Is Differently Associated With Cognition in Healthy Aging and Non-amnestic Mild Cognitive Impairment: A Pilot Diffusion Tensor Imaging Study in Thai Older Adults</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.594002</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Damage to the fornix leads to significant memory impairment and executive dysfunction and is associated with dementia risk. We sought to identify if fornix integrity and fiber length are disrupted in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and how they associate with cognition. Data from 14 healthy older adult controls (HCs) and 17 subjects with non-amnestic MCI (n-aMCI) were analyzed. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) at 1.5 Tesla MRI was performed to enable manual tracing of the fornix and calculation of DTI parameters. Higher fractional anisotropy of body and column of the fornix was associated with better executive functioning and memory, more strongly in the HC than in the n-aMCI group. Fornix fiber tract length (FTL) was associated with better executive function, more strongly in the n-aMCI than in the HC group, and with better memory, more strongly in the HC than in the n-aMCI group. These results highlight a decline in the contributions of the fornix to cognition in n-aMCI and suggest that maintenance of fornix FTL is essential for sustaining executive functioning in people with n-aMCI.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/63452</link>
	<content:encoded>The dendritic cell receptor Clec9A facilitates processing of dead cell-derived antigens for cross-presentation and the induction of effective CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cell immune responses. Here, we show that this process is regulated by E3 ubiquitin ligase RNF41 and define a new ubiquitin-mediated mechanism for regulation of Clec9A, reflecting the unique properties of Clec9A as a receptor specialized for delivery of antigens for cross-presentation. We reveal RNF41 is a negative regulator of Clec9A and the cross-presentation of dead cell-derived antigens by mouse dendritic cells. Intriguingly, RNF41 regulates the downstream fate of Clec9A by directly binding and ubiquitinating the extracellular domains of Clec9A. At steady-state, RNF41 ubiquitination of Clec9A facilitates interactions with ER-associated proteins and degradation machinery to control Clec9A levels. However, Clec9A interactions are altered following dead cell uptake to favor antigen presentation. These findings provide important insights into antigen cross-presentation and have implications for development of approaches to modulate immune responses.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/63266</link>
	<content:encoded>The transcription factor p53 is the best-known tumor suppressor, but its sibling p63 is a master regulator of epidermis development and a key oncogenic driver in squamous cell carcinomas (SCC). Despite multiple gene expression studies becoming available, the limited overlap of reported p63-dependent genes has made it difficult to decipher the p63 gene regulatory network. Particularly, analyses of p63 response elements differed substantially among the studies. To address this intricate data situation, we provide an integrated resource that enables assessing the p63-dependent regulation of any human gene of interest. We use a novel iterative &lt;i&gt;de novo&lt;/i&gt; motif search approach in conjunction with extensive ChIP-seq data to achieve a precise global distinction between p53 and p63 binding sites, recognition motifs, and potential co-factors. We integrate these data with enhancer:gene associations to predict p63 target genes and identify those that are commonly de-regulated in SCC representing candidates for prognosis and therapeutic interventions.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/61487</link>
	<content:encoded>Missense mutations in the p53 DNA binding domain (DBD) contribute to half of new cancer cases annually. Here we present a thermodynamic model that quantifies and links the major pathways by which mutations inactivate p53. We find that DBD possesses two unusual properties-one of the highest zinc affinities of any eukaryotic protein and extreme instability in the absence of zinc-which are predicted to poise p53 on the cusp of folding/unfolding in the cell, with a major determinant being available zinc concentration. We analyze the 20 most common tumorigenic p53 mutations and find that 80% impair zinc affinity, thermodynamic stability, or both. Biophysical, cell-based, and murine xenograft experiments demonstrate that a synthetic zinc metallochaperone rescues not only mutations that decrease zinc affinity, but also mutations that destabilize DBD without impairing zinc binding. The results suggest that zinc metallochaperones have the capability to treat 120,500 patients annually in the U.S.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: Fitness variation across subtle environmental perturbations reveals local modularity and global pleiotropy of adaptation</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/61271</link>
	<content:encoded>Building a genotype-phenotype-fitness map of adaptation is a central goal in evolutionary biology. It is difficult even when adaptive mutations are known because it is hard to enumerate which phenotypes make these mutations adaptive. We address this problem by first quantifying how the fitness of hundreds of adaptive yeast mutants responds to subtle environmental shifts. We then model the number of phenotypes these mutations collectively influence by decomposing these patterns of fitness variation. We find that a small number of inferred phenotypes can predict fitness of the adaptive mutations near their original glucose-limited evolution condition. Importantly, inferred phenotypes that matter little to fitness at or near the evolution condition can matter strongly in distant environments. This suggests that adaptive mutations are locally modular—affecting a small number of phenotypes that matter to fitness in the environment where they evolved—yet globally pleiotropic—affecting additional phenotypes that may reduce or improve fitness in new environments.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/60628</link>
	<content:encoded>How does the brain internally represent a sequence of sensory information that jointly drives a decision-making behavior? Studies of perceptual decision-making have often assumed that sensory cortices provide noisy but otherwise veridical sensory inputs to downstream processes that accumulate and drive decisions. However, sensory processing in even the earliest sensory cortices can be systematically modified by various external and internal contexts. We recorded from neuronal populations across posterior cortex as mice performed a navigational decision-making task based on accumulating randomly timed pulses of visual evidence. Even in V1, only a small fraction of active neurons had sensory-like responses time-locked to each pulse. Here we focus on how these 'cue-locked' neurons exhibited a variety of amplitude modulations from sensory to cognitive, notably by choice and accumulated evidence. These task-related modulations affected a large fraction of cue-locked neurons across posterior cortex, suggesting that future models of behavior should account for such influences.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/60299</link>
	<content:encoded>Proprioception, the sense of self-movement and position, is mediated by mechanosensory neurons that detect diverse features of body kinematics. Although proprioceptive feedback is crucial for accurate motor control, little is known about how downstream circuits transform limb sensory information to guide motor output. Here, we investigate neural circuits in &lt;i&gt;Drosophila &lt;/i&gt;that process proprioceptive information from the fly leg. We identify three cell-types from distinct developmental lineages that are positioned to receive input from proprioceptor subtypes encoding tibia position, movement, and vibration. 13Bα neurons encode femur-tibia joint angle and mediate postural changes in tibia position. 9Aα neurons also drive changes in leg posture, but encode a combination of directional movement, high frequency vibration, and joint angle. Activating 10Bα neurons, which encode tibia vibration at specific joint angles, elicits pausing in walking flies. Altogether, our results reveal that central circuits integrate information across proprioceptor subtypes to construct complex sensorimotor representations that mediate diverse behaviors, including reflexive control of limb posture and detection of leg vibration.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/60223</link>
	<content:encoded>Sciatic nerve crush injury triggers sterile inflammation within the distal nerve and axotomized dorsal root ganglia (DRGs). Granulocytes and pro-inflammatory Ly6C&lt;sup&gt;high&lt;/sup&gt; monocytes infiltrate the nerve first, and rapidly give way to Ly6C&lt;sup&gt;negative&lt;/sup&gt; inflammation-resolving macrophages. In axotomized DRGs, few hematogenous leukocytes are detected and resident macrophages acquire a ramified morphology. Single-cell RNA-sequencing of injured sciatic nerve identifies five macrophage subpopulations, repair Schwann cells, and mesenchymal precursor cells. Macrophages at the nerve crush site are molecularly distinct from macrophages associated with Wallerian degeneration. In the injured nerve, macrophages 'eat' apoptotic leukocytes, a process called efferocytosis, and thereby promote an anti-inflammatory milieu. Myeloid cells in the injured nerve, but not axotomized DRGs, strongly express receptors for the cytokine GM-CSF. In GM-CSF deficient (&lt;i&gt;Csf2&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt;) mice, inflammation resolution is delayed and conditioning-lesion induced regeneration of DRG neuron central axons is abolished. Thus, carefully orchestrated inflammation resolution in the nerve is required for conditioning-lesion induced neurorepair.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/59404</link>
	<content:encoded>Our understanding of the beads-on-a-string arrangement of nucleosomes has been built largely on high-resolution sequence-agnostic imaging methods and sequence-resolved bulk biochemical techniques. To bridge the divide between these approaches, we present the single-molecule adenine methylated oligonucleosome sequencing assay (SAMOSA). SAMOSA is a high-throughput single-molecule sequencing method that combines adenine methyltransferase footprinting and single-molecule real-time DNA sequencing to natively and nondestructively measure nucleosome positions on individual chromatin fibres. SAMOSA data allows unbiased classification of single-molecular 'states' of nucleosome occupancy on individual chromatin fibres. We leverage this to estimate nucleosome regularity and spacing on single chromatin fibres genome-wide, at predicted transcription factor binding motifs, and across both active and silent human epigenomic domains. Our analyses suggest that chromatin is comprised of a diverse array of both regular and irregular single-molecular oligonucleosome patterns that differ subtly in their relative abundance across epigenomic domains. This irregularity is particularly striking in constitutive heterochromatin, which has typically been viewed as a conformationally static entity. Our proof-of-concept study provides a powerful new methodology for studying nucleosome organization at a previously intractable resolution, and offers up new avenues for modeling and visualizing higher-order chromatin structure.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/58662</link>
	<content:encoded>Ciliary motility is driven by axonemal dyneins that are assembled in the cytoplasm before deployment to cilia. Motile ciliopathy can result from defects in the dyneins themselves or from defects in factors required for their cytoplasmic pre-assembly. Recent work demonstrates that axonemal dyneins, their specific assembly factors, and broadly acting chaperones are concentrated in liquid-like organelles in the cytoplasm called DynAPs (Dynein Axonemal Particles). Here, we use &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; imaging in &lt;i&gt;Xenopus&lt;/i&gt; to show that inner dynein arm (IDA) and outer dynein arm (ODA) subunits are partitioned into non-overlapping sub-regions within DynAPs. Using affinity purification mass-spectrometry of &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; interaction partners, we also identify novel partners for inner and outer dynein arms. Among these, we identify C16orf71/Daap1 as a novel axonemal dynein regulator. Daap1 interacts with ODA subunits, localizes specifically to the cytoplasm, is enriched in DynAPs, and is required for the deployment of ODAs to axonemes. Our work reveals a new complexity in the structure and function of a cell-type specific liquid-like organelle that is directly relevant to human genetic disease.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Predictive models can enhance the salience of unanticipated input. Here, we tested a key potential node in neocortical model formation in this process, layer (L) 6, using behavioral, electrophysiological and imaging methods in mouse primary somatosensory neocortex. We found that deviant stimuli enhanced tactile detection and were encoded in L2/3 neural tuning. To test the contribution of L6, we applied weak optogenetic drive that changed which L6 neurons were sensory responsive, without affecting overall firing rates in L6 or L2/3. This stimulation selectively suppressed behavioral sensitivity to deviant stimuli, without impacting baseline performance. This stimulation also eliminated deviance encoding in L2/3 but did not impair basic stimulus responses across layers. In contrast, stronger L6 drive inhibited firing and suppressed overall sensory function. These findings indicate that, despite their sparse activity, specific ensembles of stimulus driven L6 neurons are required to form neocortical predictions, and to realize their behavioral benefit.</content:encoded>

Biologically-informed neural networks (BINNs), an extension of physics-informed neural networks [1], are introduced and used to discover the underlying dynamics of biological systems from sparse experimental data. In the present work, BINNs are trained in a supervised learning framework to approximate &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; cell biology assay experiments while respecting a generalized form of the governing reaction-diffusion partial differential equation (PDE). By allowing the diffusion and reaction terms to be multilayer perceptrons (MLPs), the nonlinear forms of these terms can be learned while simultaneously converging to the solution of the governing PDE. Further, the trained MLPs are used to guide the selection of biologically interpretable mechanistic forms of the PDE terms which provides new insights into the biological and physical mechanisms that govern the dynamics of the observed system. The method is evaluated on sparse real-world data from wound healing assays with varying initial cell densities [2].&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/ZSkf13jhNqo&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

The propagation of epileptic seizure activity in the brain is a widespread pathophysiology that, in principle, should yield to intervention techniques guided by mathematical models of neuronal ensemble dynamics. During a seizure, neural activity will deviate from its current dynamical regime to one in which there are significant signal fluctuations. &lt;i&gt;In silico&lt;/i&gt; treatments of neural activity are an important tool for the understanding of how the healthy brain can maintain stability, as well as of how pathology can lead to seizures. The hope is that, contained within the mathematical foundations of such treatments, there lie potential strategies for mitigating instabilities, e.g. via external stimulation. Here, we demonstrate that the dynamic causal modelling neuronal state equation generalises to a Fokker-Planck formalism if one extends the framework to model the ways in which activity propagates along the structural connections of neural systems. Using the Jacobian of this generalised state equation, we show that an initially unstable system can be rendered stable via a reduction in diffusivity–i.e., by lowering the rate at which neuronal fluctuations disperse to neighbouring regions. We show, for neural systems prone to epileptic seizures, that such a reduction in diffusivity can be achieved via external stimulation. Specifically, we show that this stimulation should be applied in such a way as to temporarily mirror the activity profile of a pathological region in its functionally connected areas. This counter-intuitive method is intended to be used pre-emptively–i.e., in order to mitigate the effects of the seizure, or ideally even prevent it from occurring in the first place. We offer proof of principle using simulations based on functional neuroimaging data collected from patients with idiopathic generalised epilepsy, in which we successfully suppress pathological activity in a distinct sub-network prior to seizure onset. Our hope is that this technique can form the basis for future real-time monitoring and intervention devices that are capable of treating epilepsy in a non-invasive manner.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/aiaevvSfjSY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Pathogens such as &lt;i&gt;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&lt;/i&gt; advantageously modify animal host physiology, for example, by inhibiting host protein synthesis. Translational inhibition of insects and mammalian hosts by &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;aeruginosa&lt;/i&gt; utilizes the well-known exotoxin A effector. However, for the infection of &lt;i&gt;Caenorhabditis elegans&lt;/i&gt; by &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;aeruginosa&lt;/i&gt;, the precise pathways and mechanism(s) of translational inhibition are not well understood. We found that upon exposure to &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;aeruginosa&lt;/i&gt; PA14, &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;elegans&lt;/i&gt; undergoes a rapid loss of intact ribosomes accompanied by the accumulation of ribosomes cleaved at helix 69 (H69) of the 26S ribosomal RNA (rRNA), a key part of ribosome decoding center. H69 cleavage is elicited by certain virulent &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;aeruginosa&lt;/i&gt; isolates in a quorum sensing (QS)–dependent manner and independently of exotoxin A–mediated translational repression. H69 cleavage is antagonized by the 3 major host defense pathways defined by the &lt;i&gt;pmk-1&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;fshr-1&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;zip-2&lt;/i&gt; genes. The level of H69 cleavage increases with the bacterial exposure time, and it is predominantly localized in the worm’s intestinal tissue. Genetic and genomic analysis suggests that H69 cleavage leads to the activation of the worm’s &lt;i&gt;zip-2&lt;/i&gt;-mediated defense response pathway, consistent with translational inhibition. Taken together, our observations suggest that &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;aeruginosa&lt;/i&gt; deploys a virulence mechanism to induce ribosome degradation and H69 cleavage of host ribosomes. In this manner, &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;aeruginosa&lt;/i&gt; would impair host translation and block antibacterial responses.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/EOwlxU_Y4R4&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Novel coronavirus (severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2: SARS-CoV-2), which originated from Wuhan, China, has spread to the other countries in a short period of time. We report a 47-year-old male who was admitted to our hospital due to suffering from progressive vertigo and ataxia for 7 days prior to the admission. Neurological examination revealed cerebellar dysfunction, and brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) depicted edema of the cerebellar hemisphere associated with leptomeningeal enhancement. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis showed mild lymphocytic pleocytosis, elevated protein, and lactate dehydrogenase. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in the oropharyngeal/nasopharyngeal and CSF specimens. As a result, treatment with lopinavir/ritonavir was initiated, and patient symptoms and signs improved significantly during the course of hospitalization. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case of acute cerebellitis associated with COVID-19 disease which is reported in the literature so far.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Crossed cerebellar diaschisis (CCD) can be associated with impaired cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR) and poor clinical outcome, but whether this holds true for patients with diffuse glioma is unknown. With blood oxygenation level–dependent (BOLD)-CVR imaging, we determined the presence of CCD in patients with diffuse glioma and investigated its relationship with cerebrovascular reactivity and clinical outcome. For eighteen enrolled subjects (nineteen datasets) with diffuse glioma, CCD was deferred from BOLD-CVR using a predetermined cerebellar asymmetry index (CAI) cutoff value of 6.0%. A FET-PET study was done as a verification of the CCD diagnosis. BOLD-CVR values as well as clinical performance scores (i.e., Karnofsky performance score (KPS), disability rating scale (DRS), and modified Rankin scale (mRS)) by BOLD-CVR scan at 3-month clinical follow-up were assessed and compared for the CCD-positive and CCD-negative group. CCD was present in 26.3% of subjects and strongly associated with impaired BOLD-CVR of the affected (i.e., the hemisphere harboring the glioma) and unaffected supratentorial hemisphere (CCD(+) vs. CCD(−): 0.08 ± 0.11 vs. 0.18 ± 0.04; &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.007 and 0.08 ± 0.12 vs. 0.19 ± 0.04; &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.007, respectively). This finding was independent of tumor volume (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.48). Furthermore, poorer initial (by scan) clinical performance scores at follow-up were found for the CCD(+) group. The presence of crossed cerebellar diaschisis in patients with diffuse glioma is associated with impaired supratentorial cerebrovascular reactivity and worse clinical outcome.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL) is primarily characterized by migraine, stroke, mood disturbances, and cognitive decline. Ataxia has seldom been reported as a presenting symptom. Here, we review reports of CADASIL presenting as ataxia and compare these to the first pathologically confirmed case of CADASIL presenting with progressive ataxia. A 50-year-old woman presented with progressive truncal ataxia. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed white matter hyperintensities in the bilateral anterior temporal lobes, external capsules, and periventricular areas, but not the cerebellum. Electron microscopy of skin biopsy material revealed multiple granular osmiophilic materials. Genetic testing confirmed a c.4552C &amp;gt; A mutation in exon 25 of the &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;NOTCH3&lt;/em&gt; gene. CADASIL is a rare cause of progressive ataxia, and only four cases of CADASIL presenting with ataxia have been reported in the literature. We also discuss the possible pathophysiology of cerebellar ataxia associated with CADASIL.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Balance control is essential to maintain a stable body position and to prevent falls. The aim of this study was to determine whether balance control could be improved by using cerebellar transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) and visual feedback in a combined approach. A total of 90 healthy volunteers were randomly assigned to six groups defined by the delivery of tDCS (cathodal or anodal or sham) and the provision or not of visual feedback on balance during the acquisition phase. tDCS was delivered over the cerebellar hemisphere ipsilateral to the dominant leg for 20 min at 2 mA during a unipedal stance task. Body sway (i.e., ankle angle and hip position) was measured as an overall maximal unit in anteroposterior and mediolateral direction, together with participant rating of perception of stability, before (baseline), during (acquisition), and after (final) the intervention. We found a reduction in body sway during the acquisition session when visual feedback alone was provided. When the visual feedback was removed (final session), however, body sway increased above baseline. Differently, the reduction in overall maximal body sway was maintained during the final session when the delivery of cathodal tDCS and visual feedback was combined. These findings suggest that cathodal tDCS may support the short-term maintenance of the positive effects of visual feedback on balance and provide the basis for a new approach to optimize balance control, with potential translational implications for the elderly and patients with impaired posture control.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Predictive coding accounts of action perception sustain that kinematics information is compared with contextual top-down predictions (i.e., priors) to understand actions in conditions of perceptual ambiguity. It has been previously shown that the cerebellum contributes to motor simulation of observed actions. Here, we tested the hypothesis that a specific contribution of the cerebellum to action perception is to provide contextual priors that guide the sampling of perceptual kinematic information. To this aim, we compared the performance of 42 patients with childhood brain tumor affecting infratentorial (ITT) or supratentorial (STT) areas with that of peers with typical development in an action prediction task. First, participants were exposed to videos depicting a child performing different reaching-to-grasp actions, which were associated with contextual cues in a probabilistic fashion. Then, they were presented with shortened versions of the same videos and asked to infer the action outcome; since kinematics was ambiguous, we expected their responses would be biased toward the previously learned contextual priors. We found that patients with brain tumor were impaired in predicting actions when compared to healthy controls. However, STT patients presented a reliable probabilistic effect, while ITT patients, who had cerebellar damage, did not rely on contextual priors in predicting actions. Furthermore, we found an association between the use of contextual priors and the ability to infer others’ mental states as assessed by a standardized test. These results suggest that the cerebellum provides contextual priors to understand others’ actions and this predictive function might underlie complex social cognition abilities.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>The Cerebellum: Cerebellar Intermittent Theta-Burst Stimulation Combined with Vestibular Rehabilitation Improves Gait and Balance in Patients with Multiple Sclerosis: a Preliminary Double-Blind Randomized Controlled Trial</title>

	<content:encoded>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Difficulties in gait and balance disorders are among the most common mobility limitations in multiple sclerosis (MS), mainly due to a damage of cerebellar circuits. Moreover, the cerebellum plays a critical role in promoting new motor tasks, which is an essential function for neurorehabilitation. In this study, we investigated the effects of cerebellar intermittent theta burst stimulation (c-iTBS), a high-frequency rTMS protocol able to increase cerebellar activity, on gait and balance in a sample of 20 hospitalized participants with MS, undergoing vestibular rehabilitation (VR), an exercise-based program primarily designed to reduce vertigo and dizziness, gaze instability, and/or imbalance and falls in MS. Patients were assigned to receive either c-iTBS or sham iTBS before being treated with VR during 2 weeks. VR consisted of two types of training: gaze stability and postural stability exercises. The primary outcome measure was the change from baseline in the Tinetti Balance and Gait scale (TBG). The secondary outcome measures were changes from baseline in Berg Balance Scale (BBS), Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS), Two Minute Walking Test (2MWT), and Timed 25-ft walk test (T25FW) scales. MS patients treated with c-iTBS-VR showed a significant improvement in the TBG as compared to patients treated with sham iTBS-VR. Moreover, MS patients in the c-iTBS groups showed better performances in the vestibular-ocular reflex exercises. Combined c-iTBS and VR improves gait and balance abilities more than standard VR treatment in MS patients with a high level of disability.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>The Cerebellum: Effects of Cerebellar tDCS on Inhibitory Control: Evidence from a Go/NoGo Task</title>
	<link>http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s12311-020-01165-z</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Response inhibition as an executive function refers to the ability to suppress inappropriate but prepotent responses. Several brain regions have been implicated in the process underlying inhibitory control, including the cerebellum. The aim of the present study was to explore the role of the cerebellum in executive functioning, particularly in response inhibition. For this purpose, we transitorily inhibited cerebellar activity by means of cathodal tDCS and studied the effects of this inhibition on ERP components elicited during a Go/NoGo task in healthy subjects. Sixteen healthy subjects underwent a Go/NoGo task prior to and after cathodal and sham cerebellar tDCS in separate sessions. A reduction in N2-NoGo amplitude and a prolongation in N2-NoGo latency emerged after cathodal tDCS whereas no differences were detected after sham stimulation. Moreover, commission errors in NoGo trials were significantly higher after cathodal tDCS than at the basal evaluation. No differences emerged between performances in Go trials and those after sham stimulation. These data indicate that cerebellar inhibition following cathodal stimulation alters the ability to allocate attentional resources to stimuli containing conflict information and the inhibitory control. The cerebellum may regulate the attentional mechanisms of stimulus orientation and inhibitory control both directly, by making predictions of errors or behaviors related to errors, and indirectly, by controlling the functioning of the cerebral cortical areas involved in the perception of conflict signals and of the basal ganglia involved in the inhibitory control of movement.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>The Cerebellum: Is Purkinje Neuron Hyperpolarisation Important for Cerebellar Synaptic Plasticity? A Retrospective and Prospective Analysis</title>

	<content:encoded>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Two recent studies have demonstrated that the dendritic Ca&lt;sup class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; signal associated with a climbing fibre (CF) input to the cerebellar Purkinje neuron (PN) depends on the membrane potential (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;V&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;). Specifically, when the cell is hyperpolarised, this signal is mediated by T-type voltage-gated Ca&lt;sup class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; channels; in contrast, when the cell is firing, the CF-PN signal is mediated by P/Q-type voltage-gated Ca&lt;sup class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; channels. When the CF input is paired with parallel fibre (PF) activity, the signal is locally amplified at the sites of PF-activated synapses according to the &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;V&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; at the time of the CF input, suggesting that the standing &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;V&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; is a critical parameter for the induction of PF synaptic plasticity. In this review, I analyse how the &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;V&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; can potentially play a role in cerebellar learning focussing, in particular, on the hyperpolarised state that appears to occur episodically, since PNs are mostly firing under physiological conditions. By revisiting the recent literature reporting in vivo recordings and synaptic plasticity studies, I speculate on how a putative role of the PN &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;V&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; can provide an interpretation for the results of these studies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;The objective of this study was to investigate lobule-specific cerebellar structural alterations relevant to clinical behavioral characteristics of Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS). We performed a case-control study of 21 Japanese individuals with PWS (age; median 21.0, range 13–50 years, 14 males, 7 females) and 40 age- and sex-matched healthy controls with typical development. Participants underwent 3-Tesla magnetic resonance imaging. Three-dimensional T&lt;sub class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-weighted images were assessed for cerebellar lobular volume and adjusted for total intracerebellar volume (TIV) using a spatially unbiased atlas template to give a relative volume ratio. A region of interest analysis included the deep cerebellar nuclei. A correlation analysis was performed between the volumetric data and the clinical behavioral scores derived from the standard questionnaires (hyperphagia, autism, obsession, and maladaptive index) for global intelligence assessment in paired subgroups. In individuals with PWS, TIV was significantly reduced compared with that of controls (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05, family-wise error corrected; mean [standard deviation], 1014.1 [93.0] mm&lt;sup class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;). Decreased relative lobular volume ratios were observed in posterior inferior lobules with age, sex, and TIV as covariates (Crus I, Crus II, lobules VIIb, VIIIa, VIIIb, and IX). However, increased ratios were found in the dentate nuclei bilaterally in individuals with PWS (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.01); the mean (standard deviation) × 10&lt;sup class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt; was as follows: left, 1.58 (0.26); right, 1.67 (0.30). The altered lobular volume ratios showed negative correlations with hyperphagic and autistic characteristics and positive correlations with obsessive and intellectual characteristics. This study provides the first objective evidence of topographic patterns of volume differences in cerebellar structures consistent with clinical behavioral characteristics in individuals with PWS and strongly suggests a cerebellar contribution to altered functional brain connectivity in PWS.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Reading in children has been associated with microstructural properties of the cerebellar peduncles, the white matter pathways connecting the cerebellum to the cerebrum. In this study, we used two independent neuroimaging modalities to assess which features of the cerebellar peduncles would be associated with reading. Twenty-three 8-year-old children were evaluated on word reading efficiency and imaged using diffusion MRI (dMRI) and quantitative T1 relaxometry (qT1). We segmented the superior (SCP), middle, and inferior cerebellar peduncles and extracted two metrics: fractional anisotropy (FA) from dMRI and R1 from qT1. Tract-FA was significantly correlated with tract-R1 in left and right SCPs (left: &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;r&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;P&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;(21) = .63, right: &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;r&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;P&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;(21) = .76, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; ≤ .001) suggesting that FA of these peduncles, at least in part, indexed myelin content. Tract-FA and tract R1 were not correlated in the other cerebellar peduncles. Reading efficiency negatively correlated with tract-FA of the left (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;r&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;P&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;(21) = − .43, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = .040) and right SCP (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;r&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;P&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;(21) = − .37, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = .079). Reading efficiency did not correlate with tract-R1 in the SCPs. The negative association of reading efficiency with tract-FA and the lack of association of reading efficiency with tract-R1 implicate properties other than myelin content as relevant to the information flow between the cerebellum and the cerebrum for individual differences in reading skills in children.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>The Cerebellum: Essential Tremor Within the Broader Context of Other Forms of Cerebellar Degeneration</title>
	<link>http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s12311-020-01160-4</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Essential tremor (ET) has recently been reconceptualized by many as a degenerative disease of the cerebellum. Until now, though, there has been no attempt to frame it within the context of these diseases. Here, we compare the clinical and postmortem features of ET with other cerebellar degenerations, thereby placing it within the broader context of these diseases. Action tremor is the hallmark feature of ET. Although often underreported in the spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs), action tremors occur, and it is noteworthy that in SCA12 and 15, they are highly prevalent, often severe, and can be the earliest disease manifestation, resulting in an initial diagnosis of ET in many cases. Intention tremor, sometimes referred to as “cerebellar tremor,” is a common feature of ET and many SCAs. Other features of cerebellar dysfunction, gait ataxia and eye motion abnormalities, are seen to a mild degree in ET and more markedly in SCAs. Several SCAs (e.g., SCA5, 6, 14, and 15), like ET, follow a milder and more protracted disease course. In ET, numerous postmortem changes have been localized to the cerebellum and are largely confined to the cerebellar cortex, preserving the cerebellar nuclei. Purkinje cell loss is modest. Similarly, in SCA3, 12, and 15, Purkinje cell loss is limited, and in SCA12 and 15, there is preservation of cerebellar nuclei and relative sparing of other central nervous system regions. Both clinically and pathologically, there are numerous similarities and intersection points between ET and other disorders of cerebellar degeneration.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>The Cerebellum: GIRK1-Mediated Inwardly Rectifying Potassium Current Is a Candidate Mechanism Behind Purkinje Cell Excitability, Plasticity, and Neuromodulation</title>

	<content:encoded>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;G-protein-coupled inwardly rectifying potassium (GIRK) channels contribute to the resting membrane potential of many neurons and play an important role in controlling neuronal excitability. Although previous studies have revealed a high expression of GIRK subunits in the cerebellum, their functional role has never been clearly described. Using patch-clamp recordings in mice cerebellar slices, we examined the properties of the GIRK currents in Purkinje cells (PCs) and investigated the effects of a selective agonist of GIRK1-containing channels, ML297 (ML), on PC firing and synaptic plasticity. We demonstrated that GIRK channel activation decreases the PC excitability by inhibiting both sodium and calcium spikes and, in addition, modulates the complex spike response evoked by climbing fiber stimulation. Our results indicate that GIRK channels have also a marked effect on synaptic plasticity of the parallel fiber-PC synapse, as the application of ML297 increased the expression of LTP while preventing LTD. We, therefore, propose that the recruitment of GIRK channels represents a crucial mechanism by which neuromodulators can control synaptic strength and membrane conductance for proper refinement of the neural network involved in memory storage and higher cognitive functions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Cerebellar involvement in major depressive disorder (MDD) has been demonstrated by a growing number of studies, but it is unknown whether cognitive functioning in depressed individuals is related to cerebellar gray matter volume (GMV) abnormalities. Impaired attention and executive dysfunction are characteristic cognitive deficits in MDD, and critically, they often persist despite remission of mood symptoms. In this study, we investigated cerebellar GMV in patients with remitted MDD (rMDD) that showed persistent cognitive impairment. We applied cerebellum-optimized voxel-based morphometry in 37 patients with rMDD and with cognitive deficits, in 12 patients with rMDD and without cognitive deficits, and in 36 healthy controls (HC). Compared with HC, rMDD patients with cognitive deficits had lower GMV in left area VIIA, crus II, and in vermal area VIIB. In patients with rMDD, regression analyses demonstrated significant associations between GMV reductions in both regions and impaired attention and executive dysfunction. Compared with HC, patients without cognitive deficits showed increased GMV in bilateral area VIIIB. This study supports cerebellar contributions to the cognitive dimension of MDD. The data also point towards cerebellar area VII as a potential target for non-invasive brain stimulation to treat cognitive deficits related to MDD.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;The traditional view on the cerebellum is that it controls motor behavior. Although recent work has revealed that the cerebellum supports also nonmotor functions such as cognition and affect, only during the last 5 years it has become evident that the cerebellum also plays an important social role. This role is evident in social cognition based on interpreting goal-directed actions through the movements of individuals (social “mirroring”) which is very close to its original role in motor learning, as well as in social understanding of other individuals’ mental state, such as their intentions, beliefs, past behaviors, future aspirations, and personality traits (social “mentalizing”). Most of this mentalizing role is supported by the posterior cerebellum (e.g., Crus I and II). The most dominant hypothesis is that the cerebellum assists in learning and understanding social action sequences, and so facilitates social cognition by supporting optimal predictions about imminent or future social interaction and cooperation. This consensus paper brings together experts from different fields to discuss recent efforts in understanding the role of the cerebellum in social cognition, and the understanding of social behaviors and mental states by others, its effect on clinical impairments such as cerebellar ataxia and autism spectrum disorder, and how the cerebellum can become a potential target for noninvasive brain stimulation as a therapeutic intervention. We report on the most recent empirical findings and techniques for understanding and manipulating cerebellar circuits in humans. Cerebellar circuitry appears now as a key structure to elucidate social interactions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Schizophrenia (SCZ) is a multifactorial disorder caused by environmental and genetic factors. Studies have shown that various single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the binding sites of microRNAs contribute to the risk of developing SCZ. We aimed to investigate whether the variants located in the 3′-UTR region of &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;LIF&lt;/em&gt; (rs929271T&amp;gt;G) and &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;ATF6B&lt;/em&gt; (rs8283G&amp;gt;A) were associated with increased susceptibility to SCZ in a population from the south-east of Iran. In this case-control study, a total of 396 subjects were recruited. SNPs were genotyped via polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) method. Genotyping results showed that the G allele of rs929271 significantly increased the risk of SCZ (OR = 1.58 95%CI = 1.19–2.10, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.001). As for rs929271, the GG genotype of co-dominant (OR = 2.54 95%CI = 1.39–4.64, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.002) and recessive (OR = 2.91 95%CI = 1.77–4.80, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001) models were strongly linked to SCZ. No significant differences were observed between rs8283 polymorphism and predisposition to SCZ. In silico analyses predicted that rs929271 might alter the binding sites of microRNAs, which was believed to have an unclear role in the development of SCZ. Moreover, rs929271 polymorphism changed the &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;LIF&lt;/em&gt;-mRNA folding structure. These findings provide fine pieces of evidence regarding the possible effects of &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;LIF&lt;/em&gt; polymorphism in the development of SCZ and regulation of the &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;LIF&lt;/em&gt; gene targeted by microRNAs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;TBL1XR1&lt;/em&gt; is a member of the WD40 repeat-containing gene family. Mutations of &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;TBL1XR1&lt;/em&gt; have been reported in neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs). Although the phenotypes of some patients have been described in single studies, few studies have reviewed the genotype and phenotype relationships using a relatively large cohort of patients with &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;TBL1XR1&lt;/em&gt; mutations. Herein, we report a new de novo frameshift mutation in &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;TBL1XR1&lt;/em&gt; (NM_024665.4, c.388_389delAC, p.T130Sfs*14) in a patient with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). To explore the correlations between genotypes and phenotypes for &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;TBL1XR1&lt;/em&gt; in NDDs, we manually curated and analyzed 38 variants and the associated phenotypes from 50 individuals with NDDs. &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;TBL1XR1&lt;/em&gt; mutations lead to a wide range of phenotypic defects. We conclude that the most common phenotypes associated with &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;TBL1XR1&lt;/em&gt; mutations were language and motor developmental delay, intellectual disabilities, facial deformity, hypotonia, and microcephaly. Our study provides a comprehensive spectrum of neurodevelopmental phenotypes caused by &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;TBL1XR1&lt;/em&gt; mutations, which is important for genetic diagnosis and precision clinical management.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Molecular Neuroscience: The New CIC Mutation Associates with Mental Retardation and Severity of Seizure in Turkish Child with a Rare Class I Glucose-6-Phosphate Dehydrogenase Deficiency</title>
	<link>http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s12031-020-01614-8</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency is an X-linked recessive disease that causes acute or chronic hemolytic anemia and potentially leads to severe jaundice in response to oxidative agents. Capicua transcriptional repressor (CIC) is an important gene associated with mental retardation, autosomal dominant 45. Affiliated tissues including skin, brain, bone, and related phenotypes are intellectual disability and seizures. Clinical, biochemical, and whole exome analysis are carried out in a Turkish family. Mutation analysis of G6PD and CIC genes by Sanger sequencing in the whole family was carried out to reveal the effect of these mutations on the patient’s clinical outcome. Here, we present the case of epilepsy in an 8-year-old child with a hemizygous variation in G6PD gene and heterozygous mutation in CIC gene, resulting in focal epileptiform activity and hypsarrhythmia in electroencephalography (EEG), seizures, psychomotor retardation, speech impairment, intellectual disability, developmental regression, and learning difficulties. Whole exome sequencing confirmed the diagnosis of X-linked increased susceptibility for hemolytic anemia due to G6PD deficiency and mental retardation type 45 due to CIC variant, which explained the development of epileptic seizures. Considering CIC variant and relevant relation with the severity and course of the disease, G6PD mutations sustained through the family are defined as hereditary. Our findings could represent the importance of variants found in G6PD as well as CIC genes linked to the severity of epilepsy, which was presumed based on the significant changes in protein configuration.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Looking Beyond the Core: The Role of Flanking Regions in the Aggregation of Amyloidogenic Peptides and Proteins</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.611285</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Amyloid proteins are involved in many neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease [Tau, Amyloid β (Aβ)], Parkinson’s disease [alpha-synuclein (αSyn)], and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (TDP-43). Driven by the early observation of the presence of ordered structure within amyloid fibrils and the potential to develop inhibitors of their formation, a major goal of the amyloid field has been to elucidate the structure of the amyloid fold at atomic resolution. This has now been achieved for a wide variety of sequences using solid-state NMR, microcrystallography, X-ray fiber diffraction and cryo-electron microscopy. These studies, together with in silico methods able to predict aggregation-prone regions (APRs) in protein sequences, have provided a wealth of information about the ordered fibril cores that comprise the amyloid fold. Structural and kinetic analyses have also shown that amyloidogenic proteins often contain less well-ordered sequences outside of the amyloid core (termed here as flanking regions) that modulate function, toxicity and/or aggregation rates. These flanking regions, which often form a dynamically disordered “fuzzy coat” around the fibril core, have been shown to play key parts in the physiological roles of functional amyloids, including the binding of RNA and in phase separation. They are also the mediators of chaperone binding and membrane binding/disruption in toxic amyloid assemblies. Here, we review the role of flanking regions in different proteins spanning both functional amyloid and amyloid in disease, in the context of their role in aggregation, toxicity and cellular (dys)function. Understanding the properties of these regions could provide new opportunities to target disease-related aggregation without disturbing critical biological functions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Altered Intrinsic and Casual Functional Connectivities of the Middle Temporal Visual Motion Area Subregions in Chess Experts</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.605986</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;An outstanding chess player needs to accumulate massive visual and spatial information for chess configurations. Visual motion area (MT) is considered as a brain region specialized for visual motion perception and visuospatial attention processing. However, how long-term chess training shapes the functional connectivity patterns of MT, especially its functional subregions, has rarely been investigated. In our study, using resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) and Granger causality analysis (GCA), we studied the changed functional couplings of MT subregions between 28 chess master players and 27 gender- and age-matched healthy novices to reveal the neural basis of long-term professional chess training. RSFC analysis identified decreased functional connections between right dorsal-anterior subregion (CI1.R) and left angular gyrus, and increased functional connections between right ventral-anterior MT subregion (CI2.R) and right superior temporal gyrus in chess experts. Moreover, GCA analyses further found increased mutual interactions of left angular gyrus and CI1.R in chess experts compared to novice players. These findings demonstrate that long-term professional chess training could enhance spatial perception and reconfiguration and semantic processing efficiency for superior performance.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.603373</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Signaling from the synapse to nucleus is mediated by the integration and propagation of both membrane potential changes (postsynaptic potentials) and intracellular second messenger cascades. The electrical propagation of postsynaptic potentials allows for rapid neural information processing, while propagating second messenger pathways link synaptic activity to the transcription of genes required for neuronal survival and adaptive changes (plasticity) underlying circuit formation and learning. The propagation of activity-induced calcium signals to the cell nucleus is a major synapse-to-nucleus communication pathway. Neuronal PAS domain protein 4 (Npas4) is a recently discovered calcium-dependent transcription factor that regulates the activation of genes involved in the homeostatic regulation of excitatory–inhibitory balance, which is critical for neural circuit formation, function, and ongoing plasticity, as well as for defense against diseases such as epilepsy. Here, we summarize recent findings on the neuroprotective functions of Npas4 and the potential of Npas4 as a therapeutic target for the treatment of acute and chronic diseases of the central nervous system.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neural Technology: Impact of Stimulus Features on the Performance of a Gaze-Independent Brain-Computer Interface Based on Covert Spatial Attention Shifts</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.591777</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Regaining communication abilities in patients who are unable to speak or move is one of the main goals in decoding brain waves for brain-computer interface (BCI) control. Many BCI approaches designed for communication rely on attention to visual stimuli, commonly applying an oddball paradigm, and require both eye movements and adequate visual acuity. These abilities may, however, be absent in patients who depend on BCI communication. We have therefore developed a response-based communication BCI, which is independent of gaze shifts but utilizes covert shifts of attention to the left or right visual field. We recorded the electroencephalogram (EEG) from 29 channels and coregistered the vertical and horizontal electrooculogram. Data-driven decoding of small attention-based differences between the hemispheres, also known as N2pc, was performed using 14 posterior channels, which are expected to reflect correlates of visual spatial attention. Eighteen healthy participants responded to 120 statements by covertly directing attention to one of two colored symbols (green and red crosses for “yes” and “no,” respectively), presented in the user’s left and right visual field, respectively, while maintaining central gaze fixation. On average across participants, 88.5% (std: 7.8%) of responses were correctly decoded online. In order to investigate the potential influence of stimulus features on accuracy, we presented the symbols with different visual angles, by altering symbol size and eccentricity. The offline analysis revealed that stimulus features have a minimal impact on the controllability of the BCI. Hence, we show with our novel approach that spatial attention to a colored symbol is a robust method with which to control a BCI, which has the potential to support severely paralyzed people with impaired eye movements and low visual acuity in communicating with their environment.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Neuronal–Glial Interaction in a Triple-Transgenic Mouse Model of Alzheimer’s Disease: Gene Ontology and Lithium Pathways</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.579984</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Neuronal-glial interactions are critical for brain homeostasis, and disruption of this process may lead to excessive glial activation and inadequate pro-inflammatory responses. Abnormalities in neuronal-glial interactions have been reported in the pathophysiology of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), where lithium has been shown to exert neuroprotective effects, including the up-regulation of cytoprotective proteins. In the present study, we characterize by Gene Ontology (GO) the signaling pathways related to neuronal-glial interactions in response to lithium in a triple-transgenic mouse model of AD (3×-TgAD). Mice were treated for 8 months with lithium carbonate (Li) supplemented to chow, using two dose ranges to yield subtherapeutic working concentrations (Li1, 1.0 g/kg; and Li2, 2.0 g/kg of chow), or with standard chow (Li0). The hippocampi were removed and analyzed by proteomics. A neuronal-glial interaction network was created by a systematic literature search, and the selected genes were submitted to STRING, a functional network to analyze protein interactions. Proteomics data and neuronal-glial interactomes were compared by GO using ClueGo (Cytoscape plugin) with p ≤ 0.05. The proportional effects of neuron-glia interactions were determined on three GO domains: (i) biological process; (ii) cellular component; and (iii) molecular function. The gene ontology of this enriched network of genes was further stratified according to lithium treatments, with statistically significant effects observed in the Li2 group (as compared to controls) for the GO domains biological process and cellular component. In the former, there was an even distribution of the interactions occurring at the following functions: “positive regulation of protein localization to membrane,” “regulation of protein localization to cell periphery,” “oligodendrocyte differentiation,” and “regulation of protein localization to plasma membrane.” In cellular component, interactions were also balanced for “myelin sheath” and “rough endoplasmic reticulum.” We conclude that neuronal-glial interactions are implicated in the neuroprotective response mediated by lithium in the hippocampus of AD-transgenic mice. The effect of lithium on homeostatic pathways mediated by the interaction between neurons and glial cells are implicated in membrane permeability, protein synthesis and DNA repair, which may be relevant for the survival of nerve cells amidst AD pathology.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neural Technology: WAUC: A Multi-Modal Database for Mental Workload Assessment Under Physical Activity</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.549524</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Assessment of mental workload is crucial for applications that require sustained attention and where conditions such as mental fatigue and drowsiness must be avoided. Previous work that attempted to devise objective methods to model mental workload were mainly based on neurological or physiological data collected when the participants performed tasks that did not involve physical activity. While such models may be useful for scenarios that involve static operators, they may not apply in real-world situations where operators are performing tasks under varying levels of physical activity, such as those faced by first responders, firefighters, and police officers. Here, we describe WAUC, a multimodal database of mental Workload Assessment Under physical aCtivity. The study involved 48 participants who performed the NASA Revised Multi-Attribute Task Battery II under three different activity level conditions. Physical activity was manipulated by changing the speed of a stationary bike or a treadmill. During data collection, six neural and physiological modalities were recorded, namely: electroencephalography, electrocardiography, breathing rate, skin temperature, galvanic skin response, and blood volume pulse, in addition to 3-axis accelerometry. Moreover, participants were asked to answer the NASA Task Load Index questionnaire after each experimental section, as well as rate their physical fatigue level on the Borg fatigue scale. In order to bring our experimental setup closer to real-world situations, all signals were monitored using wearable, off-the-shelf devices. In this paper, we describe the adopted experimental protocol, as well as validate the subjective, neural, and physiological data collected. The WAUC database, including the raw data and features, subjective ratings, and scripts to reproduce the experiments reported herein will be made available at: http://musaelab.ca/resources/.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Alterations of Functional Connectivity During the Resting State and Their Associations With Visual Memory in College Students Who Binge Drink</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.600437</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;This study investigated the characteristics of neural oscillation and functional connectivity (FC) in college students engaging in binge drinking (BD) using resting-state electroencephalography (EEG). Also, the associations of visual memory, evaluated by the Rey-Osterrieth Complex Figure Test (RCFT), and neural oscillation with FC during the resting state were investigated. The BD (n = 35) and non-BD (n = 35) groups were selected based on scores of the Korean version of the Alcohol use disorders (AUDs) Identification Test and the Alcohol Use Questionnaire. EEG was performed for 6 min while the participants rested with eyes closed. The theta, lower-alpha, and upper alpha powers did not differ between the BD and non-BD groups. Concerning FC, the BD group exhibited stronger theta coherence than that of the non-BD group, and in the lower and upper alpha bands, the BD group showed stronger coherence in some areas but weaker coherence in others compared with the non-BD group. However, these significant results were not observed after Bonferroni correction. The BD group showed significantly lower delayed recall scores on the RCFT than did the non-BD group. A positive correlation between the left prefrontal-parietal-occipital midline connection and performance on the delayed recall of the RCFT was observed in the BD group. The present results could suggest that binge drinkers have alterations in brain FC, which may be related to their visual memory deficits.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Vesicular Release of GABA by Mammalian Horizontal Cells Mediates Inhibitory Output to Photoreceptors</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.600777</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Feedback inhibition by horizontal cells regulates rod and cone photoreceptor calcium channels that control their release of the neurotransmitter glutamate. This inhibition contributes to synaptic gain control and the formation of the center-surround antagonistic receptive fields passed on to all downstream neurons, which is important for contrast sensitivity and color opponency in vision. In contrast to the plasmalemmal GABA transporter found in non-mammalian horizontal cells, there is evidence that the mechanism by which mammalian horizontal cells inhibit photoreceptors involves the vesicular release of the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA. Historically, inconsistent findings of GABA and its biosynthetic enzyme, L-glutamate decarboxylase (GAD) in horizontal cells, and the apparent lack of surround response block by GABAergic agents diminished support for GABA's role in feedback inhibition. However, the immunolocalization of the vesicular GABA transporter (VGAT) in the dendritic and axonal endings of horizontal cells that innervate photoreceptor terminals suggested GABA was released via vesicular exocytosis. To test the idea that GABA is released from vesicles, we localized GABA and GAD, multiple SNARE complex proteins, synaptic vesicle proteins, and Ca&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt; channels that mediate exocytosis to horizontal cell dendritic tips and axonal terminals. To address the perceived relative paucity of synaptic vesicles in horizontal cell endings, we used conical electron tomography on mouse and guinea pig retinas that revealed small, clear-core vesicles, along with a few clathrin-coated vesicles and endosomes in horizontal cell processes within photoreceptor terminals. Some small-diameter vesicles were adjacent to the plasma membrane and plasma membrane specializations. To assess vesicular release, a functional assay involving incubation of retinal slices in luminal VGAT-C antibodies demonstrated vesicles fused with the membrane in a depolarization- and calcium-dependent manner, and these labeled vesicles can fuse multiple times. Finally, targeted elimination of VGAT in horizontal cells resulted in a loss of tonic, autaptic GABA currents, and of inhibitory feedback modulation of the cone photoreceptor Ca&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;, consistent with the elimination of GABA release from horizontal cell endings. These results in mammalian retina identify the central role of vesicular release of GABA from horizontal cells in the feedback inhibition of photoreceptors.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Neuroimaging biomarkers of CSVD including high-grade white matter hyperintensity (HWMH), cerebral microbleed (CMB), enlarged perivascular space (PVS), and lacunar infarct (LI) were identified and CSVD burden was calculated. Cases were grouped accordingly as mild, moderate, or severe. The DMV was divided into six segments according to the regional anatomy.

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Individual Differences in Interoceptive Accuracy Are Correlated With Salience Network Connectivity in Older Adults</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.592002</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Interoceptive accuracy refers to the ability to consciously perceive the physical condition of the inner body, including one’s heartbeat. In younger adults, interoceptive accuracy is correlated with insular and orbitofrontal cortical connectivity within the salience network (SN). As interoceptive accuracy and insular cortex volume are known to decrease with aging, we aimed to evaluate the correlation between SN connectivity and interoceptive accuracy in older adults. 27 older adults (mean age, 77.29 years, SD = 6.24; 19 female) underwent resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging, followed by a heartbeat counting task and neuropsychological test. We evaluated the correlation between interoceptive accuracy and SN connectivity with age, sex, cognitive function, and total gray matter volume as covariates. Region of interest-to-region of interest analyses showed that interoceptive accuracy was positively correlated with the functional connectivity (FC) of the left rostral prefrontal cortex with the right insular, right orbitofrontal, and anterior cingulate cortices [F(6,16) = 4.52, false discovery rate (FDR)-corrected p &amp;lt; 0.05]. Moreover, interoceptive accuracy was negatively correlated to the FC of the left anterior insular cortex with right intra-calcarine and visual medial cortices (F(6,16) = 2.04, FDR-corrected p &amp;lt; 0.10). These findings suggest that coordination between systems, with a positive correlation between left rostral prefrontal cortex and the SN and a negative correlation between left insular cortex and vision-related exteroceptive brain regions, is important for maintaining interoceptive accuracy in older adults.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

We derive and validate a novel and analytic method for estimating the probability that an epidemic has been eliminated (i.e. that no future local cases will emerge) in real time. When this probability crosses 0.95 an outbreak can be declared over with 95% confidence. Our method is easy to compute, only requires knowledge of the incidence curve and the serial interval distribution, and evaluates the statistical lifetime of the outbreak of interest. Using this approach, we show how the time-varying under-reporting of infected cases will artificially inflate the inferred probability of elimination, leading to premature (false-positive) end-of-epidemic declarations. Contrastingly, we prove that incorrectly identifying imported cases as local will deceptively decrease this probability, resulting in delayed (false-negative) declarations. Failing to sustain intensive surveillance during the later phases of an epidemic can therefore substantially mislead policymakers on when it is safe to remove travel bans or relax quarantine and social distancing advisories. World Health Organisation guidelines recommend fixed (though disease-specific) waiting times for end-of-epidemic declarations that cannot accommodate these variations. Consequently, there is an unequivocal need for more active and specialised metrics for reliably identifying the conclusion of an epidemic.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/UQTLQxspjDI&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

One of the hallmarks of cancer is the extremely high mutability and genetic instability of tumor cells. Inherent heterogeneity of intra-tumor populations manifests itself in high variability of clone instability rates. Analogously to fitness landscapes, the instability rates of clonal populations form their mutability landscapes. Here, we present MULAN (MUtability LANdscape inference), a maximum-likelihood computational framework for inference of mutation rates of individual cancer subclones using single-cell sequencing data. It utilizes the partial information about the orders of mutation events provided by cancer mutation trees and extends it by inferring full evolutionary history and mutability landscape of a tumor. Evaluation of mutation rates on the level of subclones rather than individual genes allows to capture the effects of genomic interactions and epistasis. We estimate the accuracy of our approach and demonstrate that it can be used to study the evolution of genetic instability and infer tumor evolutionary history from experimental data. MULAN is available at https://github.com/compbel/MULAN.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/8vLqzOurG9E&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Deconvolution of heterogeneous tumor samples using partial reference signals</title>

Deconvolution of heterogeneous bulk tumor samples into distinct cellular populations is an important yet challenging problem, particularly when only partial references are available. A common approach to dealing with this problem is to deconvolve the mixed signals using available references and leverage the remaining signal as a new cell component. However, as indicated in our simulation, such an approach tends to over-estimate the proportions of known cell types and fails to detect novel cell types. Here, we propose PREDE, a partial reference-based deconvolution method using an iterative non-negative matrix factorization algorithm. Our method is verified to be effective in estimating cell proportions and expression profiles of unknown cell types based on simulated datasets at a variety of parameter settings. Applying our method to TCGA tumor samples, we found that proportions of pure cancer cells better indicate different subtypes of tumor samples. We also detected several cell types for each cancer type whose proportions successfully predicted patient survival. Our method makes a significant contribution to deconvolution of heterogeneous tumor samples and could be widely applied to varieties of high throughput bulk data. PREDE is implemented in R and is freely available from GitHub (https://xiaoqizheng.github.io/PREDE).&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/0eqxhZomecE&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Inter-hospital patient transfers (direct transfers) between healthcare facilities have been shown to contribute to the spread of pathogens in a healthcare network. However, the impact of indirect transfers (patients re-admitted from the community to the same or different hospital) is not well studied. This work aims to study the contribution of indirect transfers to the spread of pathogens in a healthcare network. To address this aim, a hybrid network–deterministic model to simulate the spread of multiresistant pathogens in a healthcare system was developed for the region of Lower Saxony (Germany). The model accounts for both, direct and indirect transfers of patients. Intra-hospital pathogen transmission is governed by a SIS model expressed by a system of ordinary differential equations. Our results show that the proposed model reproduces the basic properties of healthcare-associated pathogen spread. They also show the importance of indirect transfers: restricting the pathogen spread to direct transfers only leads to 4.2% system wide prevalence. However, adding indirect transfers leads to an increase in the overall prevalence by a factor of 4 (18%). In addition, we demonstrated that the final prevalence in the individual healthcare facilities depends on average length of stay in a way described by a non-linear concave function. Moreover, we demonstrate that the network parameters of the model may be derived from administrative admission/discharge records. In particular, they are sufficient to obtain inter-hospital transfer probabilities, and to express the patients’ transfers as a Markov process. Using the proposed model, we show that indirect transfers of patients are equally or even more important as direct transfers for the spread of pathogens in a healthcare network.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/KMtj1CB6eSY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

We give an approximate solution to the difficult inverse problem of inferring the topology of an unknown network from given time-dependent signals at the nodes. For example, we measure signals from individual neurons in the brain, and infer how they are inter-connected. We use Maximum Caliber as an inference principle. The combinatorial challenge of high-dimensional data is handled using two different approximations to the pairwise couplings. We show two proofs of principle: in a nonlinear genetic toggle switch circuit, and in a toy neural network.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/JnBMVek5KWA&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Pre-existing resistance in the latent reservoir can compromise VRC01 therapy during chronic HIV-1 infection</title>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Ananya Saha, Narendra M. Dixit&lt;/p&gt;

Passive immunization with broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) of HIV-1 appears a promising strategy for eliciting long-term HIV-1 remission. When administered concomitantly with the cessation of antiretroviral therapy (ART) to patients with established viremic control, bNAb therapy is expected to prolong remission. Surprisingly, in clinical trials on chronic HIV-1 patients, the bNAb VRC01 failed to prolong remission substantially. Identifying the cause of this failure is important for improving VRC01-based therapies and unraveling potential vulnerabilities of other bNAbs. In the trials, viremia resurged rapidly in most patients despite suppressive VRC01 concentrations in circulation, suggesting that VRC01 resistance was the likely cause of failure. ART swiftly halts viral replication, precluding the development of resistance during ART. If resistance were to emerge post ART, virological breakthrough would have taken longer than without VRC01 therapy. We hypothesized therefore that VRC01-resistant strains must have been formed before ART initiation, survived ART in latently infected cells, and been activated during VRC01 therapy, causing treatment failure. Current assays preclude testing this hypothesis experimentally. We developed a mathematical model based on the hypothesis and challenged it with available clinical data. The model integrated within-host HIV-1 evolution, stochastic latency reactivation, and viral dynamics with multiple-dose VRC01 pharmacokinetics. The model predicted that single but not higher VRC01-resistant mutants would pre-exist in the latent reservoir. We constructed a virtual patient population that parsimoniously recapitulated inter-patient variations. Model predictions with this population quantitatively captured data of VRC01 failure from clinical trials, presenting strong evidence supporting the hypothesis. We attributed VRC01 failure to single-mutant VRC01-resistant proviruses in the latent reservoir triggering viral recrudescence, particularly when VRC01 was at trough levels. Pre-existing resistant proviruses in the latent reservoir may similarly compromise other bNAbs. Our study provides a framework for designing bNAb-based therapeutic protocols that would avert such failure and maximize HIV-1 remission.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/LwmqI6H4VKk&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

The evolution of cross-feeding among individuals of the same species can help generate genetic and phenotypic diversity even in completely homogeneous environments. Cross-feeding &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; strains, where one strain feeds on a carbon source excreted by another strain, rapidly emerge during experimental evolution in a chemically minimal environment containing glucose as the sole carbon source. Genome-scale metabolic modeling predicts that cross-feeding of 58 carbon sources can emerge in the same environment, but only cross-feeding of acetate and glycerol has been experimentally observed. Here we use metabolic modeling to ask whether acetate and glycerol cross-feeding are especially likely to evolve, perhaps because they require less metabolic change, and thus perhaps also less genetic change than other cross-feeding interactions. However, this is not the case. The minimally required metabolic changes required for acetate and glycerol cross feeding affect dozens of chemical reactions, multiple biochemical pathways, as well as multiple operons or regulons. The complexity of these changes is consistent with experimental observations, where cross-feeding strains harbor multiple mutations. The required metabolic changes are also no less complex than those observed for multiple other of the 56 cross feeding interactions we study. We discuss possible reasons why only two cross-feeding interactions have been discovered during experimental evolution and argue that multiple new cross-feeding interactions may await discovery.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/gAp21_teytw&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Aging is a complex process with poorly understood genetic mechanisms. Recent studies have sought to classify genes as pro-longevity or anti-longevity using a variety of machine learning algorithms. However, it is not clear which types of features are best for optimizing classification performance and which algorithms are best suited to this task. Further, performance assessments based on held-out test data are lacking. We systematically compare five popular classification algorithms using gene ontology and gene expression datasets as features to predict the pro-longevity versus anti-longevity status of genes for two model organisms (&lt;i&gt;C. elegans&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;S. cerevisiae&lt;/i&gt;) using the GenAge database as ground truth. We find that elastic net penalized logistic regression performs particularly well at this task. Using elastic net, we make novel predictions of pro- and anti-longevity genes that are not currently in the GenAge database.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/x_ruq4ze56U&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

There is increased awareness of the possibility of developmental memories resulting from evolutionary learning. Genetic regulatory and neural networks can be modelled by analogous formalism raising the important question of productive analogies in principles, processes and performance. We investigate the formation and persistence of various developmental memories of past phenotypes asking how the number of remembered past phenotypes scales with network size, to what extent memories stored form by Hebbian-like rules, and how robust these developmental “devo-engrams” are against networks perturbations (graceful degradation). The analogy between neural and genetic regulatory networks is not superficial in that it allows knowledge transfer between fields that used to be developed separately from each other. Known examples of spectacular phenotypic radiations could partly be accounted for in such terms.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/ignc7q60gK0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

The huge amount of data acquired by high-throughput sequencing requires data reduction for effective analysis. Here we give a clustering algorithm for genome-wide open chromatin data using a new data reduction method. This method regards the genome as a string of 1s and 0s based on a set of peaks and calculates the Hamming distances between the strings. This algorithm with the systematically optimized set of peaks enables us to quantitatively evaluate differences between samples of hematopoietic cells and classify cell types, potentially leading to a better understanding of leukemia pathogenesis.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/aus4lqvXfBU&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Computational modeling of dopamine transmission is challenged by complex underlying mechanisms. Here we present a new computational model that (I) simultaneously regards release, diffusion and uptake of dopamine, (II) considers multiple terminal release events and (III) comprises both synaptic and volume transmission by incorporating the geometry of the synaptic cleft. We were able to validate our model in that it simulates concentration values comparable to physiological values observed in empirical studies. Further, although synaptic dopamine diffuses into extra-synaptic space, our model reflects a very localized signal occurring on the synaptic level, i.e. synaptic dopamine release is negligibly recognized by neighboring synapses. Moreover, increasing evidence suggests that cognitive performance can be predicted by signal variability of neuroimaging data (e.g. BOLD). Signal variability in target areas of dopaminergic neurons (striatum, cortex) may arise from dopamine concentration variability. On that account we compared spatio-temporal variability in a simulation mimicking normal dopamine transmission in striatum to scenarios of enhanced dopamine release and dopamine uptake inhibition. We found different variability characteristics between the three settings, which may in part account for differences in empirical observations. From a clinical perspective, differences in striatal dopaminergic signaling contribute to differential learning and reward processing, with relevant implications for addictive- and compulsive-like behavior. Specifically, dopaminergic tone is assumed to impact on phasic dopamine and hence on the integration of reward-related signals. However, in humans DA tone is classically assessed using PET, which is an indirect measure of endogenous DA availability and suffers from temporal and spatial resolution issues. We discuss how this can lead to discrepancies with observations from other methods such as microdialysis and show how computational modeling can help to refine our understanding of DA transmission.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/EO__rbAAHyg&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Christoph Stelzer, Yaakov Benenson&lt;/p&gt;

The mapping of molecular inputs to their molecular outputs (input/output, I/O mapping) is an important characteristic of gene circuits, both natural and synthetic. Experimental determination of such mappings for synthetic circuits is best performed using stably integrated genetic constructs. In mammalian cells, stable integration of complex circuits is a time-consuming process that hampers rapid characterization of multiple circuit variants. On the other hand, transient transfection is quick. However, it is an extremely noisy process and it is unclear whether the obtained data have any relevance to the input/output mapping of a circuit obtained in the case of a stable integration. Here we describe a data processing workflow, Peakfinder algorithm for flow cytometry data (PFAFF), that allows extracting precise input/output mapping from single-cell protein expression data gathered by flow cytometry after a transient transfection. The workflow builds on the numerically-proven observation that the multivariate modes of input and output expression of multi-channel flow cytometry datasets, pre-binned by the expression level of an independent transfection reporter gene, harbor cells with circuit gene copy numbers distributions that depend deterministically on the properties of a bin. We validate our method by simulating flow cytometry data for seven multi-node circuit architectures, including a complex bi-modal circuit, under stable integration and transient transfection scenarios. The workflow applied to the simulated transient transfection data results in similar conclusions to those reached with simulated stable integration data. This indicates that the input/output mapping derived from transient transfection data using our method is an excellent approximation of the ground truth. Thus, the method allows to determine input/output mapping of complex gene network using noisy transient transfection data.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/zZ68BOK1RNw&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Experimental studies in neuroscience are producing data at a rapidly increasing rate, providing exciting opportunities and formidable challenges to existing theoretical and modeling approaches. To turn massive datasets into predictive quantitative frameworks, the field needs software solutions for systematic integration of data into realistic, multiscale models. Here we describe the Brain Modeling ToolKit (BMTK), a software suite for building models and performing simulations at multiple levels of resolution, from biophysically detailed multi-compartmental, to point-neuron, to population-statistical approaches. Leveraging the SONATA file format and existing software such as NEURON, NEST, and others, BMTK offers a consistent user experience across multiple levels of resolution. It permits highly sophisticated simulations to be set up with little coding required, thus lowering entry barriers to new users. We illustrate successful applications of BMTK to large-scale simulations of a cortical area. BMTK is an open-source package provided as a resource supporting modeling-based discovery in the community.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/_4TI_soQgpA&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

The pattern of neural activity evoked by a stimulus can be substantially affected by ongoing spontaneous activity. Separating these two types of activity is particularly important for calcium imaging data given the slow temporal dynamics of calcium indicators. Here we present a statistical model that decouples stimulus-driven activity from low dimensional spontaneous activity in this case. The model identifies hidden factors giving rise to spontaneous activity while jointly estimating stimulus tuning properties that account for the confounding effects that these factors introduce. By applying our model to data from zebrafish optic tectum and mouse visual cortex, we obtain quantitative measurements of the extent that neurons in each case are driven by evoked activity, spontaneous activity, and their interaction. By not averaging away potentially important information encoded in spontaneous activity, this broadly applicable model brings new insight into population-level neural activity within single trials.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/4XSAP6O9Szw&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Predicting mutation-induced changes in protein thermodynamic stability (ΔΔG) is of great interest in protein engineering, variant interpretation, and protein biophysics. We introduce ThermoNet, a deep, 3D-convolutional neural network designed for structure-based prediction of ΔΔGs upon point mutation. To leverage the image-processing power inherent in convolutional neural networks, we treat protein structures as if they were multi-channel 3D images. In particular, the inputs to ThermoNet are uniformly constructed as multi-channel voxel grids based on biophysical properties derived from raw atom coordinates. We train and evaluate ThermoNet with a curated data set that accounts for protein homology and is balanced with direct and reverse mutations; this provides a framework for addressing biases that have likely influenced many previous ΔΔG prediction methods. ThermoNet demonstrates performance comparable to the best available methods on the widely used S&lt;sup&gt;sym&lt;/sup&gt; test set. In addition, ThermoNet accurately predicts the effects of both stabilizing and destabilizing mutations, while most other methods exhibit a strong bias towards predicting destabilization. We further show that homology between S&lt;sup&gt;sym&lt;/sup&gt; and widely used training sets like S2648 and VariBench has likely led to overestimated performance in previous studies. Finally, we demonstrate the practical utility of ThermoNet in predicting the ΔΔGs for two clinically relevant proteins, p53 and myoglobin, and for pathogenic and benign missense variants from ClinVar. Overall, our results suggest that 3D convolutional neural networks can model the complex, non-linear interactions perturbed by mutations, directly from biophysical properties of atoms.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/niegIFFxK5E&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

How do we scale biological science to the demand of next generation biology and medicine to keep track of the facts, predictions, and hypotheses? These days, enormous amounts of DNA sequence and other omics data are generated. Since these data contain the blueprint for life, it is imperative that we interpret it accurately. The abundance of DNA is only one part of the challenge. Artificial Intelligence (AI) and network methods routinely build on large screens, single cell technologies, proteomics, and other modalities to infer or predict biological functions and phenotypes associated with proteins, pathways, and organisms. As a first step, how do we systematically trace the provenance of knowledge from experimental ground truth to gene function predictions and annotations? Here, we review the main challenges in tracking the evolution of biological knowledge and propose several specific solutions to provenance and computational tracing of evidence in functional linkage networks.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/BCbdCBNCE2M&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

The metabolite acetyl-coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA) serves as an essential element for a wide range of cellular functions including adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production, lipid synthesis, and protein acetylation. Intracellular acetyl-CoA concentrations are associated with nutrient availability, but the mechanisms by which a cell responds to fluctuations in acetyl-CoA levels remain elusive. Here, we generate a cell system to selectively manipulate the nucleo-cytoplasmic levels of acetyl-CoA using clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)-mediated gene editing and acetate supplementation of the culture media. Using this system and quantitative omics analyses, we demonstrate that acetyl-CoA depletion alters the integrity of the nucleolus, impairing ribosomal RNA synthesis and evoking the ribosomal protein-dependent activation of p53. This nucleolar remodeling appears to be mediated through the class IIa histone deacetylases (HDACs). Our findings highlight acetylation-mediated control of the nucleolus as an important hub linking acetyl-CoA fluctuations to cellular stress responses.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/znn2cQyechA&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

The vast net of fibres within and underneath the cortex is optimised to support the convergence of different levels of brain organisation. Here, we propose a novel coordinate system of the human cortex based on an advanced model of its connectivity. Our approach is inspired by seminal, but so far largely neglected models of cortico–cortical wiring established by postmortem anatomical studies and capitalises on cutting-edge in vivo neuroimaging and machine learning. The new model expands the currently prevailing diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) tractography approach by incorporation of additional features of cortical microstructure and cortico–cortical proximity. Studying several datasets and different parcellation schemes, we could show that our coordinate system robustly recapitulates established sensory-limbic and anterior–posterior dimensions of brain organisation. A series of validation experiments showed that the new wiring space reflects cortical microcircuit features (including pyramidal neuron depth and glial expression) and allowed for competitive simulations of functional connectivity and dynamics based on resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) and human intracranial electroencephalography (EEG) coherence. Our results advance our understanding of how cell-specific neurobiological gradients produce a hierarchical cortical wiring scheme that is concordant with increasing functional sophistication of human brain organisation. Our evaluations demonstrate the cortical wiring space bridges across scales of neural organisation and can be easily translated to single individuals.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/FxmeQ05KO8s&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

The causes of multiple sclerosis (MS) remain unknown. Smoking has been associated with MS in observational studies and is often thought of as an environmental risk factor. We used two-sample mendelian randomization (MR) to examine whether this association is causal using genetic variants identified in genome-wide association studies (GWASs) as associated with smoking. We assessed both smoking initiation and lifetime smoking behaviour (which captures smoking duration, heaviness, and cessation). There was very limited evidence for a meaningful effect of smoking on MS susceptibility as measured using summary statistics from the International Multiple Sclerosis Genetics Consortium (IMSGC) meta-analysis, including 14,802 cases and 26,703 controls. There was no clear evidence for an effect of smoking on the risk of developing MS (smoking initiation: odds ratio [OR] 1.03, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.92–1.61; lifetime smoking: OR 1.10, 95% CI 0.87–1.40). These findings suggest that smoking does not have a detrimental consequence on MS susceptibility. Further work is needed to determine the causal effect of smoking on MS progression.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/ktkisd6ZNQw&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Biology: Rules warp feature encoding in decision-making circuits</title>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by R. Becket Ebitz, Jiaxin Cindy Tu, Benjamin Y. Hayden&lt;/p&gt;

We have the capacity to follow arbitrary stimulus–response rules, meaning simple policies that guide our behavior. Rule identity is broadly encoded across decision-making circuits, but there are less data on how rules shape the computations that lead to choices. One idea is that rules could simplify these computations. When we follow a rule, there is no need to encode or compute information that is irrelevant to the current rule, which could reduce the metabolic or energetic demands of decision-making. However, it is not clear if the brain can actually take advantage of this computational simplicity. To test this idea, we recorded from neurons in 3 regions linked to decision-making, the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), ventral striatum (VS), and dorsal striatum (DS), while macaques performed a rule-based decision-making task. Rule-based decisions were identified via modeling rules as the latent causes of decisions. This left us with a set of physically identical choices that maximized reward and information, but could not be explained by simple stimulus–response rules. Contrasting rule-based choices with these residual choices revealed that following rules (1) decreased the energetic cost of decision-making; and (2) expanded rule-relevant coding dimensions and compressed rule-irrelevant ones. Together, these results suggest that we use rules, in part, because they reduce the costs of decision-making through a distributed representational warping in decision-making circuits.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/absqV5PG9wk&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Biology: Blood–brain barrier genetic disruption leads to protective barrier formation at the Glia Limitans</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~3/Qws0Zjy1BM4/article</link>

Inflammation of the central nervous system (CNS) induces endothelial blood–brain barrier (BBB) opening as well as the formation of a tight junction barrier between reactive astrocytes at the Glia Limitans. We hypothesized that the CNS parenchyma may acquire protection from the reactive astrocytic Glia Limitans not only during neuroinflammation but also when BBB integrity is compromised in the resting state. Previous studies found that astrocyte-derived Sonic hedgehog (SHH) stabilizes the BBB during CNS inflammatory disease, while endothelial-derived desert hedgehog (DHH) is expressed at the BBB under resting conditions. Here, we investigated the effects of endothelial Dhh on the integrity of the BBB and Glia Limitans. We first characterized DHH expression within endothelial cells at the BBB, then demonstrated that DHH is down-regulated during experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Using a mouse model in which endothelial Dhh is inducibly deleted, we found that endothelial Dhh both opens the BBB via the modulation of forkhead box O1 (FoxO1) transcriptional activity and induces a tight junctional barrier at the Glia Limitans. We confirmed the relevance of this glial barrier system in human multiple sclerosis active lesions. These results provide evidence for the novel concept of “chronic neuroinflammatory tolerance” in which BBB opening in the resting state is sufficient to stimulate a protective barrier at the Glia Limitans that limits the severity of subsequent neuroinflammatory disease. In summary, genetic disruption of the BBB generates endothelial signals that drive the formation under resting conditions of a secondary barrier at the Glia Limitans with protective effects against subsequent CNS inflammation. The concept of a reciprocally regulated CNS double barrier system has implications for treatment strategies in both the acute and chronic phases of multiple sclerosis pathophysiology.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/Qws0Zjy1BM4&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

It is unknown how growth in one tissue impacts morphogenesis in a neighboring tissue. To address this, we used the &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; ovarian follicle, in which a cluster of 15 nurse cells and a posteriorly located oocyte are surrounded by a layer of epithelial cells. It is known that as the nurse cells grow, the overlying epithelial cells flatten in a wave that begins in the anterior. Here, we demonstrate that an anterior to posterior gradient of decreasing cytoplasmic pressure is present across the nurse cells and that this gradient acts through TGFβ to control both the triggering and the progression of the wave of epithelial cell flattening. Our data indicate that intrinsic nurse cell growth is important to control proper nurse cell pressure. Finally, we reveal that nurse cell pressure and subsequent TGFβ activity in the stretched cells combine to increase follicle elongation in the anterior, which is crucial for allowing nurse cell growth and pressure control. More generally, our results reveal that during development, inner cytoplasmic pressure in individual cells has an important role in shaping their neighbors.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/MwvegINJHvM&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)-CRISPR-associated (Cas) 9 has been widely used far beyond genome editing. Fusions of deactivated Cas9 (dCas9) to transcription effectors enable interrogation of the epigenome and controlling of gene expression. However, the large transgene size of dCas9-fusion hinders its applications especially in somatic tissues. Here, we develop a robust CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) system by transgenic expression of doxycycline (Dox) inducible dCas9-KRAB in mouse embryonic stem cells (iKRAB ESC). After introduction of specific single-guide RNAs (sgRNAs), the induced dCas9-KRAB efficiently maintains gene inactivation, although it modestly down-regulates the expression of active genes. The proper timing of Dox addition during cell differentiation or reprogramming allows us to study or screen spatiotemporally activated promoters or enhancers and thereby the gene functions. Furthermore, taking the ESC for blastocyst injection, we generate an iKRAB knock-in (KI) mouse model that enables the shutdown of gene expression and loss-of-function (LOF) studies ex vivo and in vivo by a simple transduction of gRNAs. Thus, our inducible CRISPRi ESC line and KI mouse provide versatile and convenient platforms for functional interrogation and high-throughput screens of specific genes and potential regulatory elements in the setting of development or diseases.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/5BnG8yMzdTU&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Biology: EphrinB1 modulates glutamatergic inputs into POMC-expressing progenitors and controls glucose homeostasis</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~3/WwQShOMh3o8/article</link>

Proopiomelanocortin (POMC) neurons are major regulators of energy balance and glucose homeostasis. In addition to being regulated by hormones and nutrients, POMC neurons are controlled by glutamatergic input originating from multiple brain regions. However, the factors involved in the formation of glutamatergic inputs and how they contribute to bodily functions remain largely unknown. Here, we show that during the development of glutamatergic inputs, POMC neurons exhibit enriched expression of the &lt;i&gt;Efnb1&lt;/i&gt; (EphrinB1) and &lt;i&gt;Efnb2&lt;/i&gt; (EphrinB2) genes, which are known to control excitatory synapse formation. In vivo loss of &lt;i&gt;Efnb1&lt;/i&gt; in POMC-expressing progenitors decreases the amount of glutamatergic inputs, associated with a reduced number of α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor subunits and excitability of these cells. We found that mice lacking &lt;i&gt;Efnb1&lt;/i&gt; in POMC-expressing progenitors display impaired glucose tolerance due to blunted vagus nerve activity and decreased insulin secretion. However, despite reduced excitatory inputs, mice lacking &lt;i&gt;Efnb2&lt;/i&gt; in POMC-expressing progenitors showed no deregulation of insulin secretion and only mild alterations in feeding behavior and gluconeogenesis. Collectively, our data demonstrate the role of ephrins in controlling excitatory input amount into POMC-expressing progenitors and show an isotype-specific role of ephrins on the regulation of glucose homeostasis and feeding.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/WwQShOMh3o8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

&lt;p&gt;Johnston’s organ is a highly sensitive mechanoreceptive organ in insect antennae. For the first time, we examined the 3D‐structure of the Johnston’s organ in &lt;i&gt;Cataglyphis&lt;/i&gt; desert ants together with its neuronal projections in the ant brain. The multisensory nature of the organ together with its targets in multimodal brain regions make the Johnston’s organ an important component of the navigational toolkit in &lt;i&gt;Cataglyphis&lt;/i&gt; ants.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Johnston’s organ (JO) in the insect antenna is a multisensory organ involved in several navigational tasks including wind‐compass orientation, flight control, graviception, and, possibly, magnetoreception. Here we investigate the three dimensional anatomy of the JO and its neuronal projections into the brain of the desert ant &lt;i&gt;Cataglyphis&lt;/i&gt;, a marvelous long‐distance navigator. The JO of &lt;i&gt;C. nodus&lt;/i&gt; workers consists of 40 scolopidia comprising three sensory neurons each. The numbers of scolopidia slightly vary between different sexes (female/male) and castes (worker/queen). Individual scolopidia attach to the intersegmental membrane between pedicel and flagellum of the antenna and line up in a ring‐like organization. Three JO nerves project along the two antennal nerve branches into the brain. Anterograde double staining of the antennal afferents revealed that JO receptor neurons project to several distinct neuropils in the central brain. The T5 tract projects into the antennal mechanosensory and motor center (AMMC), while the T6 tract bypasses the AMMC via the saddle and forms collaterals terminating in the posterior slope (PS) (T6I), the ventral complex (T6II), and the ventrolateral protocerebrum (T6III). Double labeling of JO and ocellar afferents revealed that input from the JO and visual information from the ocelli converge in tight apposition in the PS. The general JO anatomy and its central projection patterns resemble situations in honeybees and &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt;. The multisensory nature of the JO together with its projections to multisensory neuropils in the ant brain likely serves synchronization and calibration of different sensory modalities during the ontogeny of navigation in &lt;i&gt;Cataglyphis&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25975?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Deep brain stimulation (DBS) depends on precise delivery of electrical current to target tissues. However, the specific brain structures responsible for best outcome are still debated. We applied probabilistic stimulation mapping to a retrospective, multi‐disorder DBS dataset assembled over 15 years at our institution (n&lt;sub&gt;total&lt;/sub&gt;=482 patients; n&lt;sub&gt;Parkinson’s disease&lt;/sub&gt;=303; n&lt;sub&gt;dystonia&lt;/sub&gt;=64; n&lt;sub&gt;tremor&lt;/sub&gt;=39; n&lt;sub&gt;treatment‐resistant depression/anorexia nervosa&lt;/sub&gt;=76) to identify the neuroanatomical substrates of optimal clinical response. Using high‐resolution structural MR imaging and activation volume modelling, probabilistic stimulation maps (PSMs) that delineated areas of above‐mean and below‐mean response for each patient cohort were generated and defined in terms of their relationships with surrounding anatomical structures. Our results show that overlap between PSMs and individual patients’ activation volumes can serve as a guide to predict clinical outcomes but that this is not the sole determinant of response. In the future, individualized models that incorporate advancements in mapping techniques with patient‐specific clinical variables will likely contribute to the optimization of DBS target selection and improved outcomes for patients.&lt;/p&gt;

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2020.604563</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A great deal of research has been devoted on the investigation of neural dynamics in various network topologies. However, only a few studies have focused on the influence of autapses, synapses from a neuron onto itself via closed loops, on neural synchronization. Here, we build a random network with adaptive exponential integrate-and-fire neurons coupled with chemical synapses, equipped with autapses, to study the effect of the latter on synchronous behavior. We consider time delay in the conductance of the pre-synaptic neuron for excitatory and inhibitory connections. Interestingly, in neural networks consisting of both excitatory and inhibitory neurons, we uncover that synchronous behavior depends on their synapse type. Our results provide evidence on the synchronous and desynchronous activities that emerge in random neural networks with chemical, inhibitory and excitatory synapses where neurons are equipped with autapses.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience: Stimulus Feature-Specific Information Flow Along the Columnar Cortical Microcircuit Revealed by Multivariate Laminar Spiking Analysis</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2020.600601</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Most of the mammalian neocortex is comprised of a highly similar anatomical structure, consisting of a granular cell layer between superficial and deep layers. Even so, different cortical areas process different information. Taken together, this suggests that cortex features a canonical functional microcircuit that supports region-specific information processing. For example, the primate primary visual cortex (V1) combines the two eyes' signals, extracts stimulus orientation, and integrates contextual information such as visual stimulation history. These processes co-occur during the same laminar stimulation sequence that is triggered by the onset of visual stimuli. Yet, we still know little regarding the laminar processing differences that are specific to each of these types of stimulus information. Univariate analysis techniques have provided great insight by examining one electrode at a time or by studying average responses across multiple electrodes. Here we focus on multivariate statistics to examine response patterns across electrodes instead. Specifically, we applied multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) to linear multielectrode array recordings of laminar spiking responses to decode information regarding the eye-of-origin, stimulus orientation, and stimulus repetition. MVPA differs from conventional univariate approaches in that it examines patterns of neural activity across simultaneously recorded electrode sites. We were curious whether this added dimensionality could reveal neural processes on the population level that are challenging to detect when measuring brain activity without the context of neighboring recording sites. We found that eye-of-origin information was decodable for the entire duration of stimulus presentation, but diminished in the deepest layers of V1. Conversely, orientation information was transient and equally pronounced along all layers. More importantly, using time-resolved MVPA, we were able to evaluate laminar response properties beyond those yielded by univariate analyses. Specifically, we performed a time generalization analysis by training a classifier at one point of the neural response and testing its performance throughout the remaining period of stimulation. Using this technique, we demonstrate repeating (reverberating) patterns of neural activity that have not previously been observed using standard univariate approaches.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Background&lt;p&gt;Individuals with Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) are often characterized by systemic markers of insulin resistance; however, the broader effects of AD on other relevant metabolic hormones, such as incretins that affect insulin secretion and food intake, remains less clear.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;Here, we leveraged a physiologically relevant meal tolerance test to assess diagnostic differences in these metabolic responses in cognitively healthy older adults (CH; n = 32) and AD (n = 23) participants. All individuals also underwent a comprehensive clinical examination, cognitive evaluation, and structural magnetic resonance imaging.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;The meal-stimulated response of glucose, insulin, and peptide tyrosine tyrosine (PYY) was significantly greater in individuals with AD as compared to CH. Voxel-based morphometry revealed negative relationships between brain volume and the meal-stimulated response of insulin, C-Peptide, and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) in primarily parietal brain regions.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;Our findings are consistent with prior work that shows differences in metabolic regulation in AD and relationships with cognition and brain structure.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Multiplex Networks to Characterize Seizure Development in Traumatic Brain Injury Patients</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.591662</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Traumatic brain injury (TBI) may cause secondary debilitating problems, such as post-traumatic epilepsy (PTE), which occurs with unprovoked recurrent seizures, months or even years after TBI. Currently, the Epilepsy Bioinformatics Study for Antiepileptogenic Therapy (EpiBioS4Rx) has been enrolling moderate-severe TBI patients with the goal to identify biomarkers of epileptogenesis that may help to prevent seizure occurrence and better understand the mechanism underlying PTE. In this work, we used a novel complex network approach based on segmenting T1-weighted Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans in patches of the same dimension (network nodes) and measured pairwise patch similarities using Pearson's correlation (network connections). This network model allowed us to obtain a series of single and multiplex network metrics to comprehensively analyze the different interactions between brain components and capture structural MRI alterations related to seizure development. We used these complex network features to train a Random Forest (RF) classifier and predict, with an accuracy of 70 and a 95% confidence interval of [67, 73%], which subjects from EpiBioS4Rx have had at least one seizure after a TBI. This complex network approach also allowed the identification of the most informative scales and brain areas for the discrimination between the two clinical groups: seizure-free and seizure-affected subjects, demonstrating to be a promising pilot study which, in the future, may serve to identify and validate biomarkers of PTE.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Comparison Between Blood-Brain Barrier Water Exchange Rate and Permeability to Gadolinium-Based Contrast Agent in an Elderly Cohort</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.571480</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Background: Dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) MRI using intravenous injection of gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs) is commonly used for imaging blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability. Water is an alternative endogenous tracer with limited exchange rate across the BBB. A direct comparison between BBB water exchange rate and BBB permeability to GBCA is missing. The purpose of this study was to directly compare BBB permeability to GBCA (Ktrans and k&lt;sub&gt;Gad&lt;/sub&gt; = Ktrans/Vp) and water exchange rate (kw) in a cohort of elderly subjects at risk of cerebral small vessel disease (cSVD).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Ktrans/k&lt;sub&gt;Gad&lt;/sub&gt; and kw were measured by DCE-MRI and diffusion prepared pseudo-continuous arterial spin labeling (DP-pCASL), respectively, at 3 Tesla in 16 elderly subjects (3 male, age = 67.9 ± 3.0 yrs) at risk of cSVD. The test-retest reproducibility of kw measurements was evaluated with repeated scans ~6 weeks apart. Mixed effects linear regression was performed in the whole brain, gray matter (GM), white matter (WM), and 6 subcortical brain regions to investigate associations between Ktrans/k&lt;sub&gt;Gad&lt;/sub&gt; and test-retest kw. In addition, kw and Ktrans/k&lt;sub&gt;Gad&lt;/sub&gt; were compared in normal appearing white matter (NAWM), white matter hyperintensity (WMH) lesions and penumbra.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Significant correlation was found between kw and Ktrans only in WM (β = 6.7 × 10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;, P = 0.036), caudate (β = 8.6 × 10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;, P = 0.029), and middle cerebral artery (MCA) perforator territory (β = 6.9 × 10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;, P = 0.009), but not in the whole brain, GM or rest 5 brain regions. Significant correlation was found between kw and k&lt;sub&gt;Gad&lt;/sub&gt; in MCA perforator territory (β = 1.5 × 10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, P = 0.049), medial-temporal lobe (β = 3.5 × 10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, P = 0.032), and hippocampus (β = 3.4 × 10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, P = 0.038), but not in the rest brain regions. Good reproducibility of kw measurements (ICC=0.75) was achieved. Ktrans was significantly lower inside WMH than WMH penumbra (16.2%, P = 0.026), and k&lt;sub&gt;Gad&lt;/sub&gt; was significantly lower in NAWM than in the WMH penumbra (20.8%, P &amp;lt; 0.001).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: kw provides a measure of water exchange rate across the BBB with good test-retest reproducibility. The BBB mechanism underlying kw and Ktrans/k&lt;sub&gt;Gad&lt;/sub&gt; is likely to be different, as manifested by correlations in only three brain regions for each pair of comparison between kw and Ktrans or k&lt;sub&gt;Gad&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurogenesis: Wt1 Positive dB4 Neurons in the Hindbrain Are Crucial for Respiration</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.529487</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Central pattern generator (CPG) networks coordinate the generation of rhythmic activity such as locomotion and respiration. Their development is driven by various transcription factors, one of which is the Wilms tumor protein (Wt1). It is present in dI6 neurons of the mouse spinal cord, and involved in the coordination of locomotion. Here we report about the presence of Wt1 in neurons of the caudoventral medulla oblongata and their impact on respiration. By employing immunohistofluorescence staining, we were able to characterize these Wt1 positive (+) cells as dB4 neurons. The temporal occurrence of Wt1 suggests a role for this transcription factor in the differentiation of dB4 neurons during embryonic and postnatal development. Conditional knockout of Wt1 in these cells caused an altered population size of V0 neurons already in the developing hindbrain, leading to a decline in the respiration rate in the adults. Thereby, we confirmed and extended the previously proposed similarity between dB4 neurons in the hindbrain and dI6 neurons of the spinal cord, in terms of development and function. Ablation of Wt1+ dB4 neurons resulted in the death of neonates due to the inability to initiate respiration, suggesting a vital role for Wt1+ dB4 neurons in breathing. These results expand the role of Wt1 in the CNS and show that, in addition to its function in differentiation of dI6 neurons, it also contributes to the development of dB4 neurons in the hindbrain that are critically involved in the regulation of respiration.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Lesion Induced Error on Automated Measures of Brain Volume: Data From a Pediatric Traumatic Brain Injury Cohort</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.491478</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Structural segmentation of T1-weighted (T1w) MRI has shown morphometric differences, both compared to controls and longitudinally, following a traumatic brain injury (TBI). While many patients with TBI present with abnormalities on structural MRI images, most neuroimaging software packages have not been systematically evaluated for accuracy in the presence of these pathology-related MRI abnormalities. The current study aimed to assess whether acute MRI lesions (MRI acquired 7–71 days post-injury) cause error in the estimates of brain volume produced by the semi-automated segmentation tool, Freesurfer. More specifically, to investigate whether this error was global, the presence of lesion-induced error in the contralesional hemisphere, where no abnormal signal was present, was measured. A dataset of 176 simulated lesion cases was generated using actual lesions from 16 pediatric TBI (pTBI) cases recruited from the emergency department and 11 typically-developing controls. Simulated lesion cases were compared to the “ground truth” of the non-lesion control-case T1w images. Using linear mixed-effects models, results showed that hemispheric measures of cortex volume were significantly lower in the contralesional-hemisphere compared to the ground truth. Interestingly, however, cortex volume (and cerebral white matter volume) were not significantly different in the lesioned hemisphere. However, percent volume difference (PVD) between the simulated lesion and ground truth showed that the magnitude of difference of cortex volume in the contralesional-hemisphere (mean PVD = 0.37%) was significantly smaller than that in the lesioned hemisphere (mean PVD = 0.47%), suggesting a small, but systematic lesion-induced error. Lesion characteristics that could explain variance in the PVD for each hemisphere were investigated. Taken together, these results suggest that the lesion-induced error caused by simulated lesions was not focal, but globally distributed. Previous post-processing approaches to adjust for lesions in structural analyses address the focal region where the lesion was located however, our results suggest that focal correction approaches are insufficient for the global error in morphometric measures of the injured brain.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroinformatics: A Tensor-Based Framework for rs-fMRI Classification and Functional Connectivity Construction</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fninf.2020.581897</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Recently, machine learning methods have gained lots of attention from researchers seeking to analyze brain images such as Resting-State Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (rs-fMRI) to obtain a deeper understanding of the brain and such related diseases, for example, Alzheimer's disease. Finding the common patterns caused by a brain disorder through analysis of the functional connectivity (FC) network along with discriminating brain diseases from normal controls have long been the two principal goals in studying rs-fMRI data. The majority of FC extraction methods calculate the FC matrix for each subject and then use simple techniques to combine them and obtain a general FC matrix. In addition, the state-of-the-art classification techniques for finding subjects with brain disorders also rely on calculating an FC for each subject, vectorizing, and feeding them to the classifier. Considering these problems and based on multi-dimensional nature of the data, we have come up with a novel tensor framework in which a general FC matrix is obtained without the need to construct an FC matrix for each sample. This framework also allows us to reduce the dimensionality and create a novel discriminant function that rather than using FCs works directly with each sample, avoids vectorization in any step, and uses the test data in the training process without forcing any prior knowledge of its label into the classifier. Extensive experiments using the ADNI dataset demonstrate that our proposed framework effectively boosts the fMRI classification performance and reveals novel connectivity patterns in Alzheimer's disease at its early stages.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience: DNNBrain: A Unifying Toolbox for Mapping Deep Neural Networks and Brains</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2020.580632</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Deep neural networks (DNNs) have attained human-level performance on dozens of challenging tasks via an end-to-end deep learning strategy. Deep learning allows data representations that have multiple levels of abstraction; however, it does not explicitly provide any insights into the internal operations of DNNs. Deep learning's success is appealing to neuroscientists not only as a method for applying DNNs to model biological neural systems but also as a means of adopting concepts and methods from cognitive neuroscience to understand the internal representations of DNNs. Although general deep learning frameworks, such as PyTorch and TensorFlow, could be used to allow such cross-disciplinary investigations, the use of these frameworks typically requires high-level programming expertise and comprehensive mathematical knowledge. A toolbox specifically designed as a mechanism for cognitive neuroscientists to map both DNNs and brains is urgently needed. Here, we present DNNBrain, a Python-based toolbox designed for exploring the internal representations of DNNs as well as brains. Through the integration of DNN software packages and well-established brain imaging tools, DNNBrain provides application programming and command line interfaces for a variety of research scenarios. These include extracting DNN activation, probing and visualizing DNN representations, and mapping DNN representations onto the brain. We expect that our toolbox will accelerate scientific research by both applying DNNs to model biological neural systems and utilizing paradigms of cognitive neuroscience to unveil the black box of DNNs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Peripheral Inflammation and Cognitive Performance in Middle-Aged Adults With and Without Type 2 Diabetes: Results From the ENBIND Study</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.605878</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Midlife Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) is associated with a greater risk of dementia in later life. Peripheral inflammation and its impact on cognition is proposed as one of the pathological mechanisms mediating this link. However, studies have primarily focused on older individuals with established cognitive impairment and a long duration of T2DM. Importantly, knowledge of which individuals with midlife T2DM who are at greatest risk of later cognitive decline is lacking. We examined the cross-sectional relationship between serum levels of 8 pro-inflammatory markers (IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, IL-8, MCP-1, CXCL10, IL-12p70, CRP) and performance on a detailed neuropsychological assessment battery in middle-aged adults with uncomplicated T2DM (N = 89; 52 ± 8.1 years, 47% female) and matched healthy controls (N = 50; 52 ± 8.3 years, 59% female). Linear regression was used to analyze associations between serum markers and cognitive performance in the overall cohort, followed by a T2DM&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt;protein concentration interaction analysis to identify any T2DM-specific effects. We observed a significant T2DM-specific association between serum TNF-α levels and scores on the Paired Associates Learning (PAL) task (β: −3.16, SE: 1.32, p = 0.01, Std. Beta: −0.94), a task with significant working memory demands previously implicated in T2DM-related cognitive dysfunction. However, this did not persist on controlling for multiple testing. We provide exploratory evidence for a significant T2DM-specific relationship between serum TNF-α and memory performance. These findings require further replication and longitudinal analysis with the aim of selecting-out individuals with midlife T2DM at risk of future cognitive decline for potential preventative interventions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

&lt;p&gt;Neurons derived from patient induced pluripotent stem cells harboring ACTL6B p.(Val421_Cys425del) variant display reduced expression and stability of ACTL6B protein and increased spontaneous neuronal activity &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ACTL6B is a component of the neuronal BRG1/brm‐associated factor (nBAF) complex, which is required for chromatin remodeling in postmitotic neurons. We recently reported biallelic pathogenic variants in &lt;i&gt;ACTL6B&lt;/i&gt; in patients diagnosed with early infantile epileptic encephalopathy, subtype 76 (EIEE‐76), presenting with severe, global developmental delay, epileptic encephalopathy, cerebral atrophy, and abnormal central nervous system myelination. However, the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying their phenotype is unknown. Here, we investigate the molecular pathogenesis of ACTL6B p.(Val421_Cys425del) using &lt;i&gt;in silico&lt;/i&gt; 3D protein modeling predictions and patient‐specific induced pluripotent stem cell‐derived neurons. We found neurons derived from EIEE‐76 patients showed impaired accumulation of ACTL6B compared to unaffected relatives, caused by reduced protein stability. Furthermore, EIEE‐76 patient‐derived neurons had dysregulated nBAF target gene expression, including genes important for neuronal development and disease. Multielectrode array system analysis unveiled elevated electrophysiological activity of EIEE‐76 patients‐derived neurons, consistent with the patient phenotype. Taken together, our findings validate a new model for EIEE‐76 and reveal how reduced ACTL6B expression affects neuronal function.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

&lt;p&gt;Ultrasonic neuromodulation of peripheral nerve cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Satisfactory treatment of peripheral nerve injury (PNI) faces difficulties owing to the intrinsic biological barriers in larger injuries and invasive surgical interventions. Injury gaps &amp;gt;3 cm have low chances of full motor and sensory recovery, and the unmet need for PNI repair techniques which increase the likelihood of functional recovery while limiting invasiveness motivate this work. Building upon prior work in ultrasound stimulation (US) of dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons, the effects of US on DRG neuron and Schwann cell (SC) cocultures were investigated to uncover the role of SCs in mediating the neuronal response to US &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;. Acoustic intensity‐dependent alteration in selected neuromorphometrics of DRG neurons in coculture with SCs was observed in total outgrowth, primary neurites, and length compared to previously reported DRG monoculture in a calcium‐independent manner. SC viability and proliferation were not impacted by US. Conditioned medium studies suggest secreted factors from SCs subjected to US impact DRG neuron morphology. These findings advance the current understanding of mechanisms by which these cell types respond to US, which may lead to new noninvasive US therapies for treating PNI.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

&lt;p&gt;Extracellular ascorbic acid induces Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; influx, stimulating sodium‐dependent vitamin C transporter 2 (SVCT2) anterograde trafficking in wild‐type cells. No ascorbic acid‐induced cytosolic Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; increase was observed in Huntington's disease (HD) cells. Thus, SVCT2 would fail to reach the cellular surface, affecting ascorbic acid uptake in HD cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Huntington's disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by a glutamine expansion at the first exon of the huntingtin gene. Huntingtin protein (Htt) is ubiquitously expressed and it is localized in several organelles, including endosomes. HD is associated with a failure in energy metabolism and oxidative damage. Ascorbic acid is a powerful antioxidant highly concentrated in the brain where it acts as a messenger, modulating neuronal metabolism. It is transported into neurons via the sodium‐dependent vitamin C transporter 2 (SVCT2). During synaptic activity, ascorbic acid is released from glial reservoirs to the extracellular space, inducing an increase in SVCT2 localization at the plasma membrane. Here, we studied SVCT2 trafficking and localization in HD. SVCT2 is decreased at synaptic terminals in YAC128 male mice. Using cellular models for HD (STHdhQ7 and STHdhQ111 cells), we determined that SVCT2 trafficking through secretory and endosomal pathways is altered in resting conditions. We observed Golgi fragmentation and SVCT2/Htt‐associated protein‐1 mis‐colocalization. Additionally, we observed altered ascorbic acid‐induced calcium signaling that explains the reduced SVCT2 translocation to the plasma membrane in the presence of extracellular ascorbic acid (active conditions) described in our previous results. Therefore, SVCT2 trafficking to the plasma membrane is altered in resting and active conditions in HD, explaining the redox imbalance observed during early stages of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience Research: Reelin activates the small GTPase TC10 and VAMP7 to promote neurite outgrowth and regeneration of dorsal root ganglia (DRG) neurons</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jnr.24688?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;img alt=&quot;Reelin activates the small GTPase TC10 and VAMP7 to promote neurite outgrowth and regeneration of dorsal root ganglia (DRG) neurons&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/e8d31392-bd4b-4b87-9247-10eba851fa7c/jnr24688-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Axonal growth is a relevant process for development and regeneration. After peripheral nervous system (PNS) injury, Reelin levels increase, and mice devoid of Reelin show an impairment in nerve regeneration. Here we show, for the first time, that Reelin increases the regenerative outcome of dorsal root ganglia axons after axotomy (a mock, b Reelin treated). (c) After binding to its receptor, Apolipoprotein E‐receptor 2, Reelin activates the Rho GTPases Cdc42 that regulates actin dynamics, and TC10, required for membrane addition by interacting with the exocyst complex. TC10 recruits to membrane vesicles that potentially could come from Golgi and/or recycling endosomes. TC10 vesicles also contain ApoER2 and the v‐SNARE protein VAMP7. Reelin increases the fusion of vesicles, containing VAMP7, at the growth cone. Therefore, Reelin signaling could have a therapeutic role in PNS lesions, improving axonal outgrowth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Axonal outgrowth is a fundamental process during the development of central (CNS) and peripheral (PNS) nervous system as well as in nerve regeneration and requires accurate axonal navigation and extension to the correct target. These events need proper coordination between membrane trafficking and cytoskeletal rearrangements and are under the control of the small GTPases of the Rho family, among other molecules. Reelin, a relevant protein for CNS development and synaptic function in the adult, is also present in the PNS. Upon sciatic nerve damage, Reelin expression increases and, on the other hand, mice deficient in Reelin exhibit an impaired nerve regeneration. However, the mechanism(s) involved the Reelin‐dependent axonal growth is still poorly understood. In this work, we present evidence showing that Reelin stimulates dorsal root ganglia (DRG) regeneration after axotomy. Moreover, dissociated DRG neurons express the Reelin receptor Apolipoprotein E‐receptor 2 and also require the presence of TC10 to develop their axons. TC10 is a Rho GTPase that promotes neurite outgrowth through the exocytic fusion of vesicles at the growth cone. Here, we demonstrate for the first time that Reelin controls TC10 activation in DRG neurons. Besides, we confirmed that the known CNS Reelin target Cdc42 is also activated in DRG and controls TC10 activity. Finally, in the process of membrane addition, we found that Reelin stimulates the fusion of membrane carriers containing the v‐SNARE protein VAMP7 in vesicles that contain TC10. Altogether, our work shows a new role of Reelin in PNS, opening the option of therapeutic interventions to improve the regeneration process.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience Research: Do corticosterone levels predict female depressive‐like behavior in rodents?</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jnr.24686?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dysregulation of the hypothalamus–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis is often linked to the neurobiology of depression, though the presence and type of this dysregulation is not a consistent finding. Meanwhile, significant sex differences exist regarding depression and the HPA axis. Animal models of depression simulate certain aspects of the human disease and aim to advance our knowledge regarding its neurobiology and discover new antidepressant treatments. Most animal models of depression induce a depressive‐like phenotype taking advantage of stressful experimental conditions, that also increase corticosterone, the main stress hormone in rodents. In this review we present inconsistent results in male and female rodents regarding the interaction between the depressive‐like behavioral phenotype and corticosterone. In commonly used models, the female depressive‐like phenotype in rodents seems significantly less dependent on the stress hormone corticosterone, whereas the male behavioral response is more evident and associates with variations of corticosterone. Further research and clarification of this sex‐dependent interaction will have significant ramifications on the improvement of the validity of animal models of depression.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

&lt;p&gt;Metabolic parameters (O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; consmption and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production) are influenced by lithium in dose‐dependent fashion showing a narrow therapeutic index with a subtle balance between low and high metabolic rate. We confirmed &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; that treatment efficiency is dependent on mitochondrial genetic background and sex.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lithium is widely used to treat bipolar disorder. However, the efficacy and vulnerability as to its side effects are known to differ. Although the specific biochemical mechanism of action is still elusive, lithium may influence mitochondrial function, and consequently, metabolism. Lithium exposure in this study was conducted on a unique set of mito‐nuclear introgression lines of &lt;i&gt;Drosophila subobscura&lt;/i&gt; to disentangle the independent effects of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) against a common nuclear DNA background. The study addressed three issues: (a) whether lithium has a dose‐dependent effect on whole‐organism metabolic rate, (b) whether mtDNA haplotypes show divergent metabolic efficiency measured by metabolic rate to lithium exposure and (c) whether lithium influences the whole‐organism metabolic rate across sexes. The results confirm that lithium influenced the whole‐organism metabolic rate, showing a subtle balance between efficacy and adverse effects within a narrow dose range. In addition, lithium exposure was found to influence metabolism differently based on mtDNA haplotypes and sex. This preliminary research may have a range of biological implications for the role of mitochondrial variability in psychiatric disease and treatment by contributing to the understanding and predicting of the lithium treatment response and risk for toxic side effects.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jnr.24675?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parkinson's disease (PD) is a highly prevalent neurodegenerative condition. The disease involves the progressive degeneration of dopaminergic neurons located in the substantia nigra pars compacta. Among late‐onset, familial forms of Parkinson are cases with mutations in the PARK17 locus encoding the vacuolar protein sorting 35 (Vps35), a subunit of the retromer complex. The retromer complex is composed of a heterotrimeric protein core (Vps26‐Vps35‐Vps29). The best‐known role of retromer is the retrieval of cargoes from endosomes to the Golgi complex or the plasma membrane. However, recent literature indicates that retromer performs roles associated with lysosomal and mitochondrial functions and degradative pathways such as autophagy. A common point mutation affecting the retromer subunit Vps35 is D620N, which has been linked to the alterations in the aforementioned cellular processes as well as with neurodegeneration. Here, we review the main aspects of the malfunction of the retromer complex and its implications for PD pathology. Besides, we highlight several controversies still awaiting clarification.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience Research: Functional brain connectivity changes across the human life span: From fetal development to old age</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jnr.24669?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dynamic of the temporal correlations between brain areas, called functional connectivity (FC), undergoes complex transformations through the life span. In this review, we aim to provide an overview of these changes in the nonpathological brain from fetal life to advanced age. After a brief description of the main methods, we propose that FC development can be divided into four main phases: first, before birth, a strong change in FC leads to the emergence of functional proto‐networks, involving mainly within network short‐range connections. Then, during the first years of life, there is a strong widespread organization of networks which starts with segregation processes followed by a continuous increase in integration. Thereafter, from adolescence to early adulthood, a refinement of existing networks in the brain occurs, characterized by an increase in integrative processes until about 40 years. Middle age constitutes a pivotal period associated with an inversion of the functional brain trajectories with a decrease in segregation process in conjunction to a large‐scale reorganization of between network connections. Studies suggest that these processes are in line with the development of cognitive and sensory functions throughout life as well as their deterioration. During aging, results support the notion of dedifferentiation processes, which refer to the decrease in functional selectivity of the brain regions, resulting in more diffuse and less specialized FC, associated with the disruption of cognitive functions with age. The inversion of developmental processes during aging is in accordance with the developmental models of neuroanatomy for which the latest matured regions are the first to deteriorate.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jnr.24650?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Voltage‐gated Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; (Ca&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;) channels are crucial for neuronal excitability and synaptic transmission upon depolarization. Their properties &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; are modulated by their interaction with a variety of scaffolding proteins. Such interactions can influence the function and localization of Ca&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt; channels, as well as their coupling to intracellular second messengers and regulatory pathways, thus amplifying their signaling potential. Among these scaffolding proteins, a subset of PDZ (postsynaptic density‐95, Drosophila discs‐large, and zona occludens)‐domain containing proteins play diverse roles in modulating Ca&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt; channel properties. At the presynaptic terminal, PDZ proteins enrich Ca&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt; channels in the active zone, enabling neurotransmitter release by maintaining a tight and vital link between channels and vesicles. In the postsynaptic density, these interactions are essential in regulating dendritic spine morphology and postsynaptic signaling cascades. In this review, we highlight the studies that demonstrate dynamic regulations of neuronal Ca&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt; channels by PDZ proteins. We discuss the role of PDZ proteins in controlling channel activity, regulating channel cell surface density, and influencing channel‐mediated downstream signaling events. We highlight the importance of PDZ protein regulations of Ca&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt; channels and evaluate the link between this regulatory effect and human disease.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

&lt;p&gt;Using both novel and traditional lesion methods in humans, the neural networks responsible for mind‐wandering were studied. Both lesion analyses demonstrated that reduced mind‐wandering was associated with damage to brain regions within the default mode network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Functional neuroimaging research has consistently associated brain structures within the default mode network (DMN) and frontoparietal network (FPN) with mind‐wandering. Targeted lesion research has documented impairments in mind‐wandering after damage to the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and hippocampal regions associated with the DMN. However, no lesion studies to date have applied lesion network mapping to identify common networks associated with deficits in mind‐wandering. In lesion network mapping, resting‐state functional connectivity data from healthy participants are used to infer which brain regions are functionally connected to each lesion location from a sample with brain injury. In the current study, we conducted a lesion network mapping analysis to test the hypothesis that lesions affecting the DMN and FPN would be associated with diminished mind‐wandering. We assessed mind‐wandering frequency on the Imaginal Processes Inventory (IPI) in participants with brain injury (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 29) and healthy comparison participants without brain injury (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 19). Lesion network mapping analyses showed the strongest association of reduced mind‐wandering with the left inferior parietal lobule within the DMN. In addition, traditional lesion symptom mapping results revealed that reduced mind‐wandering was associated with lesions of the dorsal, ventral, and anterior sectors of mPFC, parietal lobule, and inferior frontal gyrus in the DMN (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05 uncorrected). These findings provide novel lesion support for the role of the DMN in mind‐wandering and contribute to a burgeoning literature on the neural correlates of spontaneous cognition.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

&lt;p&gt;Early life stress (ELS) induces long‐lasting social behavior deficits. We used chemogenetics to manipulate activity in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST), which undergoes maturation during the early postnatal period. Altering BNST activity in adulthood produced divergent effects on social behavior that were dependent upon history of ELS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trauma during critical periods of development can induce long‐lasting adverse effects. To study neural aberrations resulting from early life stress (ELS), many studies utilize rodent maternal separation, whereby pups are intermittently deprived of maternal care necessary for proper development. This can produce adulthood behavioral deficits related to anxiety, reward, and social behavior. The bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) encodes aspects of anxiety‐like and social behaviors, and also undergoes developmental maturation during the early postnatal period, rendering it vulnerable to effects of ELS. Mice underwent maternal separation (separation 4 hr/day during postnatal day (PD)2–5 and 8 hr/day on PD6‐16) with early weaning on PD17, which induced behavioral deficits in adulthood performance on two‐part social interaction task designed to test social motivation (choice between a same‐sex novel conspecific or an empty cup) and social novelty preference (choice between the original‐novel conspecific vs. a new‐novel conspecific). We used chemogenetics to non‐selectively silence or activate neurons in the BNST to examine its role in social motivation and social novelty preference, in mice with or without the history of ELS. Manipulation of BNST produced differing social behavior effects in non‐stressed versus ELS mice; social motivation was decreased in non‐stressed mice following BNST activation, but unchanged following BNST silencing, while ELS mice showed no change in social behavior after BNST activation, but exhibited enhancement of social motivation—for which they were deficient prior—following BNST silencing. Findings emphasize the BNST as a potential therapeutic target for social anxiety disorders instigated by childhood trauma.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience Research: Gender inequality in academia: Problems and solutions for women faculty in STEM</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jnr.24631?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently there is widespread interest in women's underrepresentation in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM); however, progress toward gender equality in these fields is slow. More alarmingly, these gender disparities worsen when examining women's representation within STEM departments in academia. While the number of women receiving postgraduate degrees has increased in recent years, the number of women in STEM faculty positions remains largely unchanged. One explanation for this lack of progress toward gender parity is negative and pervasive gender stereotypes, which may facilitate hiring discrimination and reduce opportunities for women's career advancement. Women in STEM also have lower social capital (e.g., support networks), limiting women's opportunities to earn tenure and learn about grant funding mechanisms. Women faculty in STEM may also perceive their academic climate as unwelcoming and threatening, and report hostility and uncomfortable tensions in their work environments, such as sexual harassment and discrimination. Merely the presence of gender‐biased cues in physical spaces targeted toward men (e.g., “geeky” décor) can foster a sense of not belonging in STEM. We describe the following three factors that likely contribute to gender inequalities and women's departure from academic STEM fields: (a) numeric underrepresentation and stereotypes, (b) lack of supportive social networks, and (c) chilly academic climates. We discuss potential solutions for these problems, focusing on National Science Foundation‐funded ADVANCE organizational change interventions that target (a) recruiting diverse applicants (e.g., training search committees), (b) mentoring, networking, and professional development (e.g., promoting women faculty networks); and (c) improving academic climate (e.g., educating male faculty on gender bias).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience Research: Sex/gender differences in brain function and structure in alcohol use: A narrative review of neuroimaging findings over the last 10 years</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jnr.24625?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the last 10 years, rates of alcohol use disorder (AUD) have increased in women by 84% relative to a 35% increase in men. Rates of alcohol use and high‐risk drinking have also increased in women by 16% and 58% relative to a 7% and 16% increase in men, respectively, over the last decade. This robust increase in drinking among women highlights the critical need to identify the underlying neural mechanisms that may contribute to problematic alcohol consumption across sex/gender (SG), especially given that many neuroimaging studies are underpowered to detect main or interactive effects of SG on imaging outcomes. This narrative review aims to explore the recent neuroimaging literature on SG differences in brain function and structure as it pertains to alcohol across positron emission tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and functional magnetic resonance imaging modalities in humans. Additional work using magnetic resonance spectroscopy, diffusion tensor imaging, and event‐related potentials to examine SG differences in AUD will be covered. Overall, current research on the neuroimaging of AUD, alcohol consumption, or risk of AUD is limited, and findings are mixed regarding the effect of SG on neurochemical, structural, and functional mechanisms associated with AUD. We address SG disparities in the neuroimaging of AUD and propose a call to action to include women in brain imaging research. Future studies are crucial to our understanding of the neurobiological underpinnings of AUD across neural systems and the vulnerability for AUD among women and men.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

&lt;p&gt;A faulty radial glia scaffold and an abnormal cell layering were observed in the hippocampus of male, but not female, biogenesis of lysosome‐related organelles complex‐1‐deficient mice, early postnatally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The function(s) of the Biogenesis of Lysosome‐related Organelles Complex‐1 (BLOC‐1) during brain development is to date largely unknown. Here, we investigated how its absence alters the trajectory of postnatal brain development using as model the pallid mouse. Most of the defects observed early postnatally in the mutant mice were more prominent in males than in females and in the hippocampus. Male mutant mice, but not females, had smaller brains as compared to sex‐matching wild types at postnatal day 1 (P1), this deficit was largely recovered by P14 and P45. An abnormal cytoarchitecture of the pyramidal cell layer of the hippocampus was observed in P1 pallid male, but not female, or juvenile mice (P45), along with severely decreased expression levels of the radial glial marker Glutamate‐Aspartate Transporter. Transcriptomic analyses showed that the overall response to the lack of functional BLOC‐1 was more pronounced in hippocampi at P1 than at P45 or in the cerebral cortex. These observations suggest that absence of BLOC‐1 renders males more susceptible to perinatal brain maldevelopment and although most abnormalities appear to have been resolved in juvenile animals, still permanent defects may be present, resulting in faulty neuronal circuits, and contribute to previously reported cognitive and behavioral phenotypes in adult BLOC‐1‐deficient mice.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The development of safe and effective treatments for age‐associated neurodegenerative disorders is an on‐going challenge faced by the scientific field. Key to the development of such therapies is the appropriate selection of modeling systems in which to investigate disease mechanisms and to test candidate interventions. There are unique challenges in the development of representative laboratory models of neurodegenerative diseases, including the complexity of the human brain, the cumulative and variable contributions of genetic and environmental factors over the course of a lifetime, inability to culture human primary neurons, and critical central nervous system differences between small animal models and humans. While traditional rodent models have advanced our understanding of neurodegenerative disease mechanisms, key divergences such as the species‐specific genetic background can limit the application of animal models in many cases. Here we review &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; human neuronal systems that employ stem cell and reprogramming technology and their application to a range of neurodegenerative diseases. Specifically, we compare human‐induced pluripotent stem cell‐derived neurons to directly converted, or transdifferentiated, induced neurons, as both model systems can take advantage of patient‐derived human tissue to produce neurons in culture. We present recent technical developments using these two modeling systems, as well as current limitations to these systems, with the aim of advancing investigation of neuropathogenic mechanisms using these models.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience Research: Long term effects of stress on hippocampal function: Emphasis on early life stress paradigms and potential involvement of neuropeptide Y</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jnr.24614?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The brain is both central in orchestrating the response to stress, and, a very sensitive target when such response is not controlled. In fact, stress has long been associated with the onset and/or exacerbation of several neuropsychiatric disorders such as anxiety, depression, and drug addiction. The hippocampus is a key brain region involved in the response to stress, not only due to its anatomical connections with the hypothalamic‐pituitary‐adrenal axis but also as a major target of stress mediators. The hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG)‐CA3 circuit, composed of DG granule cells axons (mossy fibers) synapsing onto CA3 pyramidal cells, plays an essential role in memory encoding and retrieval, functions that are vulnerable to stress. Although naturally excitatory, this circuit is under the inhibitory control of GABAergic interneurons that maintain the excitation/inhibition balance. One subgroup of such interneurons produces neuropeptide Y (NPY), which has emerged as a promising endogenous stress “resilience molecule” due to its anxiolytic and anti‐epileptic properties. Here we examine existing evidence that reveals a potential role for hilar NPY+ interneurons in mediating stress‐induced changes in hippocampal function. We will focus specifically on rodent models of early life stress (ELS), defined as adverse conditions during the early postnatal period that can have profound consequences for neurodevelopment. Collectively, these findings suggest that the long‐lasting effects of ELS might stem from the loss of GABAergic NPY+ cells, which then can lead to reduced inhibition in the DG‐CA3 pathway. Such change might then lead to hyperexcitability and concomitant hippocampal‐dependent behavioral deficits.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

&lt;p&gt;Functional circadian rhythms are essential for fertility and successful reproduction. PER2::Luciferase circadian reporter mice determined relationships between circadian rhythms during the estrous cycle and pregnancy and how these rhythms could be regulated by progesterone, a steroid important in reproductive function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Molecular and behavioral timekeeping is regulated by the circadian system which includes the brain's suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) that translates environmental light information into neuronal and endocrine signals aligning peripheral tissue rhythms to the time of day. Despite the critical role of circadian rhythms in fertility, it remains unexplored how circadian rhythms change within reproductive tissues during pregnancy. To determine how estrous cycle and pregnancy impact phase relationships of reproductive tissues, we used PER2::Luciferase (PER2::LUC) circadian reporter mice and determined the time of day of PER2::LUC peak (phase) in the SCN, pituitary, uterus, and ovary. The relationships between reproductive tissue PER2::LUC phases changed throughout the estrous cycle and late pregnancy and were accompanied by changes to PER2::LUC period in the SCN, uterus, and ovary. To determine if the phase relationship adaptations were driven by sex steroids, we asked if progesterone, a hormone involved in estrous cyclicity and pregnancy, could regulate Per2‐luciferase expression. Using an &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; transfection assay, we found that progesterone increased Per2‐luciferase expression in immortalized SCN (SCN2.2) and arcuate nucleus (KTAR) cells. In addition, progesterone shortened PER2::LUC period in &lt;i&gt;ex vivo&lt;/i&gt; uterine tissue recordings collected during pregnancy. As progesterone dramatically increases during pregnancy, we evaluated wheel‐running patterns in PER2::LUC mice. We confirmed that activity levels decrease during pregnancy and found that activity onset was delayed. Although SCN, but not arcuate nucleus, PER2::LUC period changed during late pregnancy, onset of locomotor activity did not correlate with SCN or arcuate nucleus PER2::LUC period.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience Research: The role of maternal diet on offspring gut microbiota development: A review</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jnr.24605?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In offspring, an adequate maternal diet is important for neurodevelopment. One mechanism by which maternal diet impacts neurodevelopment is through its dynamic role in the development of the gut microbiota. Communication between the gut, and its associated microbiota, and the brain is facilitated by the vagus nerve, in addition to other routes. Currently, the mechanisms through which maternal diet impacts offspring microbiota development are not well‐defined. Therefore, this review aims to investigate the relationship between maternal diet during pregnancy and offspring microbiota development and its impact on neurodevelopment. Both human and animal model studies were reviewed to understand the impact of maternal diet on offspring microbiota development and potential consequences on neurodevelopment. In the period after birth, as reported in both human and model system studies, maternal diet impacts offspring bacterial colonization (e.g., decreased presence of &lt;i&gt;Lactobacillus reuteri&lt;/i&gt; as a result of a high‐fat maternal diet). It remains unknown whether these changes persist into adulthood and whether they impact vulnerability to disease. Therefore, further long‐term studies are required in both human and model systems to study these changes. Our survey of the literature indicates that maternal diet influences early postnatal microbiota development, which in turn, may serve as a mechanism through which maternal diet impacts neurodevelopment.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience Research: The placenta‐brain‐axis</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jnr.24603?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All mammalian species depend on the placenta, a transient organ, for exchange of gases, nutrients, and waste between the mother and conceptus. Besides serving as a conduit for such exchanges, the placenta produces hormones and other factors that influence maternal physiology and fetal development. To meet all of these adaptations, the placenta has evolved to become the most structurally diverse organ within all mammalian taxa. However, commonalities exist as to how placental responses promote survival against &lt;i&gt;in utero&lt;/i&gt; threats and can alter the trajectory of fetal development, in particular the brain. Increasing evidence suggests that reactions of the  placenta to various &lt;i&gt;in utero&lt;/i&gt; stressors may lead to long‐standing health outcomes, otherwise considered developmental origin of health and disease effects. Besides transferring nutrients and gases, the placenta produces neurotransmitters, including serotonin, dopamine, norepinephrine/epinephrine, that may circulate and influence brain development. Neurobehavioral disorders, such as autism spectrum disorders, likely trace their origins back to placental disturbances. This intimate relationship between the placenta and brain has led to coinage of the term, the placenta‐brain‐axis. This axis will be the focus herein, including how conceptus sex might influence it, and technologies employed to parse out the effects of placental‐specific transcript expression changes on later neurobehavioral disorders. Ultimately, the placenta might provide a historical record of &lt;i&gt;in utero&lt;/i&gt; threats the fetus confronted and a roadmap to understand how placenta responses to such encounters impacts the placental‐brain‐axis. Improved early diagnostic and preventative approaches may thereby be designed to mitigate such placental disruptions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

&lt;p&gt;Alterations in lipid metabolism, impaired protein synthesis, epigenetic abnormal modifications, oxidative stress and lower brain‐derived neurotrophic factor levels caused by phenylalanine accumulation may collaborate to hypomyelination/demyelination in phenylketonuria. HMGR: 3‐hydroxy‐3‐methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase; OL: oligodendrocytes; OPC: oligodendrocyte precursor cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;White matter pathologies, as well as intellectual disability, microcephaly, and other central nervous system injuries, are clinical traits commonly ascribed to classic phenylketonuria (PKU). PKU is an inherited metabolic disease elicited by the deficiency of phenylalanine hydroxylase. Accumulation of &lt;span class=&quot;smallCaps&quot;&gt;l&lt;/span&gt;‐phenylalanine (Phe) and its metabolites is found in tissues and body fluids in phenylketonuric patients. In order to mitigate the clinical findings, rigorous dietary Phe restriction constitutes the core of therapeutic management in PKU. Myelination is the process whereby the oligodendrocytes wrap myelin sheaths around the axons, supporting the conduction of action potentials. White matter injuries are implicated in the brain damage related to PKU, especially in untreated or poorly treated patients. The present review summarizes evidence toward putative mechanisms driving the white matter pathology in PKU patients.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Iron heterogeneity in early active multiple sclerosis lesions</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25974?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a heterogeneous inflammatory demyelinating disease. Iron distribution is altered in MS patients’ brains suggesting iron liberation within active lesions amplifies demyelination and neurodegeneration. Whether the amount and distribution of iron are similar or different among different MS immunopatterns is currently unknown.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We used synchrotron X‐ray fluorescence imaging, histology and immunohistochemistry to compare the iron quantity and distribution between immunopattern II and III early active MS lesions. We analyzed archival autopsy and biopsy tissue from 21 MS patients.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Immunopattern II early active lesions contain 64% more iron (95%CI: 17%, 127%; p=0.004) than immunopattern III lesions, and 30% more iron than the surrounding periplaque white matter (95%CI: 3%, 64%; p=0.03). Iron in immunopattern III lesions is 28% lower than in the periplaque white matter (95%CI: ‐40%, ‐14%; p&amp;lt;0.001). When normalizing the iron content of early active lesions to that of surrounding periplaque white matter, the ratio is significantly higher in immunopattern II (p&amp;lt;0.001). Micro‐focused X‐ray fluorescence imaging shows that iron in immunopattern II lesions localizes to macrophages, while macrophages in immunopattern III lesions contain little iron.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iron distribution and content are heterogeneous in early active MS lesions. Iron accumulates in macrophages in immunopattern II, but not immunopattern III lesions. This heterogeneity in the two most common MS immunopatterns may be explained by different macrophage polarization, origin or different demyelination mechanisms, and paves the way for developing new or using existing iron‐sensitive MRI techniques to differentiate among immunopatterns in the general non‐biopsied MS patient population.&lt;/p&gt;

	<content:encoded>&lt;img alt=&quot;Laminar distribution of cortical projection neurons to the pulvinar: A comparative study in cats and mice&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/2fbba36d-833e-4891-a8c3-f1cce1df54af/cne25072-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The laminar distribution of corticothalamic (CT) neurons projecting to the pulvinar thalamic nucleus was assessed in two species: cats and mice. Following injections of the retrograde tracer fragment B of cholera toxin (CTb) in the pulvinar, the morphology, and distribution of labeled neurons in the infragranular layers of the visual cortex was compared between the two species. In cats, CT neurons were mostly distributed in Layer 6 in all extrastriate areas. The exception was Area 17 that labeled neurons where almost exclusively located in Layer 5. In mice, CT neurons were mostly located in Layer 6 across all areas, including V1. Our findings show a distinct pattern of CT projections in mice in comparison to the one in cats suggesting that the pulvinar nucleus plays distinct roles in the transthalamic transmission of visual information in these species.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cortical processing of visual information is thought to follow a hierarchical framework. This framework of connections between visual areas is based on the laminar patterns of direct feedforward and feedback cortico‐cortical projections. However, this view ignores the cortico‐thalamo‐cortical projections to the pulvinar nucleus in the thalamus, which provides an alternative transthalamic information transfer between cortical areas. It was proposed that corticothalamic (CT) pathways follow a similar hierarchical pattern as cortico‐cortical connections. Two main types of CT projections have been recognized: drivers and modulators. Drivers originate mainly in Layer 5 whereas modulators are from Layer 6. Little is known about the laminar distribution of these projections to the pulvinar across visual cortical areas. Here, we analyzed the distribution of CT neurons projecting to the lateral posterior (LP) thalamus in two species: cats and mice. Injections of the retrograde tracer fragment B of cholera toxin (CTb) were performed in the LP. The morphology and cortical laminar distribution of CTb‐labeled neurons was assessed. In cats, neurons were mostly found in Layer 6 except in Area 17, where they were mostly in Layer 5. In contrast, CT neurons in mice were mostly located in Layer 6 across all areas. Thus, our results demonstrate that CT projections in mice do not follow the same organization as cats suggesting that the transthalamic pathways play distinct roles in these species.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Prevention of Epilepsy in Infants with Tuberous Sclerosis Complex in the EPISTOP Trial</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25956?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Epilepsy develops in 70 to 90% of children with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) and is often resistant to medication. Recently, the concept of preventive antiepileptic treatment to modify the natural history of epilepsy has been proposed. EPISTOP was a clinical trial designed to compare preventive versus conventional antiepileptic treatment in TSC infants.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this multicenter study, 94 infants with TSC without seizure history were followed with monthly video electroencephalography (EEG), and received vigabatrin either as conventional antiepileptic treatment, started after the first electrographic or clinical seizure, or preventively when epileptiform EEG activity before seizures was detected. At 6 sites, subjects were randomly allocated to treatment in a 1:1 ratio in a randomized controlled trial (RCT). At 4 sites, treatment allocation was fixed; this was denoted an open‐label trial (OLT). Subjects were followed until 2 years of age. The primary endpoint was the time to first clinical seizure.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 54 subjects, epileptiform EEG abnormalities were identified before seizures. Twenty‐seven were included in the RCT and 27 in the OLT. The time to the first clinical seizure was significantly longer with preventive than conventional treatment [RCT: 364 days (95% confidence interval [CI] = 223–535) vs 124 days (95% CI = 33–149); OLT: 426 days (95% CI = 258–628) vs 106 days (95% CI = 11–149)]. At 24 months, our pooled analysis showed preventive treatment reduced the risk of clinical seizures (odds ratio [OR] = 0.21, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.032), drug‐resistant epilepsy (OR = 0.23, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.022), and infantile spasms (OR = 0, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001). No adverse events related to preventive treatment were noted.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Preventive treatment with vigabatrin was safe and modified the natural history of seizures in TSC, reducing the risk and severity of epilepsy. ANN NEUROL 2020&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: MIRRAGGE – Minimum Information Required for Reproducible AGGregation Experiments</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2020.582488</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Reports on phase separation and amyloid formation for multiple proteins and aggregation-prone peptides are recurrently used to explore the molecular mechanisms associated with several human diseases. The information conveyed by these reports can be used directly in translational investigation, e.g., for the design of better drug screening strategies, or be compiled in databases for benchmarking novel aggregation-predicting algorithms. Given that minute protocol variations determine different outcomes of protein aggregation assays, there is a strong urge for standardized descriptions of the different types of aggregates and the detailed methods used in their production. In an attempt to address this need, we assembled the Minimum Information Required for Reproducible Aggregation Experiments (MIRRAGGE) guidelines, considering first-principles and the established literature on protein self-assembly and aggregation. This consensus information aims to cover the major and subtle determinants of experimental reproducibility while avoiding excessive technical details that are of limited practical interest for non-specialized users. The MIRRAGGE table (template available in Supplementary Information) is useful as a guide for the design of new studies and as a checklist during submission of experimental reports for publication. Full disclosure of relevant information also enables other researchers to reproduce results correctly and facilitates systematic data deposition into curated databases.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.593867</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Dynamic causal modeling (DCM) is an analysis technique that has been successfully used to infer about directed connectivity between brain regions based on imaging data such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Most variants of DCM for fMRI rely on a simple bilinear differential equation for neural activation, making it difficult to interpret the results in terms of local neural dynamics. In this work, we introduce a modification to DCM for fMRI by replacing the bilinear equation with a non-linear Wilson-Cowan based equation and use Bayesian Model Comparison (BMC) to show that this modification improves the model evidences. Improved model evidence of the non-linear model is shown for our empirical data (imitation of facial expressions) and validated by synthetic data as well as an empirical test dataset (attention to visual motion) used in previous foundational papers. For our empirical data, we conduct the analysis for a group of 42 healthy participants who performed an imitation task, activating regions putatively containing the human mirror neuron system (MNS). In this regard, we build 540 models as one family for comparing the standard bilinear with the modified Wilson-Cowan models on the family-level. Using this modification, we can interpret the sigmoid transfer function as an averaged f-I curve of many neurons in a single region with a sigmoidal format. In this way, we can make a direct inference from the macroscopic model to detailed microscopic models. The new DCM variant shows superior model evidence on all tested data sets.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neural Technology: Evaluation of a P300-Based Brain-Machine Interface for a Robotic Hand-Orthosis Control</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.589659</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;This work presents the design, implementation, and evaluation of a P300-based brain-machine interface (BMI) developed to control a robotic hand-orthosis. The purpose of this system is to assist patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) who cannot open and close their hands by themselves. The user of this interface can select one of six targets, which represent the flexion-extension of one finger independently or the movement of the five fingers simultaneously. We tested offline and online our BMI on eighteen healthy subjects (HS) and eight ALS patients. In the offline test, we used the calibration data of each participant recorded in the experimental sessions to estimate the accuracy of the BMI to classify correctly single epochs as target or non-target trials. On average, the system accuracy was 78.7% for target epochs and 85.7% for non-target trials. Additionally, we observed significant P300 responses in the calibration recordings of all the participants, including the ALS patients. For the BMI online test, each subject performed from 6 to 36 attempts of target selections using the interface. In this case, around 46% of the participants obtained 100% of accuracy, and the average online accuracy was 89.83%. The maximum information transfer rate (ITR) observed in the experiments was 52.83 bit/min, whereas that the average ITR was 18.13 bit/min. The contributions of this work are the following. First, we report the development and evaluation of a mind-controlled robotic hand-orthosis for patients with ALS. To our knowledge, this BMI is one of the first P300-based assistive robotic devices with multiple targets evaluated on people with ALS. Second, we provide a database with calibration data and online EEG recordings obtained in the evaluation of our BMI. This data is useful to develop and compare other BMI systems and test the processing pipelines of similar applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Repeatability of Neural and Autonomic Responses to Acute Psychosocial Stress</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.585509</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;FMRI Montreal Imaging Stress Tasks (MIST) have been shown to activate endocrine and autonomic stress responses that are mediated by a prefrontal cortex (PFC)-hippocampus-amygdala circuit. However, the stability of the neurobehavioral responses over time and the ability to monitor response to clinical interventions has yet to be validated. The objective of this study was to compare the fMRI and physiologic responses to acute psychosocial stress in healthy volunteers during initial and follow-up visits approximately 13 weeks later, simulating a typical duration of clinical intervention. We hypothesized that responses to stress would remain highly conserved across the 2 visits in the absence of an intervention. 15 healthy volunteers completed a variant of control math task (CMT) and stress math task (SMT) conditions based on MIST. Neural responses were modeled using an event-related design with estimates for math performance and auditory feedback for each task condition. For each visit, measures of stress reactivity included differential fMRI and heart rate (SMT-CMT), as well as salivary alpha-amylase before and after scanning sessions. The results revealed that differential fMRI, as well as increased heart rate and salivary alpha-amylase from before and after scanning remained similar between visits. Intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) values revealed areas of reliable task-dependent BOLD fMRI signal response across visits for peaks of clusters for the main effect of condition (SMT vs CMT) within dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), insula, and hippocampus regions during math performance and within subgenual ACC, posterior cingulate cortex, dorsolateral PFC regions during auditory feedback. Given that the neurobehavioral response to acute stress remained highly conserved across visits in the absence of an intervention, this study confirms the utility for MIST for assessing longitudinal changes in controlled trials that can identify underlying neurobiological mechanisms involved in mediating the efficacy of stress-reduction interventions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: tVNS Increases Liking of Orally Sampled Low-Fat Foods: A Pilot Study</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.600995</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Recently a role for the vagus nerve in conditioning food preferences was established in rodents. In a prospective controlled clinical trial in humans, invasive vagus nerve stimulation shifted food choice toward lower fat content. Here we explored whether hedonic aspects of an orally sampled food stimulus can be modulated by non-invasive transcutaneous vagus nerve stimulation (tVNS) in humans. In healthy participants (n = 10, five women, 20–32 years old, no obesity) we tested liking and wanting ratings of food samples with varying fat or sugar content with or without tVNS in a sham-controlled within-participants design. To determine effects of tVNS on food intake, we also measured voluntary consumption of milkshake. Spontaneous eye blink rate was measured as a proxy for dopamine tone. Liking of low-fat, but not high-fat puddings, was higher for tVNS relative to sham stimulation. Other outcomes showed no differences. These findings support a role for the vagus nerve promoting post-ingestive reward signals. Our results suggest that tVNS may be used to increase liking of low-calorie foods, which may support healthier food choices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Motor Point Stimulation in Spinal Paired Associative Stimulation can Facilitate Spinal Cord Excitability</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.593806</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Paired associative stimulation at the spinal cord (spinal PAS) has been shown to increase muscle force and dexterity by strengthening the corticomuscular connection, through spike timing dependent plasticity. Typically, transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and transcutaneous peripheral nerve electrical stimulation (PNS) are often used in spinal PAS. PNS targets superficial nerve branches, by which the number of applicable muscles is limited. Alternatively, a muscle can be activated by positioning the stimulation electrode on the “motor point” (MPS), which is the most sensitive location of a muscle to electrical stimulation. Although this can increase the number of applicable muscles for spinal PAS, nobody has tested whether MPS can be used for the spinal PAS to date. Here we investigated the feasibility of using MPS instead of PNS for spinal PAS. Ten healthy male individuals (26.0 ± 3.5 yrs) received spinal PAS on two separate days with different stimulation timings expected to induce (1) facilitation of corticospinal excitability (REAL) or (2) no effect (CONTROL) on the soleus. The motor evoked potentials (MEP) response curve in the soleus was measured prior to the spinal PAS, immediately after (0 min) and at 10, 20, 30 min post-intervention as a measure of corticospinal excitability. The post-intervention MEP response curve areas were larger in the REAL condition than the CONTROL conditions. Further, the post-intervention MEP response curve areas were significantly larger than pre-intervention in the REAL condition but not in the CONTROL condition. We conclude that MPS can facilitate corticospinal excitability through spinal PAS.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Children With Developmental Coordination Disorder Show Altered Visuomotor Control During Stair Negotiation Associated With Heightened State Anxiety</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.589502</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Safe stair negotiation is an everyday task that children with developmental coordination disorder (DCD) are commonly thought to struggle with. Yet, there is currently a paucity of research supporting these claims. We investigated the visuomotor control strategies underpinning stair negotiation in children with (N = 18, age = 10.50 ± 2.04 years) and without (N = 16, age = 10.94 ± 2.08 years) DCD by measuring kinematics, gaze behavior and state anxiety as they ascended and descended a staircase. A questionnaire was administered to determine parents' confidence in their child's ability to safely navigate stairs and their child's fall history (within the last year). Kinematics were measured using three-dimensional motion capture (Vicon), whilst gaze was measured using mobile eye-tracking equipment (Pupil labs). The parents of DCD children reported significantly lower confidence in their child's ability to maintain balance on the stairs and significantly more stair-related falls in the previous year compared to the parents of typically developing (TD) children. During both stair ascent and stair descent, the children with DCD took longer to ascend/descend the staircase and displayed greater handrail use, reflecting a more cautious stair negotiation strategy. No differences were observed between groups in their margin of stability, but the DCD children exhibited significantly greater variability in their foot-clearances over the step edge, which may increase the risk of a fall. For stair descent only, the DCD children reported significantly higher levels of state anxiety than the TD children and looked significantly further along the staircase during the initial entry phase, suggesting an anxiety-related response that may bias gaze toward the planning of future stepping actions over the accurate execution of an ongoing step. Taken together, our findings provide the first quantifiable evidence that (a) safe stair negotiation is a significant challenge for children with DCD, and that (b) this challenge is reflected by marked differences in their visuomotor control strategies and state anxiety levels. Whilst it is currently unclear whether these differences are contributing to the frequency of stair-related falls in children with DCD, our findings pave the way for future research to answer these important questions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Reduced Olfactory Bulb Volume in Obesity and Its Relation to Metabolic Health Status</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.586998</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Smell perception plays an important role in eating behavior and might be involved in body weight gain. Since a body of literature implies that olfactory perception and function is hampered in obesity, we here investigate neuroanatomical correlates of this phenomenon. We assessed olfactory bulb (OB) volume with magnetic resonance imaging in 67 healthy participants with a body mass index (BMI) from 18.9 to 45.4 kg/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (mean = 28.58 ± 6.64). Moreover, we obtained psychophysiological data on olfactory ability (Sniffin’ Sticks, Food associated odor test) and self-report measurements on eating behavior. Additionally, we collected parameters associated with metabolic health in obesity (waist-hip ratio, waist-height ratio, leptin levels, body fat percentage, fat mass index, insulin resistance) to investigate recently proposed mechanistic explanatory models of why olfaction may be altered in obesity. We showed that OB volume was significantly lower in participants with obesity when compared to those of normal weight. Moreover, we found weak to moderate negative correlations between OB volume and BMI and related measures of metabolic health, especially leptin, body fat percentage, waist-height ratio and insulin resistance. However, neither OB volume nor BMI were related to olfactory function in our young and healthy sample. Nevertheless, our results provide first indications that obesity is associated with brain anatomical changes in the OBs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Egocentric Navigation Abilities Predict Episodic Memory Performance</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.574224</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The medial temporal lobe supports both navigation and declarative memory. On this basis, a theory of phylogenetic continuity has been proposed according to which episodic and semantic memories have evolved from egocentric (e.g., path integration) and allocentric (e.g., map-based) navigation in the physical world, respectively. Here, we explored the behavioral significance of this neurophysiological model by investigating the relationship between the performance of healthy individuals on a path integration and an episodic memory task. We investigated the path integration performance through a proprioceptive Triangle Completion Task and assessed episodic memory through a picture recognition task. We evaluated the specificity of the association between performance in these two tasks by including in the study design a verbal semantic memory task. We also controlled for the effect of attention and working memory and tested the robustness of the results by including alternative versions of the path integration and semantic memory tasks. We found a significant positive correlation between the performance on the path integration the episodic, but not semantic, memory tasks. This pattern of correlation was not explained by general cognitive abilities and persisted also when considering a visual path integration task and a non-verbal semantic memory task. Importantly, a cross-validation analysis showed that participants' egocentric navigation abilities reliably predicted episodic memory performance. Altogether, our findings support the hypothesis of a phylogenetic continuity between egocentric navigation and episodic memory and pave the way for future research on the potential causal role of egocentric navigation on multiple forms of episodic memory.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The psychopathological profile of patients with medication overuse headache (MOH) appears to be particularly complex. To better define it, we evaluated their performance on a targeted psychological profile assessment. We designed a case-control study comparing MOH patients and matched healthy controls (HC). Headache frequency, drug consumption, HIT-6, and MIDAS scores were recorded. All participants filled in the following questionnaires: Beck Depression Inventory-II Edition (BDI-2), trait subtest of State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI-Y), Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS), Barratt Impulsiveness Scale (BIS-11), Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS-20). The primary endpoint was to establish if MOH patients have an altered psychopathological profile. The secondary endpoint was to establish whether the worst profile correlates with the worsening of headache and disability measures. We enrolled 48 consecutive MOH patients and 48 HC. MOH patients showed greater difficulty in recognition/regulation of emotions (DERS, TAS-20), depression (BDI-2), anxiety (STAI-Y), and impulsiveness (BIS-11). We found a positive correlation among DERS, BDI-2, STAI-Y, and BIS scores and MIDAS and HIT-6 scores and among DERS and headache frequency and drug consumption. MOH patients showed a high rate of emotion regulation difficulties, depression, and anxiety, which may negatively affect their headaches. The ability to regulate/recognize emotions may play a central role in sustaining medication overuse.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroanatomy: Afferent Projections to Area Prostriata of the Mouse</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnana.2020.605021</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Area prostriata plays important roles in fast detection and analysis of peripheral visual information. It remains unclear whether the prostriata directly receives and integrates information from other modalities. To gain insight into this issue, we investigated brain-wide afferent projections to mouse prostriata. We find convergent projections to layer 1 of the prostriata from primary and association visual and auditory cortices; retrosplenial, lateral entorhinal, and anterior cingulate cortices; subiculum; presubiculum; and anterior thalamic nuclei. Innervation of layers 2–3 of the prostriata mainly originates from the presubiculum (including postsubiculum) and anterior midline thalamic region. Layer 5 of the prostriata mainly receives its inputs from medial entorhinal, granular retrosplenial, and medial orbitofrontal cortices and anteromedial thalamic nucleus while layer 6 gets its major inputs from ectorhinal, postrhinal, and agranular retrosplenial cortices. The claustrum, locus coeruleus, and basal forebrain provide relatively diffuse innervation to the prostriata. Moreover, Cre-dependent tracing in cortical areas reveals that the cells of origin of the prostriata inputs are located in layers 2–4 and 5 of the neocortical areas, layers 2 and 5 of the medial entorhinal cortex, and layer 5 of the retrosplenial cortex. These results indicate that the prostriata is a unique region where primary and association visual and auditory inputs directly integrate with many limbic inputs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A rare anatomic variant of a markedly enlarged anterior external arcuate fasciculus (AEAF) on the ventral medullary surface is reported and compared to two controls. The hypertrophic AEAF was nine times larger in diameter than normal, whereas the arcuate nucleus (AN) and inferior olivary nucleus (ION) appeared histologically normal in size and neuronal distribution, and morphometric analysis of the AN confirmed that it was within the normal range. Calbindin-2 (calretinin, CALB2) expression was identified in the AN and in the fibers of the normal AEAF. The hypertrophic AEAF did not contain calbindin-2–expressing fibers. CALB2 expression was also present in the ventrolateral portion of the ION, both in the index case and in one of the control cases. The origin of the additional fibers was not identified; however, the potential origin of these fibers and its implications for the development of the AEAF are discussed.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroanatomy: HPG-Dependent Peri-Pubertal Regulation of Adult Neurogenesis in Mice</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnana.2020.584493</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Adult neurogenesis, a striking form of neural plasticity, is involved in the modulation of social stimuli driving reproduction. Previous studies on adult neurogenesis have shown that this process is significantly modulated around puberty in female mice. Puberty is a critical developmental period triggered by increased secretion of the gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH), which controls the activity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis (HPG). Secretion of HPG-axis factors at puberty participates to the refinement of neural circuits that govern reproduction. Here, by exploiting a transgenic GnRH deficient mouse model, that progressively loses GnRH expression during postnatal development (GnRH::Cre;Dicer&lt;sup&gt;loxP/loxP&lt;/sup&gt;mice), we found that a postnatally-acquired dysfunction in the GnRH system affects adult neurogenesis selectively in the subventricular-zone neurogenic niche in a sexually dimorphic way. Moreover, by examining adult females ovariectomized before the onset of puberty, we provide important evidence that, among the HPG-axis secreting factors, the circulating levels of gonadal hormones during pre-/peri-pubertal life contribute to set-up the proper adult subventricular zone-olfactory bulb neurogenic system.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.593320</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Background: Although cognitive decline (CD) is associated with increased post-operative morbidity and mortality, routinely screening patients remains difficult. The main objective of this prospective study is to use the EEG response to a Propofol-based general anesthesia (GA) to reveal CD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: 42 patients with collected EEG and Propofol target concentration infusion (TCI) during GA had a preoperative cognitive assessment using MoCA. We evaluated the performance of three variables to detect CD (MoCA &amp;lt; 25 points): age, Propofol requirement to induce unconsciousness (TCI at SEF&lt;sub&gt;95&lt;/sub&gt;: 8–13 Hz) and the frontal alpha band power (AP at SEF&lt;sub&gt;95&lt;/sub&gt;: 8–13 Hz).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: The 17 patients (40%) with CD were significantly older (p &amp;lt; 0.001), had lower TCI (p &amp;lt; 0.001), and AP (p &amp;lt; 0.001). We found using logistic models that TCI and AP were the best set of variables associated with CD (AUC: 0.89) and performed better than age (p &amp;lt; 0.05). Propofol TCI had a greater impact on CD probability compared to AP, although both were complementary in detecting CD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: TCI and AP contribute additively to reveal patient with preoperative cognitive decline. Further research on post-operative cognitive trajectory are necessary to confirm the interest of intra operative variables in addition or as a substitute to cognitive evaluation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.591666</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Purpose: This study aimed to identify consistent gray matter volume (GMV) changes in the two subtypes of multiple system atrophy (MSA), including parkinsonism subtype (MSA-P), and cerebellar subtype (MSA-C), by conducting a voxel-wise meta-analysis of whole brain voxel-based morphometry (VBM) studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Method: VBM studies comparing MSA-P or MSA-C and healthy controls (HCs) were systematically searched in the PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science published from 1974 to 20 October 2020. A quantitative meta-analysis of VBM studies on MSA-P or MSA-C was performed using the effect size-based signed differential mapping (ES-SDM) method separately. A complementary analysis was conducted using the Seed-based d Mapping with Permutation of Subject Images (SDM-PSI) method, which allows a familywise error rate (FWE) correction for multiple comparisons of the results, for further validation of the results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Ten studies were included in the meta-analysis of MSA-P subtype, comprising 136 MSA-P patients and 211 HCs. Five studies were included in the meta-analysis of MSA-C subtype, comprising 89 MSA-C patients and 134 HCs. Cerebellum atrophy was detected in both MSA-P and MSA-C, whereas basal ganglia atrophy was only detected in MSA-P. Cerebral cortex atrophy was detected in both subtypes, with predominant impairment of the superior temporal gyrus, inferior frontal gyrus, temporal pole, insula, and amygdala in MSA-P and predominant impairment of the superior temporal gyrus, middle temporal gyrus, fusiform gyrus, and lingual gyrus in MSA-C. Most of these results survived the FWE correction in the complementary analysis, except for the bilateral amygdala and the left caudate nucleus in MSA-P, and the right superior temporal gyrus and the right middle temporal gyrus in MSA-C. These findings remained robust in the jackknife sensitivity analysis, and no significant heterogeneity was detected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: A different pattern of brain atrophy between MSA-P and MSA-C detected in the current study was in line with clinical manifestations and provided the evidence of the pathophysiology of the two subtypes of MSA.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Background: Acupuncture may be an effective complementary treatment for Alzheimer's disease (AD). The aim of this study was to summarize the evidence provided by systematic reviews (SRs)/meta-analyses (MAs) on the effect of acupuncture on AD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Eight electronic databases were searched from their inception until October 19, 2020. The methodological quality, reporting quality, and risk of bias of the included SRs were assessed by the Assessing the Methodological Quality of Systematic Reviews 2 (AMSTAR-2), the Risk of Bias in Systematic Reviews (ROBIS) tool, and the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA). Moreover, the evidence quality of the outcome measures was assessed by the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Eleven SRs/MAs met all inclusion criteria. According to the results of the AMSTAR-2, all included reviews were rated critically as being of low quality. With PRISMA, the reporting checklist was relatively complete, but some reporting weaknesses remained in the topics of the protocol and registration, search strategy, risk of bias, additional analyses, and funding. Based on the ROBIS tool, only two SRs/MAs had a low risk of bias. With the GRADE system, no high-quality evidence was found, and only seven outcomes provided moderate-quality evidence. Among the downgraded factors, the risk of bias within the original trials was ranked first, followed by inconsistency, imprecision, and publication bias.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: Acupuncture is a promising complementary treatment for AD. However, due to the low quality of the SRs/MAs supporting these results, high-quality studies with rigorous study designs and larger samples are needed before widespread recommendations can be made.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Hippocampus: Chronic stress has different immediate and delayed effects on hippocampal calretinin‐ and somatostatin‐positive cells</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/hipo.23285?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Past studies find that chronic stress alters inhibitory, GABAergic circuitry of neurons in distinct hippocampal subregions. Less clear is whether these effects persist weeks after chronic stress ends, and whether these effects involve changes in the total number of hippocampal GABAergic neurons or modulates the function of specific GABAergic subtypes. A transgenic mouse line (&lt;i&gt;VGAT:Cre Ai9&lt;/i&gt;) containing an indelible marker for GABAergic neurons (tdTomato) throughout the brain was used to determine whether chronic stress alters total GABAergic neuronal number or the expression of two key GABAergic cell subtypes, calretinin expressing (CR+) and somatostatin expressing (SOM+) neurons, and whether these changes endure weeks later. Male and female mice were chronically stressed in wire mesh restrainers for 6h/d/21d (Str) or not (Con), and then allowed a 3 week rest period (Str‐Rest) and compared to those without a rest period (Str‐NoRest). Epifluorescent microscope images of immunohistochemistry‐processed brains were quantified to estimate the total number of fluorescently‐labeled hippocampal GABAergic neurons and the proportion that were CR+ or SOM+. Neither chronic stress nor sex altered the total number of GABAergic cells. In contrast, chronic stress reduced the expression of CR+ in the CA3 region of the hippocampus in both males and females, with robust reductions in the DG region of males, but not females, and these changes reversed following a rest period. Chronic stress also reduced the proportion of hippocampal SOM+ neurons and this reduction persisted even with a rest period. These results show chronic stress dynamically reduced CR expression without changing total inhibitory neuronal number and point to CR as a potential new lead to understand mechanisms by which chronic stress alters hippocampal function.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Hippocampus: Conjunctive representation of what and when in monkey hippocampus and lateral prefrontal cortex during an associative memory task</title>

	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adaptive memory requires the organism to form associations that bridge between events separated in time. Many studies show interactions between hippocampus (HPC) and prefrontal cortex (PFC) during formation of such associations. We analyze neural recording from monkey HPC and PFC during a memory task that requires the monkey to associate stimuli separated by about a second in time. After the first stimulus was presented, large numbers of units in both HPC and PFC fired in sequence. Many units fired only when a particular stimulus was presented at a particular time in the past. These results indicate that both HPC and PFC maintain a temporal record of events that could be used to form associations across time. This temporal record of the past is a key component of the temporal coding hypothesis, a hypothesis in psychology that memory not only encodes what happened, but when it happened.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Hippocampus: NMDA receptors promote hippocampal sharp‐wave ripples and the associated coactivity of CA1 pyramidal cells</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/hipo.23276?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hippocampal sharp‐wave ripples (SWRs) support the reactivation of memory representations, relaying information to neocortex during “offline” and sleep‐dependent memory consolidation. While blockade of NMDA receptors (NMDAR) is known to affect both learning and subsequent consolidation, the specific contributions of NMDAR activation to SWR‐associated activity remain unclear. Here, we combine biophysical modeling with in vivo local field potential (LFP) and unit recording to quantify changes in SWR dynamics following inactivation of NMDAR. In a biophysical model of CA3‐CA1 SWR activity, we find that NMDAR removal leads to reduced SWR density, but spares SWR properties such as duration, cell recruitment and ripple frequency. These predictions are confirmed by experiments in which NMDAR‐mediated transmission in rats was inhibited using three different NMDAR antagonists, while recording dorsal CA1 LFP. In the model, loss of NMDAR‐mediated conductances also induced a reduction in the proportion of cell pairs that co‐activate significantly above chance across multiple events. Again, this prediction is corroborated by dorsal CA1 single‐unit recordings, where the NMDAR blocker ketamine disrupted correlated spiking during SWR. Our results are consistent with a framework in which NMDA receptors both promote activation of SWR events and organize SWR‐associated spiking content. This suggests that, while SWR are short‐lived events emerging in fast excitatory‐inhibitory networks, slower network components including NMDAR‐mediated currents contribute to ripple density and promote consistency in the spiking content across ripples, underpinning mechanisms for fine‐tuning of memory consolidation processes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Hippocampus: Interindividual differences in memory system local field potential activity predict behavioral strategy on a dual‐solution T‐maze</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/hipo.23258?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Individuals can use diverse behavioral strategies to navigate their environment including hippocampal‐dependent place strategies reliant upon cognitive maps and striatal‐dependent response strategies reliant upon egocentric body turns. The existence of multiple memory systems appears to facilitate successful navigation across a wide range of environmental and physiological conditions. The mechanisms by which these systems interact to ultimately generate a unitary behavioral response, however, remain unclear. We trained 20 male, Sprague–Dawley rats on a dual‐solution T‐maze while simultaneously recording local field potentials that were targeted to the dorsolateral striatum and dorsal hippocampus. Eight rats spontaneously exhibited a place strategy while the remaining 12 rats exhibited a response strategy. Interindividual differences in behavioral strategy were associated with distinct patterns of LFP activity between the dorsolateral striatum and dorsal hippocampus. Specifically, striatal‐hippocampal theta activity was in‐phase in response rats and out‐of‐phase in place rats and response rats exhibited elevated striatal‐hippocampal coherence across a wide range of frequency bands. These contrasting striatal‐hippocampal activity regimes were (a) present during both maze‐learning and a 30 min premaze habituation period and (b) could be used to train support vector machines to reliably predict behavioral strategy. Distinct patterns of neuronal activity across multiple memory systems, therefore, appear to bias behavioral strategy selection and thereby contribute to interindividual differences in behavior.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Hippocampus: Developmental onset of enduring long‐term potentiation in mouse hippocampus</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/hipo.23257?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Analysis of long‐term potentiation (LTP) provides a powerful window into cellular mechanisms of learning and memory. Prior work shows late LTP (L‐LTP), lasting &amp;gt;3 hr, occurs abruptly at postnatal day 12 (P12) in the &lt;i&gt;stratum radiatum&lt;/i&gt; of rat hippocampal area CA1. The goal here was to determine the developmental profile of synaptic plasticity leading to L‐LTP in the mouse hippocampus. Two mouse strains and two mutations known to affect synaptic plasticity were chosen: C57BL/6J and &lt;i&gt;Fmr1&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;−/y&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sup&gt; on the C57BL/6J background, and 129SVE and &lt;i&gt;Hevin&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;−/−&lt;/sup&gt; (&lt;i&gt;Sparcl1&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;−/−&lt;/sup&gt;) on the 129SVE background. Like rats, hippocampal slices from all of the mice showed test pulse‐induced depression early during development that was gradually resolved with maturation by 5 weeks. All the mouse strains showed a gradual progression between P10‐P35 in the expression of short‐term potentiation (STP), lasting ≤1 hr. In the 129SVE mice, L‐LTP onset (&amp;gt;25% of slices) occurred by 3 weeks, reliable L‐LTP (&amp;gt;50% slices) was achieved by 4 weeks, and &lt;i&gt;Hevin&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;−/−&lt;/sup&gt; advanced this profile by 1 week. In the C57BL/6J mice, L‐LTP onset occurred significantly later, over 3–4 weeks, and reliability was not achieved until 5 weeks. Although some of the &lt;i&gt;Fmr1&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;−/y&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sup&gt; mice showed L‐LTP before 3 weeks, reliable L‐LTP also was not achieved until 5 weeks. L‐LTP onset was not advanced in any of the mouse genotypes by multiple bouts of theta‐burst stimulation at 90 or 180 min intervals. These findings show important species differences in the onset of STP and L‐LTP, which occur at the same age in rats but are sequentially acquired in mice.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Hippocampus: Recurrent amplification of grid‐cell activity</title>

	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;High‐level cognitive abilities such as navigation and spatial memory are thought to rely on the activity of grid cells in the medial entorhinal cortex (MEC), which encode the animal's position in space with periodic triangular patterns. Yet the neural mechanisms that underlie grid‐cell activity are still unknown. Recent in vitro and in vivo experiments indicate that grid cells are embedded in highly structured recurrent networks. But how could recurrent connectivity become structured during development? And what is the functional role of these connections? With mathematical modeling and simulations, we show that recurrent circuits in the MEC could emerge under the supervision of weakly grid‐tuned feedforward inputs. We demonstrate that a learned excitatory connectivity could amplify grid patterns when the feedforward sensory inputs are available and sustain attractor states when the sensory cues are lost. Finally, we propose a Fourier‐based measure to quantify the spatial periodicity of grid patterns: the grid‐tuning index.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Hippocampus: The function of medial temporal lobe and posterior middle temporal gyrus in forming creative associations</title>

	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the function of the hippocampus and adjacent medial temporal lobe (MTL) areas in forming associations is generally recognized, how MTL contributes to form creative associations that could result in novel and appropriate functions or meanings remains unclear. In this study, we compared highly creative combinations (HCCs) of two objects (e.g., that of “lifejacket” and “distress signal device”) that resulted in genuine innovative designs comprising additionally unprecedented functions (the “1 + 1 &amp;gt; 2” effects) with the lowly creative combinations (LCCs, e.g., the combination of “set‐top box” and “jewelry box”) that resulted in nothing more than simple “1 + 1 = 2” effects. The event‐related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study found that during the “early binding phase,” when the combinations of the two objects were initially encoded, the right parahippocampus was more intensively activated during the encoding of HCC relative to LCC trials. However, during the “late integration phase,” when participants finally formed a holistic mental representation of new products based on the two‐object combinations, both HCCs and LCCs were found to be associated with significantly increased hippocampal and parahippocampal activation relative to the baseline condition, but at a similar level. In this “late integration phase,” the functional areas appeared to be more intensively activated in HCCs relative to LCCs located in the posterior middle temporal gyrus (pMTG), the area known to mediate category‐related processing. Consistently, our supplementary behavioral study found that, relative to LCCs, HCCs had a higher possibility of resulting in some new conceptual expansions that differed from each of the original two objects that constituted the combinations. These findings indicate that the formation of creative combinations not only require MTL‐based novel association‐formation, but also pMTG‐based novel concept‐expansion.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Hippocampus: Hebbian and non‐Hebbian timing‐dependent plasticity in the hippocampal CA3 region</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/hipo.23252?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The timing between synaptic inputs has been proposed to play a role in the induction of plastic changes that enable neural circuits to store information. In the case of spike timing‐dependent plasticity (STDP), this relates to the interval between a synaptic input and a postsynaptic spike, thus providing a conceptual link to the Hebb learning rule. Experiments have documented STDP in many synapses and brain regions, and computational models have tested its utility in many neural network functions. However, questions remain about whether timing plays a role in plasticity during natural activity, and whether it can function in information storage. The present study used imaging with voltage sensitive dye to investigate the effectiveness of input timing in the plasticity of responses in the CA3 region of hippocampal slices. Plasticity was induced by sequential dual‐site stimulation at 10 ms intervals of either synaptic inputs and cell bodies (synaptic–somatic induction) or of two sets of synaptic inputs (synaptic–synaptic induction). Both protocols potentiated responses, with greater potentiation of responses to the first stimulation of the sequence than the second. Neither of these protocols induced depression. Synaptic–somatic stimulation was much more effective than synaptic–synaptic stimulation in evoking somatic action potentials, but both protocols potentiated responses equally well. This suggests that sequential dual‐site stimulation can potentiate equally well with very different degrees of somatic action potential firing. With synaptic–somatic induction, potentiation was focused at the sites of stimulation. In contrast, with synaptic–synaptic induction, the distribution of potentiation varied greatly. Changes in the spatial distribution of responses indicated that sequential dual‐site stimulation functions poorly in the storage of activity patterns. These results suggest that in the hippocampal CA3 region, timed sequential activation of two inputs is less effective than theta bursts, both in the induction of LTP and in the storage of information.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hippocampus has long been observed to encode a representation of an animal's position in space. Recent evidence suggests that the nature of this representation is somewhat predictive and can be modeled by learning a successor representation (SR) between distinct positions in an environment. However, this discretization of space is subjective making it difficult to formulate predictions about how some environmental manipulations should impact the hippocampal representation. Here, we present a model of place and grid cell firing as a consequence of learning a SR from a basis set of known neurobiological features—boundary vector cells (BVCs). The model describes place cell firing as the successor features of the SR, with grid cells forming a low‐dimensional representation of these successor features. We show that the place and grid cells generated using the BVC‐SR model provide a good account of biological data for a variety of environmental manipulations, including dimensional stretches, barrier insertions, and the influence of environmental geometry on the hippocampal representation of space.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Network Fingerprint of Stimulation‐Induced Speech Impairment in Essential Tremor</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25958?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study was undertaken to gain insights into structural networks associated with stimulation‐induced dysarthria (SID) and to predict stimulation‐induced worsening of intelligibility in essential tremor patients with bilateral thalamic deep brain stimulation (DBS).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Monopolar reviews were conducted in 14 essential tremor patients. Testing included determination of SID thresholds, intelligibility ratings, and a fast syllable repetition task. Volumes of tissue activated (VTAs) were calculated to identify discriminative fibers for stimulation‐induced worsening of intelligibility in a structural connectome. The resulting fiber‐based atlas structure was then validated in a leave‐one‐out design.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fibers determined as discriminative for stimulation‐induced worsening of intelligibility were mainly connected to the ipsilateral precentral gyrus as well as to both cerebellar hemispheres and the ipsilateral brain stem. In the thalamic area, they ran laterally to the thalamus and posteromedially to the subthalamic nucleus, in close proximity, mainly anterolaterally, to fibers beneficial for tremor control as published by Al‐Fatly et al in 2019. The overlap of the respective clinical stimulation setting's VTAs with these fibers explained 62.4% (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001) of the variance of stimulation‐induced change in intelligibility in a leave‐one‐out analysis.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study demonstrates that SID in essential tremor patients is associated with both motor cortex and cerebellar connectivity. Furthermore, the identified fiber‐based atlas structure might contribute to future postoperative programming strategies to achieve optimal tremor control without speech impairment in essential tremor patients with thalamic DBS.

	<title>Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience: Hopf Bifurcation in Mean Field Explains Critical Avalanches in Excitation-Inhibition Balanced Neuronal Networks: A Mechanism for Multiscale Variability</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2020.580011</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Cortical neural circuits display highly irregular spiking in individual neurons but variably sized collective firing, oscillations and critical avalanches at the population level, all of which have functional importance for information processing. Theoretically, the balance of excitation and inhibition inputs is thought to account for spiking irregularity and critical avalanches may originate from an underlying phase transition. However, the theoretical reconciliation of these multilevel dynamic aspects in neural circuits remains an open question. Herein, we study excitation-inhibition (E-I) balanced neuronal network with biologically realistic synaptic kinetics. It can maintain irregular spiking dynamics with different levels of synchrony and critical avalanches emerge near the synchronous transition point. We propose a novel semi-analytical mean-field theory to derive the field equations governing the network macroscopic dynamics. It reveals that the E-I balanced state of the network manifesting irregular individual spiking is characterized by a macroscopic stable state, which can be either a fixed point or a periodic motion and the transition is predicted by a Hopf bifurcation in the macroscopic field. Furthermore, by analyzing public data, we find the coexistence of irregular spiking and critical avalanches in the spontaneous spiking activities of mouse cortical slice in vitro, indicating the universality of the observed phenomena. Our theory unveils the mechanism that permits complex neural activities in different spatiotemporal scales to coexist and elucidates a possible origin of the criticality of neural systems. It also provides a novel tool for analyzing the macroscopic dynamics of E-I balanced networks and its relationship to the microscopic counterparts, which can be useful for large-scale modeling and computation of cortical dynamics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience: BrainWave Nets: Are Sparse Dynamic Models Susceptible to Brain Manipulation Experimentation?</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2020.527757</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Sparse time series models have shown promise in estimating contemporaneous and ongoing brain connectivity. This paper was motivated by a neuroscience experiment using EEG signals as the outcome of our established interventional protocol, a new method in neurorehabilitation toward developing a treatment for visual verticality disorder in post-stroke patients. To analyze the [complex outcome measure (EEG)] that reflects neural-network functioning and processing in more specific ways regarding traditional analyses, we make a comparison among sparse time series models (classic VAR, GLASSO, TSCGM, and TSCGM-modified with non-linear and iterative optimizations) combined with a graphical approach, such as a Dynamic Chain Graph Model (DCGM). These dynamic graphical models were useful in assessing the role of estimating the brain network structure and describing its causal relationship. In addition, the class of DCGM was able to visualize and compare experimental conditions and brain frequency domains [using finite impulse response (FIR) filter]. Moreover, using multilayer networks, the results corroborate with the susceptibility of sparse dynamic models, bypassing the false positives problem in estimation algorithms. We conclude that applying sparse dynamic models to EEG data may be useful for describing intervention-relocated changes in brain connectivity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Modulation of β-Amyloid Fibril Formation in Alzheimer’s Disease by Microglia and Infection</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2020.609073</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Amyloid plaques are a pathological hallmark of Alzheimer’s disease. The major component of these plaques are highly ordered amyloid fibrils formed by amyloid-β (Aβ) peptides. However, whilst Aβ amyloid fibril assembly has been subjected to detailed and extensive analysis in vitro, these studies may not reproduce how Aβ fibrils assemble in the brain. This is because the brain represents a highly complex and dynamic environment, and in Alzheimer’s disease multiple cofactors may affect the assembly of Aβ fibrils. Moreover, in vivo amyloid plaque formation will reflect the balance between the assembly of Aβ fibrils and their degradation. This review explores the roles of microglia as cofactors in Aβ aggregation and in the clearance of amyloid deposits. In addition, we discuss how infection may be an additional cofactor in Aβ fibril assembly by virtue of the antimicrobial properties of Aβ peptides. Crucially, by understanding the roles of microglia and infection in Aβ amyloid fibril assembly it may be possible to identify new therapeutic targets for Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: A Functional Comparison of Homopentameric Nicotinic Acetylcholine Receptors (ACR-16) Receptors From Necator americanus and Ancylostoma ceylanicum</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2020.601102</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Effective control of hookworm infections in humans and animals relies on using a small group of anthelmintics. Many of these drugs target cholinergic ligand-gated ion channels, yet the direct activity of anthelmintics has only been studied in a subset of these receptors, primarily in the non-parasitic nematode, Caenorhabditis elegans. Here we report the characterization of a homopentameric ionotropic acetylcholine receptor (AChR), ACR-16, from Necator americanus and Ancylostoma ceylanicum, the first known characterization of human hookworm ion channels. We used two-electrode voltage clamp electrophysiology in Xenopus laevis oocytes to determine the pharmacodynamics of cholinergics and anthelmintics on ACR-16 from both species of hookworm. The A. ceylanicum receptor (Ace-ACR-16) was more sensitive to acetylcholine (EC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; = 20.64 ± 0.32 μM) and nicotine (EC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; = 24.37 ± 2.89 μM) than the N. americanus receptor (Nam-ACR-16) (acetylcholine EC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; = 170.1 ± 19.23 μM; nicotine EC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; = 597.9 ± 59.12 μM), at which nicotine was a weak partial agonist (% maximal acetylcholine response = 30.4 ± 7.4%). Both receptors were inhibited by 500 μM levamisole (Ace-ACR-16 = 65.1 ± 14.3% inhibition, Nam-ACR-16 = 79.5 ± 7.7% inhibition), and responded to pyrantel, but only Ace-ACR-16 responded to oxantel. We used in silico homology modeling to investigate potential structural differences that account for the differences in agonist binding and identified a loop E isoleucine 130 of Nam-ACR-16 as possibly playing a role in oxantel insensitivity. These data indicate that key functional differences exist among ACR-16 receptors from closely related species and suggest mechanisms for differential drug sensitivity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: A Neurotoxic Ménage-à-trois: Glutamate, Calcium, and Zinc in the Excitotoxic Cascade</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2020.600089</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Fifty years ago, the seminal work by John Olney provided the first evidence of the neurotoxic properties of the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate. A process hereafter termed excitotoxicity. Since then, glutamate-driven neuronal death has been linked to several acute and chronic neurological conditions, like stroke, traumatic brain injury, Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, and Huntington’s diseases, and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis. Mechanisms linked to the overactivation of glutamatergic receptors involve an aberrant cation influx, which produces the failure of the ionic neuronal milieu. In this context, zinc, the second most abundant metal ion in the brain, is a key but still somehow underappreciated player of the excitotoxic cascade. Zinc is an essential element for neuronal functioning, but when dysregulated acts as a potent neurotoxin. In this review, we discuss the ionic changes and downstream effects involved in the glutamate-driven neuronal loss, with a focus on the role exerted by zinc. Finally, we summarize our work on the fascinating distinct properties of NADPH-diaphorase neurons. This neuronal subpopulation is spared from excitotoxic insults and represents a powerful tool to understand mechanisms of resilience against excitotoxic processes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Local Secretory Trafficking Pathways in Neurons and the Role of Dendritic Golgi Outposts in Different Cell Models</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2020.597391</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A fundamental characteristic of neurons is the relationship between the architecture of the polarized neuron and synaptic transmission between neurons. Intracellular membrane trafficking is paramount to establish and maintain neuronal structure; perturbation in trafficking results in defects in neurodevelopment and neurological disorders. Given the physical distance from the cell body to the distal sites of the axon and dendrites, transport of newly synthesized membrane proteins from the central cell body to their functional destination at remote, distal sites represents a conundrum. With the identification of secretory organelles in dendrites, including endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi outposts (GOs), recent studies have proposed local protein synthesis and trafficking distinct from the conventional anterograde transport pathways of the cell body. A variety of different model organisms, including Drosophila, zebrafish, and rodents, have been used to probe the organization and function of the local neuronal secretory network. Here, we review the evidence for local secretory trafficking pathways in dendrites in a variety of cell-based neuronal systems and discuss both the similarities and differences in the organization and role of the local secretory organelles, especially the GOs. In addition, we identify the gaps in the current knowledge and the potential advances using human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) in defining local membrane protein trafficking in human neurons and in understanding the molecular basis of neurological diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Integrative Neuroscience: Evaluating Sensory Integration/Sensory Processing Treatment: Issues and Analysis</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnint.2020.556660</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;For more than 50 years, “Sensory Integration” has been a theoretical framework for diagnosing and treating disabilities in children under the umbrella of “sensory integration dysfunction” (SID). More recently, the approach has been reframed as “the dimensions of sensory processing” or SPD in place of SID, so the review herein describes this collective framework as sensory integration/sensory processing treatment (SI/SP-T) for ASD. This review is not focused on diagnosis of SI/SPD. Broadly, the SI/SPD intervention approach views a plethora of disabilities such as ADHD, ASD, and disruptive behavior as being exacerbated by difficulties in modulating and integrating sensory input with a primary focus on contributions from tactile, proprioceptive, and vestibular systems which are hypothesized to contribute to core symptoms of the conditions (e.g., ASD). SI/SP intervention procedures include sensory protocols designed to enhance tactile, proprioceptive, and vestibular experiences. SI/SP-T procedures utilize equipment (e.g., lycra swings, balance beams, climbing walls, and trampolines), specific devices (e.g., weighted vests, sensory brushes) and activities (e.g., placing hands in messy substances such as shaving cream, sequenced movements) hypothesized to enhance sensory integration and sensory processing. The approach is reviewed herein to provide a framework for testing SI/SP-T using widely accepted clinical trials and event coding methods used in applied behavior analysis (ABA) and other behavioral interventions. Also, a related but distinct neuroscientific paradigm, multisensory integration, is presented as an independent test of whether SI/SP-T differentially impacts sensory integration and/or multisensory integration. Finally, because SI/SP-T activities include many incidental behavioral events that are known as developmental facilitators (e.g., contingent verbal models/recasts during verbal interactions), there is a compelling need to control for confounds to study the unique impact of sensory-based interventions. Note that SI/SP-T includes very specific and identifiable procedures and materials, so it is reasonable to expect high treatment fidelity when testing the approach. A patient case is presented that illustrates this confound with a known facilitator (recast intervention) and a method for controlling potential confounds in order to conduct unbiased studies of the effects of SI/SP-T approaches that accurately represent SI/SP-T theories of change.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Comparing the Impact of Laparoscopic Sleeve Gastrectomy and Gastric Cancer Surgery on Resting-State Brain Activity and Functional Connectivity</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.614092</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) is one of the most performed bariatric surgeries in clinical practice. Growing neuroimaging evidence shows that LSG induces brain functional and structural alterations accompany with sustained weight-loss. Meanwhile, for clinical treatment of gastric cancer, stomach removal surgery is a similar procedure to LSG. It is unclear if the gastric cancer surgery (GCS) would induce the similar alterations in brain functions and structures as LSG, and it would help to clarify the specificity of the LSG. We recruited 24 obese patients who received LSG in the LSG group and 16 normal weight patients with gastric cancer who received GCS as the control group. Functional magnetic resonance imaging was employed to investigate the differences and similarity of surgery’s impact on resting-state brain activity and functional connectivity (RSFC) between LSG and GCS groups. Both LSG and GCS groups showed increased activities in the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) and supplementary motor area (SMA) as well as the decreased RSFC of PCC- dorsomedial prefrontal cortex and SMA- dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. There were decreased resting-state activity of hippocampus and putamen in LSG group and increases in GCS group. In LSG group, resting-state activities of hippocampus and putamen were correlated with craving for high-caloric food and body mass index after surgery, respectively. These findings suggest LSG induced alterations in resting-state activity and RSFC of hippocampus and putamen specifically regulate the obese state and overeating behaviors in obese patients.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Is So Called “Split Alpha” in EEG Spectral Analysis a Result of Methodological and Interpretation Errors?</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.608453</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;This paper attempts to explain some methodological issues regarding EEG signal analysis which might lead to misinterpretation and therefore to unsubstantiated conclusions. The so called “split-alpha,” a “new phenomenon” in EEG spectral analysis described lately in few papers is such a case. We have shown that spectrum feature presented as a “split alpha” can be the result of applying improper means of analysis of the spectrum of the EEG signal that did not take into account the significant properties of the applied Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) method. Analysis of the shortcomings of the FFT method applied to EEG signal such as limited duration of analyzed signal, dependence of frequency resolution on time window duration, influence of window duration and shape, overlapping and spectral leakage was performed. Our analyses of EEG data as well as simulations indicate that double alpha spectra called as “split alpha” can appear, as spurious peaks, for short signal window when the EEG signal being studied shows multiple frequencies and frequency bands. These peaks have no relation to any frequencies of the signal and are an effect of spectrum leakage. Our paper is intended to explain the reasons underlying a spectrum pattern called as a “split alpha” and give some practical indications for using spectral analysis of EEG signal that might be useful for readers and allow to avoid EEG spectrum misinterpretation in further studies and publications as well as in clinical practice.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.586330</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Background: The associations between olfactory identification (OI) ability and the Alzheimer's disease biomarkers were not clear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Objective: This meta-analysis aimed to examine the associations between OI and Aβ and tau burden.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Electronic databases (PubMed, Embase, PsycINFO, and Google Scholar) were searched until June 2019 to identify studies that reported correlation coefficients or regression coefficients between OI and Aβ or tau levels measured by positron emission tomography (PET) or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Pooled Pearson correlation coefficients were computed for the PET imaging and CSF biomarkers, with subgroup analysis for subjects classified into different groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Nine studies met the inclusion criteria. Of these, five studies (N = 494) involved Aβ PET, one involved tau PET (N = 26), and four involved CSF Aβ or tau (N = 345). OI was negatively associated with Aβ PET in the mixed (r = −0.25, P = 0.008) and cognitively normal groups (r = −0.15, P = 0.004) but not in the mild cognitive impairment group. A similar association with CSF total tau in the mixed group was also observed. No association was found between OI and CSF phosphorylated tau or Aβ&lt;sub&gt;42&lt;/sub&gt; in the subgroup analysis of the CSF biomarkers. Due to a lack of data, no pooled r value could be computed for the association between the OI and tau PET.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: The associations between OI ability and Aβ and CSF tau burden in older adults are negligible. While current evidence does not support the association, further studies using PET tau imaging are warranted.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Molecular Mechanisms of Glutamate Toxicity in Parkinson’s Disease</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.585584</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disease, the pathological features of which include the presence of Lewy bodies and the neurodegeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta. However, until recently, research on the pathogenesis and treatment of PD have progressed slowly. Glutamate and dopamine are both important central neurotransmitters in mammals. A lack of enzymatic decomposition of extracellular glutamate results in glutamate accumulating at synapses, which is mainly absorbed by excitatory amino acid transporters (EAATs). Glutamate exerts its physiological effects by binding to and activating ligand-gated ion channels [ionotropic glutamate receptors (iGluRs)] and a class of G-protein-coupled receptors [metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs)]. Timely clearance of glutamate from the synaptic cleft is necessary because high levels of extracellular glutamate overactivate glutamate receptors, resulting in excitotoxic effects in the central nervous system. Additionally, increased concentrations of extracellular glutamate inhibit cystine uptake, leading to glutathione depletion and oxidative glutamate toxicity. Studies have shown that oxidative glutamate toxicity in neurons lacking functional N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors may represent a component of the cellular death pathway induced by excitotoxicity. The association between inflammation and excitotoxicity (i.e., immunoexcitotoxicity) has received increased attention in recent years. Glial activation induces neuroinflammation and can stimulate excessive release of glutamate, which can induce excitotoxicity and, additionally, further exacerbate neuroinflammation. Glutamate, as an important central neurotransmitter, is closely related to the occurrence and development of PD. In this review, we discuss recent progress on elucidating glutamate as a relevant neurotransmitter in PD. Additionally, we summarize the relationship and commonality among glutamate excitotoxicity, oxidative toxicity, and immunoexcitotoxicity in order to posit a holistic view and molecular mechanism of glutamate toxicity in PD.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.571479</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Optic Atrophy 1 (OPA1) is a mitochondrially targeted GTPase that plays a pivotal role in mitochondrial health, with mutations causing severe mitochondrial dysfunction and typically associated with Dominant Optic Atrophy (DOA), a progressive blinding disease involving retinal ganglion cell loss and optic nerve damage. In the current study, we investigate the use of codon-optimized versions of OPA1 isoform 1 and 7 as potential therapeutic interventions in a range of in vitro and in vivo models of mitochondrial dysfunction. We demonstrate that both isoforms perform equally well in ameliorating mitochondrial dysfunction in OPA1 knockout mouse embryonic fibroblast cells but that OPA1 expression levels require tight regulation for optimal benefit. Of note, we demonstrate for the first time that both OPA1 isoform 1 and 7 can be used independently to protect spatial visual function in a murine model of retinal ganglion cell degeneration caused by mitochondrial dysfunction, as well as providing benefit to mitochondrial bioenergetics in DOA patient derived fibroblast cells. These results highlight the potential value of OPA1-based gene therapy interventions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.571293</link>
	<content:encoded>Purpose&lt;p&gt;was to create an in vitro model of human retinal detachment (RD) to study the mechanisms of photoreceptor death.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;Human retinas were obtained through eye globe donations for research purposes and cultivated as explants. Cell death was investigated in retinas with (control) and without retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells to mimic RD. Tissues were studied at different time points and immunohistological analyses for TUNEL, Cleaved caspase3, AIF, CDK4 and the epigenetic mark H3K27me3 were performed. Human and monkey eye globes with retinal detachment served as controls.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;The number of TUNEL-positive cells, compared between 1 and 7 days, increased with time in both retinas with RPE (from 1.2 ± 0.46 to 8 ± 0.89, n = 4) and without RPE (from 2.6 ± 0.73 to 16.3 ± 1.27, p &amp;lt; 0.014). In the group without RPE, cell death peaked at day 3 (p = 0.014) and was high until day 7. Almost no Cleaved-Caspase3 signal was observed, whereas a transient augmentation at day 3 of AIF-positive cells was observed to be about 10-fold in comparison to the control group (n = 2). Few CDK4-positive cells were found in both groups, but significantly more in the RD group at day 7 (1.8 ± 0.24 vs. 4.7 ± 0.58, p = 0.014). The H3K27me3 mark increased by 7-fold after 5 days in the RD group (p = 0.014) and slightly decreased at day 7 and was also observed to be markedly increased in human and monkey detached retina samples.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;AIF expression coincides with the first peak of cell death, whereas the H3K27me3 mark increases during the cell death plateau, suggesting that photoreceptor death is induced by different successive pathways after RD. This in vitro model should permit the identification of neuroprotective drugs with clinical relevance.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurogenesis: Decreased Proliferation in the Neurogenic Niche, Disorganized Neuroblast Migration, and Increased Oligodendrogenesis in Adult Netrin-5-Deficient Mice</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.570974</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In the adult mouse brain, neurogenesis occurs mainly in the ventricular-subventricular zone (V-SVZ) and the subgranular zone of the hippocampal dentate gyrus. Neuroblasts generated in the V-SVZ migrate to the olfactory bulb via the rostral migratory stream (RMS) in response to guidance molecules, such as netrin-1. We previously showed that the related netrin-5 (NTN5) is expressed in Mash1-positive transit-amplifying cells and doublecortin-positive neuroblasts in the granule cell layer of the olfactory bulb, the RMS, and the subgranular zone of the adult mouse brain. However, the precise role of NTN5 in adult neurogenesis has not been investigated. In this study, we show that proliferation in the neurogenic niche is impaired in NTN5 knockout mice. The number of proliferating (EdU-labeled) cells in NTN5 KO mice was significantly lower in the V-SVZ, whereas the number of Ki67-positive proliferating cells was unchanged, suggesting a longer cell cycle and decreased cell division in NTN5 KO mice. The number of EdU-labeled cells in the RMS and olfactory bulb was unchanged. By contrast, the numbers of EdU-labeled cells in the cortex, basal ganglia/lateral septal nucleus, and corpus callosum/anterior commissure were increased, which largely represented oligodendrocyte lineage cells. Lastly, we found that chain migration in the RMS of NTN5 KO mice was disorganized. These findings suggest that NTN5 may play important roles in promoting proliferation in the V-SVZ niche, organizing proper chain migration in the RMS, and suppressing oligodendrogenesis in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.569706</link>
	<content:encoded>Aim&lt;p&gt;Attenuation correction using zero-echo time (ZTE) – magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (ZTE-MRAC) has become one of the standard methods for brain-positron emission tomography (PET) on commercial PET/MR scanners. Although the accuracy of the net tracer-uptake quantification based on ZTE-MRAC has been validated, that of the diagnosis for dementia has not yet been clarified, especially in terms of automated statistical analysis. The aim of this study was to clarify the impact of ZTE-MRAC on the diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) by performing simulation study.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;We recruited 27 subjects, who underwent both PET/computed tomography (CT) and PET/MR (GE SIGNA) examinations. Additionally, we extracted 107 subjects from the Alzheimer Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset. From the PET raw data acquired on PET/MR, three FDG-PET series were generated, using two vendor-provided MRAC methods (ZTE and Atlas) and CT-based AC. Following spatial normalization to Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space, we calculated each patient’s specific error maps, which correspond to the difference between the PET image corrected using the CTAC method and the PET images corrected using the MRAC methods. To simulate PET maps as if ADNI data had been corrected using MRAC methods, we multiplied each of these 27 error maps with each of the 107 ADNI cases in MNI space. To evaluate the probability of AD in each resulting image, we calculated a cumulative t-value using a fully automated method which had been validated not only in the original ADNI dataset but several multi-center studies. In the method, PET score = 1 is the 95% prediction limit of AD. PET score and diagnostic accuracy for the discrimination of AD were evaluated in simulated images using the original ADNI dataset as reference.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Positron emission tomography score was slightly underestimated both in ZTE and Atlas group compared with reference CTAC (−0.0796 ± 0.0938 vs. −0.0784 ± 0.1724). The absolute error of PET score was lower in ZTE than Atlas group (0.098 ± 0.075 vs. 0.145 ± 0.122, p &amp;lt; 0.001). A higher correlation to the original PET score was observed in ZTE vs. Atlas group (R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;: 0.982 vs. 0.961). The accuracy for the discrimination of AD patients from normal control was maintained in ZTE and Atlas compared to CTAC (ZTE vs. Atlas. vs. original; 82.5% vs. 82.1% vs. 83.2% (CI 81.8–84.5%), respectively).&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;For FDG-PET images on PET/MR, attenuation correction using ZTE-MRI had superior accuracy to an atlas-based method in classification for dementia. ZTE maintains the diagnostic accuracy for AD.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroinformatics: SARA-GAN: Self-Attention and Relative Average Discriminator Based Generative Adversarial Networks for Fast Compressed Sensing MRI Reconstruction</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fninf.2020.611666</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Research on undersampled magnetic resonance image (MRI) reconstruction can increase the speed of MRI imaging and reduce patient suffering. In this paper, an undersampled MRI reconstruction method based on Generative Adversarial Networks with the Self-Attention mechanism and the Relative Average discriminator (SARA-GAN) is proposed. In our SARA-GAN, the relative average discriminator theory is applied to make full use of the prior knowledge, in which half of the input data of the discriminator is true and half is fake. At the same time, a self-attention mechanism is incorporated into the high-layer of the generator to build long-range dependence of the image, which can overcome the problem of limited convolution kernel size. Besides, spectral normalization is employed to stabilize the training process. Compared with three widely used GAN-based MRI reconstruction methods, i.e., DAGAN, DAWGAN, and DAWGAN-GP, the proposed method can obtain a higher peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and structural similarity index measure(SSIM), and the details of the reconstructed image are more abundant and more realistic for further clinical scrutinization and diagnostic tasks.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Brain Metabolite Levels in Sedentary Women and Non-contact Athletes Differ From Contact Athletes</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.593498</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;White matter tracts are known to be susceptible to injury following concussion. The objective of this study was to determine whether contact play in sport could alter white matter metabolite levels in female varsity athletes independent of changes induced by long-term exercise. Metabolite levels were measured by single voxel proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) in the prefrontal white matter at the beginning (In-Season) and end (Off-Season) of season in contact (N = 54, rugby players) and non-contact (N = 23, swimmers and rowers) varsity athletes. Sedentary women (N = 23) were scanned once, at a time equivalent to the Off-Season time point. Metabolite levels in non-contact athletes did not change over a season of play, or differ from age matched sedentary women except that non-contact athletes had a slightly lower myo-inositol level. The contact athletes had lower levels of myo-inositol and glutamate, and higher levels of glutamine compared to both sedentary women and non-contact athletes. Lower levels of myo-inositol in non-contact athletes compared to sedentary women indicates long-term exercise may alter glial cell profiles in these athletes. The metabolite differences observed between contact and non-contact athletes suggest that non-contact athletes should not be used as controls in studies of concussion in high-impact sports because repetitive impacts from physical contact can alter white matter metabolite level profiles. It is imperative to use athletes engaged in the same contact sport as controls to ensure a matched metabolite profile at baseline.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>
