	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Neural Network Learning Predicts Optic Flow Specificities of Zebrafish Pretectal Neurons. (arXiv:1805.01277v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1805.01277</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Zebrafish pretectal neurons exhibit specificities for large-field optic flow
patterns associated with rotatory or translatory body motion. We investigate
the hypothesis that these specificities reflect the input statistics of natural
optic flow. Realistic motion sequences are generated with computer graphics
simulating self-motion in an underwater scene. Local retinal motion was
estimated with a motion detector and encoded in four populations of
directionally tuned retinal ganglion cells, represented as two signed input
variables. This activity was then used as input into one of two learning
networks: a sparse coding network (competitive learning) and backpropagation
network (supervised learning). Both simulations develop specificities for optic
flow which are comparable to those found in a neurophysiological study (Kubo et
al. 2014), and relative frequencies of the various neuronal responses are best
modelled by the sparse coding approach. We conclude that the optic flow neurons
in the zebrafish pretectum do reflect the optic flow statistics. The predicted
vectorial receptive fields show typical optic flow fields but also &quot;Gabor&quot; and
dipole-shaped patterns that likely reflect difference fields needed for
reconstruction by linear superposition.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: White Matter Network Architecture Guides Direct Electrical Stimulation Through Optimal State Transitions. (arXiv:1805.01260v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1805.01260</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Electrical brain stimulation is currently being investigated as a therapy for
neurological disease. However, opportunities to optimize such therapies are
challenged by the fact that the beneficial impact of focal stimulation on both
neighboring and distant regions is not well understood. Here, we use network
control theory to build a model of brain network function that makes
predictions about how stimulation spreads through the brain's white matter
network and influences large-scale dynamics. We test these predictions using
combined electrocorticography (ECoG) and diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) data
who volunteered to participate in an extensive stimulation regimen. We posit a
specific model-based manner in which white matter tracts constrain stimulation,
defining its capacity to drive the brain to new states, including states
associated with successful memory encoding. In a first validation of our model,
we find that the true pattern of white matter tracts can be used to more
accurately predict the state transitions induced by direct electrical
stimulation than the artificial patterns of null models. We then use a targeted
optimal control framework to solve for the optimal energy required to drive the
brain to a given state. We show that, intuitively, our model predicts larger
energy requirements when starting from states that are farther away from a
target memory state. We then suggest testable hypotheses about which structural
properties will lead to efficient stimulation for improving memory based on
energy requirements. Our work demonstrates that individual white matter
architecture plays a vital role in guiding the dynamics of direct electrical
stimulation, more generally offering empirical support for the utility of
network control theoretic models of brain response to stimulation.

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: beachmat: A Bioconductor C++ API for accessing high-throughput biological data from a variety of R matrix types</title>

Biological experiments involving genomics or other high-throughput assays typically yield a data matrix that can be explored and analyzed using the R programming language with packages from the Bioconductor project. Improvements in the throughput of these assays have resulted in an explosion of data even from routine experiments, which poses a challenge to the existing computational infrastructure for statistical data analysis. For example, single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) experiments frequently generate large matrices containing expression values for each gene in each cell, requiring sparse or file-backed representations for memory-efficient manipulation in R. These alternative representations are not easily compatible with high-performance C++ code used for computationally intensive tasks in existing R/Bioconductor packages. Here, we describe a C++ interface named &lt;i&gt;beachmat&lt;/i&gt;, which enables agnostic data access from various matrix representations. This allows package developers to write efficient C++ code that is interoperable with dense, sparse and file-backed matrices, amongst others. We evaluated the performance of &lt;i&gt;beachmat&lt;/i&gt; for accessing data from each matrix representation using both simulated and real scRNA-seq data, and defined a clear memory/speed trade-off to motivate the choice of an appropriate representation. We also demonstrate how beachmat can be incorporated into the code of other packages to drive analyses of a very large scRNA-seq data set.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/MHxJ8eSA7PU&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Predictive modelling of a novel anti-adhesion therapy to combat bacterial colonisation of burn wounds</title>

As the development of new classes of antibiotics slows, bacterial resistance to existing antibiotics is becoming an increasing problem. A potential solution is to develop treatment strategies with an alternative mode of action. We consider one such strategy: anti-adhesion therapy. Whereas antibiotics act directly upon bacteria, either killing them or inhibiting their growth, anti-adhesion therapy impedes the binding of bacteria to host cells. This prevents bacteria from deploying their arsenal of virulence mechanisms, while simultaneously rendering them more susceptible to natural and artificial clearance. In this paper, we consider a particular form of anti-adhesion therapy, involving biomimetic multivalent adhesion molecule 7 coupled polystyrene microbeads, which competitively inhibit the binding of bacteria to host cells. We develop a mathematical model, formulated as a system of ordinary differential equations, to describe inhibitor treatment of a &lt;i&gt;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&lt;/i&gt; burn wound infection in the rat. Benchmarking our model against &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; data from an ongoing experimental programme, we use the model to explain bacteria population dynamics and to predict the efficacy of a range of treatment strategies, with the aim of improving treatment outcome. The model consists of two physical compartments: the host cells and the exudate. It is found that, when effective in reducing the bacterial burden, inhibitor treatment operates both by preventing bacteria from binding to the host cells and by reducing the flux of daughter cells from the host cells into the exudate. Our model predicts that inhibitor treatment cannot eliminate the bacterial burden when used in isolation; however, when combined with regular or continuous debridement of the exudate, elimination is theoretically possible. Lastly, we present ways to improve therapeutic efficacy, as predicted by our mathematical model.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/MQif6tb7BiM&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Cytoskeletal components, such as tubulins and actins, have the remarkable ability to organize themselves into filaments and networks to support specialized and compartmentalized functions. Alterations in cytoskeletal proteins have long been associated with a variety of neurodevelopmental disorders. This review focuses on recent findings, primarily from forward genetic screens in Caenorhabditis elegans that illustrate how different tubulin protein isotypes can play distinct roles in neuronal development and function. Additionally, we discuss studies revealing new regulators of the actin cytoskeleton, and highlight recent technological advances in in vivo imaging and functional dissection of the neuronal cytoskeleton. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content:encoded>

The entorhinal–hippocampal system is central to such representations, which are severely compromised in some neurological diseases. In spite of much progress, a comprehensive, integrated view of spatial, temporal and other aspects of episodic representation remains elusive. Here, we review recent data on the role of cell-type specific entorhinal inputs which excite deep and superficial CA1 pyramidal cells by direct and indirect pathways. We discuss how an entorhinal dialogue with deep-superficial CA1 cells can multiplex neuronal activity along theta phases and how their reactivation may be segregated during sharp-wave ripples. Thus, deep and superficial CA1 sublayers provide substrate for general hippocampal function. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;h3 class=&quot;h3&quot;&gt;Graphical abstract&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;img alt=&quot;image&quot; height=&quot;159&quot; src=&quot;http://origin-ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S0959438817302994-fx1.jpg&quot; width=&quot;301&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content:encoded>

However, recent studies have revealed that some non-primate animal species have higher levels of dexterity than previously supposed, and in higher primates, various indirect non-CM descending pathways have been shown to participate in the control of dexterous movements. More recently, the CM pathway was shown to exist in rodents during early development, suggesting that rodents and primates diverged in their reliance on the CM pathway at some point in evolution, thus challenging the traditional view of the sequential development of hand control from rodents to primates. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content:encoded>

These limitations reflect what has been dichotomy between the structure and mechanical properties of living brain tissue and non-living neural probes. To bridge the gap between neural and electronic networks, we have introduced the new concept of mesh electronics probes designed with structural and mechanical properties such that the implant begins to ‘look and behave’ like neural tissue. Syringe-implanted mesh electronics have led to the realization of probes that are neuro-attractive and free of the chronic immune response, as well as capable of stable long-term mapping and modulation of brain activity at the single-neuron level. This review provides a historical overview of a 10-year development of mesh electronics by highlighting the tissue-like design, syringe-assisted delivery, seamless neural tissue integration, and single-neuron level chronic recording stability of mesh electronics. We also offer insights on unique near-term opportunities and future directions for neuroscience and neurology that now are available or expected for mesh electronics neurotechnologies. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content:encoded>

Moreover, several synapse subtype-specific molecules have been shown to control the targeting, formation or maturation of particular subtypes of excitatory synapses. Because inhibitory neurons are extremely diverse, a similar molecular diversity is likely to underlie the development of different inhibitory synapses making it a promising topic for future investigation in the field of the synapse development. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content:encoded>

Safe propagation of action potentials relies on specific ion channel expression at strategic points of the axon such as nodes of Ranvier or axonal branch points. However, while action potentials are generally considered as the quantum of neuronal information, their signaling is not entirely digital. In fact, both their shape and their conduction speed have been shown to be modulated by activity, leading to regulations of synaptic latency and synaptic strength. We report here newly identified mechanisms of (1) safe spike propagation along the axon, (2) compartmentalization of action potential shape in the axon, (3) analog modulation of spike-evoked synaptic transmission and (4) alteration in conduction time after persistent regulation of axon morphology in central neurons. We discuss the contribution of these regulations in information processing. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content:encoded>

We describe the steps necessary to build such models and show how this computational approach can provide previously unobtainable information through the ability to perform virtual experiments. Finally, we present examples of how personalized brain network models can be used to gain insight into the effects of local stimulation and improve surgical outcomes in epilepsy. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;h3 class=&quot;h3&quot;&gt;Graphical abstract&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;img alt=&quot;image&quot; height=&quot;93&quot; src=&quot;http://origin-ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S0959438818300059-fx1.jpg&quot; width=&quot;301&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content:encoded>

To be effective, these systems must be able to simultaneously record and stimulate neural activity, a task made difficult by persistent stimulation artifacts that distort and obscure underlying biomarkers. To enable simultaneous stimulation and recording, several techniques have been proposed. These techniques involve artifact-preventing system configurations, resilient recording front-ends, and back-end signal processing for removing recorded artifacts. Co-designing and integrating these artifact cancellation techniques will be key to enabling neuromodulation systems to stimulate and record at the same time. Here, we review the state-of-the-art for these techniques and their role in achieving artifact-free neuromodulation. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content:encoded>

With the development of sensitive genetically encoded calcium indicators, this has extended to the whole-brain imaging of neural activity with cellular resolution. This technique has been used to study brain-wide population dynamics accompanying sensory processing and sensorimotor transformations, and has spurred the development of innovative closed-loop behavioral paradigms in which stimulus–response relationships can be studied. More recently, microscopes have been developed that allow whole-brain calcium imaging in freely swimming and behaving larvae. In this review, we highlight the technologies underlying whole-brain functional imaging in zebrafish, provide examples of the sensory and motor processes that have been studied with this technique, and discuss the need to merge data from whole-brain functional imaging studies with neurochemical and anatomical information to develop holistic models of functional neural circuits. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content:encoded>

However, bulk of evidence demonstrates the requirement of the reciprocal interactions between cortical and thalamic neurons as key for the correct development of functional thalamocortical circuits. This reciprocal loop of connections is essential for sensory processing as well as for the execution of complex sensory-motor tasks. Here, we review recent advances in our understanding of how mutual collaborations between both brain regions define area patterning and cell differentiation in the thalamus and cortex. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content:encoded>

Microelectrode arrays based on complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) technology, such as Neuropixels probes, look set to transform these methods. Neuropixels probes provide ∼1000 recording sites on an extremely narrow shank, with on-board amplification, digitization, and multiplexing. They deliver low-noise recordings from hundreds of neurons, providing a step change in the type of data available to neuroscientists. Here we discuss the opportunities afforded by these probes for large-scale electrophysiology, the challenges associated with data processing and anatomical localization, and avenues for further improvements of the technology. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content:encoded>

With vast cell number and diversity, mammalian nervous systems present a daunting challenge for achieving specific and comprehensive cell type access—prerequisite to circuit analysis. Genetic approaches in the mouse have relied on germline engineering to access marker-defined cell populations. Combinatorial strategies that engage marker intersection, anatomy and projection pattern (e.g. antero-grade and retro-grade viral vectors), and developmental lineage substantially increase the specificity of cell type targeting. While increasing number of mouse cell types are becoming experimentally accessible, comprehensive coverage requires larger coordinated efforts with strategic infrastructural and fiscal planning. CRISPR-based genome editing may enable cell type access in other species, but issues of time, cost and ethics remain, especially for primates. Novel approaches that bypass the germline, such as somatic cell engineering and cell surface-based gene delivery, may reduce the barrier of genetic access to mammalian cell types. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content:encoded>

Autocrine signals have been discovered in many neuronal contexts, providing insights into their regulation and function. The growing realization of the importance of cell-autonomous signaling stems from advances in both conditional genetic approaches and in sophisticated analyses of growth factor dynamics, which combine to enable rigorous in vivo dissection of signaling pathways. Here we review recent studies defining autocrine roles for growth factors such as BDNF, and classical morphogens, including Wnts and BMPs, in regulating neuronal development and plasticity. Collectively, these studies highlight an intimate relationship between activity-dependent autocrine signaling and synaptic plasticity, and further suggest a common principle for coordinating paracrine and autocrine signaling in the nervous system. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content:encoded>

These platforms leverage basic advances in biocompatible materials, semiconductor device designs and systems engineering concepts to afford modes of operation that are qualitatively distinct from those of conventional approaches that tether animals to external hardware by means of optical fibers, electrical cables and/or fluidic tubing. Neuroscience studies that exploit the unique features of these technologies enable insights into neural function through targeted stimulation, inhibition and recording, with spatially and genetically precise manipulation of neural circuit activity. Experimental possibilities include studies in naturalistic, three dimensional environments, investigations of pair-wise or group related social interactions and many other scenarios of interest that cannot be addressed using traditional hardware. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content:encoded>

When synaptic vesicles fuse with the plasma membrane, these membranes and the attached proteins are endocytosed and either recycled or degraded. This turnover needs to be tightly regulated in a timely and spatially confined manner. Increasing evidence suggests that these mechanisms do not only serve for the removal of defective synaptic vesicles or structural proteins of the active zone but also contribute to pathways regulating synaptic strength. The corresponding presynaptic autophagy system thus appears also important for synaptic maintenance and plasticity. Exciting new studies provide evidence how the autophagy machinery recognizes and degrades synaptic components and lay the ground to understand how autophagy in the presynaptic compartment contributes to modulation and maintenance of synaptic function. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content:encoded>

During synchronous neurotransmission release is precisely coupled to action potentials, in contrast, asynchronous release events show only loose temporal coupling to presynaptic activity whereas spontaneous neurotransmission occurs independent of presynaptic activity. The mechanisms that give rise to this diversity in neurotransmitter release modes are poorly understood. Recent studies have described several presynaptic molecular pathways controlling synaptic vesicle pool segregation and recycling, which in turn may dictate distinct modes of neurotransmitter release. In this article, we review this recent work regarding neurotransmitter release modes and their relationship to synaptic vesicle pool dynamics as well as the molecular machinery that establishes synaptic vesicle pool identity. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: A competitive binding model predicts nonlinear responses of olfactory receptors to complex mixtures. (arXiv:1805.00563v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1805.00563</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In color vision, the quantitative rules for mixing lights to make a target
color are well understood. By contrast, the rules for mixing odorants to make a
target odor remain elusive. A solution to this problem in vision relied on
characterizing the receptor responses to different wavelengths of light and
subsequently relating receptor responses to perception. In olfaction,
experimentally measuring the receptor response to a representative set of
complex mixtures is intractable due to the vast number of possibilities. To
meet this challenge, we develop a biophysical model that predicts mammalian
receptor responses to complex mixtures using responses to single odorants. The
dominant nonlinearity in our model is competitive binding: only one odorant
molecule can attach to a receptor binding site at a time. This simple framework
predicts receptor responses to mixtures of up to twelve monomolecular odorants
to within 10-30% of experimental observations and provides a powerful method
for leveraging limited experimental data. Simple extensions of our model
describe phenomena such as synergy, overshadowing, and inhibition, suggesting
that these perceptual effects can arise partly from receptor binding
properties, and may not require either complex neural interactions or feedback
from higher brain areas.

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Waves of maturation and senescence in micro-structural MRI markers of human cortical myelination over the lifespan</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/314195v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Seminal human brain histology work has demonstrated developmental waves of myelination. Here, using a micro-structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) marker sensitive to myelin, we studied fine-grained age differences to deduce waves of growth, stability, and decline of cortical myelination over the life-cycle. In 484 participants, aged 8-85 years, we fitted smooth growth curves to T1- to T2-weighted ratio in each of 360 regions from one of 7 cytoarchitectonic classes. From the first derivatives of these generally inverted-U trajectories, we defined three milestones: the age at peak growth; the age at onset of a stable plateau; and the age at the onset of decline. Age at peak growth had a bimodal distribution comprising an early (pre-pubertal) wave of primary sensory and motor cortices and a later (post-pubertal) wave of association, insular and limbic cortices. Most regions reached stability in the 30s but there was a second wave reaching stability in the 50s. Age at onset of decline was also bimodal: in some right hemisphere regions, the curve declined from the 60s, but in other left hemisphere regions, there was no significant decline from the stable plateau. Network analysis of the micro-structural connectome revealed that late developing (second wave) regions had significantly higher degree and other measures of centrality. These results are consistent with regionally heterogeneous waves of intracortical myelinogenesis and age-related demyelination, which may be relevant to the onset of neuropsychiatric disorders, and dementia, and the staged acquisition and decline of motor and cognitive skills over the course of the life-cycle.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/313981v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Recent advances in experimental methods in neuroscience enable measuring in-vivo activity of large populations of neurons at cellular level resolution. To leverage the full potential of these complex datasets and analyze the dynamics of individual neurons, it is essential to extract high-resolution regions of interest, while addressing demixing of overlapping spatial components and denoising of the temporal signal of each neuron. In this paper, we propose a data-driven solution to these challenges, by representing the spatiotemporal volume as a graph in the image plane. Based on the spectral embedding of this graph calculated across trials, we propose a new clustering method, Local Selective Spectral Clustering, capable of handling overlapping clusters and disregarding clutter. We also present a new nonlinear mapping which recovers the structural map of the neurons and dendrites, and global video denoising. We demonstrate our approach on in-vivo calcium imaging of neurons and apical dendrites, automatically extracting complex structures in the image domain, and denoising and demixing their time-traces.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/313692v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Background: Current evidence has revealed a significant association between bullous pemphigoid (BP) and neurological diseases (ND), including stroke, but the incidence of BP autoantibodies in patients with stroke has not previously been investigated. Objective: Our study aims to assess BP antigen-specific antibodies in stroke patients. Methods: 100 patients with stroke and 100 healthy controls were randomly selected to measure anti-BP180/230 IgG autoantibodies by ELISA, salt split IIF and immunoblotting against human cutaneous BP180 and BP180-NC16A. Results: Anti-BP180 autoantibodies were found in 14(14.0%) patients with stroke and 5(5.0 %) of controls by ELISA (p&amp;lt;0.05). Sera from 13(13.0%) patients with stroke and 3(3.0 %) controls reacted with 180-kDa proteins from human cutis extract (p&amp;lt;0.05). 11(11.0%) of stroke and 2(2.0 %) of control sera recognized the human recombinant full length BP180 and NC16A (p&amp;lt;0.05). The anti-BP180-positive patients were significantly younger than the negative patients in stroke (p&amp;lt;0.001). Conclusion: Development of anti-BP180 autoantibodies occur at a higher frequency after stroke, suggesting BP180 as a shared autoantigen in stroke with BP and providing novel insights into BP pathogenesis in aging.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/313452v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>A variety of de novo and inherited missense mutations associated with neurological disorders are found in the NMDA receptor M4 transmembrane helices, which are peripheral to the pore domain in eukaryotic ionotropic glutamate receptors. Subsets of these mutations affect receptor gating with dramatic effects, including in one instance halting it, occurring at a conserved glycine near the extracellular end of M4. Functional experiments and molecular dynamic simulations of constructs with and without substitutions at this glycine indicate that it acts as a hinge, permitting the intracellular portion of the ion channel to laterally expand. This expansion stabilizes long-lived open states leading to slow deactivation and high Ca2+ permeability. Our studies provide a functional and structural framework for the effect of missense mutations on NMDARs at central synapses and highlight how the M4 segment may represent a pathway for intracellular modulation of NMDA receptor function.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/313221v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Reduced hippocampal volume is frequently observed in posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), but the exact psychological processes associated with these alterations remain unclear. Given the role of the hippocampus in contextual representations of threat and memory, we investigated relationships between retrospectively reported combat exposure, perceived threat, and hippocampal volume in trauma-exposed veterans. T1-weighted anatomical images were obtained from a sample of 52 male veterans with a broad range of PTSD symptoms during MRI scanning. Hippocampal volume was estimated using automatic segmentation tools in FreeSurfer. An index of Perceived Threat Bias (PTB) was calculated, reflecting the degree of discordance between subjective perceptions of threat while deployed and self-reported combat exposure. Hippocampal volume was regressed on PTB and PTSD symptoms on the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS). Results indicated that perceived threat bias was unrelated to overall CAPS symptoms, but was positively associated with CAPS avoidance/numbing symptoms and symptoms of depression, anxiety, and worry. Elevated PTB was associated with smaller hippocampal volume for individuals with a wide range of PTSD symptoms. Hippocampal volume was also inversely related to avoidance/numbing CAPS symptoms. These results indicate that volume of the hippocampus, a region involved in contextual threat processing and memory, is related to recalled associations between traumatic events and accompanying subjective threat appraisals. Future research should clarify the precise temporal milieu of these effects and investigate whether individual differences in hippocampal structure and function contribute to exaggerated threat appraisal at the time of trauma, or in subsequently biased memories or appraisals of traumatic events.</content:encoded>

Animals are able to reach a desired state in an environment by controlling various behavioral patterns. Identification of the behavioral strategy used for this control is important for understanding animals’ decision-making and is fundamental to dissect information processing done by the nervous system. However, methods for quantifying such behavioral strategies have not been fully established. In this study, we developed an inverse reinforcement-learning (IRL) framework to identify an animal’s behavioral strategy from behavioral time-series data. We applied this framework to &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;elegans&lt;/i&gt; thermotactic behavior; after cultivation at a constant temperature with or without food, fed worms prefer, while starved worms avoid the cultivation temperature on a thermal gradient. Our IRL approach revealed that the fed worms used both the absolute temperature and its temporal derivative and that their behavior involved two strategies: directed migration (DM) and isothermal migration (IM). With DM, worms efficiently reached specific temperatures, which explains their thermotactic behavior when fed. With IM, worms moved along a constant temperature, which reflects isothermal tracking, well-observed in previous studies. In contrast to fed animals, starved worms escaped the cultivation temperature using only the absolute, but not the temporal derivative of temperature. We also investigated the neural basis underlying these strategies, by applying our method to thermosensory neuron-deficient worms. Thus, our IRL-based approach is useful in identifying animal strategies from behavioral time-series data and could be applied to a wide range of behavioral studies, including decision-making, in other organisms.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/kL4dFBBuUp4&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Mirror Neuron Populations Represent Sequences of Behavioral Epochs During Both Execution and Observation</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/18/4441?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Mirror neurons (MNs) have the distinguishing characteristic of modulating during both execution and observation of an action. Although most studies of MNs have focused on various features of the observed movement, MNs also may monitor the behavioral circumstances in which the movement is embedded, including time periods preceding and following the observed movement. Here, we recorded multiple MNs simultaneously from implanted electrode arrays as two male monkeys executed and observed a reach, grasp, and manipulate task involving different target objects. MNs were recorded from premotor cortex (PM-MNs) and primary motor cortex (M1-MNs). During execution trials, hidden Markov models (HMMs) applied to the activity of either PM-MN or M1-MN populations most often detected sequences of four hidden states, which we named according to the behavioral epoch during which each state began: initial, reaction, movement, and final. The hidden states of MN populations thus reflected not only the movement, but also three behavioral epochs during which no movement occurred. HMMs trained on execution trials could decode similar sequences of hidden states in observation trials, with complete hidden state sequences decoded more frequently from PM-MN populations than from M1-MN populations. Moreover, population trajectories projected in a 2D plane defined by execution trials were preserved in observation trials more for PM-MN than for M1-MN populations. These results suggest that MN populations represent entire behavioral sequences, including both movement and non-movement. PM-MN populations showed greater similarity than M1-MN populations in their representation of behavioral sequences during execution versus observation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Mirror neurons (MNs) are thought to provide a neural mechanism for understanding the actions of others. However, for an action to be understood, both the movement per se and the non-movement context before and after the movement need to be represented. We found that simultaneously recorded MN populations encoded sequential hidden neural states corresponding approximately to sequential behavioral epochs of a reach, grasp, and manipulate task. During observation trials, hidden state sequences were similar to those identified in execution trials. Hidden state similarity was stronger for MN populations in premotor cortex than for those in primary motor cortex. Execution/observation similarity of hidden state sequences may contribute to understanding the actions of others without actually performing the action oneself.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Control of Excitation/Inhibition Balance in a Hippocampal Circuit by Calcium Sensor Protein Regulation of Presynaptic Calcium Channels</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/18/4430?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Activity-dependent regulation controls the balance of synaptic excitation to inhibition in neural circuits, and disruption of this regulation impairs learning and memory and causes many neurological disorders. The molecular mechanisms underlying short-term synaptic plasticity are incompletely understood, and their role in inhibitory synapses remains uncertain. Here we show that regulation of voltage-gated calcium (Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;) channel type 2.1 (Ca&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;2.1) by neuronal Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; sensor (CaS) proteins controls synaptic plasticity and excitation/inhibition balance in a hippocampal circuit. Prevention of CaS protein regulation by introducing the IM-AA mutation in Ca&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;2.1 channels in male and female mice impairs short-term synaptic facilitation at excitatory synapses of CA3 pyramidal neurons onto parvalbumin (PV)-expressing basket cells. In sharp contrast, the IM-AA mutation abolishes rapid synaptic depression in the inhibitory synapses of PV basket cells onto CA1 pyramidal neurons. These results show that CaS protein regulation of facilitation and inactivation of Ca&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;2.1 channels controls the direction of short-term plasticity at these two synapses. Deletion of the CaS protein CaBP1/caldendrin also blocks rapid depression at PV-CA1 synapses, implicating its upregulation of inactivation of Ca&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;2.1 channels in control of short-term synaptic plasticity at this inhibitory synapse. Studies of local-circuit function revealed reduced inhibition of CA1 pyramidal neurons by the disynaptic pathway from CA3 pyramidal cells via PV basket cells and greatly increased excitation/inhibition ratio of the direct excitatory input versus indirect inhibitory input from CA3 pyramidal neurons to CA1 pyramidal neurons. This striking defect in local-circuit function may contribute to the dramatic impairment of spatial learning and memory in IM-AA mice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Many forms of short-term synaptic plasticity in neuronal circuits rely on regulation of presynaptic voltage-gated Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; (Ca&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;) channels. Regulation of Ca&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;2.1 channels by neuronal calcium sensor (CaS) proteins controls short-term synaptic plasticity. Here we demonstrate a direct link between regulation of Ca&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;2.1 channels and short-term synaptic plasticity in native hippocampal excitatory and inhibitory synapses. We also identify CaBP1/caldendrin as the calcium sensor interacting with Ca&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;2.1 channels to mediate rapid synaptic depression in the inhibitory hippocampal synapses of parvalbumin-expressing basket cells to CA1 pyramidal cells. Disruption of this regulation causes altered short-term plasticity and impaired balance of hippocampal excitatory to inhibitory circuits.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Alpha Oscillations Are Causally Linked to Inhibitory Abilities in Ageing</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/18/4418?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Aging adults typically show reduced ability to ignore task-irrelevant information, an essential skill for optimal performance in many cognitive operations, including those requiring working memory (WM) resources. In a first experiment, young and elderly human participants of both genders performed an established WM paradigm probing inhibitory abilities by means of valid, invalid, and neutral retro-cues. Elderly participants showed an overall cost, especially in performing invalid trials, whereas younger participants' general performance was comparatively higher, as expected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inhibitory abilities have been linked to alpha brain oscillations but it is yet unknown whether in aging these oscillations (also typically impoverished) and inhibitory abilities are causally linked. To probe this possible causal link in aging, we compared in a second experiment parietal alpha-transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) with either no stimulation (Sham) or with two control stimulation frequencies (theta- and gamma-tACS) in the elderly group while performing the same WM paradigm. Alpha- (but not theta- or gamma-) tACS selectively and significantly improved performance (now comparable to younger adults' performance in the first experiment), particularly for invalid cues where initially elderly showed the highest costs. Alpha oscillations are therefore causally linked to inhibitory abilities and frequency-tuned alpha-tACS interventions can selectively change these abilities in the elderly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Ignoring task-irrelevant information, an ability associated to rhythmic brain activity in the alpha frequency band, is fundamental for optimal performance. Indeed, impoverished inhibitory abilities contribute to age-related decline in cognitive functions like working memory (WM), the capacity to briefly hold information in mind. Whether in aging adults alpha oscillations and inhibitory abilities are &lt;i&gt;causally&lt;/i&gt; linked is yet unknown. We experimentally manipulated frequency-tuned brain activity using transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS), combined with a retro-cue paradigm assessing WM and inhibition. We found that alpha-tACS induced a significant improvement in target responses and misbinding errors, two indexes of inhibition. We concluded that in aging alpha oscillations are causally linked to inhibitory abilities, and that despite being impoverished, these abilities are still malleable.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: The Magnitude, But Not the Sign, of MT Single-Trial Spike-Time Correlations Predicts Motion Detection Performance</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/18/4399?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Spike-time correlations capture the short timescale covariance between the activity of neurons on a single trial. These correlations can significantly vary in magnitude and sign from trial to trial, and have been proposed to contribute to information encoding in visual cortex. While monkeys performed a motion-pulse detection task, we examined the behavioral impact of both the magnitude and sign of single-trial spike-time correlations between two nonoverlapping pools of middle temporal (MT) neurons. We applied three single-trial measures of spike-time correlation between our multiunit MT spike trains (Pearson's, absolute value of Pearson's, and mutual information), and examined the degree to which they predicted a subject's performance on a trial-by-trial basis. We found that on each trial, positive and negative spike-time correlations were almost equally likely, and, once the correlational sign was accounted for, all three measures were similarly predictive of behavior. Importantly, just before the behaviorally relevant motion pulse occurred, single-trial spike-time correlations were as predictive of the performance of the animal as single-trial firing rates. While firing rates were positively associated with behavioral outcomes, the presence of either strong positive or negative correlations had a detrimental effect on behavior. These correlations occurred on short timescales, and the strongest positive and negative correlations modulated behavioral performance by ~9%, compared with trials with no correlations. We suggest a model where spike-time correlations are associated with a common noise source for the two MT pools, which in turn decreases the signal-to-noise ratio of the integrated signals that drive motion detection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Previous work has shown that spike-time correlations occurring on short timescales can affect the encoding of visual inputs. Although spike-time correlations significantly vary in both magnitude and sign across trials, their impact on trial-by-trial behavior is not fully understood. Using neural recordings from area MT (middle temporal) in monkeys performing a motion-detection task using a brief stimulus, we found that both positive and negative spike-time correlations predicted behavioral responses as well as firing rate on a trial-by-trial basis. We propose that strong positive and negative spike-time correlations decreased behavioral performance by reducing the signal-to-noise ratio of integrated MT neural signals.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: On the Flexibility of Basic Risk Attitudes in Monkeys</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/18/4383?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Monkeys and other animals appear to share with humans two risk attitudes predicted by prospect theory: an inverse-S-shaped probability-weighting (PW) function and a steeper utility curve for losses than for gains. These findings suggest that such preferences are stable traits with common neural substrates. We hypothesized instead that animals tailor their preferences to subtle changes in task contexts, making risk attitudes flexible. Previous studies used a limited number of outcomes, trial types, and contexts. To gain a broader perspective, we examined two large datasets of male macaques' risky choices: one from a task with real (juice) gains and another from a token task with gains and losses. In contrast to previous findings, monkeys were risk seeking for both gains and losses (i.e., lacked a reflection effect) and showed steeper gain than loss curves (loss seeking). Utility curves for gains were substantially different in the two tasks. Monkeys showed nearly linear PWs in one task and S-shaped ones in the other; neither task produced a consistent inverse-S-shaped curve. To account for these observations, we developed and tested various computational models of the processes involved in the construction of reward value. We found that adaptive differential weighting of prospective gamble outcomes could partially account for the observed differences in the utility functions across the two experiments and thus provide a plausible mechanism underlying flexible risk attitudes. Together, our results support the idea that risky choices are constructed flexibly at the time of elicitation and place important constraints on neural models of economic choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; We respond in reliable ways to risk, but are our risk preferences stable traits or ephemeral states? Using various computational models, we examined two large datasets of macaque risky choices in two different tasks. We observed several deviations from &quot;classic&quot; risk preferences seen in humans and monkeys: no reflection effect, loss seeking as opposed to loss aversion, and linear and S-shaped, as opposed to inverse-S-shaped, probability distortion. These results challenge the idea that our risk attitudes are evolved traits shared with the last common ancestor of macaques and humans, suggesting instead that behavioral flexibility is the hallmark of risky choice in primates. We show how this flexibility can emerge partly as a result of interactions between attentional and reward systems.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Active Braking of Whole-Arm Reaching Movements Provides Single-Trial Neuromuscular Measures of Movement Cancellation</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/18/4367?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Movement inhibition is an aspect of executive control that can be studied using the countermanding paradigm, wherein subjects try to cancel an impending movement following presentation of a stop signal. This paradigm permits estimation of the stop-signal reaction time or the time needed to respond to the stop signal. Numerous countermanding studies have examined fast, ballistic movements, such as saccades, even though many movements in daily life are not ballistic and can be stopped at any point during their trajectory. A benefit of studying the control of nonballistic movements is that antagonist muscle recruitment, which serves to actively brake a movement, presumably arises in response to the stop signal. Here, nine human participants (2 female) performed a center-out whole-arm reaching task with a countermanding component, while we recorded the activity of upper-limb muscles contributing to movement generation and braking. The data show a clear response on antagonist muscles to a stop signal, even for movements that have barely begun. As predicted, the timing of such antagonist recruitment relative to the stop signal covaried with conventional estimates of the stop-signal reaction time, both within and across subjects. The timing of antagonist muscle recruitment also attested to a rapid reprioritization of movement inhibition, with antagonist latencies decreasing across sequences consisting of repeated stop trials; such reprioritization also scaled with error magnitude. We conclude that antagonist muscle recruitment arises as a manifestation of a stopping process, providing a novel, accessible, and within-trial measure of the stop-signal reaction time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The countermanding or stop-signal paradigm permits estimation of how quickly subjects cancel an impending movement. Traditionally, this paradigm has been studied using simple movements, such as saccadic eye movements or button presses. Here, by measuring upper limb muscle activity while human subjects countermand whole-arm reaching movements, we show that movement cancellation often involves prominent recruitment of antagonist muscles that serves to actively brake the movement, even on movements that have barely begun. The timing of antagonist muscle recruitment correlates with traditional estimates of movement cancellation. Because they can be detected on a single-trial basis, muscle-based measures may provide a new way of characterizing movement cancellation at an unprecedented within-trial resolution.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Parietal-Occipital Interactions Underlying Control- and Representation-Related Processes in Working Memory for Nonspatial Visual Features</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/18/4357?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Although the manipulation of load is popular in visual working memory research, many studies confound general attentional demands with context binding by drawing memoranda from the same stimulus category. In this fMRI study of human observers (both sexes), we created high- versus low-binding conditions, while holding load constant, by comparing trials requiring memory for the direction of motion of one random dot kinematogram (RDK; 1M trials) versus for three RDKs (3M), or versus one RDK and two color patches (1M2C). Memory precision was highest for 1M trials and comparable for 3M and 1M2C trials. And although delay-period activity in occipital cortex did not differ between the three conditions, returning to baseline for all three, multivariate pattern analysis decoding of a remembered RDK from occipital cortex was also highest for 1M trials and comparable for 3M and 1M2C trials. Delay-period activity in intraparietal sulcus (IPS), although elevated for all three conditions, displayed more sensitivity to demands on context binding than to load per se. The 1M-to-3M increase in IPS signal predicted the 1M-to-3M declines in both behavioral and neural estimates of working memory precision. These effects strengthened along a caudal-to-rostral gradient, from IPS0 to IPS5. Context binding-independent load sensitivity was observed when analyses were lateralized and extended into PFC, with trend-level effects evident in left IPS and strong effects in left lateral PFC. These findings illustrate how visual working memory capacity limitations arise from multiple factors that each recruit dissociable brain systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Visual working memory capacity predicts performance on a wide array of cognitive and real-world outcomes. At least two theoretically distinct factors are proposed to influence visual working memory capacity limitations: an amodal attentional resource that must be shared across remembered items; and the demands on context binding. We unconfounded these two factors by varying load with items drawn from the same stimulus category (&quot;high demands on context binding&quot;) versus items drawn from different stimulus categories (&quot;low demands on context binding&quot;). The results provide evidence for the dissociability, and the neural bases, of these two theorized factors, and they specify that the functions of intraparietal sulcus may relate more strongly to the control of representations than to the general allocation of attention.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Time Course of Brain Network Reconfiguration Supporting Inhibitory Control</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/18/4348?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Hemodynamic research has recently clarified key nodes and links in brain networks implementing inhibitory control. Although fMRI methods are optimized for identifying the structure of brain networks, the relatively slow temporal course of fMRI limits the ability to characterize network operation. The latter is crucial for developing a mechanistic understanding of how brain networks shift dynamically to support inhibitory control. To address this critical gap, we applied spectrally resolved Granger causality (GC) and random forest machine learning tools to human EEG data in two large samples of adults (test sample &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 96, replication sample &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 237, total &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt; = 333, both sexes) who performed a color–word Stroop task. Time–frequency analysis confirmed that recruitment of inhibitory control accompanied by slower behavioral responses was related to changes in theta and alpha/beta power. GC analyses revealed directionally asymmetric exchanges within frontal and between frontal and parietal brain areas: top-down influence of superior frontal gyrus (SFG) over both dorsal ACC (dACC) and inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), dACC control over middle frontal gyrus (MFG), and frontal–parietal exchanges (IFG, precuneus, MFG). Predictive analytics confirmed a combination of behavioral and brain-derived variables as the best set of predictors of inhibitory control demands, with SFG theta bearing higher classification importance than dACC theta and posterior beta tracking the onset of behavioral response. The present results provide mechanistic insight into the biological implementation of a psychological phenomenon: inhibitory control is implemented by dynamic routing processes during which the target response is upregulated via theta-mediated effective connectivity within key PFC nodes and via beta-mediated motor preparation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Hemodynamic neuroimaging research has recently clarified regional structures in brain networks supporting inhibitory control. However, due to inherent methodological constraints, much of this research has been unable to characterize the temporal dynamics of such networks (e.g., direction of information flow between nodes). Guided by fMRI research identifying the structure of brain networks supporting inhibitory control, results of EEG source analysis in a test sample (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 96) and replication sample (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 237) using effective connectivity and predictive analytics strategies advance a model of inhibitory control by characterizing the precise temporal dynamics by which this network operates and exemplify an approach by which mechanistic models can be developed for other key psychological processes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: GABAergic Local Interneurons Shape Female Fruit Fly Response to Mating Songs</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/18/4329?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Many animals use acoustic signals to attract a potential mating partner. In fruit flies (&lt;i&gt;Drosophila melanogaster&lt;/i&gt;), the courtship pulse song has a species-specific interpulse interval (IPI) that activates mating. Although a series of auditory neurons in the fly brain exhibit different tuning patterns to IPIs, it is unclear how the response of each neuron is tuned. Here, we studied the neural circuitry regulating the activity of antennal mechanosensory and motor center (AMMC)-B1 neurons, key secondary auditory neurons in the excitatory neural pathway that relay song information. By performing Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; imaging in female flies, we found that the IPI selectivity observed in AMMC-B1 neurons differs from that of upstream auditory sensory neurons [Johnston's organ (JO)-B]. Selective knock-down of a GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptor subunit in AMMC-B1 neurons increased their response to short IPIs, suggesting that GABA suppresses AMMC-B1 activity at these IPIs. Connection mapping identified two GABAergic local interneurons that synapse with AMMC-B1 and JO-B. Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; imaging combined with neuronal silencing revealed that these local interneurons, AMMC-LN and AMMC-B2, shape the response pattern of AMMC-B1 neurons at a 15 ms IPI. Neuronal silencing studies further suggested that both GABAergic local interneurons suppress the behavioral response to artificial pulse songs in flies, particularly those with a 15 ms IPI. Altogether, we identified a circuit containing two GABAergic local interneurons that affects the temporal tuning of AMMC-B1 neurons in the song relay pathway and the behavioral response to the courtship song. Our findings suggest that feedforward inhibitory pathways adjust the behavioral response to courtship pulse songs in female flies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; To understand how the brain detects time intervals between sound elements, we studied the neural pathway that relays species-specific courtship song information in female &lt;i&gt;Drosophila melanogaster&lt;/i&gt;. We demonstrate that the signal transmission from auditory sensory neurons to key secondary auditory neurons antennal mechanosensory and motor center (AMMC)-B1 is the first-step to generate time interval selectivity of neurons in the song relay pathway. Two GABAergic local interneurons are suggested to shape the interval selectivity of AMMC-B1 neurons by receiving auditory inputs and in turn providing feedforward inhibition onto AMMC-B1 neurons. Furthermore, these GABAergic local interneurons suppress the song response behavior in an interval-dependent manner.

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Cascades of Homeostatic Dysregulation Promote Incubation of Cocaine Craving</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/18/4316?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In human drug users, cue-induced drug craving progressively intensifies after drug abstinence, promoting drug relapse. This time-dependent progression of drug craving is recapitulated in rodent models, in which rats exhibit progressive intensification of cue-induced drug seeking after withdrawal from drug self-administration, a phenomenon termed incubation of drug craving. Although recent results suggest that functional alterations of the nucleus accumbens (NAc) contribute to incubation of drug craving, it remains poorly understood how NAc function evolves after drug withdrawal to progressively intensify drug seeking. The functional output of NAc relies on how the membrane excitability of its principal medium spiny neurons (MSNs) translates excitatory synaptic inputs into action potential firing. Here, we report a synapse-membrane homeostatic crosstalk (SMHC) in male rats, through which an increase or decrease in the excitatory synaptic strength induces a homeostatic decrease or increase in the intrinsic membrane excitability of NAc MSNs, and vice versa. After short-term withdrawal from cocaine self-administration, despite no actual change in the AMPA receptor-mediated excitatory synaptic strength, GluN2B NMDA receptors, the SMHC sensors of synaptic strength, are upregulated. This may create false SMHC signals, leading to a decrease in the membrane excitability of NAc MSNs. The decreased membrane excitability subsequently induces another round of SMHC, leading to synaptic accumulation of calcium-permeable AMPA receptors and upregulation of excitatory synaptic strength after long-term withdrawal from cocaine. Disrupting SMHC-based dysregulation cascades after cocaine exposure prevents incubation of cocaine craving. Thus, cocaine triggers cascades of SMHC-based dysregulation in NAc MSNs, promoting incubated cocaine seeking after drug withdrawal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Here, we report a bidirectional homeostatic plasticity between the excitatory synaptic input and membrane excitability of nucleus accumbens (NAc) medium spiny neurons (MSNs), through which an increase or decrease in the excitatory synaptic strength induces a homeostatic decrease or increase in the membrane excitability, and vice versa. Cocaine self-administration creates a false homeostatic signal that engages this synapse-membrane homeostatic crosstalk mechanism, and produces cascades of alterations in excitatory synapses and membrane properties of NAc MSNs after withdrawal from cocaine. Experimentally preventing this homeostatic dysregulation cascade prevents the progressive intensification of cocaine seeking after drug withdrawal. These results provide a novel mechanism through which drug-induced homeostatic dysregulation cascades progressively alter the functional output of NAc MSNs and promote drug relapse.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Matrix Metalloproteinase-Mediated Blood-Brain Barrier Dysfunction in Epilepsy</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/18/4301?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The blood-brain barrier is dysfunctional in epilepsy, thereby contributing to seizure genesis and resistance to antiseizure drugs. Previously, several groups reported that seizures increase brain glutamate levels, which leads to barrier dysfunction. One critical component of barrier dysfunction is brain capillary leakage. Based on our preliminary data, we hypothesized that glutamate released during seizures mediates an increase in matrix-metalloproteinase (MMP) expression and activity levels, thereby contributing to barrier leakage. To test this hypothesis, we exposed isolated brain capillaries from male Sprague Dawley rats to glutamate &lt;i&gt;ex vivo&lt;/i&gt; and used an &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;ex vivo&lt;/i&gt; approach of isolated brain capillaries from female Wistar rats that experienced status epilepticus as an acute seizure model. We found that exposing isolated rat brain capillaries to glutamate increased MMP-2 and MMP-9 protein and activity levels, and decreased tight junction protein levels, which resulted in barrier leakage. We confirmed these findings &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; in rats after status epilepticus and in brain capillaries from male mice lacking cytosolic phospholipase A&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Together, our data support the hypothesis that glutamate released during seizures signals an increase in MMP-2 and MMP-9 protein expression and activity levels, resulting in blood-brain barrier leakage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The mechanism leading to seizure-mediated blood-brain barrier dysfunction in epilepsy is poorly understood. In the present study, we focused on defining this mechanism in the brain capillary endothelium. We demonstrate that seizures trigger a pathway that involves glutamate signaling through cytosolic phospholipase A&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, which increases MMP levels and decreases tight junction protein expression levels, resulting in barrier leakage. These findings may provide potential therapeutic avenues within the blood-brain barrier to limit barrier dysfunction in epilepsy and decrease seizure burden.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: BACE1 Mediates HIV-Associated and Excitotoxic Neuronal Damage Through an APP-Dependent Mechanism</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/18/4288?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HANDs) share common symptoms with Alzheimer's disease (AD), which is characterized by amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques. Plaques are formed by aggregation of Aβ oligomers, which may be the toxic species in AD pathogenesis, and oligomers are generated by cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP) by β-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1). BACE1 inhibitors reverse neuronal loss and cognitive decline in animal models of AD. Although studies have also found evidence of altered APP processing in HIV&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; patients, it is unknown whether increased BACE1 expression or Aβ oligomer production is a common neuropathological feature of HAND. Moreover, it is unknown whether BACE1 or APP is involved in the excitotoxic, NMDAR-dependent component of HIV-associated neurotoxicity &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;. Herein, we hypothesize that HIV-associated neurotoxicity is mediated by NMDAR-dependent elevation of BACE1 and subsequent altered processing of APP. Supporting this, we observed elevated levels of BACE1 and Aβ oligomers in CNS of male and female HIV&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; patients. In a model of HIV-associated neurotoxicity in which rat neurons are treated with supernatants from HIV-infected human monocyte-derived macrophages, we observed NMDAR-dependent elevation of BACE1 protein. NMDA treatment also increased BACE1 and both pharmacological BACE1 inhibition and genetic loss of APP were partially neuroprotective. Moreover, in APP knock-out (APP&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt;) mouse neurons, NMDA-induced toxicity was BACE1 independent, indicating that cytotoxicity of BACE1 is dependent upon APP cleavage. Our findings suggest that increased BACE1 and the resultant Aβ oligomer production may contribute to HIV-associated neuropathogenesis and inhibition of BACE1 could have therapeutic potential in HANDs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HANDs) represent a range of cognitive impairments affecting ~50% of HIV&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; individuals. The specific causes of HAND are unknown, but evidence suggests that HIV-infected macrophage infiltration into the brain may cause neuronal damage. Herein, we show that neurons treated with conditioned media from HIV-infected macrophages have increased expression of β-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1), a protein implicated in Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis. Moreover, inhibition of BACE1 prevented neuronal loss after conditioned media exposure, but had no effect on HIV-associated neurotoxicity in neurons lacking its cleavage target amyloid precursor protein. We also observed increased BACE1 expression in HIV&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; patient brain tissue, confirming the potential relevance of BACE1 as a therapeutic target in HANDs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Sustained Expression of Negative Regulators of Myelination Protects Schwann Cells from Dysmyelination in a Charcot-Marie-Tooth 1B Mouse Model</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/18/4275?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Schwann cell differentiation and myelination in the PNS are the result of fine-tuning of positive and negative transcriptional regulators. As myelination starts, negative regulators are downregulated, whereas positive ones are upregulated. Fully differentiated Schwann cells maintain an extraordinary plasticity and can transdifferentiate into &quot;repair&quot; Schwann cells after nerve injury. Reactivation of negative regulators of myelination is essential to generate repair Schwann cells. Negative regulators have also been implicated in demyelinating neuropathies, although their role in disease remains elusive. Here, we used a mouse model of Charcot–Marie–Tooth neuropathy type 1B (CMT1B), the P0S63del mouse characterized by ER stress and the activation of the unfolded protein response, to show that adult Schwann cells are in a partial differentiation state because they overexpress transcription factors that are normally expressed only before myelination. We provide evidence that two of these factors, Sox2 and Id2, act as negative regulators of myelination &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. However, their sustained expression in neuropathy is protective because ablation of Sox2 or/and Id2 from S63del mice of both sexes results in worsening of the dysmyelinating phenotype. This is accompanied by increased levels of mutant P0 expression and exacerbation of ER stress, suggesting that limited differentiation may represent a novel adaptive mechanism through which Schwann cells counter the toxic effect of a mutant terminal differentiation protein.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; In many neuropathies, Schwann cells express high levels of early differentiation genes, but the significance of these altered expression remained unclear. Because many of these factors may act as negative regulators of myelination, it was suggested that their misexpression could contribute to dysmyelination. Here, we show that the transcription factors Sox2 and Id2 act as negative regulators of myelination &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;, but that their sustained expression in Charcot–Marie–Tooth type 1B (CMT1B) represents an adaptive response activated by the Schwann cells to reduce mutant protein toxicity and prevent demyelination.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Functional Organization of the Temporal-Parietal Junction for Theory of Mind in Preverbal Infants: A Near-Infrared Spectroscopy Study</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/18/4264?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Successful human social life requires imagining what others believe or think to understand and predict behavior. This ability, often referred to as theory of mind (ToM), reliably engages a specialized network of temporal and prefrontal brain regions in older children and adults, including selective recruitment of the temporal–parietal junction (TPJ). To date, how and when this specialized brain organization for ToM arises is unknown due to limitations in functional neuroimaging at younger ages. Here, we used the emerging technique of functional near-infrared spectroscopy to measure the functional brain response across parietal, temporal, and prefrontal regions in 7-month-old male and female infants as they viewed different video scenarios of a person searching for a hidden object. Over different conditions, we manipulated whether the person held an accurate (true) or inaccurate (false) belief about the location of the hidden object in the videos. In two separate experiments, we observed that activity from the TPJ, but not other temporal and prefrontal regions, spontaneously tracked with the beliefs of the other person, responding more during scenarios when the other person's belief regarding the location of the object was false compared with scenarios when her belief was true. These results mirror those obtained with adults to show that the TPJ already shows some functional organization relevant to high-level social cognition by around 7 months of age. Furthermore, these results suggest that infants may draw on similar core mechanisms to implicitly track beliefs, as adults do when reasoning explicitly about them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Humans selectively engage a network of brain regions, including the temporal–parietal junction (TPJ), to track what others think, an ability referred to as theory of mind. How and when this specialized brain organization for high-level social cognition arises is unknown. Using the emerging technique of near-infrared spectroscopy with 7-month-old infants, we observed that activity of the TPJ, but not other temporal and frontal regions, distinguished between scenarios when another person's belief about the location of the object was false compared with scenarios when the belief was true. These results suggest that a basic neural architecture to understand and predict the actions of others based on their beliefs may be present from the first year of life.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Integrated Information and Autonomy in the Thermodynamic Limit. (arXiv:1805.00393v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1805.00393</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The concept of autonomy is fundamental for understanding biological
organization and the evolutionary transitions of living systems. Understanding
how a system constitutes itself as an individual, cohesive entity is a
fundamental challenge for the understanding of life. However, it is generally a
difficult task to determine whether the system or its environment has generated
the correlations that allow an observer to trace the boundary of a living
system as a coherent unit. Inspired by the framework of integrated information
theory, we propose a measure of the level of integration of a system as the
response of a system to partitions that introduce perturbations in the
interaction between subsystems, without assuming the existence of an stationary
distribution. With the goal of characterizing transitions in integrated
information in the thermodynamic limit, we apply this measure to kinetic Ising
models of infinite size applying mean field techniques. Our findings suggest
that, in order to preserve the integration of causal influences of a system as
it grows in size, a living entity must be poised near critical points
maximizing the sensitivity of the system to perturbations in the interaction
between subsystems. Moreover, we observe how such a measure is able to delimit
an agent and its environment, being able to characterize simple instances of
agent-environment asymmetries in which the agent has the ability to modulate
its interaction with the environment.

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Preferential Representation of Past Outcome Information and Future Choice Behavior by Putative Inhibitory Interneurons Rather Than Putative Pyramidal Neurons in the Primate Dorsal Anterior Cingulate Cortex</title>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy103/4990942?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;The dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) plays crucial roles in monitoring the outcome of a choice and adjusting a subsequent choice behavior based on the outcome information. In the present study, we investigated how different types of dACC neurons, that is, putative pyramidal neurons and putative inhibitory interneurons, contribute to these processes. We analyzed single-unit database obtained from the dACC in monkeys performing a reversal learning task. The monkey was required to adjust choice behavior from past outcome experiences. Depending on their action potential waveforms, the recorded neurons were classified into putative pyramidal neurons and putative inhibitory interneurons. We found that these neurons do not equally contribute to outcome monitoring and behavioral adjustment. Although both neuron types evenly responded to the current outcome, a larger proportion of putative inhibitory interneurons than putative pyramidal neurons stored the information about the past outcome. The putative inhibitory interneurons further represented choice-related signals more frequently, such as whether the monkey would shift the last choice to an alternative at the next choice opportunity. Our findings suggest that putative inhibitory interneurons, which are thought not to project to brain areas outside the dACC, preferentially transmit signals that would adjust choice behavior based on past outcome experiences.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Converging evidence from activation, connectivity, and stimulation studies suggests that auditory brain networks are lateralized. Here we show that these findings can be at least partly explained by the asymmetric network embedding of the primary auditory cortices. Using diffusion-weighted imaging in 3 independent datasets, we investigate the propensity for left and right auditory cortex to communicate with other brain areas by quantifying the centrality of the auditory network across a spectrum of communication mechanisms, from shortest path communication to diffusive spreading. Across all datasets, we find that the right auditory cortex is better integrated in the connectome, facilitating more efficient communication with other areas, with much of the asymmetry driven by differences in communication pathways to the opposite hemisphere. Critically, the primacy of the right auditory cortex emerges only when communication is conceptualized as a diffusive process, taking advantage of more than just the topologically shortest paths in the network. Altogether, these results highlight how the network configuration and embedding of a particular region may contribute to its functional lateralization.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Mirror neurons have been proposed to underlie humans’ ability to understand others’ actions and intentions. Despite 2 decades of research, however, the exact computational and neuronal mechanisms implied in this ability remain unclear. In the current study, we investigated whether, in the absence of contextual cues, regions considered to be part of the human mirror neuron system represent intention from movement kinematics. A total of 21 participants observed reach-to-grasp movements, performed with either the intention to drink or to pour while undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging. Multivoxel pattern analysis revealed successful decoding of intentions from distributed patterns of activity in a network of structures comprising the inferior parietal lobule, the superior parietal lobule, the inferior frontal gyrus, and the middle frontal gyrus. Consistent with the proposal that parietal regions play a key role in intention understanding, classifier weights were higher in the inferior parietal region. These results provide the first demonstration that putative mirror neuron regions represent subtle differences in movement kinematics to read the intention of an observed motor act.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

However, radial glial cells (RGCs) have not been well characterized during human development and aging. We have previously described progenitor and neuronal layer establishment in the hippocampal pyramidal layer and dentate gyrus from embryonic life until mid-gestation. Here, we describe RGC subtypes in the hippocampus from 13 gestational weeks (GW) to mid-gestation and characterize their evolution and the dynamics of neurogenesis from mid-gestation to adulthood in normal and Alzheimer’s disease (AD) subjects. In the pyramidal ventricular zone (VZ), RGC density declined with neurogenesis from mid-gestation until the perinatal period. In the dentate area, morphologic and antigenic differences among RGCs were observed from early ages of development to adulthood. Density and proliferative capacity of dentate RGCs as well as neurogenesis were strongly reduced during childhood until 5 years, few DCX&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cells are seen in adults. The dentate gyrus of both control and AD individuals showed Nestin&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and/or GFAPδ&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cells displaying different morphologies. In conclusion, pools of morphologically, antigenically, and topographically diverse neural progenitor cells are present in the human hippocampus from early developmental stages until adulthood, including in AD patients, while their neurogenic potential seems negligible in the adult.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Computational Modeling of the Dynamic Biomarker Cascade in Alzheimer\'s Disease</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/313353v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Background: The heterogeneity and complexity of Alzheimer disease (AD) lends itself to dynamic causal modeling, a computational systems biology approach to simulate complex systems. Methods: We implemented a computational dynamic causal model (DCM) to test the common descriptive assumptions of biomarker evolution in AD. We modeled beta-amyloid, tau, neuro-degeneration and cognitive impairment as first order non-linear differential equations to include beta-amyloid dependent and non-dependent neurodegenerative cascades. We tested the DCM, by adjusting its parameters to simulate three specific simulation scenarios in early-onset autosomal dominant AD and late-onset AD, to determine whether computed biomarker trajectories agreed with current assumptions of AD progression. We also simulated the effects of anti-amyloid therapy in late-onset AD. Results: The computational model of early-onset pure AD demonstrated the initial appearance of amyloid, followed by other biomarkers of tau and neurodegeneration, followed by the onset of cognitive decline as predicted by prior literature. The model also showed the ability to vary onset of cognitive decline based on cognitive reserve. Similarly, the late-onset AD computational models demonstrated the first appearance of amyloid-related or non-amyloid-related tauopathy, depending on the magnitude of age-related comorbid pathology, and also closely matched the cascade predicted by prior literature. Forward simulation of anti-amyloid therapy in symptomatic late-onset AD failed to demonstrate any benefit on cognitive decline, consistent with prior failed clinical trials in symptomatic patients. Conclusions: To our knowledge, this is the first computational model of the dynamic biomarker cascade in autosomal dominant and late-onset AD. Such models, with refinement using actual molecular, clinical and genomic data, are an important tool towards developing a systems biology precision medicine approach for understanding and preventing AD.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Cortical spike multiplexing using gamma frequency latencies</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/313320v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>One of the fundamental problems in understanding the brain, in particular, the cerebral cortex, is that we only have a partial understanding of the basic communication protocols that underlie signal transmission. This makes it difficult to interpret the significance of particular phenomena such as basic firing patterns and oscillations at different frequencies. There are, of course, useful models. Motivated by single-cell recording technology, Poisson statistics of cortical action potentials have long been a basic component in models of signal representation in the cortex. However, it is increasingly difficult to integrate Poisson spiking with spike timing signals in the gamma frequency spectrum. A potential way forward is being sparked by new technologies that allow the exploration of very low-level communication strategies. Specifically, the voltage potential of a cell's soma now can be recorded with very high fidelity in vivo, allowing correlation of its fine structure to be correlated with behaviors. To interpret this data, we have developed a unified model (gamma spike multiplexing, or GSM) wherein a cell's somatic gamma frequencies can modulate the generation of action potentials. Such spikes can be seen as the basis for a general-purpose method of modulating fast communication in cortical networks. In particular, the model has several important advantages over traditional formalisms: 1) It allows multiple, independent processes to run in parallel, greatly increasing the processing capability of the cortex 2) Its processing speed is 100 to 1,000 times faster than population coding methods 3) Its processes are not bound to specific locations, but migrate across cortical cells as a function of time, facilitating the maintenance of cortical cell calibration.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: White Matter Network Architecture Guides Direct Electrical Stimulation Through Optimal State Transitions</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/313304v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Electrical brain stimulation is currently being investigated as a potential therapy for neurological disease. However, opportunities to optimize and personalize such therapies are challenged by the fact that the beneficial impact (and potential side effects) of focal stimulation on both neighboring and distant regions is not well understood. Here, we use network control theory to build a formal model of brain network function that makes explicit predictions about how stimulation spreads through the brain's white matter network and influences large-scale dynamics. We test these predictions using combined electrocorticography (ECoG) and diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) data from patients with medically refractory epilepsy undergoing evaluation for resective surgery, and who volunteered to participate in an extensive stimulation regimen. We posit a specific model-based manner in which white matter tracts constrain stimulation, defining its capacity to drive the brain to new states, including states associated with successful memory encoding. In a first validation of our model, we find that the true pattern of white matter tracts can be used to more accurately predict the state transitions induced by direct electrical stimulation than the artificial patterns of a topological or spatial network null model. We then use a targeted optimal control framework to solve for the optimal energy required to drive the brain to a given state. We show that, intuitively, our model predicts larger energy requirements when starting from states that are farther away from a target memory state. We then suggest testable hypotheses about which structural properties will lead to efficient stimulation for improving memory based on energy requirements. We show that the strength and homogeneity of edges between controlled and uncontrolled nodes, as well as the persistent modal controllability of the stimulated region, predict energy requirements. Our work demonstrates that individual white matter architecture plays a vital role in guiding the dynamics of direct electrical stimulation, more generally offering empirical support for the utility of network control theoretic models of brain response to stimulation.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/313213v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Dysregulation of sleep and feeding has widespread health consequences. Despite extensive epidemiological evidence for interactions between sleep and metabolic function, little is known about the neural or molecular basis underlying the integration of these processes. Drosophila melanogaster potently suppress sleep in response to starvation, and powerful genetic tools allow for mechanistic investigation of sleep-metabolism interactions. We have previously identified neurons expressing the neuropeptide leucokinin (Lk) as being required for starvation-mediated changes in sleep. Here, we demonstrate an essential role for Lk neuropeptide in metabolic regulation of sleep. Further, we find that the activity of Lk neurons is modulated by feeding state and circulating nutrients, with reduced activity in response to glucose and increased activity under starvation conditions. Both genetic silencing and laser-mediated microablation localize Lk-mediated sleep regulation to a single pair of Lk neurons within the lateral horn (LHLK) that project near primary sleep and metabolic centers of the brain. A targeted screen identified a critical role for AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) in starvation-modulated changes in sleep. Disruption of AMPK function in Lk neurons suppresses sleep and increases LHLK activity in fed flies, phenocopying the starvation state. Taken together, these findings localize feeding state-dependent regulation of sleep to a single pair of neurons within the fruit fly brain and provide a system for investigating the cellular basis of sleep-metabolism interactions.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/313015v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Multimodal imaging enables sensitive measures of the architecture and integrity of the human brain, but the complex and high-dimensional nature of advanced brain imaging features poses inherent challenges for the analyses and interpretations. Multivariate age prediction reduces the dimensionality to one biologically informative summary measure with potential for assessing deviations from normal lifespan trajectories. Whereas a number of studies have documented remarkably accurate age prediction, the differential age trajectories of distinct brain tissue classes have to a lesser extent been characterized. Exploring differential brain age models driven by tissue-specific classifiers provides a hitherto unexplored opportunity to disentangle independent sources of heterogeneity in brain biology. We trained machine-learning models to estimate brain age using various combinations of FreeSurfer based morphometry and diffusion tensor imaging based indices of white matter microstructure in a large training set (n=612, 18-87 years). Next, we applied each of the 11 models to an independent and cognitively well-characterized sample (n=265, 20-88 years) to compare the tissue-specific brain ages and their cognitive sensitivity. Correlations between true and estimated age in our test sample were highest for the most comprehensive brain morphometry (r=0.83, CI:0.78-0.86) and white matter microstructure (r=0.79, CI:0.74-0.83) models, confirming sensitivity and generalizability. The deviance from the chronological age were sensitive to performance on several cognitive tests for various models, including spatial stroop and symbol coding, indicating poorer performance in individuals with an over-estimated age. Tissue-specific brain age models provide sensitive measures of brain integrity, with implications for the study of a range of brain disorders.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Diverse homeostatic responses to visual deprivation by uncovering recurrent subnetworks</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/312926v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Multiple homeostatic plasticity mechanisms are thought to be critical for the prevention of excessively high or aberrantly low neural activity in the adult cortex. In L2/3 of adult mouse visual cortex the interplay between disinhibition and local functional interactions may support homeostatic recovery following visual deprivation. Despite blanket disinhibition only a subset of L2/3 excitatory neurons are observed to exhibit homeostatic recovery. Recovering neurons tend to be correlated with each other, forming functional networks prior to deprivation. How homeostatic recovery occurs in this way is therefore unclear, particularly in conditions of global disinhibition. Here, we employ a computational modelling approach to investigate the origin of diverse homeostatic responses in the cortex. This model finds network size to be a critical determinant of the diverse homeostatic activity profiles observed following visual deprivation, as neurons which belong to larger networks exhibit a stronger homeostatic response. Our simulations provide mechanistic insights into the emergence of diverse homeostatic responses, and predict that neurons with a high proportion of enduring functional associations will exhibit the strongest homeostatic recovery. We test and confirm these predictions experimentally.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/312819v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Background: Excessive beta oscillatory activity in the subthalamic nucleus (STN) is linked to Parkinson's disease and associated motor symptoms. However, the relationship between beta activity and motor symptoms has been inconsistent, which may influence the efficacy of closed-loop deep brain stimulation. Hypothesis: We hypothesized that this variability is due to the degree of neural noise in STN recordings. Recent evidence has shown that neural noise is influenced by multiple factors, such as development, aging and disease, and could confound measures of beta activity. In this work, we propose a model that disentangles beta oscillatory activity and neural noise in the STN power spectrum. Methods: We investigated the impact of neural noise on estimations of beta activity and motor symptoms from data recorded bilaterally from the subthalamic nuclei of thirteen Parkinsonian patients. Results: Results showed that the relationship between beta oscillatory amplitude and motor symptoms (bradykinesia and rigidity) significantly improved when neural noise was removed from the estimation of beta activity. Conclusion: These findings emphasize the importance of modeling neural components independently for understanding physiological processes associated with Parkinson's disease, and identifying better biomarkers for characterizing symptom severity. Subsequently, we predict that our findings can have a direct application for closed-loop deep brain stimulation on Parkinson's Disease.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/312629v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Cognitive reasoning is thought to require functional interactions between whole-brain networks. Such networks rely on both cerebral hemispheres, with the corpus callosum providing cross-hemispheric communication. Here we used high-field functional magnetic resonance imaging (7T fMRI), a well validated cognitive task, and brain network analyses to investigate the functional networks underlying cognitive reasoning in individuals with corpus callosum dysgenesis (CCD), an anatomical abnormality that affects the corpus callosum. Participants with CCD were asked to solve cognitive reasoning problems while their brain activity was measured using fMRI. The complexity of these problems was parametrically varied by changing the complexity of relations that needed to be established between shapes within each problem matrix. Behaviorally, participants showed a typical reduction in task performance as problem complexity increased. Task-evoked neural activity was observed in brain regions known to constitute two key cognitive control systems: the fronto-parietal and cingulo-opercular networks. Under low complexity demands, network topology and the patterns of local neural activity in the CCD group closely resembled those observed in neurotypical controls. By contrast, when asked to solve more complex problems, participants with CCD showed a reduction in neural activity and connectivity within the fronto-parietal network. These complexity-induced -- as opposed to intrinsic -- differences in functional network activity help resolve the apparent paradox between preserved network architecture found at rest in CCD individuals, and the heterogeneous deficits they display in response to cognitive task demands.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/312587v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>During non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, the neocortex and hippocampus continuously alternate between states of neuronal spiking and inactivity. To study the mechanisms of NREM alternation dynamics, we used a mean field model of a recurrent adapting neural population. Analysis of the model reveals how the interplay between recurrence, adaptation, and drive can result in four distinct regimes of alternation dynamics. By directly comparing model dynamics with experimental observations of NREM sleep, we find that the neocortical dynamics match the model in a regime in which a stable active state is interrupted by transient inactive states (slow waves) while hippocampal dynamics match the model in a regime in which a stable inactive state is interrupted by transient active states (sharp waves). We propose that during NREM sleep, hippocampal and neocortical populations are excitable: each in a stable state from which noise or perturbation can evoke the stereotyped population events that support NREM functions.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/312561v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Pharmacoresistant epilepsy is a common neurological disorder in which increased neuronal intrinsic excitability and synaptic excitation lead to pathologically synchronous behavior in the brain. In the majority of experimental and theoretical epilepsy models, epilepsy is associated with reduced inhibition in the pathological neural circuits, yet effects of intrinsic excitability are usually not explicitly analyzed. Here we present a novel neural mass model that includes intrinsic excitability in the form of spike-frequency adaptation in the excitatory population. We validated our model using local field potential data recorded from human hippocampal/subicular slices. We found that synaptic conductances and slow adaptation in the excitatory population both play essential roles for generating seizures and pre-ictal oscillations. Using bifurcation analysis, we found that transitions towards seizure and back to the resting state take place via Andronov-Hopf bifurcations. These simulations therefore suggest that single neuron adaptation as well as synaptic inhibition are responsible for orchestrating seizure dynamics and transition towards the epileptic state.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/312488v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>In order to produce movements, muscles must act through joints. The translation from muscle force to limb movement is mediated by internal joint structures that permit movement in some directions but constrain it in others. Although muscle forces acting against constrained directions will not affect limb movements, such forces can cause excess stresses and strains in joint structures, leading to pain or injury. In this study, we hypothesized that the central nervous system (CNS) chooses muscle activations to avoid excess joint stresses and strains. We evaluated this hypothesis by examining adaptation strategies after selective paralysis of a muscle acting at the rat knee. We show that the CNS compromises between restoration of task performance and regulation of joint stresses and strains. These results have significant implications to our understanding of the neural control of movements, suggesting that common theories emphasizing task performance are insufficient to explain muscle activations during behaviors.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/312298v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Gene expression studies suggest that differential ion channel expression contributes to differences in rodent versus human neuronal physiology. We tested whether h-channels more prominently contribute to the physiological properties of human compared to mouse supragranular pyramidal neurons. Single cell/nucleus RNA sequencing revealed ubiquitous HCN1-subunit expression in excitatory neurons in human, but not mouse supragranular layers. Using patch-clamp recordings, we found stronger h-channel-related membrane properties in supragranular pyramidal neurons in human temporal cortex, compared to mouse supragranular pyramidal neurons in temporal association area. The magnitude of these differences depended upon cortical depth and was largest in pyramidal neurons in deep L3. Additionally, pharmacologically blocking h-channels produced a larger change in membrane properties in human compared to mouse neurons. Finally, using biophysical modeling, we provided evidence that h-channels promote the transfer of theta frequencies from dendrite-to-soma in human L3 pyramidal neurons. Thus, h-channels contribute to between-species differences in a fundamental neuronal property.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/311514v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>In color vision, the quantitative rules for mixing lights to make a target color are well understood. By contrast, the rules for mixing odorants to make a target odor remain elusive. A solution to this problem in vision relied on characterizing the receptor responses to different wavelengths of light and subsequently relating receptor responses to perception. In olfaction, experimentally measuring the receptor response to a representative set of complex mixtures is intractable due to the vast number of possibilities. To meet this challenge, we develop a biophysical model that predicts mammalian receptor responses to complex mixtures using responses to single odorants. The dominant nonlinearity in our model is competitive binding: only one odorant molecule can attach to a receptor binding site at a time. This simple framework predicts receptor responses to mixtures of up to twelve monomolecular odorants to within 10-30% of experimental observations and provides a powerful method for leveraging limited experimental data. Simple extensions of our model describe phenomena such as synergy, overshadowing, and inhibition, suggesting that these perceptual effects can arise partly from receptor binding properties, and may not require either complex neural interactions or feedback from higher brain areas.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/309260v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>In order to obtain the sample sizes needed for robustly reproducible effects, it is often necessary to acquire data at multiple sites using different MRI scanners. This poses a challenge for investigators to account for the variance due to scanner, as balanced sampling is often not an option. Similarly, longitudinal studies must deal with known and unknown changes to scanner hardware and software over time. In this manuscript, we have explored scanner-related differences in the dataset recently released by the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) project, a multi-site, longitudinal study of children age 9-10. We demonstrate that scanner manufacturer, model, as well as the individual scanner itself, are detectable in the resting and task-based fMRI results of the ABCD dataset. We further demonstrate that these differences can be harmonized using an empirical Bayes approach known as ComBat. We argue that accounting for scanner variance, including even minor differences in scanner hardware or software, is crucial for any analysis.</content:encoded>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Neuro-Cognitive Effects of Acute Tyrosine Administration on Reactive and Proactive Response Inhibition in Healthy Older Adults</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/5/2/ENEURO.0035-17.2018?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;The aging brain is characterized by altered dopamine signaling. The amino acid tyrosine, a catecholamine precursor, is known to improve cognitive performance in young adults, especially during high environmental demands. Tyrosine administration might also affect catecholamine transmission in the aging brain, thereby improving cognitive functioning. In healthy older adults, impairments have been demonstrated in two forms of response inhibition: reactive inhibition (outright stopping) and proactive inhibition (anticipatory response slowing) under high information load. However, no study has directly compared the effects of a catecholamine precursor on reactive and load-dependent proactive inhibition. In this study we explored the effects of tyrosine on reactive and proactive response inhibition and signal in dopaminergically innervated fronto-striatal regions. Depending on age, tyrosine might lead to beneficial or detrimental neurocognitive effects. We aimed to address these hypotheses in 24 healthy older human adults (aged 61–72 years) using fMRI in a double blind, counterbalanced, placebo-controlled, within-subject design. Across the group, tyrosine did not alter reactive or proactive inhibition behaviorally but did increase fronto-parietal proactive inhibition-related activation. When taking age into account, tyrosine affected proactive inhibition both behaviorally and neurally. Specifically, increasing age was associated with a greater detrimental effect of tyrosine compared with placebo on proactive slowing. Moreover, with increasing age, tyrosine decreased fronto-striatal and parietal proactive signal, which correlated positively with tyrosine’s effects on proactive slowing. Concluding, tyrosine negatively affected proactive response slowing and associated fronto-striatal activation in an age-dependent manner, highlighting the importance of catecholamines, perhaps particularly dopamine, for proactive response inhibition in older adults.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Unveiling Stimulation Secrets of Electrical Excitation of Neural Tissue Using a Circuit Probability Theory. (arXiv:1804.11310v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1804.11310</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A new theory, named the Circuit-Probability theory, is proposed to unveil the
secret of electrical nerve stimulation, essentially explain the nonlinear and
resonant phenomena observed when neural and non-neural tissues are electrically
stimulated. For the explanation of frequency dependent response, an inductor is
involved in the neural circuit model. Furthermore, predicted response to varied
stimulation strength is calculated stochastically. Based on this theory, many
empirical models, such as strength-duration relationship and LNP model, can be
theoretically explained, derived, and amended. This theory can explain the
complex nonlinear interactions in electrical stimulation and fit in vivo
experiment data on stimulation-responses of many experiments. As such, the C-P
theory should be able to guide novel experiments and more importantly, offer an
in-depth physical understanding of the neural tissue. As a promising neural
model, we can even further explore the more accurate circuit configuration and
probability equation to better describe the electrical stimulation of neural
tissues in the future.

	<content:encoded>Efforts to parcellate the cortex into areas based on fine-scale anatomical signatures (e.g., cytoarchitectonics) date back to the early years of the last century. In the ensuing decades, rapidly growing knowledge of cortical connections encouraged neurobiologists to search for connectivity-based principles underlying the organization of the cerebral cortex. Using such an approach, Felleman and Van Essen presented, in their 1991 paper, a connectivity-based hierarchical principle dictating the relationship between cortical areas.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>In 2001 Raichle and colleagues showed that, at rest, brain activity fluctuates near a metabolically active equilibrium: a ‘default mode’ of brain function. This finding broke ranks with the prevailing ‘task–rest’ dichotomy to position the brain as continuously active, balancing the deployment of resources according to current and anticipated needs.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Spinal cord repair research appeared to have run out of new ideas in the 1970s. In a 1981 paper, the Aguayo Laboratory revisited an experiment by Tello and Cajal that suggested that central nervous system (CNS) axons could regenerate into peripheral nerve grafts. Using modern axon tracing methods, David and Aguayo showed that axons from neurons in the spinal cord could regenerate for long distances within peripheral nervous system (PNS) grafts, but not back into the CNS. This proved that damaged CNS tissue is inhibitory to axon regeneration while PNS tissue is permissive.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/312389v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>In all animals, the successful orchestration of motor programs hinges on appropriate coupling between components of the system, from neural circuit dynamics, through muscles and body properties to the physical environment. We study this coupling in undulatory locomotion, with a view to better understanding the relative roles of central and reflex-driven control. We ask how the coupling between neural control and body mechanics is affected by sensory inputs during undulatory locomotion in C. elegans. To address this question, we use a biomechanical simulation framework, within which we separately model feed-forward and feedback controlled undulations. We characterize neuromechanical phase lag and locomotion speed using body stiffness as a control parameter. We show that sensory entrainment can suppress neuromechanical phase lag, that would otherwise emerge under centrally generated feed-forward control.</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Quantitative analysis reveals crosstalk mechanisms of heat shock-induced attenuation of NF-κB signaling at the single cell level</title>

Elevated temperature induces the heat shock (HS) response, which modulates cell proliferation, apoptosis, the immune and inflammatory responses. However, specific mechanisms linking the HS response pathways to major cellular signaling systems are not fully understood. Here we used integrated computational and experimental approaches to quantitatively analyze the crosstalk mechanisms between the HS-response and a master regulator of inflammation, cell proliferation, and apoptosis the Nuclear Factor κB (NF-κB) system. We found that populations of human osteosarcoma cells, exposed to a clinically relevant 43°C HS had an attenuated NF-κB p65 response to Tumor Necrosis Factor α (TNFα) treatment. The degree of inhibition of the NF-κB response depended on the HS exposure time. Mathematical modeling of single cells indicated that individual crosstalk mechanisms differentially encode HS-mediated NF-κB responses while being consistent with the observed population-level responses. In particular “all-or-nothing” encoding mechanisms were involved in the HS-dependent regulation of the IKK activity and IκBα phosphorylation, while others involving transport were “analogue”. In order to discriminate between these mechanisms, we used live-cell imaging of nuclear translocations of the NF-κB p65 subunit. The single cell responses exhibited “all-or-nothing” encoding. While most cells did not respond to TNFα stimulation after a 60 min HS, 27% showed responses similar to those not receiving HS. We further demonstrated experimentally and theoretically that the predicted inhibition of IKK activity was consistent with the observed HS-dependent depletion of the IKKα and IKKβ subunits in whole cell lysates. However, a combination of “all-or-nothing” crosstalk mechanisms was required to completely recapitulate the single cell data. We postulate therefore that the heterogeneity of the single cell responses might be explained by the cell-intrinsic variability of HS-modulated IKK signaling. In summary, we show that high temperature modulates NF-κB responses in single cells in a complex and unintuitive manner, which needs to be considered in hyperthermia-based treatment strategies.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/SmfXbHv2meA&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Automated evaluation of quaternary structures from protein crystals</title>

A correct assessment of the quaternary structure of proteins is a fundamental prerequisite to understanding their function, physico-chemical properties and mode of interaction with other proteins. Currently about 90% of structures in the Protein Data Bank are crystal structures, in which the correct quaternary structure is embedded in the crystal lattice among a number of crystal contacts. Computational methods are required to 1) classify all protein-protein contacts in crystal lattices as biologically relevant or crystal contacts and 2) provide an assessment of how the biologically relevant interfaces combine into a biological assembly. In our previous work we addressed the first problem with our EPPIC (Evolutionary Protein Protein Interface Classifier) method. Here, we present our solution to the second problem with a new method that combines the interface classification results with symmetry and topology considerations. The new algorithm enumerates all possible valid assemblies within the crystal using a graph representation of the lattice and predicts the most probable biological unit based on the pairwise interface scoring. Our method achieves 85% precision (ranging from 76% to 90% for different oligomeric types) on a new dataset of 1,481 biological assemblies with consensus of PDB annotations. Although almost the same precision is achieved by PISA, currently the most popular quaternary structure assignment method, we show that, due to the fundamentally different approach to the problem, the two methods are complementary and could be combined to improve biological assembly assignments. The software for the automatic assessment of protein assemblies (EPPIC version 3) has been made available through a web server at http://www.eppic-web.org.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/I193wKcTvyY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Understanding complexity in physical, biological, social and information systems is predicated on describing interactions amongst different components. Advances in genomics are facilitating the high-throughput identification of molecular interactions, and graphs are emerging as indispensable tools in explaining how the connections in the network drive organismal phenotypic plasticity. Here, we describe the architectural organization and associated emergent topological properties of gene regulatory networks (GRNs) that describe protein-DNA interactions (PDIs) in several model eukaryotes. By analyzing GRN connectivity, our results show that the anticipated scale-free network architectures are characterized by organism-specific power law scaling exponents. These exponents are independent of the fraction of the GRN experimentally sampled, enabling prediction of properties of the complete GRN for an organism. We further demonstrate that the exponents describe inequalities in transcription factor (TF)-target gene recognition across GRNs. These observations have the important biological implication that they predict the existence of an intrinsic organism-specific &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt; and/or &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt; regulatory landscape that constrains GRN topologies. Consequently, architectural GRN organization drives not only phenotypic plasticity within a species, but is also likely implicated in species-specific phenotype.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/6xXxhGM4T7U&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Estimation of the dispersal distances of an aphid-borne virus in a patchy landscape</title>

Characterising the spatio-temporal dynamics of pathogens &lt;i&gt;in natura&lt;/i&gt; is key to ensuring their efficient prevention and control. However, it is notoriously difficult to estimate dispersal parameters at scales that are relevant to real epidemics. Epidemiological surveys can provide informative data, but parameter estimation can be hampered when the timing of the epidemiological events is uncertain, and in the presence of interactions between disease spread, surveillance, and control. Further complications arise from imperfect detection of disease and from the huge number of data on individual hosts arising from landscape-level surveys. Here, we present a Bayesian framework that overcomes these barriers by integrating over associated uncertainties in a model explicitly combining the processes of disease dispersal, surveillance and control. Using a novel computationally efficient approach to account for patch geometry, we demonstrate that disease dispersal distances can be estimated accurately in a patchy (i.e. fragmented) landscape when disease control is ongoing. Applying this model to data for an aphid-borne virus (&lt;i&gt;Plum pox virus&lt;/i&gt;) surveyed for 15 years in 605 orchards, we obtain the first estimate of the distribution of flight distances of infectious aphids at the landscape scale. About 50% of aphid flights terminate beyond 90 m, which implies that most infectious aphids leaving a tree land outside the bounds of a 1-ha orchard. Moreover, long-distance flights are not rare–10% of flights exceed 1 km. By their impact on our quantitative understanding of winged aphid dispersal, these results can inform the design of management strategies for plant viruses, which are mainly aphid-borne.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/6RNe0Vdqjuk&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>RSS PAP: Attention Effects on Neural Population Representations for Shape and Location Are Stronger in the Ventral than Dorsal Stream</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0371-17.2018v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;We examined how attention causes neural population representations of shape and location to change in AIT (ventral stream) and LIP (dorsal stream). Monkeys performed two identical delayed-match-to-sample tasks, attending either to shape or location. In AIT, shapes were more discriminable when directing attention to shape rather than location, measured by an increase in mean distance between population response vectors. In LIP, attending to location rather than shape did not increase the discriminability of different stimulus locations. Even when factoring out the change in mean vector response distance, multidimensional scaling still showed a significant task difference in AIT, but not LIP, indicating that beyond increasing discriminability, attention also causes a nonlinear warping of representation space in AIT. Despite single-cell attentional modulations in both areas, our data show that attentional modulations of population representations are weaker in dorsal stream, likely due to a need to maintain veridical representations for visuomotor control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Disruption of &lt;i&gt;attention&lt;/i&gt; is a fundamental characteristic of many human disorders. Although much work has focused on how attention to shape and space modulates responses at a single neuron level, that has provided little insight into how these modulations translate into effects at the population level. Similar to prior findings, we show attentional modulations at the single-cell level in both ventral and dorsal cortical areas. However, we also show that attention alters population representations of both shape and space more strongly the ventral stream than in the dorsal stream. This study is a first demonstration of how attention modulates the organization of high-dimensional neurophysiological representations, findings that help link cellular attentional modulations more tightly with behavior.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Human Augmentation (HA) spans several technical fields and methodological
approaches, including Experimental Psychology, Human-Computer Interaction,
Psychophysiology, and Artificial Intelligence. Augmentation involves various
strategies for optimizing and controlling cognitive states, which requires an
understanding of biological plasticity, dynamic cognitive processes, and models
of adaptive systems. As an instructive lesson, we will explore a few HA-related
concepts and outstanding issues. Next, we focus on inducing and controlling HA
using experimental methods by introducing three techniques for HA
implementation: learning augmentation, augmentation using physical media, and
extended phenotype modeling. To conclude, we will review integrative approaches
to augmentation, which transcend specific functions.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1804.10508</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;To understand consciousness within the framework of natural science we must
acknowledge the role of energy in the brain. Many contemporary neuroscientists
regard the brain as an information processor. However, evidence from brain
imaging experiments demonstrates that the brain is actually a voracious
consumer of energy, and that functionality is intimately tied to metabolism.
Maintaining a critical level of energy in the brain is required to sustain
consciousness, and the organisation of this energy distinguishes conscious from
unconscious states. Meanwhile, contemporary physicists often regard energy as
an abstract mathematical property. But this view neglects energy's causal
efficacy and actuality, as identified by Aristotle and later appreciated by
many important biologists, psychologists and physicists. By reconsidering the
nature of energy and recasting its role in neural activity, we arrive at a
theory of consciousness that is consistent with the laws of physics, chemistry
and biology. The argument draws on the integrated information theory (IIT)
developed by Tononi et al. but reinterprets their findings from the perspective
of energy exchange. In IIT, the conscious state in a system, such as a brain,
is defined by the quantity of integrated differences, or information, it
contains. According to the approach outlined here, it is in the nature of
energy to manifest differences of motion and tension. The level of complexity
of the energy differences in a system determines its conscious state.
Consciousness occurs because, in Nagel's terminology, there is 'something it is
like' to be a sufficiently complex state of energy differences.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Method to assess the functional role of noisy brain signals by mining envelope dynamics. (arXiv:1804.10454v1 [eess.SP])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1804.10454</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Data-driven spatial filtering approaches are commonly used to assess rhythmic
brain activity from multichannel recordings such as electroencephalography
(EEG). As spatial filter estimation is prone to noise, non-stationarity effects
and limited data, a high model variability induced by slight changes of, e.g.,
involved hyperparameters is generally encountered. These aspects challenge the
assessment of functionally relevant features which are of special importance in
closed-loop applications as, e.g., in the field of rehabilitation. We propose a
data-driven method to identify groups of reliable and functionally relevant
oscillatory components computed by a spatial filtering approach. Therefore, we
initially embrace the variability of decoding models in a large configuration
space before condensing information by density-based clustering of components'
functional signatures. Exemplified for a hand force task with rich within-trial
structure, the approach was evaluated on EEG data of 18 healthy subjects. We
found that functional characteristics of single components are revealed by
distinct temporal dynamics of their event-related power changes. Based on a
within-subject analysis, our clustering revealed seven groups of homogeneous
envelope dynamics on average. To support introspection by practitioners, we
provide a set of metrics to characterize and validate single clusterings. We
show that identified clusters contain components of strictly confined frequency
ranges, dominated by the alpha and beta band. Our method is applicable to any
spatial filtering algorithm. Despite high model variability, it allows
capturing and monitoring relevant oscillatory features. We foresee its
application in closed-loop applications such as brain-computer interface based
protocols in stroke rehabilitation.

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Effects of growth rate, cell size, motion, and elemental stoichiometry on nutrient transport kinetics</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/CoNucHdd8IM/article</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Kevin J. Flynn, David O. F. Skibinski, Christian Lindemann&lt;/p&gt;

Nutrient acquisition is a critical determinant for the competitive advantage for auto- and osmohetero- trophs alike. Nutrient limited growth is commonly described on a whole cell basis through reference to a maximum growth rate (&lt;i&gt;G&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;) and a half-saturation constant (&lt;i&gt;K&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;G&lt;/sub&gt;). This empirical application of a Michaelis-Menten like description ignores the multiple underlying feedbacks between physiology contributing to growth, cell size, elemental stoichiometry and cell motion. Here we explore these relationships with reference to the kinetics of the nutrient transporter protein, the transporter rate density at the cell surface (&lt;i&gt;TRD&lt;/i&gt;; potential transport rate per unit plasma-membrane area), and diffusion gradients. While the half saturation value for the limiting nutrient increases rapidly with cell size, significant mitigation is afforded by cell motion (swimming or sedimentation), and by decreasing the cellular carbon density. There is thus potential for high vacuolation and high sedimentation rates in diatoms to significantly decrease &lt;i&gt;K&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;G&lt;/sub&gt; and increase species competitive advantage. Our results also suggest that &lt;i&gt;G&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; for larger non-diatom protists may be constrained by rates of nutrient transport. For a given carbon density, cell size and &lt;i&gt;TRD&lt;/i&gt;, the value of &lt;i&gt;G&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;i&gt;/K&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;G&lt;/sub&gt; remains constant. This implies that species or strains with a lower &lt;i&gt;G&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; might coincidentally have a competitive advantage under nutrient limited conditions as they also express lower values of &lt;i&gt;K&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;G&lt;/sub&gt;. The ability of cells to modulate the &lt;i&gt;TRD&lt;/i&gt; according to their nutritional status, and hence change the instantaneous maximum transport rate, has a very marked effect upon transport and growth kinetics. Analyses and dynamic models that do not consider such modulation will inevitably fail to properly reflect competitive advantage in nutrient acquisition. This has important implications for the accurate representation and predictive capabilities of model applications, in particular in a changing environment.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/CoNucHdd8IM&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

RosettaAntibodyDesign (RAbD) samples the diverse sequence, structure, and binding space of an antibody to an antigen in highly customizable protocols for the design of antibodies in a broad range of applications. The program samples antibody sequences and structures by grafting structures from a widely accepted set of the canonical clusters of CDRs (North et al., &lt;i&gt;J&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;Mol&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;Biol&lt;/i&gt;., 406:228–256, 2011). It then performs sequence design according to amino acid sequence profiles of each cluster, and samples CDR backbones using a flexible-backbone design protocol incorporating cluster-based CDR constraints. Starting from an existing experimental or computationally modeled antigen-antibody structure, RAbD can be used to redesign a single CDR or multiple CDRs with loops of different length, conformation, and sequence. We rigorously benchmarked RAbD on a set of 60 diverse antibody–antigen complexes, using two design strategies—optimizing total Rosetta energy and optimizing interface energy alone. We utilized two novel metrics for measuring success in computational protein design. The design risk ratio (DRR) is equal to the frequency of recovery of native CDR lengths and clusters divided by the frequency of sampling of those features during the Monte Carlo design procedure. Ratios greater than 1.0 indicate that the design process is picking out the native more frequently than expected from their sampled rate. We achieved DRRs for the non-H3 CDRs of between 2.4 and 4.0. The antigen risk ratio (ARR) is the ratio of frequencies of the native amino acid types, CDR lengths, and clusters in the output decoys for simulations performed in the presence and absence of the antigen. For CDRs, we achieved cluster ARRs as high as 2.5 for L1 and 1.5 for H2. For sequence design simulations without CDR grafting, the overall recovery for the native amino acid types for residues that contact the antigen in the native structures was 72% in simulations performed in the presence of the antigen and 48% in simulations performed without the antigen, for an ARR of 1.5. For the non-contacting residues, the ARR was 1.08. This shows that the sequence profiles are able to maintain the amino acid types of these conserved, buried sites, while recovery of the exposed, contacting residues requires the presence of the antigen-antibody interface. We tested RAbD experimentally on both a lambda and kappa antibody–antigen complex, successfully improving their affinities 10 to 50 fold by replacing individual CDRs of the native antibody with new CDR lengths and clusters.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/PVAny09_uEE&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Material and shape perception based on two types of intensity gradient information</title>

Visual estimation of the material and shape of an object from a single image includes a hard ill-posed computational problem. However, in our daily life we feel we can estimate both reasonably well. The neural computation underlying this ability remains poorly understood. Here we propose that the human visual system uses different aspects of object images to separately estimate the contributions of the material and shape. Specifically, material perception relies mainly on the intensity gradient magnitude information, while shape perception relies mainly on the intensity gradient order information. A clue to this hypothesis was provided by the observation that luminance-histogram manipulation, which changes luminance gradient magnitudes but not the luminance-order map, effectively alters the material appearance but not the shape of an object. In agreement with this observation, we found that the simulated physical material changes do not significantly affect the intensity order information. A series of psychophysical experiments further indicate that human surface shape perception is robust against intensity manipulations provided they do not disturb the intensity order information. In addition, we show that the two types of gradient information can be utilized for the discrimination of albedo changes from highlights. These findings suggest that the visual system relies on these diagnostic image features to estimate physical properties in a distal world.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/hiqJxpkZuOw&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>RSS PAP: Circadian and Brain State Modulation of Network Hyperexcitability in Alzheimers Disease</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0426-17.2018v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Network hyperexcitability is a feature of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) as well as numerous transgenic mouse models of AD. While hyperexcitability in AD patients and AD animal models share certain features, the mechanistic overlap remains to be established. We aimed to identify features of network hyperexcitability in AD models that can be related to epileptiform activity signatures in AD patients. We studied network hyperexcitability in mice expressing amyloid precursor protein (APP) with mutations that cause familial AD, and compared a transgenic model that overexpresses human APP (J20), to a knock-in model expressing APP at physiological levels (APP&lt;sup&gt;NL/F&lt;/sup&gt;). We recorded continuous long-term electrocorticogram activity from mice, and studied modulation by circadian cycle, behavioural, and brain state. We report that while J20s exhibit frequent inter-ictal spikes (IIS), APP&lt;sup&gt;NL/F&lt;/sup&gt; mice do not. In J20 mice, IIS were most prevalent during daylight hours and the circadian modulation was associated with sleep. Further analysis of brain state revealed that IIS in J20s are associated with features of rapid-eye movement (REM) sleep. We found no evidence of cholinergic changes that may contribute to IIS-circadian coupling in J20s. In contrast to J20s, intracranial recordings capturing IIS in AD patients demonstrated frequent IIS in non-REM sleep. The salient differences in sleep-stage coupling of IIS in APP overexpressing mice and AD patients suggests that different mechanisms may underlie network hyperexcitability in mice and humans. We posit that sleep-stage coupling of IIS should be an important consideration in identifying mouse AD models that most closely recapitulate network hyperexcitability in human AD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; It is increasingly recognized that Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is associated with hyperexcitability in brain networks. Brain network hyperexcitability is also reported in several rodent models of AD. We studied the signatures of this hyperexcitability in two rodent models of AD as well as AD patients. Network hyperexcitability was prevalent in a transgenic model of AD, but was absent in a rodent model that is considered to be more physiologic. Moreover, while network hyperexcitability was coupled to rapid-eye movement (REM) sleep in transgenic mice, hyperexcitability occurred in non-REM sleep in AD patients. We suggest that brain state coupling of hyperexcitability can be used as a method for screening animal models of AD.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;The cerebral cortex is subdivided into distinct areas that have particular functions. The rostrocaudal (R-C) gradient of fibroblast growth factor 8 (FGF8) signaling defines this areal identity during neural development. In this study, we recapitulated cortical R-C patterning in human pluripotent stem cell (PSC) cultures. Modulation of FGF8 signaling appropriately regulated the R-C markers, and the patterns of global gene expression resembled those of the corresponding areas of human fetal brains. Furthermore, we demonstrated the utility of this culture system in modeling the area-specific forebrain phenotypes [presumptive upper motor neuron (UMN) phenotypes] of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). We anticipate that our culture system will contribute to studies of human neurodevelopment and neurological disease modeling.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: A Dynamic Connectome Supports the Emergence of Stable Computational Function of Neural Circuits through Reward-Based Learning</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/5/2/ENEURO.0301-17.2018?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Synaptic connections between neurons in the brain are dynamic because of continuously ongoing spine dynamics, axonal sprouting, and other processes. In fact, it was recently shown that the spontaneous synapse-autonomous component of spine dynamics is at least as large as the component that depends on the history of pre- and postsynaptic neural activity. These data are inconsistent with common models for network plasticity and raise the following questions: how can neural circuits maintain a stable computational function in spite of these continuously ongoing processes, and what could be functional uses of these ongoing processes? Here, we present a rigorous theoretical framework for these seemingly stochastic spine dynamics and rewiring processes in the context of reward-based learning tasks. We show that spontaneous synapse-autonomous processes, in combination with reward signals such as dopamine, can explain the capability of networks of neurons in the brain to configure themselves for specific computational tasks, and to compensate automatically for later changes in the network or task. Furthermore, we show theoretically and through computer simulations that stable computational performance is compatible with continuously ongoing synapse-autonomous changes. After reaching good computational performance it causes primarily a slow drift of network architecture and dynamics in task-irrelevant dimensions, as observed for neural activity in motor cortex and other areas. On the more abstract level of reinforcement learning the resulting model gives rise to an understanding of reward-driven network plasticity as continuous sampling of network configurations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Retinal degenerations are a major cause of vision impairment and blindness. Neuroprotective therapy is a promising therapeutic strategy for retinal degenerative diseases. We investigated a novel neurotrophic factor mesencephalic astrocyte-derived neurotrophic factor (MANF) in the retina. MANF is expressed at a high level during postnatal development and the expression declines to a lower level as the retina matures. Müller cells are the major cells expressing MANF. It is also found in the retinal ganglion cells, in the inner nuclear layer (INL) neurons, and in retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells. Intravitreal injection of recombinant human (rh)MANF significantly protected rod and cone photoreceptors in rats carrying the rhodopsin S334ter mutation, and preserved electroretinograms (ERGs) in the &lt;i&gt;rd10&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;Pde6b&lt;sup&gt;rd10/rd10&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt;) mice. These results indicate that MANF is a native protein in the retina and is a potent neurotrophic factor for photoreceptor protection.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/5/2/ENEURO.0023-18.2018?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Specialized brain structures encode spatial locations and movements, yet there is growing evidence that this information is also represented in the rodent medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). Disambiguating such information from the encoding of other types of task-relevant information has proven challenging. To determine the extent to which movement and location information is relevant to mPFC neurons, tetrodes were used to record neuronal activity while limb positions, poses (i.e., recurring constellations of limb positions), velocity, and spatial locations were simultaneously recorded with two cameras every 200 ms as rats freely roamed in an experimental enclosure. Regression analyses using generalized linear models revealed that more than half of the individual mPFC neurons were significantly responsive to at least one of the factors, and many were responsive to more than one. On the other hand, each factor accounted for only a very small portion of the total spike count variance of any given neuron (&amp;lt;20% and typically &amp;lt;1%). Machine learning methods were used to analyze ensemble activity and revealed that ensembles were usually superior to the sum of the best neurons in encoding movements and spatial locations. Because movement and location encoding by individual neurons was so weak, it may not be such a concern for single-neuron analyses. Yet because these weak signals were so widely distributed across the population, this information was strongly represented at the ensemble level and should be considered in population analyses.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Firing of Putative Dopamine Neurons in Ventral Tegmental Area Is Modulated by Probability of Success during Performance of a Stop-Change Task</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/5/2/ENEURO.0007-18.2018?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Response inhibition, the ability to refrain from unwanted actions, is an essential component of complex behavior and is often impaired across numerous neuropsychiatric disorders such as addiction, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), schizophrenia, and obsessive-compulsive disorder. Accordingly, much research has been devoted to characterizing brain regions responsible for the regulation of response inhibition. The stop-signal task, a task in which animals are required to inhibit a prepotent response in the presence of a STOP cue, is one of the most well-studied tasks of response inhibition. While pharmacological evidence suggests that dopamine (DA) contributes to the regulation of response inhibition, what is exactly encoded by DA neurons during performance of response inhibition tasks is unknown. To address this issue, we recorded from single units in the ventral tegmental area (VTA), while rats performed a stop-change task. We found that putative DA neurons fired less and higher to cues and reward on STOP trials relative to GO trials, respectively, and that firing was reduced during errors. These results suggest that DA neurons in VTA encode the uncertainty associated with the probability of obtaining reward on difficult trials instead of the saliency associated with STOP cues or the need to resolve conflict between competing responses during response inhibition.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

methods in several areas of neuroscience research. The hippocampal interneuron
characterization technology has achieved rapid development in recent years.
However, capturing true neuronal features for accurate interneuron

novel global preserving estimate algorithm is used to capture the non-linearity
in the features of hippocampal interneurons after factor Algorithm. Our results
provide evidence for the effective integration of the original linear and
nonlinear neuronal features and achieves better characterization performance on
multiple hippocampal interneuron databases through array matching.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1804.10090</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The role of synchronous firing in sensory coding and cognition remains
controversial. While studies, focusing on its mechanistic consequences in
attentional tasks, suggest that synchronization dynamically boosts sensory
processing, others failed to find significant synchronization in such tasks. We
attempt to understand both lines of evidence within a coherent theoretical
framework. We conceptualize synchronization as an independent control parameter
to study how the postsynaptic neuron transmits the average firing activity of a
presynaptic population, in the presence of synchronization. We apply the
Berger-Levy theory of energy efficient information transmission to interpret
simulations of a Hodgkin-Huxley-type postsynaptic neuron model, where we varied
independently the firing rate and synchronization level in the presynaptic
population. We find that for a fixed presynaptic firing rate the simulated
postsynaptic interspike interval distribution depends on the synchronization
level and is well-described by a generalized extreme value distribution. For
synchronization levels of 15% to 50%, we find that the optimal distribution of
presynaptic firing rate, maximizing the mutual information per unit cost, is
maximized at ~30% synchronization level. These results suggest that the
statistics and energy efficiency of neuronal communication channels, through
which the input rate is communicated, can be dynamically adapted by the

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1804.09844</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Versatile, sterically accessible imaging systems capable of in vivo rapid
volumetric functional and structural imaging deep in the brain continue to be a
limiting factor in neuroscience research. Towards overcoming this obstacle, we
present integrated one- and two-photon scanned oblique plane illumination
(SOPi) microscopy which uses a single front-facing microscope objective to
provide light-sheet scanning based rapid volumetric imaging capability at
subcellular resolution. Our planar scan-mirror based optimized light-sheet
architecture allows for non-distorted scanning of volume samples, simplifying
accurate reconstruction of the imaged volume. Integration of both one-photon
(1P) and two-photon (2P) light-sheet microscopy in the same system allows for
easy selection between rapid volumetric imaging and higher resolution imaging
in scattering media. Using SOPi, we demonstrate deep, large volume imaging
capability inside scattering mouse brain sections and rapid imaging speeds up
to 10 volumes per second in zebrafish larvae expressing genetically encoded
fluorescent proteins GFP or GCaMP6s. SOPi flexibility and steric access makes
it adaptable for numerous imaging applications and broadly compatible with
orthogonal techniques for actuating or interrogating neuronal structure and
activity.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Particle-filtering approaches for nonlinear Bayesian decoding of neuronal spike trains. (arXiv:1804.09739v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1804.09739</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The number of neurons that can be simultaneously recorded doubles every seven
years. This ever increasing number of recorded neurons opens up the possibility
to address new questions and extract higher dimensional stimuli from the
recordings. Modeling neural spike trains as point processes, this task of
extracting dynamical signals from spike trains is commonly set in the context
of nonlinear filtering theory. Particle filter methods relying on importance
weights are generic algorithms that solve the filtering task numerically, but
exhibit a serious drawback when the problem dimensionality is high: they are
known to suffer from the 'curse of dimensionality' (COD), i.e. the number of
particles required for a certain performance scales exponentially with the
observable dimensions. Here, we first briefly review the theory on filtering
with point process observations in continuous time. Based on this theory, we
investigate both analytically and numerically the reason for the COD of
weighted particle filtering approaches: Similarly to particle filtering with
continuous-time observations, the COD with point-process observations is due to
the decay of effective number of particles, an effect that is stronger when the
number of observable dimensions increases. Given the success of unweighted
particle filtering approaches in overcoming the COD for continuous- time
observations, we introduce an unweighted particle filter for point-process
observations, the spike-based Neural Particle Filter (sNPF), and show that it
exhibits a similar favorable scaling as the number of dimensions grows.
Further, we derive rules for the parameters of the sNPF from a maximum
likelihood approach learning. We finally employ a simple decoding task to
illustrate the capabilities of the sNPF and to highlight one possible future
application of our inference and learning algorithm.

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Dynamic Patterns of Spontaneous Ongoing Activity in the Visual Cortex of Anesthetized and Awake Monkeys are Different</title>

	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Ongoing internal cortical activity plays a major role in perception and behavior both in animals and humans. Previously we have shown that spontaneous patterns resembling orientation-maps appear over large cortical areas in the primary visual-cortex of anesthetized cats. However, it remains unknown 1) whether spontaneous-activity in the primate also displays similar patterns and 2) whether a significant difference exists between cortical ongoing-activity in the anesthetized and awake primate. We explored these questions by combining voltage-sensitive-dye imaging with multiunit and local-field-potential recordings. Spontaneously emerging orientation and ocular-dominance maps, spanning up to 6 × 6 mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, were readily observed in anesthetized but not in awake monkeys. Nevertheless, spontaneous correlated-activity involving orientation-domains was observed in awake monkeys. Under both anesthetized and awake conditions, spontaneous correlated-activity coincided with traveling waves. We found that spontaneous activity resembling orientation-maps in awake animals spans smaller cortical areas in each instance, but over time it appears across all of V1. Furthermore, in the awake monkey, our results suggest that the synaptic strength had been completely reorganized including connections between dissimilar elements of the functional architecture. These findings lend support to the notion that ongoing-activity has many more fast switching representations playing an important role in cortical function and behavior.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;While it is well known that netrin-1 and its receptors UNC5 and UNC40 family members are involved in the normal establishment of the motor cortex and its corticospinal tract, less is known about its other receptor Down syndrome cell adherence molecule (DSCAM). DSCAM is expressed in the developing motor cortex, regulates axonal outgrowth of cortical neurons, and its mutation impairs the dendritic arborization of cortical neurons, thus suggesting that it might be involved in the normal development and functioning of the motor cortex. In comparison to WT littermates, DSCAM&lt;sup&gt;2J&lt;/sup&gt; mutant mice slipped and misplaced their paw while walking on the rungs of a horizontal ladder, and exhibited more difficulties in stepping over an obstacle while walking at slow speed. Anterograde tracing showed a normal pyramidal decussation and corticospinal projection, but a more dorsal distribution of their axonal terminals in the spinal gray matter. Intracortical microstimulations showed a reduced corticospinal and intracortical efficacy, whereas stimulations of the pyramidal tract revealed a normal spinal efficacy and excitability of corticospinal tract axons, thus arguing for a dysfunctional cortical development. Our study reveals impairment of the network dynamics within the motor cortex, reducing corticospinal drive and impairing voluntary locomotor functions upon DSCAM&lt;sup&gt;2J&lt;/sup&gt; mutation.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

The circuit organization within the mammalian brainstem respiratory network, specifically within and between the pre-Bötzinger (pre-BötC) and Bötzinger (BötC) complexes, and the roles of these circuits in respiratory pattern generation are continuously debated. We address these issues with a combination of optogenetic experiments and modeling studies. We used transgenic mice expressing channelrhodopsin-2 under the VGAT-promoter to investigate perturbations of respiratory circuit activity by site-specific photostimulation of inhibitory neurons within the pre-BötC or BötC. The stimulation effects were dependent on the intensity and phase of the photostimulation. Specifically: (1) Low intensity (≤ 1.0 mW) pulses delivered to the pre-BötC during inspiration did not terminate activity, whereas stronger stimulations (≥ 2.0 mW) terminated inspiration. (2) When the pre-BötC stimulation ended in or was applied during expiration, rebound activation of inspiration occurred after a fixed latency. (3) Relatively weak sustained stimulation (20 Hz, 0.5–2.0 mW) of pre-BötC inhibitory neurons increased respiratory frequency, while a further increase of stimulus intensity (&amp;gt; 3.0 mW) reduced frequency and finally (≥ 5.0 mW) terminated respiratory oscillations. (4) Single pulses (0.2–5.0 s) applied to the BötC inhibited rhythmic activity for the duration of the stimulation. (5) Sustained stimulation (20 Hz, 0.5–3.0 mW) of the BötC reduced respiratory frequency and finally led to apnea. We have revised our computational model of pre-BötC and BötC microcircuits by incorporating an additional population of post-inspiratory inhibitory neurons in the pre-BötC that interacts with other neurons in the network. This model was able to reproduce the above experimental findings as well as previously published results of optogenetic activation of pre-BötC or BötC neurons obtained by other laboratories. The proposed organization of pre-BötC and BötC circuits leads to testable predictions about their specific roles in respiratory pattern generation and provides important insights into key circuit interactions operating within brainstem respiratory networks.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/2-EXg_xghbA&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Effects of spatiotemporal HSV-2 lesion dynamics and antiviral treatment on the risk of HIV-1 acquisition</title>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Catherine M. Byrne, Soren Gantt, Daniel Coombs&lt;/p&gt;

Patients with Herpes Simplex Virus-2 (HSV-2) infection face a significantly higher risk of contracting HIV-1. This is thought to be due to herpetic lesions serving as entry points for HIV-1 and tissue-resident CD4+ T cell counts increasing during HSV-2 lesional events. We have created a stochastic and spatial mathematical model describing the dynamics of HSV-2 infection and immune response in the genital mucosa. Using our model, we first study the dynamics of a developing HSV-2 lesion. We then use our model to quantify the risk of infection with HIV-1 following sexual exposure in HSV-2 positive women. Untreated, we find that HSV-2 infected women are up to 8.6 times more likely to acquire HIV-1 than healthy patients. However, when including the effects of the HSV-2 antival drug, pritelivir, the risk of HIV-1 infection is predicted to decrease by up to 35%, depending on drug dosage. We estimate the relative importance of decreased tissue damage versus decreased CD4+ cell presence in determining the effectiveness of pritelivir in reducing HIV-1 infection. Our results suggest that clinical trials should be performed to evaluate the effectiveness of pritelivir or similar agents in preventing HIV-1 infection in HSV-2 positive women.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/gAxRWv6Wb-g&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Mechanical unfolding reveals stable 3-helix intermediates in talin and α-catenin</title>

Mechanical stability is a key feature in the regulation of structural scaffolding proteins and their functions. Despite the abundance of α-helical structures among the human proteome and their undisputed importance in health and disease, the fundamental principles of their behavior under mechanical load are poorly understood. Talin and α-catenin are two key molecules in focal adhesions and adherens junctions, respectively. In this study, we used a combination of atomistic steered molecular dynamics (SMD) simulations, polyprotein engineering, and single-molecule atomic force microscopy (smAFM) to investigate unfolding of these proteins. SMD simulations revealed that talin rod α-helix bundles as well as α-catenin α-helix domains unfold through stable 3-helix intermediates. While the 5-helix bundles were found to be mechanically stable, a second stable conformation corresponding to the 3-helix state was revealed. Mechanically weaker 4-helix bundles easily unfolded into a stable 3-helix conformation. The results of smAFM experiments were in agreement with the findings of the computational simulations. The disulfide clamp mutants, (resistant to mechanical unfolding) designed to protect the stable state, support the 3-helix intermediate model in both experimental and computational setups. As a result, multiple discrete unfolding intermediate states in the talin and α-catenin unfolding pathway were discovered. Better understanding of the mechanical unfolding mechanism of α-helix proteins is a key step towards comprehensive models describing the mechanoregulation of proteins.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/z2y475sR2a8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Ji-Sung Kim, Xin Gao, Andrey Rzhetsky&lt;/p&gt;

Anonymized electronic medical records are an increasingly popular source of research data. However, these datasets often lack race and ethnicity information. This creates problems for researchers modeling human disease, as race and ethnicity are powerful confounders for many health exposures and treatment outcomes; race and ethnicity are closely linked to population-specific genetic variation. We showed that deep neural networks generate more accurate estimates for missing racial and ethnic information than competing methods (e.g., logistic regression, random forest, support vector machines, and gradient-boosted decision trees). RIDDLE yielded significantly better classification performance across all metrics that were considered: accuracy, cross-entropy loss (error), precision, recall, and area under the curve for receiver operating characteristic plots (all &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 10&lt;sup&gt;−9&lt;/sup&gt;). We made specific efforts to interpret the trained neural network models to identify, quantify, and visualize medical features which are predictive of race and ethnicity. We used these characterizations of informative features to perform a systematic comparison of differential disease patterns by race and ethnicity. The fact that clinical histories are informative for imputing race and ethnicity could reflect (1) a skewed distribution of blue- and white-collar professions across racial and ethnic groups, (2) uneven accessibility and subjective importance of prophylactic health, (3) possible variation in lifestyle, such as dietary habits, and (4) differences in background genetic variation which predispose to diseases.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/4S7ZYbUulAk&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

The beneficial effects of physical activity for the prevention and management of several chronic diseases are widely recognized. Mathematical modeling of the effects of physical exercise in body metabolism and in particular its influence on the control of glucose homeostasis is of primary importance in the development of eHealth monitoring devices for a personalized medicine. Nonetheless, to date only a few mathematical models have been aiming at this specific purpose. We have developed a whole-body computational model of the effects on metabolic homeostasis of a bout of physical exercise. Built upon an existing model, it allows to detail better both subjects’ characteristics and physical exercise, thus determining to a greater extent the dynamics of the hormones and the metabolites considered.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/L9MBzxj-2FY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Open(G)PIAS: An open source solution for the construction of a high-precision Acoustic-Startle-Response (ASR) setup for tinnitus screening and threshold estimation in rodents. (arXiv:1804.09667v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1804.09667</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The acoustic startle reflex (ASR) that can be induced by a loud sound
stimulus can be used as a versatile tool to, e.g., estimate hearing thresholds
or identify subjective tinnitus percepts in rodents. These techniques are based
on the fact that the ASR amplitude can be suppressed by a pre-stimulus of
lower, non-startling intensity, an effect named pre-pulse inhibition (PPI). For
hearing threshold estimation, pure tone pre-stimuli of varying amplitudes are
presented before an intense noise burst serving as startle stimulus. The amount
of suppression of the ASR amplitude as a function of the pre-stimulus intensity
can be used as a behavioral correlate to determine the hearing ability. For
tinnitus assessment, the pure-tone pre-stimulus is replaced by a gap of silence
in a narrowband noise background, a paradigm termed GPIAS (gap-pre-pulse
inhibition of the acoustic startle response). A proper application of these
paradigms depend on a reliable measurement of the ASR amplitudes, an exact
stimulus presentation in terms of frequency and intensity. Here we introduce a
novel open source solution for the construction of a low-cost ASR setup for the
above mentioned purpose. The complete software for data acquisition and
stimulus presentation is written in Python 3.6 and is provided as an anaconda
package. Furthermore, we provide a construction plan for the sensory system
based on low-cost hardware components. Exemplary data show that the ratios
(1-PPI) of the pre and post trauma ASR amplitudes can be well described by a
lognormal distribution being in good accordance to previous studies with
already established setups. Hence, the open access solution described here will
help to further establish the ASR method in many laboratories and thus
facilitate and standardize research in animal models of tinnitus or hearing
loss.

	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Progress in neurodevelopmental brain research has been achieved through the use of animal models. Such models not only help understanding biological changes that govern brain development, maturation and aging, but are also essential for identifying possible mechanisms of neurodevelopmental and age-related chronic disorders, and to evaluate possible interventions with potential relevance to human disease. Genetic relationship of rhesus monkeys to humans makes those animals a great candidate for such models. With the typical lifespan of 25 years, they undergo cognitive maturation and aging that is similar to this observed in humans. Quantitative structural neuroimaging has been proposed as one of the candidate in vivo biomarkers for tracking white matter brain maturation and aging. While lifespan trajectories of white matter changes have been mapped in humans, such knowledge is not available for nonhuman primates. Here, we analyze and model lifespan trajectories of white matter microstructure using in vivo diffusion imaging in a sample of 44 rhesus monkeys. We report quantitative parameters (including slopes and peaks) of lifespan trajectories for 8 individual white matter tracts. We show different trajectories for cellular and extracellular microstructural imaging components that are associated with white matter maturation and aging, and discuss similarities and differences between those in humans and rhesus monkeys, the importance of our findings, and future directions for the field.Significance Statement: Quantitative structural neuroimaging has been proposed as one of the candidate in vivo biomarkers for tracking brain maturation and aging.

The human brain has the impressive capacity to adapt how it processes information to high-level goals. While it is known that these cognitive control skills are malleable and can be improved through training, the underlying plasticity mechanisms are not well understood. Here, we develop and evaluate a model of how people learn when to exert cognitive control, which controlled process to use, and how much effort to exert. We derive this model from a general theory according to which the function of cognitive control is to select and configure neural pathways so as to make optimal use of finite time and limited computational resources. The central idea of our Learned Value of Control model is that people use reinforcement learning to predict the value of candidate control signals of different types and intensities based on stimulus features. This model correctly predicts the learning and transfer effects underlying the adaptive control-demanding behavior observed in an experiment on visual attention and four experiments on interference control in Stroop and Flanker paradigms. Moreover, our model explained these findings significantly better than an associative learning model and a Win-Stay Lose-Shift model. Our findings elucidate how learning and experience might shape people’s ability and propensity to adaptively control their minds and behavior. We conclude by predicting under which circumstances these learning mechanisms might lead to self-control failure.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Aj4DbuvGLfQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Collagen XIII Is Required for Neuromuscular Synapse Regeneration and Functional Recovery after Peripheral Nerve Injury</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/17/4243?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Collagen XIII occurs as both a transmembrane-bound and a shed extracellular protein and is able to regulate the formation and function of neuromuscular synapses. Its absence results in myasthenia: presynaptic and postsynaptic defects at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ), leading to destabilization of the motor nerves, muscle regeneration and atrophy. Mutations in &lt;i&gt;COL13A1&lt;/i&gt; have recently been found to cause congenital myasthenic syndrome, characterized by fatigue and chronic muscle weakness, which may be lethal. We show here that muscle defects in collagen XIII-deficient mice stabilize in adulthood, so that the disease is not progressive until very late. Sciatic nerve crush was performed to examine how the lack of collagen XIII or forced expression of its transmembrane form affects the neuromuscular synapse regeneration and functional recovery following injury. We show that collagen XIII-deficient male mice are unable to achieve complete NMJ regeneration and functional recovery. This is mainly attributable to presynaptic defects that already existed in the absence of collagen XIII before injury. Shedding of the ectodomain is not required, as the transmembrane form of collagen XIII alone fully rescues the phenotype. Thus, collagen XIII could serve as a therapeutic agent in cases of injury-induced PNS regeneration and functional recovery. We conclude that intrinsic alterations at the NMJ in &lt;i&gt;Col13a1&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt; mice contribute to impaired and incomplete NMJ regeneration and functional recovery after peripheral nerve injury. However, such alterations do not progress once they have stabilized in early adulthood, emphasizing the role of collagen XIII in NMJ maturation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Collagen XIII is required for gaining and maintaining the normal size, complexity, and functional capacity of neuromuscular synapses. Loss-of-function mutations in &lt;i&gt;COL13A1&lt;/i&gt; cause congenital myasthenic syndrome 19, characterized by postnatally progressive muscle fatigue, which compromises patients' functional capacity. We show here in collagen XIII-deficient mice that the disease stabilizes in adulthood once the NMJs have matured. This study also describes a relevant contribution of the altered NMJ morphology and function to neuromuscular synapses, and PNS regeneration and functional recovery in collagen XIII-deficient mice after peripheral nerve injury. Correlating the animal model data on collagen XIII-associated congenital myasthenic syndrome, it can be speculated that neuromuscular connections in congenital myasthenic syndrome patients are not able to fully regenerate and restore normal functionality if exposed to peripheral nerve injury.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>RSS PAP: Deletion of Tsc2 in Nociceptors Reduces Target Innervation, Ion Channel Expression and Sensitivity to Heat</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0436-17.2018v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;The mechanistic Target of Rapamycin Complex 1 (mTORC1) is known to regulate cellular growth pathways, and its genetic activation is sufficient to enhance regenerative axon growth following injury to the central or peripheral nervous systems. However, excess mTORC1 activation may promote innervation defects, and mTORC1 activity mediates injury-induced hypersensitivity, reducing enthusiasm for the pathway as a therapeutic target. While mTORC1 activity is required for full expression of some pain modalities, the effects of pathway activation on nociceptor phenotypes and sensory behaviors are currently unknown. To address this, we genetically activated mTORC1 in mouse peripheral sensory neurons by conditional deletion of its negative regulator Tuberous sclerosis 2 (Tsc2). Consistent with the well-known role of mTORC1 in regulating cell size, soma size and axon diameter of C-nociceptors were increased in Tsc2-deleted mice. Glabrous skin and spinal cord innervation by C-fiber neurons were also disrupted. Transcriptional profiling of nociceptors enriched by fluorescence-associated cell sorting (FACS) revealed downregulation of multiple classes of ion channels as well as reduced expression of markers for peptidergic nociceptors in Tsc2-deleted mice. In addition to these changes in innervation and gene expression, Tsc2-deleted mice exhibited reduced noxious heat sensitivity and decreased injury-induced cold hypersensitivity, but normal baseline sensitivity to cold and mechanical stimuli. Together, these data show that excess mTORC1 activity in sensory neurons produces changes in gene expression, neuron morphology and sensory behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; mTORC1 activation promotes regeneration of injured peripheral axons, however it may have a negative effect on target innervation as well as alter normal sensory function and injury-induced pain. Acute and chronic mTORC1 inhibition may have different effects on sensory behavior. For the mTORC1 pathway to be considered as a therapeutic target to promote nerve regeneration, it is necessary to gain an understanding of the effects of chronic pathway activation on nociceptors and sensory behavior. We show that constitutive mTORC1 activation in nociceptors via conditional deletion of its negative regulator Tsc2 results in anomalies in cell morphology and gene expression that may underlie the decrease in noxious heat sensitivity and the attenuated nerve injury-induced cold hypersensitivity observed in Tsc2-deleted mice.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>RSS PAP: Sound Frequency Representation in the Auditory Cortex of the Common Marmoset Visualized Using Optical Intrinsic Signal Imaging</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0078-18.2018v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Natural sound is composed of various frequencies. Although the core region of the primate auditory cortex has functionally defined sound frequency preference maps, how the map is organized in the auditory areas of the belt and parabelt regions is not well known. In this study, we investigated the functional organizations of the core, belt, and parabelt regions encompassed by the lateral sulcus and the superior temporal sulcus in the common marmoset (&lt;i&gt;Callithrix jacchus&lt;/i&gt;). Using optical imaging of intrinsic signals, we obtained evoked responses to band-pass noise stimuli in a range of sound frequencies (0.5-16 kHz) in anesthetized adult animals and visualized the preferred sound frequency map on the cortical surface. We characterized the functionally defined organization using histologically defined brain areas in the same animals. We found tonotopic representation of a set of sound frequencies (low to high) within the primary (A1), rostral, and rostrotemporal areas of the core region. In the belt region, the tonotopic representation existed only in the mediolateral (ML) area. This representation was symmetric with that found in A1 along the border between areas A1 and ML. The functional structure was not very clear in the anterolateral area. Low frequencies were mainly preferred in the rostrotemplatal area, while high frequencies were preferred in the caudolateral area. There was a portion of the parabelt region that strongly responded to higher sound frequencies (&amp;gt;5.8 kHz) along the border between the rostral and caudal parabelt regions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; In this study, we examined functional organizations for sound frequency representation in the core, belt, and parabelt regions in the marmoset using optical intrinsic signal imaging. In addition to the auditory areas in the core region, the ML in the belt region continuously represented a range of frequencies from low to high, with tonotopic organization, which was symmetric to that in the A1 in the core region about the border between the A1 and ML. The posterior and anterior belt regions represented mainly low and high frequencies, respectively. The parabelt region contained a distinct region with preference for high frequencies. These results suggest that the functional organization unique to each auditory region would process sound information specific to this species.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>RSS PAP: Dynamic Encoding of Incentive Salience in the Ventral Pallidum: dependence on the Form of the Reward Cue</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0328-17.2018v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Some rats are especially prone to attribute incentive salience to a cue (conditioned stimulus, CS) paired with food reward (sign-trackers, STs), but the extent they do so varies as a function of the form of the CS. Other rats respond primarily to the predictive value of a cue (goal-trackers, GTs), regardless of its form. Sign-tracking is associated with greater cue-induced activation of mesolimbic structures than goal-tracking; however, it is unclear how the form of the CS itself influences activity in neural systems involved in incentive salience attribution. Thus, our goal was to determine how different cue modalities affect neural activity in the ventral pallidum (VP), which is known to encode incentive salience attribution, as rats performed a two-CS Pavlovian conditioned approach task in which both a lever-CS and a tone-CS predicted identical food reward. The lever-CS elicited sign-tracking in some rats (STs) and goal-tracking in others (GTs); whereas the tone-CS elicited only goal-tracking in all rats. The lever-CS elicited robust changes in neural activity (sustained tonic increases or decreases in firing) throughout the VP in STs, relative to GTs. These changes were not seen when STs were exposed to the tone-CS, and in GTs there were no differences in firing between the lever-CS and tone-CS. We conclude that neural activity throughout the VP encodes incentive signals, and is especially responsive when a cue is of a form that promotes the attribution of incentive salience to it, especially in predisposed individuals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; The incentive-motivational value of reward-paired cues varies as a function of the individual and the form of the cue itself. Here we examined whether neural activity in a brain region important for processing reward cues, the ventral pallidum (VP), reflected variation in the incentive-motivational value of a food cue, both between individuals and between different cue types (a tone versus a manipulable lever). Neural responses were greatest in individuals that attached incentive salience to a cue, and within individuals the VP dynamically tracked changes in the motivation evoked by the different cue types. This suggests that the VP plays an important role in the encoding of the emotional/motivational states that enable cues to gain control over motivated behavior.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: How swarm size during evolution impacts the behavior, generalizability, and brain complexity of animats performing a spatial navigation task. (arXiv:1804.08940v1 [cs.NE])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1804.08940</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;While it is relatively easy to imitate and evolve natural swarm behavior in
simulations, less is known about the social characteristics of simulated,
evolved swarms, such as the optimal (evolutionary) group size, why individuals
in a swarm perform certain actions, and how behavior would change in swarms of
different sizes. To address these questions, we used a genetic algorithm to
evolve animats equipped with Markov Brains in a spatial navigation task that
facilitates swarm behavior. The animats' goal was to frequently cross between
two rooms without colliding with other animats. Animats were evolved in swarms
of various sizes. We then evaluated the task performance and social behavior of
the final generation from each evolution when placed with swarms of different
sizes in order to evaluate their generalizability across conditions. According
to our experiments, we find that swarm size during evolution matters: animats
evolved in a balanced swarm developed more flexible behavior, higher fitness
across conditions, and, in addition, higher brain complexity.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The Gemini theorem asserts that, given certain reasonable assumptions, no
physical system can be certainly aware of its own existence. The theorem can be
proved algorithmically, but the proof of this theorem is somewhat obscure, and
there exists very little literature on it. The purpose of this article is to
provide a brief non-technical summary of the theorem and its proof, with a view
to stimulating critical discussion of the proof and its implications. Since the
theorem implies that a violation of the conservation of energy will take place
within the brains of conscious human beings, it has obvious implications for
any physical theory.

	<title>RSS PAP: Tracking Temporal Hazard in the Human Electroencephalogram Using a Forward Encoding Model</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0017-18.2018v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Human observers automatically extract temporal contingencies from the environment and predict the onset of future events. Temporal predictions are modelled by the hazard function, which describes the instantaneous probability for an event to occur given it has not occurred yet. Here, we tackle the question of whether and how the human brain tracks continuous temporal hazard on a moment-to-moment basis, and how flexibly it adjusts to strictly implicit variations in the hazard function. We applied an encoding-model approach to human electroencephalographic (EEG) data recorded during a pitch-discrimination task, in which we implicitly manipulated temporal predictability of the target tones by varying the interval between cue and target tone (the foreperiod). Critically, temporal predictability was either solely driven by the passage of time (resulting in a monotonic hazard function), or was modulated to increase at intermediate foreperiods (resulting in a modulated hazard function with a peak at the intermediate foreperiod). Forward encoding models trained to predict the recorded EEG signal from different temporal hazard functions were able to distinguish between experimental conditions, showing that implicit variations of temporal hazard bear tractable signatures in the human electroencephalogram. Notably, this tracking signal was reconstructed best from the supplementary motor area (SMA), underlining this area’s link to cognitive processing of time. Our results underline the relevance of temporal hazard to cognitive processing, and show that the predictive accuracy of the encoding-model approach can be utilised to track abstract time-resolved stimuli.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Extracting temporal predictions from sensory input allows to process future input more efficiently and to prepare responses in time. In mathematical terms, temporal predictions can be described by the hazard function, modeling the probability of an event to occur over time. Here, we show that the human EEG tracks temporal hazard in an implicit foreperiod paradigm. Forward encoding models trained to predict the recorded EEG signal from different temporal-hazard functions were able to distinguish between experimental conditions that differed in their build-up of hazard over time. These neural signatures of tracking temporal hazard converge with the extant literature on temporal processing and provide new evidence that the supplementary motor area tracks hazard under strictly implicit timing conditions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: An accumulator model for primes and targets with independent response activation rates: Basic equations for average response times. (arXiv:1804.08513v2 [q-bio.NC] UPDATED)</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1804.08513</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In response priming tasks, speeded responses are performed toward target
stimuli preceded by prime stimuli. Responses are slower and error rates are
higher when prime and target are assigned to different responses, compared to
assignment to the same response, and those priming effects increase with
prime-target SOA. Here, we generalize Vorberg et al.'s (2003) accumulator model
of response priming, where response activation is first controlled exclusively
by the prime and then taken over by the actual target. Priming thus occurs by
motor conflict because a response-inconsistent prime can temporarily drive the
process towards the incorrect response. While the original model assumed prime
and target signals to be identical in strength, we allow different rates of
response activation (cf. Mattler &amp;amp; Palmer, 2012; Schubert et al., 2012). Our
model predicts that stronger primes mainly increase priming effects in response
times and error rates, whereas stronger targets mainly diminish response times
and priming effects.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The paper titled `Intentional Observer Effects on Quantum Randomness: A
Bayesian Analysis Reveals Evidence Against Micro-Psychokinesis', published in
Frontiers of Psychology in March 2018, reports on a mind-matter experiment with
the main result of strong evidence against Micro-Psychokinesis. Despite this
conclusion, the authors interpret the observed pattern in their data as
possible evidence for Micro-Psychokinesis, albeit of a different kind.
Suggesting a connection to some existing models, the authors put forward the
hypothesis that a higher frequency of slow data variations can be observed in
their experiment data than in a set of control data. This commentary analyses
this claim and concludes that the variation in the data motivating this
hypothesis would show up just by chance with a probability of p=0.328 under a
null hypothesis. Therefore, there is no evidence for the hypothesis of faster
data variations, and thus for this kind of suggested Micro-Psychokinesis in
this experiment.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1804.08154</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Large bundles of myelinated axons, called white matter, anatomically connect
disparate brain regions together and compose the structural core of the human
connectome. We recently proposed a method of measuring the local integrity
along the length of each white matter fascicle, termed the local connectome. If
communication efficiency is fundamentally constrained by the integrity along
the entire length of a white matter bundle, then variability in the functional
dynamics of brain networks should be associated with variability in the local
connectome. We test this prediction using two statistical approaches that are
capable of handling the high dimensionality of data. First, by performing
statistical inference on distance-based correlations, we show that similarity
in the local connectome between individuals is significantly correlated with
similarity in their patterns of functional connectivity. Second, by employing
variable selection using sparse canonical correlation analysis and
cross-validation, we show that segments of the local connectome are predictive
of certain patterns of functional brain dynamics. These results are consistent
with the hypothesis that structural variability along axon bundles constrains
communication between disparate brain regions.

However, the effects of prenatal ethanol exposure on the development of this region await elucidation. Here, we used an established mouse model of FASD with binge-type ethanol exposure from embryonic day 13.5–16.5 to investigate the effects of prenatal ethanol exposure on pyramidal neurons in the somatosensory cortex. Specifically, we focused on the radial migration of primordial pyramidal neurons during embryonic corticogenesis and their morphology and function during active synaptogenesis in early postnatal development. We found that prenatal ethanol exposure resulted in aberrant radial migration, particularly affecting the populations of postmitotic pyramidal neurons. In addition, there was an enduring effect of prenatal ethanol exposure on glutamate-mediated synaptic transmission in layer V/VI pyramidal neurons. This persisted beyond a transient decrease in pyramidal neuron dendritic complexity that was evident only during early postnatal development. Adolescent mice exposed prenatally to ethanol also displayed decreased tactile sensitivity, as revealed by a modified adhesive tape removal assay. Our findings demonstrate the persistent effects of binge-type &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;in utero&lt;/span&gt; ethanol exposure on pyramidal neuron form and function and ultimately sensory processing, the latter being reminiscent of that seen in individuals with FASD.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

Here, we systematically investigate DACH1 expression patterns during human neurodevelopment, from 5 to 21 postconceptional weeks. By immunodetection analysis, we found that DACH1 is highly expressed in the proliferating neuroprogenitors of the developing cortical ventricular and subventricular regions, while it is absent in the more differentiated cortical plate. Single-cell global transcriptional analysis revealed that &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;DACH1&lt;/span&gt; is specifically enriched in neuroepithelial and ventricular radial glia cells of the developing human neocortex. Moreover, we describe a previously unreported DACH1 expression in the human striatum, in particular in the striatal medium spiny neurons. This finding qualifies DACH1 as a new striatal projection neuron marker, together with PPP1R1B, BCL11B, and EBF1. We finally compared DACH1 expression profile in human and mouse forebrain, where we observed spatio-temporal similarities in its expression pattern thus providing a precise developmental description of DACH1 in the 2 mammalian species.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

Neuronal information processing is regulated by fast and localized fluctuations of brain states. Brain states reliably switch between distinct spatiotemporal signatures at a network scale even though they are composed of heterogeneous and variable rhythms at a cellular scale. We investigated the mechanisms of this network control in a conductance-based population model that reliably switches between active and oscillatory mean-fields. Robust control of the mean-field properties relies critically on a switchable negative intrinsic conductance at the cellular level. This conductance endows circuits with a shared cellular positive feedback that can switch population rhythms on and off at a cellular resolution. The switch is largely independent from other intrinsic neuronal properties, network size and synaptic connectivity. It is therefore compatible with the temporal variability and spatial heterogeneity induced by slower regulatory functions such as neuromodulation, synaptic plasticity and homeostasis. Strikingly, the required cellular mechanism is available in all cell types that possess T-type calcium channels but unavailable in computational models that neglect the slow kinetics of their activation.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/12Pj_Yzaong&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

We present a new modeling and computational tool that computes rigorous summaries of network dynamics over large sets of parameter values. These summaries, organized in a database, can be searched for observed dynamics, e.g., bistability and hysteresis, to discover parameter regimes over which they are supported. We illustrate our approach on several networks underlying the restriction point of the cell cycle in humans and yeast. We rank networks by how robustly they support hysteresis, which is the observed phenotype. We find that the best 6-node human network and the yeast network share similar topology and robustness of hysteresis, in spite of having no homology between the corresponding nodes of the network. Our approach provides a new tool linking network structure and dynamics.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/StTE5SEaAR8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by William Marshall, Larissa Albantakis, Giulio Tononi&lt;/p&gt;

Reductionism assumes that causation in the physical world occurs at the micro level, excluding the emergence of macro-level causation. We challenge this reductionist assumption by employing a principled, well-defined measure of intrinsic cause-effect power–integrated information (Φ), and showing that, according to this measure, it is possible for a macro level to “beat” the micro level. Simple systems were evaluated for Φ across different spatial and temporal scales by systematically considering all possible &lt;i&gt;black boxes&lt;/i&gt;. These are macro elements that consist of one or more micro elements over one or more micro updates. Cause-effect power was evaluated based on the inputs and outputs of the black boxes, ignoring the internal micro elements that support their input-output function. We show how black-box elements can have more common inputs and outputs than the corresponding micro elements, revealing the emergence of high-order mechanisms and joint constraints that are not apparent at the micro level. As a consequence, a macro, black-box system can have higher Φ than its micro constituents by having more mechanisms (higher composition) that are more interconnected (higher integration). We also show that, for a given micro system, one can identify local maxima of Φ across several spatiotemporal scales. The framework is demonstrated on a simple biological system, the Boolean network model of the fission-yeast cell-cycle, for which we identify stable local maxima during the course of its simulated biological function. These local maxima correspond to macro levels of organization at which emergent cause-effect properties of physical systems come into focus, and provide a natural vantage point for scientific inquiries.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/nmwWC-o9ix4&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Computational mechanisms underlying cortical responses to the affordance properties of visual scenes</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/XJmM-iMvR90/article</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Michael F. Bonner, Russell A. Epstein&lt;/p&gt;

Biologically inspired deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs), trained for computer vision tasks, have been found to predict cortical responses with remarkable accuracy. However, the internal operations of these models remain poorly understood, and the factors that account for their success are unknown. Here we develop a set of techniques for using CNNs to gain insights into the computational mechanisms underlying cortical responses. We focused on responses in the occipital place area (OPA), a scene-selective region of dorsal occipitoparietal cortex. In a previous study, we showed that fMRI activation patterns in the OPA contain information about the navigational affordances of scenes; that is, information about where one can and cannot move within the immediate environment. We hypothesized that this affordance information could be extracted using a set of purely feedforward computations. To test this idea, we examined a deep CNN with a feedforward architecture that had been previously trained for scene classification. We found that responses in the CNN to scene images were highly predictive of fMRI responses in the OPA. Moreover the CNN accounted for the portion of OPA variance relating to the navigational affordances of scenes. The CNN could thus serve as an image-computable candidate model of affordance-related responses in the OPA. We then ran a series of &lt;i&gt;in silico&lt;/i&gt; experiments on this model to gain insights into its internal operations. These analyses showed that the computation of affordance-related features relied heavily on visual information at high-spatial frequencies and cardinal orientations, both of which have previously been identified as low-level stimulus preferences of scene-selective visual cortex. These computations also exhibited a strong preference for information in the lower visual field, which is consistent with known retinotopic biases in the OPA. Visualizations of feature selectivity within the CNN suggested that affordance-based responses encoded features that define the layout of the spatial environment, such as boundary-defining junctions and large extended surfaces. Together, these results map the sensory functions of the OPA onto a fully quantitative model that provides insights into its visual computations. More broadly, they advance integrative techniques for understanding visual cortex across multiple level of analysis: from the identification of cortical sensory functions to the modeling of their underlying algorithms.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/XJmM-iMvR90&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>RSS PAP: Phasic Stimulation of Midbrain Dopamine Neuron Activity Reduces Salt Consumption</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0064-18.2018v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Salt intake is an essential dietary requirement, but excessive consumption is implicated in hypertension and associated conditions. Little is known about the neural circuit mechanisms that control motivation to consume salt, although the midbrain dopamine system, which plays a key role in other reward-related behaviours, has been implicated. We, therefore, examined the effects on salt consumption of either optogenetic excitation or chemogenetic inhibition of ventral tegmental area (VTA) dopamine neurons in male mice. Strikingly, optogenetic excitation of dopamine neurons decreased salt intake in a rapid and reversible manner, despite a strong salt appetite. Importantly, optogenetic excitation was not aversive, did not induce hyperactivity, and did not alter salt concentration preferences in a need-free state. In addition, we found that chemogenetic inhibition of dopamine neurons had no effect on salt intake. Lastly, optogenetic excitation of dopamine neurons reduced consumption of sucrose following an overnight fast, suggesting a more general role of VTA dopamine neuron excitation in organising motivated behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Although it is well-established that midbrain dopamine neurons are involved in many types of reward-related behaviours, little is known about their role in salt intake under conditions where salt is appetitive (i.e. during salt depletion). Here, we show that optogenetic excitation of midbrain dopamine neurons can decrease salt intake. Importantly, this stimulation protocol did not affect salt concentration preferences. Furthermore, we find that this stimulation protocol can also reduce sucrose intake following an overnight fast, suggesting a broader role for dopamine neuron activity in regulating nutrient intake, which compliments findings from previous lesion- and pharmacological-based studies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>RSS PAP: How Much Does Movement and Location Encoding Impact Prefrontal Cortex Activity? an Algorithmic Decoding Approach in Freely Moving Rats</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0023-18.2018v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Specialized brain structures encode spatial locations and movements, yet there is growing evidence that this information is also represented in the rodent medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). Disambiguating such information from the encoding of other types of task-relevant information has proven challenging. In order to determine the extent to which movement and location information is relevant to mPFC neurons, tetrodes were used to record neuronal activity while limb positions, poses (i.e. recurring constellations of limb positions), velocity and spatial locations were simultaneously recorded with two cameras every 200ms as rats freely roamed in an experimental enclosure. Regression analyses using Generalized Linear Models revealed that over half of the individual mPFC neurons were significantly responsive to at least one of the factors and many were responsive to more than one. On the other hand, each factor accounted for only a very small portion of the total spike count variance of any given neuron (&amp;lt;20% and typically &amp;lt;1%). Machine learning methods were used to analyze ensemble activity and revealed that ensembles were usually superior to the sum of the best neurons in encoding movements and spatial locations. Since movement and location encoding by individual neurons was so weak, it may not be such a concern for single neuron analyses. Yet because these weak signals were so widely distributed across the population, this information was strongly represented at the ensemble level and should be considered in population analyses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; It is often difficult to determine exactly what is driving changes in the activity of single mPFC neurons. Basic things such as movements or spatial locations can activate these neurons and interfere with the ability to extract high-order task-related correlates. Here we applied a series of powerful techniques to carefully quantify the relationship between a rat’s movements and the activity of mPFC neurons. Overall the firing related to limb movements, poses and spatial locations had little impact on individual neurons, yet this widely distributed information became prominent at the ensemble level. A framework where neurons participate to varying degrees in encoding all events has certain advantages that could prove useful for higher-order cognitive processing and in guiding artificial intelligence approaches.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Advances in gene discovery for neurodevelopmental disorders have identified SCN2A dysfunction as a leading cause of infantile seizures, autism spectrum disorder, and intellectual disability. SCN2A encodes the neuronal sodium channel NaV1.2. Functional assays demonstrate strong correlation between genotype and phenotype. This insight can help guide therapeutic decisions and raises the possibility that ligands that selectively enhance or diminish channel function may improve symptoms. The well-defined function of sodium channels makes SCN2A an important test case for investigating the neurobiology of neurodevelopmental disorders more generally.</content:encoded>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Frontal Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation Induces Dopamine Release in the Ventral Striatum in Human</title>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy093/4980863?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;A single transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) session applied over the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLFPC) can be associated with procognitive effects. Furthermore, repeated DLPFC tDCS sessions are under investigation as a new therapeutic tool for a range of neuropsychiatric conditions. A possible mechanism explaining such beneficial effects is a modulation of meso-cortico-limbic dopamine transmission. We explored the spatial and temporal neurobiological effects of bifrontal tDCS on subcortical dopamine transmission during and immediately after the stimulation. In a double blind sham-controlled study, 32 healthy subjects randomly received a single session of either active (20 min, 2 mA; &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;n&lt;/span&gt; = 14) or sham (&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;n&lt;/span&gt; = 18) tDCS during a dynamic positron emission tomography scan using [&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;C]raclopride binding. During the stimulation period, no significant effect of tDCS was observed. After the stimulation period, compared with sham tDCS, active tDCS induced a significant decrease in [&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;C]raclopride binding potential ratio in the striatum, suggesting an increase in extracellular dopamine in a part of the striatum involved in the reward–motivation network. The present study provides the first evidence that bifrontal tDCS induces neurotransmitter release in polysynaptic connected subcortical areas. Therefore, levels of dopamine activity and reactivity should be a new element to consider for a general hypothesis of brain modulation by bifrontal tDCS.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Prematurity is associated with diverse developmental abnormalities, yet few studies relate cognitive and neurostructural deficits to a dimensional measure of prematurity. Leveraging a large sample of children, adolescents, and young adults (age 8–22 years) studied as part of the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort, we examined how variation in gestational age impacted cognition and brain structure later in development. Participants included 72 preterm youth born before 37 weeks’ gestation and 206 youth who were born at term (37 weeks or later). Using a previously-validated factor analysis, cognitive performance was assessed in three domains: (1) executive function and complex reasoning, (2) social cognition, and (3) episodic memory. All participants completed T1-weighted neuroimaging at 3 T to measure brain volume. Structural covariance networks were delineated using non-negative matrix factorization, an advanced multivariate analysis technique. Lower gestational age was associated with both deficits in executive function and reduced volume within 11 of 26 structural covariance networks, which included orbitofrontal, temporal, and parietal cortices as well as subcortical regions including the hippocampus. Notably, the relationship between lower gestational age and executive dysfunction was accounted for in part by structural network deficits. Together, these findings emphasize the durable impact of prematurity on cognition and brain structure, which persists across development.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Neurogenesis in the healthy adult murine brain is based on proliferation and integration of stem/progenitor cells and is thought to be restricted to 2 neurogenic niches: the subventricular zone and the dentate gyrus. Intriguingly, cells expressing the immature neuronal marker doublecortin (DCX) and the polysialylated-neural cell adhesion molecule reside in layer II of the piriform cortex. Apparently, these cells progressively disappear along the course of ageing, while their fate and function remain unclear. Using DCX-CreER&lt;sup&gt;T2&lt;/sup&gt;/Flox-EGFP transgenic mice, we demonstrate that these immature neurons located in the murine piriform cortex do not vanish in the course of aging, but progressively resume their maturation into glutamatergic (TBR1&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, CaMKII&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) neurons. We provide evidence for a putative functional integration of these newly differentiated neurons as indicated by the increase in perisomatic puncta expressing synaptic markers, the development of complex apical dendrites decorated with numerous spines and the appearance of an axonal initial segment. Since immature neurons found in layer II of the piriform cortex are generated prenatally and devoid of proliferative capacity in the postnatal cortex, the gradual maturation and integration of these cells outside of the canonical neurogenic niches implies that they represent a valuable, but nonrenewable reservoir for cortical plasticity.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;The default mode network (DMN) is considered a unified core brain function for generating subjective mental experiences, such as mind wandering. We propose a novel cognitive framework for understanding the unity of the DMN from the perspective of hemispheric asymmetry. Using transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), effective connectivity estimation, and machine learning, we show that the bilateral angular gyri (AG), which are core regions of the DMN, exhibit heterogeneity in both inherent network organization and mind wandering regulation. Inherent heterogeneities are present between the right and left AG regarding not only effective connectivity, but also mind wandering regulation; the right AG is related to mind-wandering reduction, whereas the left AG is related to mind-wandering generation. Further supporting this observation, we found that only anodal tDCS of the right AG induced machine learning-detectable changes in effective connectivity and regional amplitude, which could possibly be linked to reduced mind wandering. Our findings highlight the importance of hemispheric asymmetry to further understand the function of the DMN and contribute to the emerging neural model of mind wandering, which is necessary to understand the nature of the human mind.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Cracking brain's neural code is of general interest. In contrast to the traditional view that enormous spike variability in resting states and stimulus-triggered responses reflects noise, here, we examine the “Neural Self-Information Theory” that the interspike-interval (ISI), or the silence-duration between 2 adjoining spikes, carries self-information that is inversely proportional to its variability-probability. Specifically, higher-probability ISIs convey minimal information because they reflect the ground state, whereas lower-probability ISIs carry more information, in the form of “positive” or “negative surprisals,” signifying the excitatory or inhibitory shifts from the ground state, respectively. These surprisals serve as the quanta of information to construct temporally coordinated cell-assembly ternary codes representing real-time cognitions. Accordingly, we devised a general decoding method and unbiasedly uncovered 15 cell assemblies underlying different sleep cycles, fear-memory experiences, spatial navigation, and 5-choice serial-reaction time (5CSRT) visual-discrimination behaviors. We further revealed that robust cell-assembly codes were generated by ISI surprisals constituted of ~20% of the skewed ISI gamma-distribution tails, conforming to the “Pareto Principle” that specifies, for many events—including communication—roughly 80% of the output or consequences come from 20% of the input or causes. These results demonstrate that real-time neural coding arises from the temporal assembly of neural-clique members via silence variability-based self-information codes.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;The mammalian cerebral neocortex has a unique structure, composed of layers of different neuron types, interconnected in a stereotyped fashion. While the overall developmental program seems to be conserved, there are divergent developmental factors generating cortical diversity amongst species. In terms of cortical neuronal numbers, some of the determining factors are the size of the founder population, the duration of cortical neurogenesis, the proportion of different progenitor types, and the fine-tuned balance between self-renewing and differentiative divisions. We develop a mathematical model of neurogenesis that, accounting for these factors, aims at explaining the high diversity in neuronal numbers found across species. By framing our hypotheses in rigorous mathematical terms, we are able to identify paths of neurogenesis that match experimentally observed patterns in mouse, macaque and human. Additionally, we use our model to identify key parameters that would particularly benefit from accurate experimental investigation. We find that the timing of a switch in favor of symmetric neurogenic divisions produces the highest variation in cortical neuronal numbers. Surprisingly, assuming similar cell cycle lengths in primate progenitors, the increase in cortical neuronal numbers does not reflect a larger size of founder population, a prediction that has identified a specific need for experimental quantifications.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Humans show a preference for using the right hand over the left for tasks and activities of everyday life. While experimental work in non-human primates has identified the neural systems responsible for reaching and grasping, the neural basis of lateralized motor behavior in humans remains elusive. The advent of diffusion imaging tractography for studying connectional anatomy in the living human brain provides the possibility of understanding the relationship between hemispheric asymmetry, hand preference, and manual specialization. In this study, diffusion tractography was used to demonstrate an interaction between hand preference and the asymmetry of frontoparietal tracts, specifically the dorsal branch of the superior longitudinal fasciculus, responsible for visuospatial integration and motor planning. This is in contrast to the corticospinal tract and the superior cerebellar peduncle, for which asymmetry was not related to hand preference. Asymmetry of the dorsal frontoparietal tract was also highly correlated with the degree of lateralization in tasks requiring visuospatial integration and fine motor control. These results suggest a common anatomical substrate for hand preference and lateralized manual specialization in frontoparietal tracts important for visuomotor processing.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>RSS PAP: Neuregulin 1 Type-I over-Expression Is Associated with Reduced NMDA Receptor-Mediated Synaptic Signaling in Hippocampal Interneurons Expressing PV or CCK</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0418-17.2018v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;wHypofunction of &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-methyl-d-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) in inhibitory GABAergic interneurons is implicated in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia (SZ), a heritable disorder with many susceptibility genes. However, it is still unclear how SZ risk genes interfere with NMDAR-mediated synaptic transmission in diverse inhibitory interneuron populations. One putative risk gene is neuregulin 1 (NRG1), which signals via the receptor tyrosine kinase ErbB4, itself a schizophrenia risk gene. The type-I isoform of &lt;i&gt;NRG1&lt;/i&gt; shows increased expression in the brain of SZ patients, and ErbB4 is enriched in GABAergic interneurons expressing parvalbumin (PV+) or cholecystokinin (CCK+). Here, we investigated ErbB4 expression and synaptic transmission in interneuronal populations of the hippocampus of transgenic mice over-expressing NRG1 type-I (NRG1&lt;sup&gt;tg-type-I&lt;/sup&gt; mice). Immunohistochemical analyses confirmed that ErbB4 was co-expressed with either PV or CCK in hippocampal interneurons, but we observed a reduced number of ErbB4-immunopositive interneurons in the NRG1&lt;sup&gt;tg-type-I&lt;/sup&gt; mice. NMDAR-mediated currents in interneurons expressing PV (including PV+ basket cells) or CCK were reduced in NRG1&lt;sup&gt;tg-type-I&lt;/sup&gt; mice compared to their littermate controls. We found no difference in AMPA receptor-mediated currents. Optogenetic activation (5 pulses at 20 Hz) of local glutamatergic fibers revealed a decreased NMDAR-mediated contribution to disynaptic GABAergic inhibition of pyramidal cells in the NRG1&lt;sup&gt;tg-type-I&lt;/sup&gt; mice. GABAergic synaptic transmission from either PV+ or CCK+ interneurons, and glutamatergic transmission onto pyramidal cells, did not significantly differ between genotypes. The results indicate that synaptic NMDAR-mediated signaling in hippocampal interneurons is sensitive to chronically elevated NGR1 type-I levels. This may contribute to the pathophysiological consequences of increased &lt;i&gt;NRG1&lt;/i&gt; expression in SZ.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Hypofunction of NMDA receptors in inhibitory GABAergic interneurons is implicated in pathophysiology of schizophrenia (SZ), but it is largely unknown how SZ risk genes interfere with NMDAR-mediated signaling in specific interneurons. We investigated synaptic transmission in hippocampus of mice over-expressing the type-I isoform of the putative SZ risk gene, NRG1, and found markedly reduced NMDAR-mediated synaptic responses in GABAergic interneuron types labeled for PV or CCK which are known to express the NRG1 receptor ErbB4. The NMDAR hypofunction changed synaptic excitatory drive of interneurons during hippocampal network activity. The observed reductions of NMDAR-mediated transmission in these interneurons may contribute to the hippocampal dysfunction observed with increased NGR1 type-I expression, and may provide a link to the genetic predisposition to SZ.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>RSS PAP: Altered Cerebellar Short-Term Plasticity but No Change in Postsynaptic AMPA-Type Glutamate Receptors in a Mouse Model of Juvenile Batten Disease</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0387-17.2018v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Juvenile Batten disease is the most common progressive neurodegenerative disorder of childhood. It is associated with mutations in the &lt;i&gt;CLN3&lt;/i&gt; gene, causing loss of function of CLN3 protein and degeneration of cerebellar and retinal neurons. It has been proposed that changes in granule cell AMPA-type glutamate receptors (AMPARs) contribute to the cerebellar dysfunction. In this study we compared AMPAR properties and synaptic transmission in cerebellar granule cells from wild-type and &lt;i&gt;Cln3&lt;/i&gt; knockout mice. In &lt;i&gt;Cln3&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;ex1–6&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; cells the amplitude of AMPA-evoked whole-cell currents was unchanged. Similarly, we found no change in the amplitude, kinetics, or rectification of synaptic currents evoked by individual quanta, or in their underlying single-channel conductance. We found no change in cerebellar expression of GluA2 or GluA4 protein. By contrast, we observed a reduced number of quantal events following mossy-fiber stimulation in Sr&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, altered short-term plasticity in conditions of reduced extracellular Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, and reduced mossy fiber vesicle number. Thus, while our results suggest early presynaptic changes in the &lt;i&gt;Cln3&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;ex1–6&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; mouse model of juvenile Batten disease, they reveal no evidence for altered postsynaptic AMPARs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Juvenile Batten disease is an inherited lysosomal storage disorder that affects children and leads to premature death. Caused by mutations in the &lt;i&gt;CLN3&lt;/i&gt; gene, it results in a loss of CLN3 protein and neuronal degeneration. It has been proposed that changes in granule cell AMPA-type glutamate receptors contribute to cerebellar dysfunction. Here, we show that the properties of postsynaptic AMPA receptors in granule cells from juvenile &lt;i&gt;Cln3&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;ex1–6&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; mice are unaltered. Instead, loss of CLN3 protein leads to early presynaptic changes and altered short-term plasticity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Intracellular recording allows measurement and perturbation of the membrane potential of identified neurons with sub-millisecond and sub-millivolt precision. This gives intracellular recordings a unique capacity to provide rich information about individual cells (e.g., high-resolution characterization of inputs, outputs, excitability, and structure). Hence, such recordings can elucidate the mechanisms that underlie fundamental phenomena, such as brain state, sparse coding, gating, gain modulation, and learning.</content:encoded>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Post-stroke Intranasal (+)-Naloxone Delivery Reduces Microglial Activation and Improves Behavioral Recovery from Ischemic Injury</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/5/2/ENEURO.0395-17.2018?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Ischemic stroke is the leading cause of disability, and effective therapeutic strategies are needed to promote complete recovery. Neuroinflammation plays a significant role in stroke pathophysiology, and there is limited understanding of how it affects recovery. The aim of this study was to characterize the spatiotemporal expression profile of microglial activation and whether dampening microglial/macrophage activation post-stroke facilitates the recovery. For dampening microglial/macrophage activation, we chose intranasal administration of naloxone, a drug that is already in clinical use for opioid overdose and is known to decrease microglia/macrophage activation. We characterized the temporal progression of microglia/macrophage activation following cortical ischemic injury in rat and found the peak activation in cortex 7 d post-stroke. Unexpectedly, there was a chronic expression of phagocytic cells in the thalamus associated with neuronal loss. (+)-Naloxone, an enantiomer that reduces microglial activation without antagonizing opioid receptors, was administered intranasally starting 1 d post-stroke and continuing for 7 d. (+)-Naloxone treatment decreased microglia/macrophage activation in the striatum and thalamus, promoted behavioral recovery during the 14-d monitoring period, and reduced neuronal death in the lesioned cortex and ipsilateral thalamus. Our results are the first to show that post-stroke intranasal (+)-naloxone administration promotes short-term functional recovery and reduces microglia/macrophage activation. Therefore, (+)-naloxone is a promising drug for the treatment of ischemic stroke, and further studies should be conducted.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;We investigated, in 445 healthy adults whose Heschl’s gyrus (HG) gyrification patterns had been previously identified, how an in vivo MRI marker of intracortical myelination of HG and the planum temporale (PT) varied as a function of HG gyrification pattern and, in cases of duplication, of anatomical characteristics of the second HG (H2). By measuring the MRI T1/T2 ratio in regions of interest covering the first HG (H1), H2 in cases of common stem (H2CSD), or complete posterior duplication (H2CPD) and the PT, we showed that H1 had the highest T1/T2 values, while the PT had the lowest. The major impact of duplication was a decrease in both H1 and PT T1/T2 values in cases of left CPD. Concerning H2, the right and left T1/T2 values of right H2CSD were closer to those of H1, and those of left H2CPD were closer to those of PT. After adjusting for verbal skills, rhyming performance was not associated with T1/T2 values in left regions, but it decreased with increasing right PT T1/T2 values. These results reveal the existence of hemispheric differences in H2 myelination and underline the importance of neuroimaging markers of intracortical myelination for investigating brain structure–function relationships.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Mature granule cells are poorly excitable neurons that were recently shown to fire action potentials, preferentially in bursts. It is believed that the particularly pronounced short-term facilitation of mossy fiber synapses makes granule cell bursting a very effective means of properly transferring information to CA3. However, the mechanism underlying the unique bursting behavior of mature granule cells is currently unknown. Here, we show that Cav3.2 T-type channels at the axon initial segment are responsible for burst firing of mature granule cells in rats and mice. Accordingly, Cav3.2 knockout mice fire tonic spikes and exhibit impaired bursting, synaptic plasticity and dentate-to-CA3 communication. The data show that Cav3.2 channels are strong modulators of bursting and can be considered a critical molecular switch that enables effective information transfer from mature granule cells to the CA3 pyramids.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Vascular-Derived Vegfa Promotes Cortical Interneuron Migration and Proximity to the Vasculature in the Developing Forebrain</title>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy082/4975490?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Vascular endothelial growth factor (&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Vegfa&lt;/span&gt;) is essential for promoting the vascularization of the embryonic murine forebrain. In addition, it directly influences neural development, although its role in the forming forebrain is less well elucidated. It was recently suggested that &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Vegfa&lt;/span&gt; may influence the development of GABAergic interneurons, inhibitory cells with crucial signaling roles in cortical neuronal circuits. However, the mechanism by which it affects interneuron development remains unknown. Here we investigated the developmental processes by which &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Vegfa&lt;/span&gt; may influence cortical interneuron development by analyzing transgenic mice that ubiquitously express the Vegfa120 isoform to perturb its signaling gradient. We found that interneurons reach the dorsal cortex at mid phases of corticogenesis despite an aberrant vascular network. Instead, endothelial ablation of Vegfa alters cortical interneuron numbers, their intracortical distribution and spatial proximity to blood vessels. We show for the first time that vascular-secreted guidance factors promote early-migrating interneurons in the intact forebrain in vivo and identify a novel role for vascular-Vegfa in this process.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Constitutive Inactivation of the PRRT2 Gene Alters Short-Term Synaptic Plasticity and Promotes Network Hyperexcitability in Hippocampal Neurons</title>

	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Mutations in PRoline-Rich Transmembrane protein 2 (&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;PRRT2&lt;/span&gt;) underlie a group of paroxysmal disorders including epilepsy, kinesigenic dyskinesia and migraine. Most of the mutations lead to impaired PRRT2 expression and/or function, emphasizing the pathogenic role of the PRRT2 deficiency. In this work, we investigated the phenotype of primary hippocampal neurons obtained from mouse embryos in which the &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;PRRT2&lt;/span&gt; gene was constitutively inactivated. Although PRRT2 is expressed by both excitatory and inhibitory neurons, its deletion decreases the number of excitatory synapses without significantly affecting the number of inhibitory synapses or the nerve terminal ultrastructure. Analysis of synaptic function in primary PRRT2 knockout excitatory neurons by live imaging and electrophysiology showed slowdown of the kinetics of exocytosis, weakened spontaneous and evoked synaptic transmission and markedly increased facilitation. Inhibitory neurons showed strengthening of basal synaptic transmission, accompanied by faster depression. At the network level these complex synaptic effects resulted in a state of heightened spontaneous and evoked activity that was associated with increased excitability of excitatory neurons in both PRRT2 knockout primary cultures and acute hippocampal slices. The data indicate the existence of network instability/hyperexcitability as the possible basis of the paroxysmal phenotypes associated with &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;PRRT2&lt;/span&gt; mutations.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>
