	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1802.01496</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common cardiac arrhythmia in human
beings, and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. The current
standard of care includes interventional catheter ablation in selected
patients, but the success rate is limited. The major limitation of the current
approach to AF is the lack of fundamental understanding of its underlying
mechanism. Specifically, it remains unclear whether human AF dynamics are a
deterministic or a stochastic process. Here we assess for determinism in human
AF by evaluating the properties of the symbolic representation of intracardiac
electrical recordings obtained from patients. Specifically, we evaluate (a) the
number of the missing ordinal patterns, (b) the rate of missing ordinal pattern
decay for increased length of the time series, and (c) the causal-entropy
complexity plane of the Bandt-Pompe symbolic representation. When used
together, these are powerful tools to detect determinism, even in the presence
of experimental noise and brief time series.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;`Bursting', defined as periods of high frequency firing of a neuron separated
by periods of quiescence, has been observed in various neuronal systems, both
\textit{in vitro} and \textit{in vivo}. It has been associated with a range of
neuronal processes, including efficient information transfer and the formation
of functional networks during development, and has been shown to be sensitive
to genetic and pharmacological manipulations. Accurate detection of periods of
bursting activity is thus an important aspect of characterising both
spontaneous and evoked neuronal network activity. A wide variety of
computational methods have been developed to detect periods of bursting in
spike trains recorded from neuronal networks. In this chapter, we review
several of the most popular and successful of these methods.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1802.01008</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Music, being a multifaceted stimulus evolving at multiple timescales,
modulates brain function in a manifold way that encompasses not only the
distinct stages of auditory perception but also higher cognitive processes like
memory and appraisal. Network theory is apparently a promising approach to
describe the functional reorganization of brain oscillatory dynamics during
music listening. However, the music induced changes have so far been examined
within the functional boundaries of isolated brain rhythms. Using naturalistic
music, we detected the functional segregation patterns associated with
different cortical rhythms, as these were reflected in the surface EEG
measurements. The emerged structure was compared across frequency bands to
quantify the interplay among rhythms. It was also contrasted against the
structure from the rest and noise listening conditions to reveal the specific
components stemming from music listening. Our methodology includes an efficient
graph-partitioning algorithm, which is further utilized for mining prototypical
modular patterns, and a novel algorithmic procedure for identifying switching
nodes that consistently change module during music listening. Our results
suggest the multiplex character of the music-induced functional reorganization
and particularly indicate the dependence between the networks reconstructed
from the {\delta} and {\beta}H rhythms. This dependence is further justified
within the framework of nested neural oscillations and fits perfectly within
the context of recently introduced cortical entrainment to music. Considering
its computational efficiency, and in conjunction with the flexibility of in
situ electroencephalography, it may lead to novel assistive tools for real-life
applications.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Certain concepts, words, and images are intuitively more similar than others
(dog vs. cat, dog vs. spoon), though quantifying such similarity is notoriously
difficult. Indeed, this kind of computation is likely a critical part of
learning the category boundaries for words within a given language. Here, we
use a set of 27 items (e.g. 'dog') that are highly common in infants' input,
and use both image- and word-based algorithms to independently compute
similarity among them. We find three key results. First, the pairwise item
similarities derived within image-space and word-space are correlated,
suggesting preserved structure among these extremely different representational
formats. Second, the closest 'neighbors' for each item, within each space,
showed significant overlap (e.g. both found 'egg' as a neighbor of 'apple').
Third, items with the most overlapping neighbors are later-learned by infants
and toddlers. We conclude that this approach, which does not rely on human
ratings of similarity, may nevertheless reflect stable within-class structure
across these two spaces. We speculate that such invariance might aid lexical
acquisition, by serving as an informative marker of category boundaries.

Mycolactone is the exotoxin produced by &lt;i&gt;Mycobacterium ulcerans&lt;/i&gt; and is the virulence factor behind the neglected tropical disease Buruli ulcer. The toxin has a broad spectrum of biological effects within the host organism, stemming from its interaction with at least two molecular targets and the inhibition of protein uptake into the endoplasmic reticulum. Although it has been shown that the toxin can passively permeate into host cells, it is clearly lipophilic. Association with lipid carriers would have substantial implications for the toxin’s distribution within a host organism, delivery to cellular targets, diagnostic susceptibility, and mechanisms of pathogenicity. Yet the toxin’s interactions with, and distribution in, lipids are unknown. Herein we have used coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations, guided by all-atom simulations, to study the interaction of mycolactone with pure and mixed lipid membranes. Using established techniques, we calculated the toxin’s preferential localization, membrane translocation, and impact on membrane physical and dynamical properties. The computed water-octanol partition coefficient indicates that mycolactone prefers to be in an organic phase rather than in an aqueous environment. Our results show that in a solvated membrane environment the exotoxin mainly localizes in the water-membrane interface, with a preference for the glycerol moiety of lipids, consistent with the reported studies that found it in lipid extracts of the cell. The calculated association constant to the model membrane is similar to the reported association constant for Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein. Mycolactone is shown to modify the physical properties of membranes, lowering the transition temperature, compressibility modulus, and critical line tension at which pores can be stabilized. It also shows a tendency to behave as a linactant, a molecule that localizes at the boundary between different fluid lipid domains in membranes and promotes inter-mixing of domains. This property has implications for the toxin’s cellular access, T-cell immunosuppression, and therapeutic potential.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/LYJj4QzsN_A&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) in microbial organisms have the potential to vastly improve the way we understand, manage, and treat infectious diseases. Yet, microbial GWAS methods established thus far remain insufficiently able to capitalise on the growing wealth of bacterial and viral genetic sequence data. Facing clonal population structure and homologous recombination, existing GWAS methods struggle to achieve both the precision necessary to reject spurious findings and the power required to detect associations in microbes. In this paper, we introduce a novel phylogenetic approach that has been tailor-made for microbial GWAS, which is applicable to organisms ranging from purely clonal to frequently recombining, and to both binary and continuous phenotypes. Our approach is robust to the confounding effects of both population structure and recombination, while maintaining high statistical power to detect associations. Thorough testing via application to simulated data provides strong support for the power and specificity of our approach and demonstrates the advantages offered over alternative cluster-based and dimension-reduction methods. Two applications to &lt;i&gt;Neisseria meningitidis&lt;/i&gt; illustrate the versatility and potential of our method, confirming previously-identified penicillin resistance loci and resulting in the identification of both well-characterised and novel drivers of invasive disease. Our method is implemented as an open-source R package called treeWAS which is freely available at https://github.com/caitiecollins/treeWAS.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/OLN5pMOESlw&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

The packaging of DNA inside a nucleus shows complex structure stabilized by a host of DNA-bound factors. Both the distribution of these factors and the contacts between different genomic locations of the DNA can now be measured on a genome-wide scale. This has advanced the development of models aimed at predicting the conformation of DNA given only the locations of bound factors—the chromatin folding problem. Here we present a maximum-entropy model that is able to predict a contact map representation of structure given a sequence of bound factors. Non-local effects due to the sequence neighborhood around contacting sites are found to be important for making accurate predictions. Lastly, we show that the model can be used to infer a sequence of bound factors given only a measurement of structure. This opens up the possibility for efficiently predicting sequence regions that may play a role in generating cell-type specific structural differences.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/O5rA1JNPMq0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) holoenzymes play a critical role in decoding Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; signals in neurons. Understanding how this occurs has been the focus of numerous studies including many that use models. However, CaMKII is notoriously difficult to simulate in detail because of its multi-subunit nature, which causes a combinatorial explosion in the number of species that must be modeled. To study the Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-calmodulin-CaMKII reaction network with detailed kinetics while including the effect of diffusion, we have customized an existing stochastic particle-based simulator, Smoldyn, to manage the problem of combinatorial explosion. With this new method, spatial and temporal aspects of the signaling network can be studied without compromising biochemical details. We used this new method to examine how calmodulin molecules, both partially loaded and fully loaded with Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, choose pathways to interact with and activate CaMKII under various Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; input conditions. We found that the dependence of CaMKII phosphorylation on Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; signal frequency is intrinsic to the network kinetics and the activation pattern can be modulated by the relative amount of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; to calmodulin and by the rate of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; diffusion. Depending on whether Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; influx is saturating or not, calmodulin molecules could choose different routes within the network to activate CaMKII subunits, resulting in different frequency dependence patterns. In addition, the size of the holoenzyme produces a subtle effect on CaMKII activation. The more extended the subunits are organized, the easier for calmodulin molecules to access and activate the subunits. The findings suggest that particular intracellular environmental factors such as crowding and calmodulin availability can play an important role in decoding Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; signals and can give rise to distinct CaMKII activation patterns in dendritic spines, Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; channel nanodomains and cytoplasm.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/yb7HPOwKnGo&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Clinical and animal model studies have shown that changes in PFC excitation and inhibition are important for cognitive functions as well as related disorders. Here, we discuss recent findings revealing the roles of the excitatory and inhibitory synaptic proteins neuroligin 1 (NLGN1) and NLGN2 in the PFC in memory formation and modulation of memory strength. We propose that shifts in NLGN1 and NLGN2 expression in specific excitatory and inhibitory neuronal subpopulations in response to experience regulate the dynamic processes of memory consolidation and strengthening. Because excitatory/inhibitory imbalances accompany neuropsychiatric disorders in which strength and flexibility of representations play important roles, understanding these mechanisms may suggest novel therapies. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content:encoded>

These limitations reflect what has been dichotomy between the structure and mechanical properties of living brain tissue and non-living neural probes. To bridge the gap between neural and electronic networks, we have introduced the new concept of mesh electronics probes designed with structural and mechanical properties such that the implant begins to ‘look and behave’ like neural tissue. Syringe-implanted mesh electronics have led to the realization of probes that are neuro-attractive and free of the chronic immune response, as well as capable of stable long-term mapping and modulation of brain activity at the single-neuron level. This review provides a historical overview of a 10-year development of mesh electronics by highlighting the tissue-like design, syringe-assisted delivery, seamless neural tissue integration, and single-neuron level chronic recording stability of mesh electronics. We also offer insights on unique near-term opportunities and future directions for neuroscience and neurology that now are available or expected for mesh electronics neurotechnologies. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content:encoded>

Human neuroimaging studies consistently show a hunger-dependent, selective enhancement of responses to images of food in association cortex and amygdala. More recently, cellular-resolution imaging combined with circuit mapping experiments in behaving mice have revealed underlying neuronal population dynamics and enabled tracing of pathways by which hunger circuits influence the assignment of value to visual objects in visual association cortex, insular cortex, and amygdala. These experiments begin to provide a mechanistic understanding of motivation-specific neural processing of need-relevant cues in healthy humans and in disease states such as obesity and other eating disorders. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content:encoded>

Since the earliest days of embryology, lineage questions have been addressed with methods of increasing specificity, capacity, and resolution. Yet, a full realization of individual cell lineages remains challenging for complex systems. A recent explosion of technical advances in genome-editing and single-cell sequencing has enabled lineage analysis in an unprecedented scale, speed, and depth across different species. In this review, we discuss the application of available as well as future genetic labeling techniques for tracking neural lineages in vivo in the mammalian nervous system. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content:encoded>

During development, individual gene activity can dynamically engage different signaling networks; thus genetic mutations can lead to different functional changes at different times. Interpretation of phenotypes can be further complicated if initial functional changes trigger compensatory mechanisms. Examining genetic mouse models of neurodevelopmental disorders reveals cellular phenotypes that change over the course of development and exist long before behavioral deficits are assessed. Correspondingly, earlier genetic interventions in these disorder models have often been more effective at improving behavioral deficits than late interventions. The restricted period of effective intervention demonstrates that identifying a target window is an essential component of treatment. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content:encoded>

Emerging evidence indicates that REST is a master transcriptional regulator of neuron-specific genes not only in neurogenesis and neuronal differentiation, but also in differentiated neurons during the critical period in postnatal brain development, where it plays a role in fine-tuning of genes involved in synaptic plasticity, and in normal aging, where it promotes neuroprotection by repressing genes involved in oxidative stress and β-amyloid toxicity. This review focuses on recent findings that dysregulation of REST and REST-dependent epigenetic remodeling provide a central mechanism critical to the progressive neurodegeneration associated with neurologic disorders and diseases including global ischemia, stroke, epilepsy, Alzheimer's and Huntington's disease. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content:encoded>

During the first three weeks of postnatal development, immature astrocytes express mGlu5 and expands several fold while undergoing a transition towards their mature phase. Although mGlu5-mediated signalling in astrocyte functions has been extensively studied in the last decades, whether this signalling is implicated in the mechanisms governing their development, as well as the effects of dysregulated astrocytic development on neurodevelopmental disorders, are still unclear. The aim of this review is to examine what is known about the mGlu5-mediated signalling in the developing astrocytes and its possible contribution to the pathophysiology of autism spectrum disorders. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content:encoded>

This neural activity reflects internal processes by which the brain plans and executes volitional movements. The study of motor planning offers an opportunity to understand how the structure and dynamics of neural circuits support persistent internal states and how these states influence behavior. Recent advances in large-scale neural recordings are beginning to decipher the relationship of the dynamics of populations of neurons during motor planning and movements. New behavioral tasks in rodents, together with quantified perturbations, link dynamics in specific nodes of neural circuits to behavior. These studies reveal a neural network distributed across multiple brain regions that collectively supports motor planning. We review recent advances and highlight areas where further work is needed to achieve a deeper understanding of the mechanisms underlying motor planning and related cognitive processes. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content:encoded>

These functions rely on the computation of the local cerebellar microcircuits and long-range connectivity that relays cerebellar output to various brain areas. In this review, we discuss recent work on two of the circuit elements, which are thought to be fundamental for a wide range of non-sensorimotor behaviors: The role for cerebellar granule cells in multimodal integration in the cerebellar cortex and the long-range connectivity between the deep cerebellar nuclei and the basal ganglia. Lastly, we discuss how studies on synapses and circuits of the cerebellum in rodent models of autism-spectrum disorders might contribute to our understanding of the pathophysiology of this class of neurodevelopmental disorders. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content:encoded>

Studies have found that sensory, prefrontal, hippocampal, cerebellar, and striatal regions, as well as the circuits that connect them, are perturbed in mouse models of ASD and ID. Dissecting the disruptions in morphology and activity in these neural circuits might help us to understand the shared risk between the two disorders as well as their clinical heterogeneity. Treatments that target the balance between excitation and inhibition in these regions are able to reverse pathological phenotypes, elucidating this deficit as a commonality across models and opening new avenues for intervention. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content:encoded>

Designing behavioral paradigms that provide a solid foundation to ask questions about decision-making computations and mechanisms is a difficult and often underestimated challenge. Here, we propose three dimensions on which we can consider rodent decision-making tasks: ethological validity, task complexity, and stimulus-response compatibility. We review recent research through this lens, and provide practical guidance for researchers in the decision-making field. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content:encoded>

These platforms leverage basic advances in biocompatible materials, semiconductor device designs and systems engineering concepts to afford modes of operation that are qualitatively distinct from those of conventional approaches that tether animals to external hardware by means of optical fibers, electrical cables and/or fluidic tubing. Neuroscience studies that exploit the unique features of these technologies enable insights into neural function through targeted stimulation, inhibition and recording, with spatially and genetically precise manipulation of neural circuit activity. Experimental possibilities include studies in naturalistic, three dimensional environments, investigations of pair-wise or group related social interactions and many other scenarios of interest that cannot be addressed using traditional hardware. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content:encoded>

Individual network components in the mushroom bodies of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster represent cues, learning signals and behavioral outcomes of learned experience. Recent findings have highlighted the importance of dopamine-driven plasticity and activity in feedback and feedforward connections, between various elements of the mushroom body neural network. These computational motifs have been shown to be crucial for long term olfactory memory consolidation, integration of internal states, re-evaluation and updating of learned information. The often recurrent circuit anatomy and a prolonged requirement for activity in parts of these underlying networks, suggest that self-sustained and precisely timed activity is a fundamental feature of network computations in the insect brain. Together these processes allow flies to continuously adjust the content of their learned knowledge and direct their behavior in a way that best represents learned expectations and serves their most pressing current needs. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content:encoded>

Numerous genes in the endo-lysosomal pathways have been found to associate with neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Mutations of these genes lead to dysfunction in multiple steps of the endo-lysosomal network: autophagy, endocytic trafficking and lysosomal degradation, resulting in accumulation of pathogenic proteins. Although the exact pathogenic mechanism varies for different disease-associated genes, dysfunction of the endo-lysosomal pathways represents a converging mechanism shared by these diseases. Therefore, strategies that correct or compensate for endo-lysosomal dysfunction may be promising therapeutic approaches to treat neurodegenerative diseases. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content:encoded>

These devices, usually sensing cell activity via microelectrodes, should be characterized by safe working conditions in the biological milieu together with a well-controlled operation-life. The stable device/neuronal electrical coupling at the interface requires tight interactions between the electrode surface and the cell membrane. This neuro-electrode hybrid represents the hyphen between the soft nature of neural tissue, generating electrical signals via ion motions, and the rigid realm of microelectronics and medical devices, dealing with electrons in motion. Efficient integration of these entities is essential for monitoring, analyzing and controlling neuronal signaling but poses significant technological challenges. Improving the cell/electrode interaction and thus the interface performance requires novel engineering of (nano)materials: tuning at the nanoscale electrode's properties may lead to engineer interfacing probes that better camouflaged with their biological target. In this brief review, we highlight the most recent concepts in nanotechnologies and nanomaterials that might help reducing the mismatch between tissue and electrode, focusing on the device's mechanical properties and its biological integration with the tissue. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content:encoded>

Activation of excitatory glutamatergic synapses leads to their shuttling from the synapse to the nucleus, mostly importin-mediated, and subsequent regulation of gene transcription needed for long lasting modifications of synaptic function. Accordingly, increasing evidences show that alterations of the activity of synaptonuclear messengers are correlated to synaptic failure as observed in different synaptopathies. Specifically, recent studies demonstrate that the modulation of the activity of synaptonuclear messengers could represent a novel molecular target in the pathogenesis of both neurodevelopmental disorders and neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Predicting clinical diagnosis in Huntington's disease: An imaging polymarker</title>
	<link>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25171</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h3&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Objective&lt;/b&gt;: Huntington's disease (HD) gene-carriers can be identified prior to clinical diagnosis; however, statistical models for predicting when overt motor symptoms will manifest are too imprecise to be useful at the level of the individual. Perfecting this prediction is integral to the search for disease modifying therapies. This study aimed to identify an imaging marker capable of reliably predicting real-life clinical diagnosis in HD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Method&lt;/b&gt;: A multivariate machine learning approach was applied to resting-state and structural MRI scans from 19 pre-manifest HD gene carriers (preHD, 8 of whom developed clinical disease in the 5 years post-scanning) and 21 healthy controls. A classification model was developed using cross-group comparisons between preHD and controls, and within the preHD group in relation to “estimated” and “actual” proximity to disease onset. Imaging measures were modelled individually, and combined, and permutation modelling robustly tested classification accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Results&lt;/b&gt;: Classification performance for preHDs vs. controls was greatest when all measures were combined. The resulting polymarker predicted converters with high accuracy including those who were not expected to manifest in that timescale based on the currently adopted statistical models.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Interpretation&lt;/b&gt;: We propose that a holistic multivariate machine learning treatment of brain abnormalities in the premanifest phase can be used to accurately identify those patients within 5 years of developing motor features of Huntington's disease, with implications for prognostication and preclinical trials.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Orthostatic Heart Rate Changes in Patients with Autonomic Failure caused by Neurodegenerative Synucleinopathies</title>
	<link>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25170</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h3&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Objective&lt;/b&gt;: Blunted tachycardia during hypotension is a characteristic feature of patients with autonomic failure, but the range has not been defined. This study reports the range of orthostatic heart rate (HR) changes in patients with autonomic failure caused by neurodegenerative synucleinopathies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Methods&lt;/b&gt;: Patients evaluated at sites of the U.S. Autonomic Consortium (NCT01799915) underwent standardized autonomic function tests and full neurological evaluation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Results&lt;/b&gt;: We identified 402 patients with orthostatic hypotension (OH) who had normal sinus rhythm. Of these, 378 had impaired sympathetic activation, i.e., neurogenic OH, and based on their neurological examination were diagnosed with Parkinson disease, dementia with Lewy bodies, pure autonomic failure or multiple system atrophy. The remaining 24 patients had preserved sympathetic activation and their OH was classified as non-neurogenic, due to volume depletion, anemia or polypharmacy. Patients with neurogenic OH had twice the fall in systolic blood pressure (SBP) [-44±25 vs. -21±14 mmHg (mean±SD), p&amp;lt;0.0001] but only one third of the increase in HR than those with non-neurogenic OH (8±8 vs. 25±11 bpm, p&amp;lt;0.0001). A ΔHR/ΔSBP ratio of 0.492 bpm/mmHg had excellent sensitivity (91.3%) and specificity (88.4%) to distinguish between patients with neurogenic vs. non-neurogenic OH (AUC=0.96, p&amp;lt;0.0001). Within patients with neurogenic OH, HR increased more in those with multiple system atrophy (p=0.0003), but there was considerable overlap with patients with Lewy body disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Interpretation&lt;/b&gt;: A blunted HR increase during hypotension suggests a neurogenic cause. A ΔHR/ΔSBP ratio lower than 0.5 bpm/mmHg is diagnostic of neurogenic OH. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1802.00753</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Byrne and colleagues present a paper on a timely topic with potentially
important results. However, we think that issues in the design and analysis
complicate the interpretation and limit the generalizability of the findings.
Specifically, the details of the small volume correction used in the primary
analysis are not adequately described and, moreover, the results do not appear
to be corroborated by the whole-brain analysis. In addition, the follow-up
multilevel modeling, which is fundamental to the conclusions of the paper, is
inherently circular thereby guaranteeing discovery of the reported effect.
Finally, the study does not control for other factors that vary over the course
of the day and are known to impact MRI measurements, and fails to link the
neural results directly to any relevant behavior.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The hippocampus and the striatum support episodic and procedural memory,
respectively, and &quot;place&quot; and &quot;response&quot; learning within spatial navigation.
Recently this dichotomy has been linked to &quot;model-based&quot; and &quot;model-free&quot;
reinforcement learning. Here we present a well-constrained neural model of how
both systems support spatial navigation, and apply the same model to more
abstract problems such as sequential decision making. In particular, we show
that if a task can be transformed into a Markov Decision Process, the machinery
provided by the hippocampus and striatum can be utilized to solve it. These
results show how the hippocampal complex can represent non-spatial problems,
including context, probabilities and action-dependent information, in support
of &quot;model-based&quot; reinforcement learning to complement learning within the
striatum.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Many recent efforts in computational modeling of macro-scale brain dynamics

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Neurofeedback Tunes Scale-Free Dynamics in Spontaneous Brain Activity. (arXiv:1512.09133v3 [q-bio.NC] UPDATED)</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.09133</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Brain oscillations exhibit long-range temporal correlations (LRTCs), which
reflect the regularity of their fluctuations: low values representing more
random (decorrelated) while high values more persistent (correlated) dynamics.
LRTCs constitute supporting evidence that the brain operates near criticality,
a state where neuronal activities are balanced between order and randomness.
Here, healthy adults used closed-loop brain training (neurofeedback, NFB) to
reduce the amplitude of alpha oscillations, producing a significant increase in
spontaneous LRTCs post-training. This effect was reproduced in patients with
post-traumatic stress disorder, where abnormally random dynamics were reversed
by NFB, correlating with significant improvements in hyperarousal. Notably,
regions manifesting abnormally low LRTCs (i.e., excessive randomness)
normalized toward healthy population levels, consistent with theoretical
predictions about self-organized criticality. Hence, when exposed to
appropriate training, spontaneous cortical activity reveals a residual capacity
for &quot;self-tuning&quot; its own temporal complexity, despite manifesting the abnormal
dynamics seen in individuals with psychiatric disorder. Lastly, we observed an
inverse-U relationship between strength of LRTC and oscillation amplitude,
suggesting a breakdown of long-range dependence at high/low synchronization
extremes, in line with recent computational models. Together, our findings
offer a broader mechanistic framework for motivating research and clinical
applications of NFB, encompassing disorders with perturbed LRTCs.

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/260562v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>RNA splicing is a key mechanism linking genetic variation and complex diseases, including schizophrenia. Splicing profiles are particularly diverse in the brain, but it is difficult to accurately identify and quantify full-length isoforms using standard approaches. CACNA1C is a large gene that shows robust genetic associations with several psychiatric disorders and encodes multiple, functionally-distinct voltage-gated calcium channels via alternative splicing. We combined long-range PCR with nanopore sequencing to characterise the full-length coding sequences of the CACNA1C gene in human brain. We show that its splice isoform profile varies between brain regions and is substantially more complex than currently appreciated: we identified 38 novel exons and 83 high confidence novel isoforms, many of which are predicted to alter protein function. Our findings demonstrate the capability of long-read amplicon sequencing to effectively characterise human splice isoform diversity, while the accurate characterisation of CACNA1C isoforms will facilitate the identification of disease-linked isoforms.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/260422v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Spontaneous emergence of synchronized population activity is a characteristic feature of developing brain circuits. Recent experiments in the developing neo-cortex showed the existence of driver cells able to impact the synchronization dynamics when single-handedly stimulated. We have developed a spiking network model capable to reproduce the experimental results, thus identifying two classes of driver cells: functional hubs and low functionally connected (LC) neurons. The functional hubs arranged in a clique orchestrated the synchronization build-up, while the LC drivers were lately or not at all recruited in the synchronization process. Notwithstanding, they were able to alter the network state when stimulated by modifying the temporal activation of the functional clique or even its composition. LC drivers can lead either to higher population synchrony or even to the arrest of population dynamics, upon stimulation. Noticeably, some LC driver can display both effects depending on the received stimulus. We show that in the model the presence of inhibitory neurons together with the assumption that younger cells are more excitable and less connected is crucial for the emergence of LC drivers. These results provide a further understanding of the structural-functional mechanisms underlying synchronized firings in developing circuits possibly related to the coordinated activity of cell assemblies in the adult brain.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/260299v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>The current study presents a re-analysis of data from Zink et al. (1998, Electroencephalography and Clinical Neurophysiology, 107), who administered galvanic vestibular stimulation through unipolar direct current. They placed electrodes on each mastoid, and applied both right and left anodal stimulation. Ocular torsion and visual tilt were measured under different stimulation intensities. New modelling introduced here demonstrates that directly proportional linear models fit reasonably well to the relationship between vestibular input and visual tilt, but not to that between vestibular input and ocular torsion. Instead, an exponential model characterised by a decreasing slope and an asymptote fitted best. These results demonstrate that in the results presented by Zink et al., ocular torsion could not completely account for visual tilt. This suggests that vestibular input is processed centrally to stabilise vision when ocular torsion is insufficient. Potential mechanisms and seemingly conflicting literature are discussed.</content:encoded>

In this study, we identified transmitted genetic mutations in the CNTNAP3 gene from Chinese Han ASD cohorts and Simons Simplex Collections. We found that CNTNAP3 interacted with synaptic adhesion proteins Neuroligin1 and Neuroligin2, as well as scaffolding proteins PSD95 and Gephyrin. Importantly, we found that CNTNAP3 plays an opposite role in controlling development of excitatory and inhibitory synapses in vitro and in vivo, in which ASD mutants exhibited loss-of-function effects. We showed that Cntnap3-null mice exhibited deficits in social interaction and spatial learning. These evidences elucidate the pivotal role of CNTNAP3 in synapse development and social behavior, providing the mechanistic insights for ASD.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/260075v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Advances in calcium imaging have made it possible to record from an increasingly larger number of neurons simultaneously. Neuroscientists can now routinely image hundreds to thousands of individual neurons. With the continued neurotechnology development effort, it is expected that millions of neurons could soon be simultaneously measured. An emerging technical challenge that parallels the advancement in imaging such a large number of individual neurons is the processing of correspondingly large datasets, an important step of which is the identification of individual neurons. Traditional methods rely mainly on manual or semi-manual inspection, which cannot be scaled to processing large datasets. To address this challenge, we have developed an automated cell segmentation method, which is referred to as Automated Cell Segmentation by Adaptive Thresholding (ACSAT). ACSAT includes an iterative procedure that automatically calculates global and local threshold values during each iteration based on image pixel intensities. As such, the algorithm is capable of handling morphological variations and dynamic changes in fluorescence intensities in different calcium imaging datasets. In addition, ACSAT computes adaptive threshold values based on a time-collapsed image that is representative of the image sequence, and thus ACSAT provides segmentation results at a fast speed. We tested the algorithm on wide-field calcium imaging datasets in the brain regions of hippocampus and striatum in mice. ACSAT achieved precision and recall rates of approximately 80% when compared to individual neurons that are verified by human inspection. Additionally, ACSAT successfully detected low-intensity neurons that were initially undetected by humans.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Two Novel Forms of ERG Oscillation in Drosophila: Age and Activity Dependence</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/259952v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Over an animal's lifespan, neuronal circuits and systems often decline in an inherently heterogeneous fashion. To compare the age-dependent progression of changes in visual behavior with alterations in retinal physiology, we examined phototaxis and electroretinograms (ERGs) in a wild-type D. melanogaster strain (Canton-S) across their lifespan. In aged flies (beyond 50% median lifespan), we found a marked decline in phototaxis, while motor coordination was less disrupted, as indicated by relatively stronger negative geotaxis. These aged flies displayed substantially reduced ERG transient amplitudes while the receptor potentials (RP) remained largely intact. Using a repetitive light flash protocol, we serendipitously discovered two forms of activity-dependent oscillation in the ERG waveforms of young flies: &quot;light-off&quot; and &quot;light-on&quot; oscillations. After repeated 500 ms light flashes, light-off oscillations appeared during the ERG off-transients (frequency: 50-120 Hz, amplitude: ~1 mV). Light-on oscillations (100-200 Hz, ~0.3 mV) were induced by a series of 50 ms flashes, and were evident during the ERG on-transients. Both forms of oscillation were observed in other strains of D. melanogaster (Oregon-R, Berlin), additional Drosophila species (funerbris, euronotus, hydei, americana), and were evoked by a variety of light sources. Both light-off and light-on oscillations were distinct from previously described ERG oscillations in visual mutants, such as rosA, in terms of location within the waveform and frequency. However, within rosA mutants, light-off oscillations, but not light-on oscillations could be recruited by the repetitive light flash protocol. Importantly though, we found that both forms of oscillation were rarely observed in aged flies. Although the physiological bases of these oscillations remain to be elucidated, they may provide important clues to age-related changes in neuronal excitability and synaptic transmission.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Mosaic representations of odors in the input and output layers of the mouse olfactory bulb</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/259945v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Unlike for other sensory modalities, the elementary stimulus features encoded by the olfactory system remain poorly understood. Here we examine the relationship between the activity of olfactory bulb inputs and outputs, and 1,666 physical-chemical descriptors of odors in awake mice. We find that glomerular and M/T cell responses are sparse and locally heterogeneous, with only a coarse dependence of glomerular positions on physical-chemical properties. Ensembles of M/T cells and glomeruli respond to different features of odors, consistent with extensive interplay between feedforward and feedback inputs to the bulb. This reformatting is well-described as a rotation in odor space. Overall, the descriptors account for a small fraction in response variance, and the similarity of odors in physical-chemical space is a poor predictor of similarity in neuronal representations. Our results suggest that commonly used physical-chemical properties are not systematically represented in the bulb activity and encourage further search for better descriptors of odor space.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Conceptual content in images triggers rapid shifts of covert attention</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/259929v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>The visual system can use conceptual information to search for targets even in the absence of clear featural signifiers, and visual saccades are often directed at target objects defined by conceptual content. These abilities are a core component of our facility with the visual world. Here, we evaluate whether contingent mechanisms of visual attention, known to trigger in response to target features such as motion, color or luminance, are also triggered by visual patterns that match conceptually specified categories. These pre-registered experiments provide convergent behavioral and electrophysiological support that attention is rapidly triggered by natural image exemplars from superordinate conceptually described target sets such as dinner food or four-legged animal, causing a rapid, spatially selective, covert enhancement of visual input, even though images were never repeated within a given experiment. In the behavioral experiment, two such targets presented in sequence elicited higher accuracy for reporting the second when it appeared in the same spatial location as the first. In the EEG experiment, target images elicited clear N2pc and P3 components only when those images matched the conceptually specified target set. The same images elicited no comparable waveforms when they were not of the target set. The latency of the N2pc peaked at roughly 250ms, which is comparable to that commonly found in other N2pc studies for simpler stimulus types. These results suggest that vision is able to quickly decode conceptual information from natural images and selectively deploy spatial attention to locations containing information that matches current search goals.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/259853v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Humans are highly skilled at analysing complex auditory scenes. Previously we showed that the auditory brainstem response to speech is modulated by selective attention, a result that we achieved through developing a novel method for measuring the brainstem's response to running speech (Forte et al. 2017). Here we demonstrate that the attentional modulation of the brainstem response to speech can be employed to decode the attentional focus of a listener in real time, from short measurements of ten seconds or less in duration. The decoding is based on complex statistical models for extracting the brainstem response from multi-channel scalp recordings and subsequent classification of the model performances according to the focus of attention. We further show how a few recording channels as well as out-of-the-box decoding that employs population average models achieve a high accuracy from short recordings as well.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Conditioned flavor preference (CFP) learning is a form of associative learning in ingestive behavior. CFP Learning can be rapid and produces preferences of varying strengths that can be exceptionally persistent. We sought to establish a method to produce a robust long-lasting CFP in rats. Rats were given 48-h access (conditioning) to a CS+ flavor (grape or cherry 0.05% Kool-Aid, counterbalanced) mixed with 8% glucose and 0.05% saccharin. In order to determine the strength of conditioning rats were given 14 consecutive days of 24-h access to CS+ and CS- flavors mixed only with 0.05% Kool-Aid and 0.05% saccharin (extinction), then further tested 34 days after the last extinction test (48 days post conditioning) for 2 consecutive days with the CS+ and CS-. We found that not only did the learned CFP fail to extinguish over 14 days of testing, but it also persisted for at least 48 days after conditioning. These data provide a method to produce a robust, long lasting and persistent CFP for use in future ingestive behavior research.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/259713v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Brain organization can be appreciated across multiple spatial and temporal scales, where each scale affects the other in the emergent functions that we appreciate as cognition. As a complex adaptive system, the interplay of these scales in the brain represents the information that ultimately supports what we think and do. The dynamics of these multiscale operations can be quantified with measures of complexity, which are sensitive to the balance between information that is coded in local cell populations and that captured in the network interactions between populations. This local vs. global balance has its foundation in the structural connectivity of the brain, which is then realized through the dynamics of cell populations and their ensuing interactions with other populations. Considering brain function and cognition in this way enables a different perspective on the changes in cognitive function in aging. Our initial work examined changes in brain signal complexity from childhood to adulthood. Across two independent studies, we observed an overall increase in signal complexity with maturation, which also correlated with more stable and accurate cognitive performance. There was some suggestion that the maximal change occurs in medial posterior cortical areas, which have been considered network hubs of the brain. In extending to study to healthy aging, we observed a scale dependent change in brain complexity across three independent studies. Healthy aging brings a shift in local/global balance, where more information is coded in local dynamics and less in global interactions. This balance is associated with better cognitive performance, and interestingly in a more active lifestyle. It also seems that the lack of this shift in local/global balance is predictive of worse cognitive performance and potentially predictive of additional decline indicative of dementia.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/259333v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Blood-borne factors regulate adult hippocampal neurogenesis (AHN) and cognition in mammals, albeit via mechanisms that are poorly understood. We report that elevating circulating unacylated-ghrelin (UAG), using both pharmacological and genetic methods, reduced hippocampal neurogenesis and plasticity in mice. Spatial memory impairments observed in GOAT-/- mice that lack acyl-ghrelin (AG) but have high levels of UAG, were rescued by treatment with AG. This unexpected finding suggests that the post-translational acylation of ghrelin is an important modulator of neurogenesis and memory in adult mammals. To determine whether this paradigm is relevant to humans we analysed circulating AG:UAG levels in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients diagnosed with dementia (PDD), cognitively intact PD patients and healthy controls. Uniquely, the ratio of plasma AG:UAG was reduced in the PDD cohort and correlated with cognitive performance. Our results identify UAG as a novel regulator of neurogenesis and cognition, and AG:UAG as a circulating diagnostic biomarker of dementia. The findings extend our understanding of adult brain plasticity regulation by circulating factors and suggest that manipulating the post-translational acylation of plasma ghrelin may offer therapeutic opportunities to ameliorate cognitive decline.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/246819v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Non-invasive brain stimulation techniques, such as transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), play a growing role in the treatment of neurological disorders. However, the mechanisms by which electric fields modulate cortical network activity are only partially understood. To explore the spatiotemporal modulation of cortical activity by electric fields (DC fields), we exposed neocortical slices to constant fields of varying intensity and polarity and we measured their effect on the slow (&amp;lt;1 Hz) and high frequencies (beta 15-30 Hz and gamma 30-90 Hz) of spontaneously generated oscillations. Slow oscillations consist of Up (active) and Down (silent) states. We found that DC fields ranging from -6 to +6 V/m induced an exponential increase in the frequency of slow oscillations through the regulation of the excitability and duration of Down states, while hardly affecting Up states duration. A computational model based on the mean field theory of attractor dynamics provided a mechanistic and quantitative description of the network dynamics underlying such precise modulation of slow oscillatory frequency. The modulation of high frequencies by DC fields was less consistent, the high frequency power varying with the intensity of the fields only in a fraction of slices. Interestingly, negative DC fields of increasing intensities progressively and effectively reversed the increase in high frequency power induced by kainate application. Our findings have implications for the understanding of cortical oscillations and the mechanisms by which they are modulated by DC fields, and may contribute to the future development of tools with an accurate spatiotemporal control of cortical activity.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/259671v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Motor memory is an important learning feature. How its consolidation depends on sleep is still unsolved. Some motor tasks were previously shown to depend on sleep to some extent, whereas pure non-hippocampal dependent motor tasks, like motor adaptation, might not. However, recent research suggests that training schedules might affect the sleep dependency of motor adaptation tasks. This study investigated whether sleep differentially impacts memory consolidation on a motor adaptation task dependent on the training schedule. Healthy men were trained with their dominant right hand on a force field adaptation task and re-tested after an 11-h consolidation period either involving overnight sleep (Sleep group) or daytime wakefulness (Wake group). The Retest session comprised a Posttest and a Transfer test to the left hand. Half of the subjects in each group trained the adaptation to different force field magnitudes in a blocked schedule with low inter-trial variability (Sleep-Blocked; Wake-Blocked), the other half in a random schedule with high variability (Sleep-Random; Wake-Random). EEG records during task performance and overnight polysomnography was obtained. Consistent with the notion that sleep generally does not benefit motor adaptation, memory performance did not differ between Wake and Sleep groups, although Posttest performance specifically correlated with sleep spindles nesting in slow wave upstates. Increased, inter-trial variability at Training produced better performance at the Posttest and Transfer test. This improvement appeared to result from the participants increased ability to use feedback for ongoing movement corrections, and correlated with EEG alpha power over the left parietal cortex during the task.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/259457v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>An important unresolved question about neural processing is the mechanism by which distant brain areas coordinate their activities and relate their local processing to global neural events. A potential candidate for the local-global integration are slow rhythms such as respiration, which is also linked to sensory exploration. In this article, we asked if there are modulations of local cortical processing which are time-locked to (peripheral) sensory-motor exploratory rhythms. We studied rats freely behaving on an elevated platform where they would display exploratory and rest behaviors. Concurrent with behavior, we monitored orofacial sampling rhythms (whisking and sniffing) and local field potentials (LFP) from olfactory bulb, dorsal hippocampus, primary motor cortex, primary somatosensory cortex and primary visual cortex. We defined exploration as simultaneous whisking and sniffing above 5 Hz and found that this activity peaked at about 8 Hz. We considered rest as the absence of whisking and sniffing, and in this case, mean respiration occurred at about 3 Hz. We found a consistent shift across all areas toward these rhythm peaks accompanying behavioral state changes. We also found, across areas, that LFP gamma (70-100 Hz) amplitude could time-lock to the animal's respiratory rhythm, a finding indicative of respiration-locked changes in local processing. The respiratory rhythm, although occurring at the same frequencies of hippocampal theta, was not spectrally coherent with it, implying a different oscillator. Our results are consistent with the notion of respiration as a binder or integrator of activity between distant brain regions.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Objective: Young children are often unable to remain still for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Various preparation methods have been reported to avoid sedation or anesthesia, with mixed success rates and feasibility. Here we describe a time-efficient preparation method and factors associated with successful scanning in young chdilren. We recruited 134 children aged 2.0-5.0 years for an MRI study. Some children completed a training session on a mock scanner, and all children received a 15-20 minute introduction to scanning procedures immediately before their scan. We compared success between children receiving mock scanner training or not, and evaluated demographic or cognitive factors that predicted success. Results: 97 children (72%) completed at least one sequence successfully; 64 children provided high-quality data for all 3 sequences. Cognitive scores were higher in successful children, but children who received mock scanner training were less likely to be successful. A case-controlled comparison of children matched on age, gender, and cognitive scores found no differences between children receiving training or not. We present a quick method for preparing young children for awake MRI scans. Our data suggests limited advantages of mock scanner preparation for healthy young children, and that cognitive abilities may help predict success.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/222448v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Flying animals need constant sensory feedback about their body position and orientation for flight control. The visual system provides valuable but slow feedback. In contrast, mechanosensory channels can provide feedback at much shorter response times. How the contributions from the two senses are integrated is still an open question in most insect groups. In Diptera, fast mechanosensory feedback is provided by organs called halteres, and is crucial for the control of rapid flight manoeuvres, while vision controls manoeuvres in lower temporal frequency bands. Here we have investigated the visual-mechanosensory integration in an insect which lacks halteres: the hawkmoth Macroglossum stellatarum. It is representative for a large group of insects that use mechanoreceptive Johnston's organs in their antennae to provide gyroscopic feedback on perturbations in body position. High-speed videos of freely-flying hawkmoths hovering at stationary or oscillating artificial flowers show that positional fidelity during flight was reduced in antennectomised animals, but was rescued after antennal re-attachment. Our experiments show that antennal mechanosensory feedback specifically supports fast flight manoeuvres (flower oscillations between 2-6 Hz), but not slow ones. Differences in the reliability of visual feedback (in different light intensities) affected all antennal conditions equally, suggesting there was no compensatory interaction between antennal and visual feedback under the conditions tested. These results establish the importance of antennal mechanosensors in providing rapid mechanosensory feedback for finer control of flight manoeuvres, acting in parallel to visual feedback.</content:encoded>

Genetic networks from post-mortem human brain revealed 84 partner genes co-expressed with &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;DRD2&lt;/span&gt;. Moreover, eight functional single nucleotide polymorphisms combined into a polygenic co-expression index (PCI) predicted co-expression of this &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;DRD2&lt;/span&gt; network and were associated with prefrontal function in humans. Here, we investigated the non-linear association of the PCI with behavioral and Working Memory (WM) related brain response to pharmacological D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Rs stimulation. Fifty healthy volunteers took part in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, functional MRI (fMRI) study with bromocriptine and performed the N-Back task. The PCI by drug interaction was significant on both WM behavioral scores (&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;P&lt;/span&gt; = 0.046) and related prefrontal activity (all corrected &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;P&lt;/span&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05) using a polynomial PCI model. Non-linear responses under placebo were reversed by bromocriptine administration. fMRI results on placebo were replicated in an independent sample of 50 participants who did not receive drug administration (&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;P&lt;/span&gt; = 0.034). These results match earlier evidence in non-human primates and confirm the physiological relevance of this &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;DRD2&lt;/span&gt; co-expression network. Results show that in healthy subjects, different alleles evaluated as an ensemble are associated with non-linear prefrontal responses.

While both intrinsic and extrinsic cues are known to influence this process, whether distinct neuronal progenitor groups contribute to neuron diversity and allocation is poorly understood. Using in vivo genetic fate-mapping combined with whole-cell patch clamp recording, we show that the firing pattern and apical dendritic morphology of excitatory neurons in layer 4 of the barrel cortex are specified in part by their neural precursor lineage. Further, we show that separate precursors contribute to unique features of barrel cortex topography including the intralaminar position and thalamic innervation of the neurons they generate. Importantly, many of these lineage-specified characteristics are different from those previously measured for pyramidal neurons in layers 2–3 of the frontal cortex. Collectively, our data elucidate a dynamic temporal program in neuronal precursors that fine-tunes the properties of their progeny according to the lamina of destination.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Rhythmic synchronization of neurons is known to affect neuronal interactions. In the motor system, oscillatory power fluctuations modulate corticospinal excitability. However, previous research addressing phase-specific gain modulation in the motor system has resulted in contradictory findings. It remains unclear how many time windows of increased responsiveness each oscillatory cycle provides. Moreover, we still lack conclusive evidence as to whether the motor cortex entails an intrinsic response modulation along the rhythm cycle, as shown for spinal neurons. We investigated this question with single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation over the primary motor cortex at rest. Application of near-motor threshold stimuli revealed a frequency- and phase-specific gain modulation at both cortical and spinal level, independent of the spontaneous oscillatory power fluctuations at each level. We detected bilateral sensorimotor circuits in the lower beta-band (14–17 Hz) and unilateral corticospinal circuits in the upper beta-band (20–24 Hz). These findings provide novel evidence that intrinsic activity in the human motor cortex modulates input gain along the beta oscillatory cycle within distinct circuits. In accordance with periodic alternations of synchronous hyper- and depolarization, increased neuronal responsiveness occurred once per oscillatory beta cycle. This information may lead to new brain state-dependent and circuit-specific interventions for targeted neuromodulation.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Half a century ago, Donald Hebb posited that mental imagery is a constructive process that emulates perception. Specifically, Hebb claimed that visual imagery results from the reactivation of neural activity associated with viewing images. He also argued that neural reactivation and imagery benefit from the re-enactment of eye movement patterns that first occurred at viewing (fixation reinstatement). To investigate these claims, we applied multivariate pattern analyses to functional MRI (fMRI) and eye tracking data collected while healthy human participants repeatedly viewed and visualized complex images. We observed that the specificity of neural reactivation correlated positively with vivid imagery and with memory for stimulus image details. Moreover, neural reactivation correlated positively with fixation reinstatement, meaning that image-specific eye movements accompanied image-specific patterns of brain activity during visualization. These findings support the conception of mental imagery as a simulation of perception, and provide evidence consistent with the supportive role of eye movement in neural reactivation.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

However, the neural substrates that regulate adaptive communications between brain regions are understudied. In this human fMRI study, we investigated this issue by tracking time-varying, task-evoked changes in functional connectivity between localized occipitotemporal regions while participants performed different tasks on the same visually presented stimuli. We found that functional connectivity between ventral temporal and the primary visual regions selectively increased during the processing of task-relevant information. Further, additional task demands selectively strengthen these targeted connectivity patterns. To identify candidate regions that contribute to this increase in inter-regional coupling, we regressed the task-specific time-varying connectivity strength between primary visual and occipitotemporal regions against voxel-wise activity patterns elsewhere in the brain. This allowed us to identify a set of frontal and parietal regions whose activity increased as a function of task-evoked functional connectivity.

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Verbal Creativity Correlates with the Temporal Variability of Brain Networks During the Resting State</title>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy010/4836784?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Creativity is the ability to see the world in new ways. Creative individuals exhibit the ability to switch between different modes of thinking and shift their mental focus. This suggests a connection between creativity and dynamic interactions of brain networks. We report here the first investigation into the relationship between the reconfiguration of dynamic brain networks during the resting state and verbal creativity using two fMRI datasets involving 574 subjects. We find that verbal creativity correlates with temporal variability of the functional-connectivity (FC) patterns of the lateral prefrontal cortex, the precuneus, and the parahippocampal gyrus. High variability of these regions indicates flexible connectivity patterns which may facilitate executive functions. Furthermore, verbal creativity correlates with the temporal variability of FC patterns within the default mode network (DMN), between the DMN and attention/sensorimotor network, and between control and sensory networks. High variability of FCs between the DMN and attention networks characterizes frequent adjustments of attention. Finally, dynamic interaction between the cerebellum and task control network also contributes to verbal creativity, suggesting a relationship between the cerebellum and creativity. This study reveals a close relationship between verbal creativity and high variability of cortical networks involved in spontaneous thought, attention and cognitive control.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Single Neurons in Anterior Cingulate Cortex Signal the Need to Change Action During Performance of a Stop-change Task that Induces Response Competition</title>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy008/4836782?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Several human imaging studies have suggested that anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) is highly active when participants receive competing inputs, and that these signals may be important for influencing the downstream planning of actions. Despite increasing evidence from several neuroimaging studies, no study has examined ACC activity at the level of the single neuron in rodents performing similar tasks. To fill this gap, we recorded from single neurons in ACC while rats performed a stop-change task. We found higher firing on trials with competing inputs (STOP trials), and that firing rates were positively correlated with accuracy and movement speed, suggesting that when ACC was engaged, rats tended to slow down and perform better. Finally, firing was the strongest when STOP trials were preceded by GO trials and was reduced when rats adapted their behavior on trials subsequent to a STOP trial. These data provide the first evidence that activity of single neurons in ACC is elevated when 2 responses are in competition with each other when there is a need to change the course of action to obtain reward.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Temporal Regulation of Dendritic Spines Through NrCAM-Semaphorin3F Receptor Signaling in Developing Cortical Pyramidal Neurons</title>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy004/4836779?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Neuron-glial related cell adhesion molecule NrCAM is a newly identified negative regulator of spine density that genetically interacts with Semaphorin3F (Sema3F), and is implicated in autism spectrum disorders (ASD). To investigate a role for NrCAM in spine pruning during the critical adolescent period when networks are established, we generated novel conditional, inducible NrCAM mutant mice (Nex1Cre-ERT2: NrCAMflox/flox). We demonstrate that NrCAM functions cell autonomously during adolescence in pyramidal neurons to restrict spine density in the visual (V1) and medial frontal cortex (MFC). Guided by molecular modeling, we found that NrCAM promoted clustering of the Sema3F holoreceptor complex by interfacing with Neuropilin-2 (Npn2) and PDZ scaffold protein SAP102. NrCAM-induced receptor clustering stimulated the Rap-GAP activity of PlexinA3 (PlexA3) within the holoreceptor complex, which in turn, inhibited Rap1-GTPase and inactivated adhesive β1 integrins, essential for Sema3F-induced spine pruning. These results define a developmental function for NrCAM in Sema3F receptor signaling that limits dendritic spine density on cortical pyramidal neurons during adolescence.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Training and Spontaneous Reinforcement of Neuronal Assemblies by Spike Timing Plasticity</title>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy001/4836778?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;The synaptic connectivity of cortex is plastic, with experience shaping the ongoing interactions between neurons. Theoretical studies of spike timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) have focused on either just pairs of neurons or large-scale simulations. A simple analytic account for how fast spike time correlations affect both microscopic and macroscopic network structure is lacking. We develop a low-dimensional mean field theory for STDP in recurrent networks and show the emergence of assemblies of strongly coupled neurons with shared stimulus preferences. After training, this connectivity is actively reinforced by spike train correlations during the spontaneous dynamics. Furthermore, the stimulus coding by cell assemblies is actively maintained by these internally generated spiking correlations, suggesting a new role for noise correlations in neural coding. Assembly formation has often been associated with firing rate-based plasticity schemes; our theory provides an alternative and complementary framework, where fine temporal correlations and STDP form and actively maintain learned structure in cortical networks.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;The postnatal subventricular zone (SVZ) harbors neural stem cells (NSCs) that exhibit robust neurogenesis. However, the epigenetic mechanisms that maintain NSCs and regulate neurogenesis remain unclear. We report that label-retaining SVZ NSCs express Eed, the core component of Polycomb repressive complex 2. In vivo and in vitro conditional knockout and knockdown show Eed is necessary for maintaining NSC proliferation, neurogenesis and neurosphere formation. We discovered that Eed functions to maintain p21 protein levels in NSCs by repressing Gata6 transcription. Both Gata6 overexpression and p21 knockdown reduced neurogenesis, while Gata6 knockdown or p21 overexpression partially rescued neurogenesis after Eed loss. Furthermore, genetic deletion of Eed impaired injury induced SVZ proliferation and emigration. These data reveal a novel epigenetic regulated pathway and suggest an essential role for Eed in SVZ homeostasis and injury.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Developmental chromatin restriction of pro-growth gene networks acts as an epigenetic barrier to axon regeneration in cortical neurons</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/259408v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Axon regeneration in the central nervous system is prevented in part by a developmental decline in the intrinsic regenerative ability of maturing neurons. This loss of axon growth ability likely reflects widespread changes in gene expression, but the mechanisms that drive this shift remain unclear. Chromatin accessibility has emerged as a key regulatory mechanism in other cellular contexts, raising the possibility that chromatin structure may contribute to the age-dependent loss of regenerative potential. Here we establish an integrated bioinformatic pipeline that combines analysis of developmentally dynamic gene networks with transcription factor regulation and genome-wide maps of chromatin accessibility. When applied to the developing cortex, this pipeline detected overall closure of chromatin in sub-networks of genes associated with axon growth. We next analyzed mature CNS neurons that were supplied with various pro-regenerative transcription factors. Unlike prior results with SOX11 and KLF7, here we found that neither JUN nor an activated form of STAT3 promoted substantial corticospinal tract regeneration. Correspondingly, chromatin accessibility in JUN or STAT3 target genes was substantially lower than in predicted targets of SOX11 and KLF7. Finally, we used the pipeline to predict pioneer factors that could potentially relieve chromatin constraints at growth-associated loci. Overall this integrated analysis substantiates the hypothesis that dynamic chromatin accessibility contributes to the developmental decline in axon growth ability and influences the efficacy of pro-regenerative interventions in the adult, while also pointing toward selected pioneer factors as high-priority candidates for future combinatorial experiments.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Intrinsic Connectivity Networks, patterns of correlated activity emerging from &quot;resting-state&quot; Blood Oxygenation Level Dependent time series, are increasingly being associated to cognitive, clinical, and behavioral aspects, and compared with the pattern of activity elicited by specific tasks. In this study we use a large cohort of publicly available data to test to which extent one can associate a brain region to one of these Intrinsic Connectivity Networks looking only at its connectivity pattern, and examine at how the correspondence between resting and task-based patterns can be mapped in this context. By trying a battery of different supervised classifiers relying only on task-based measurements, we show that the highest accuracy is reached with a simple neural network of one hidden layer. In addition, when testing the fitted model on resting state measurements, such architecture yields a performance close to 90% for areas connected to the task performed, which mainly involve the visual and sensorimotor cortex. This clearly confirms the correspondence of Intrinsic Connectivity Networks in both paradigms and opens a window for future clinical applications to subjects whose participation in a required task cannot be guaranteed.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Detecting rapid coincident changes across sensory modalities is essential to recognize sudden threats and events. Using two-photon calcium imaging in identified cell types in awake mice, we show that auditory cortex (AC) neurons projecting to primary visual cortex (V1) preferentially encode the abrupt onsets of sounds. In V1, a sub-population of layer 1 interneurons gates this selective cross-modal information by a suppression specific to the absence of visual inputs. However, when large auditory onsets coincide with visual stimuli, visual responses are strongly boosted in V1. Thus, a dynamic asymmetric circuit across AC and V1 specifically identifies visual events starting simultaneously to sudden sounds, potentially catalyzing localization of new sound sources in the visual field.</content:encoded>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Activation of pial and dural macrophages and dendritic cells by CSD (67 chrs)</title>
	<link>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25169</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h3&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Objective:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cortical spreading depression (CSD) has long been implicated in migraine attacks with aura. The process by which CSD, a cortical event that occurs within the blood brain barrier (BBB), results in nociceptor activation outside the BBB is likely mediated by multiple molecules and cells. The objective of this study was to determine whether CSD activates immune cells inside the BBB (pia), outside the BBB (dura), or in both, and if so, when.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investigating cellular events in the meninges shortly after CSD, we used &lt;em&gt;in-vivo&lt;/em&gt; 2-photon imaging to identify changes in macrophages and dendritic cells (DC) that reside in the pia, arachnoid, and dura, and their anatomical relationship to TRPV1 axons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;We found that activated meningeal macrophages retract their processes and become circular, and that activated meningeal DC stop migrating. We found that CSD activates pial macrophages instantaneously, pial, subarachnoid and dural DC 6-12 minutes later, and dural macrophages 20 minutes later. Dural macrophages and DC can appear in close proximity to TRPV1-positive axons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interpretation:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings suggest that activation of pial macrophages may be more relevant to cases where aura and migraine begin simultaneously, that activation of dural macrophages may be more relevant to cases where headache begins 20-30 minutes after aura, and that activation of dural macrophages may be mediated by activation of migratory DC in the SAS and dura. The anatomical relationship between TRPV1-positive meningeal nociceptors, and dural macrophages and dendritic cells support a role for these immune cells in the modulation of head pain.

	<content:encoded>&lt;h3&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Objective:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Information about Rivaroxaban plasma levels (RivLev) may guide treatment decisions in patients with acute ischemic stroke (AIS) and intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) taking rivaroxaban.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a multicenter registry-based study (Novel-Oral-Anticoagulants-In-Stroke-Patients collaboration;NOACISP;ClinicalTrials.gov:NCT02353585) of patients with stroke while taking rivaroxaban, we compared RivLev in patients with AIS and ICH. We determined how many AIS-patients had RivLev≤100ng/ml, indicating possible eligibility for thrombolysis and how many ICH-patients had RivLev≥75ng/ml, possibly eligible for the use of specific reversal agents. We explored factors associated with RivLev (Spearman correlation; regression models) and studied the sensitivity and specificity of INR-thresholds to substitute RivLevs using cross tables and ROC curves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among 241 patients (median age 80 years[IQR73-84], median time-from-onset-to-admission 2 hours[IQR1-4.5hours], median RivLev 89ng/ml[31-194]), 190 had AIS and 51 had ICH. RivLev were similar in AIS-patients (82ng/ml[IQR30-202] and ICH-patients (102ng/ml[IQR 51-165]; p=0.24). Trough RivLev&lt;sub&gt;(≤137ng/ml)&lt;/sub&gt; occurred in 126/190 (66.3%) AIS- and 34/51 (66.7%) ICH-patients. Among AIS-patients, 108/190 (56.8%) had RivLev≤100ng/ml. In ICH-patients 33/51(64.7%) had RivLev≥75ng/ml. RivLev were associated with rivaroxaban dosage, inversely with renal function and time-since-last-intake (each p&amp;lt;.05). INR≤1.0 had a specificity of 98.9% and a sensitivity of 25.7% to predict RivLev≤100ng/ml. INR≥1.4 had a sensitivity of 59.3% and specificity of 90.1% to predict RivLev≥75ng/ml.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interpretation:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;RivLev did not differ between patients with AIS and ICH. Half of the patients with AIS under Rivaroxaban had RivLev low enough to consider thrombolysis. In ICH-patients, 2/3 had RivLev high enough to meet the eligibility for the use of a specific reversal agent. INR-thresholds perform poor to inform treatment decisions in individual patients.

	<content:encoded>&lt;h3&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Objective&lt;/b&gt;: To investigate sleep disturbances that induce cognitive changes over four years in non-demented elderlies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Methods&lt;/b&gt;: Data were acquired from a nationwide, population-based, prospective cohort of Korean elderlies (2,238 normal cognition [NC] and 655 mild cognitive impairment [MCI]). At baseline and 4-year follow up assessments, sleep-related parameters (mid-sleep time, sleep duration, latency, subjective quality, efficiency and daytime dysfunction) and cognitive status were measured using Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index and Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease Assessment, respectively. We used logistic regression models adjusted for covariates including age, sex, education, apolipoprotein E genotype, Geriatric Depression Scale, Cumulative Illness Rating Scale, and physical activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Results&lt;/b&gt;: In participants with NC, long sleep latency (&amp;gt; 30 min), long sleep duration (≥ 7.95 hr), and late mid-sleep time (after 3:00AM) at baseline were related to the risk of cognitive decline at 4-year follow-up assessment; odds ratio (OR) was 1.40 for long sleep latency, 1.67 for long sleep duration, and 0.61 for late mid-sleep time. These relationships remained significant when these variables maintained their status throughout the follow-up period. Newly developed long sleep latency also doubled the risk of cognitive decline. In those with MCI, however, only long sleep latency reduced the chance of reversion to NC (OR = 0.69).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Interpretation&lt;/b&gt;: As early markers of cognitive decline, long sleep latency can be used for elderlies with NC or MCI, while long sleep duration and relatively early sleep time might be used for cognitively normal elderlies only.

	<content:encoded>&lt;h3&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Objective&lt;/b&gt;: Autosomal dominant lateral temporal epilepsy (ADLTE) is a genetic focal epilepsy characterized by auditory symptoms. Two genes, &lt;em&gt;LGI1&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;RELN&lt;/em&gt;, encoding secreted proteins, are implicated in the etiology of ADLTE, but half of the affected families remain genetically unsolved, and the underlying molecular mechanisms are yet to be clarified. We aimed to identify additional genes causing ADLTE to better understand the genetic basis and molecular pathway underlying this epileptic disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Methods&lt;/b&gt;: A cohort of Italian ADLTE families was examined by whole exome sequencing combined with genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism-array linkage analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Results&lt;/b&gt;: We identified two ADLTE-causing variants in the &lt;em&gt;MICAL-1&lt;/em&gt; gene: a p.Gly150Ser substitution occurring in the enzymatically active monooxygenase (MO) domain, and a p.Ala1065fs frameshift indel in the C-terminal domain, which inhibits the oxidoreductase activity of the MO domain. Each variant segregated with ADLTE in a single family. Examination of candidate variants in additional genes excluded their implication in ADLTE. In cell-based assays, both variants significantly increased MICAL-1 oxidoreductase activity and induced cell contraction in COS7 cells, which likely resulted from deregulation of F-actin dynamics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Interpretation&lt;/b&gt;: MICAL-1 oxidoreductase activity induces disassembly of actin filaments, thereby regulating the organization of the actin cytoskeleton in developing and adult neurons and in other cell types. This suggests that dysregulation of the actin cytoskeleton dynamics is a likely mechanism by which &lt;em&gt;MICAL-1&lt;/em&gt; pathogenic variants lead to ADLTE.

&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The nerve excitability test in SMA patients and a mouse model of SMA was carried out to explore the pathophysiology of nodal and internodal currents, and quantitative PCR, Western blotting and whole-cell patch-clamp recording were used for the identified hypothesis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The nerve excitability test in SMA patients showed increased inward rectification in the current-threshold relationship and increased overshoot after hyperpolarizing threshold electrotonus, which indicates increased hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) current; these findings correlated with disease severity. Increased inward rectification in the current-threshold relationship was reproducible in a mouse model of mild SMA and the abnormality preceded the decline of compound motor action potential amplitudes. Furthermore, quantitative PCR of spinal cord tissues and Western blotting of the spinal cord and sciatic nerves showed increased HCN1 and HCN2 expression in the SMA mice, and voltage-clamp recording in dissociated spinal motor neurons from SMA mice also showed increased HCN current density. Treatment with ZD7288, an HCN channel blocker, also reduced early mortality, improved motor function, and restored neuromuscular junction architecture in a mouse model of severe SMA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

A significant portion of bone fractures fail to heal properly, increasing healthcare costs. Advances in fracture management have slowed because translation barriers have limited generation of mechanism-based explanations for the healing process. When uncertainties are numerous, analogical modeling can be an effective strategy for developing plausible explanations of complex phenomena. We demonstrate the feasibility of engineering analogical models in software to facilitate discovery of biomimetic explanations for how fracture healing may progress. Concrete analogical models—Callus Analogs—were created using the MASON simulation toolkit. We designated a Target Region initial state within a characteristic tissue section of mouse tibia fracture at day-7 and posited a corresponding day-10 Target Region final state. The goal was to discover a coarse-grain analog mechanism that would enable the discretized initial state to transform itself into the corresponding Target Region final state, thereby providing an alternative way to study the healing process. One of nine quasi-autonomous Tissue Unit types is assigned to each grid space, which maps to an 80×80 μm region of the tissue section. All Tissue Units have an opportunity each time step to act based on individualized logic, probabilities, and information about adjacent neighbors. Action causes transition from one Tissue Unit type to another, and simulation through several thousand time steps generates a coarse-grain analog—a theory—of the healing process. We prespecified a minimum measure of success: simulated and actual Target Region states achieve ≥ 70% Similarity. We used an iterative refinement protocol to explore many combinations of Tissue Unit logic and action constraints. Workflows progressed through four stages of analog mechanisms. Similarities of 73–90% were achieved for Mechanisms 2–4. The range of Upper-Level similarities increased to 83–94% when we allowed for uncertainty about two Tissue Unit designations. We have demonstrated how Callus Analog experiments provide domain experts with a fresh medium and tools for thinking about and understanding the fracture healing process.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/qhxB-qfzMYk&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: A computational framework for cortical microtubule dynamics in realistically shaped plant cells</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/-ogXqfE-FHg/article</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Bandan Chakrabortty, Ikram Blilou, Ben Scheres, Bela M. Mulder&lt;/p&gt;

Plant morphogenesis is strongly dependent on the directional growth and the subsequent oriented division of individual cells. It has been shown that the plant cortical microtubule array plays a key role in controlling both these processes. This ordered structure emerges as the collective result of stochastic interactions between large numbers of dynamic microtubules. To elucidate this complex self-organization process a number of analytical and computational approaches to study the dynamics of cortical microtubules have been proposed. To date, however, these models have been restricted to two dimensional planes or geometrically simple surfaces in three dimensions, which strongly limits their applicability as plant cells display a wide variety of shapes. This limitation is even more acute, as both local as well as global geometrical features of cells are expected to influence the overall organization of the array. Here we describe a framework for efficiently simulating microtubule dynamics on triangulated approximations of arbitrary three dimensional surfaces. This allows the study of microtubule array organization on realistic cell surfaces obtained by segmentation of microscopic images. We validate the framework against expected or known results for the spherical and cubical geometry. We then use it to systematically study the individual contributions of global geometry, cell-edge induced catastrophes and cell-face induced stability to array organization in a cuboidal geometry. Finally, we apply our framework to analyze the highly non-trivial geometry of leaf pavement cells of &lt;i&gt;Arabidopsis thaliana&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Nicotiana benthamiana&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Hedera helix&lt;/i&gt;. We show that our simulations can predict multiple features of the microtubule array structure in these cells, revealing, among others, strong constraints on the orientation of division planes.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/-ogXqfE-FHg&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1802.00334</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A key question in modern neuroscience is how cognitive changes in a human
brain can be quantified and captured by functional connectomes (FC) . A
systematic approach to measure pairwise functional distance at different brain
states is lacking. This would provide a straight-forward way to quantify
differences in cognitive processing across tasks; also, it would help in
relating these differences in task-based FCs to the underlying structural
network. Here we propose a framework, based on Jensen-Shannon divergence,to map
the task-rest connectivity divergence between tasks and resting-state FC. We
show how this information theoretical measure allows for quantifying
connectivity changes in distributed and centralized processing in functional
networks. We study resting-state and seven tasks from the Human Connectome
Project dataset to obtain the most divergent links across tasks. We investigate
how these changes are associated to different functional brain networks, and
use the proposed measure to infer changes in the information processing
regimes. Furthermore, we show how the FC divergence with respect to resting
state is shaped by structural connectivity, and to what extent this
relationship depends on the task. This framework provides a well grounded
mathematical quantification of connectivity changes associated to cognitive
processing in large-scale brain networks.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The dynamics of networks of neuronal cultures has been recently shown to be
strongly dependent on the network geometry and in particular on their
dimensionality. However, this phenomenon has been so far mostly unexplored from
the theoretical point of view. Here we reveal the rich interplay between
network geometry and synchronization of coupled oscillators in the context of a
simplicial complex model of manifolds called Complex Network Manifold. The
networks generated by this model combine small world properties (infinite
Hausdorff dimension) and a high modular structure with finite and tunable
spectral dimension. We show that the networks display frustrated
synchronization for a wide range of the coupling strength of the oscillators,
and that the synchronization properties are directly affected by the spectral
dimension of the network.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In this work we study the excitatory AMPA, and NMDA, and inhibitory GABAA
receptor mediated dynamical changes in neuronal networks of neonatal rat cortex
in vitro. Extracellular network-wide activity was recorded with 59 planar
electrodes simultaneously under different pharmacological conditions. We
analyzed the changes of overall network activity and network-wide burst
frequency between baseline and AMPA receptor (AMPA-R) or NMDA receptor (NMDA-R)
driven activity, as well as between the latter states and disinhibited
activity. Additionally, spatiotemporal structures of pharmacologically modified
bursts and recruitment of electrodes during the network bursts were studied.
Our results show that AMPA-R and NMDA-R receptors have clearly distinct roles
in network dynamics. AMPA-Rs are in greater charge to initiate network wide
bursts. Therefore NMDA-Rs maintain the already initiated activity. GABAA
receptors (GABAA-Rs) inhibit AMPA-R driven network activity more strongly than
NMDA-R driven activity during the bursts.

Translation of consecutive prolines causes ribosome stalling, which is alleviated but cannot be fully compensated by the elongation factor P. However, the presence of polyproline motifs in about one third of the &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; proteins underlines their potential functional importance, which remains largely unexplored. We conducted an evolutionary analysis of polyproline motifs in the proteomes of 43 &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; strains and found evidence of evolutionary selection against translational stalling, which is especially pronounced in proteins with high translational efficiency. Against the overall trend of polyproline motif loss in evolution, we observed their enrichment in the vicinity of translational start sites, in the inter-domain regions of multi-domain proteins, and downstream of transmembrane helices. Our analysis demonstrates that the time gain caused by ribosome pausing at polyproline motifs might be advantageous in protein regions bracketing domains and transmembrane helices. Polyproline motifs might therefore be crucial for co-translational folding and membrane insertion.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/tDkLZ5Cs-1M&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Bioinformatics is recognized as part of the essential knowledge base of numerous career paths in biomedical research and healthcare. However, there is little agreement in the field over what that knowledge entails or how best to provide it. These disagreements are compounded by the wide range of populations in need of bioinformatics training, with divergent prior backgrounds and intended application areas. The Curriculum Task Force of the International Society of Computational Biology (ISCB) Education Committee has sought to provide a framework for training needs and curricula in terms of a set of bioinformatics core competencies that cut across many user personas and training programs. The initial competencies developed based on surveys of employers and training programs have since been refined through a multiyear process of community engagement. This report describes the current status of the competencies and presents a series of use cases illustrating how they are being applied in diverse training contexts. These use cases are intended to demonstrate how others can make use of the competencies and engage in the process of their continuing refinement and application. The report concludes with a consideration of remaining challenges and future plans.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/H-O9q3LkWbg&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Meanings, Metaphors, and Morphisms: Theory of Indeterminate Natural Transformation (TINT). (arXiv:1801.10542v1 [math.CT])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1801.10542</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In the present paper, we propose a new theory named &quot;Theory of indeterminate
natural transformation (TINT)&quot; to investigate the dynamical creation of
meanings as association relationships between images, focusing on the metaphor
comprehension as an example. TINT models the meaning creation as a kind of
stochastic processes based on the mathematical structure defined by association
relationships as morphisms in category theory, so as to represent the
indeterminate nature of structure-structure interactions between the systems of
the meanings of images. Such interactions are formulated in terms of so-called
coslice categories and functors as structure-preserving correspondence between
them. The relationship between such functors is &quot;indeterminate natural
transformation&quot;, the central notion in TINT, which models the creation of
meanings in a precise manner. For instance, the process of metaphor
comprehension is modeled by the construction of indeterminate natural
transformation from a canonically defined functor which we call the
base-of-metaphor functor.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Landau-Ginzburg theory of cortex dynamics: Scale-free avalanches emerge at the edge of synchronization. (arXiv:1801.10356v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1801.10356</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Understanding the origin, nature, and functional significance of complex
patterns of neural activity, as recorded by diverse electrophysiological and
neuroimaging techniques, is a central challenge in neuroscience. Such patterns
include collective oscillations emerging out of neural synchronization as well
as highly heterogeneous outbursts of activity interspersed by periods of
quiescence, called &quot;neuronal avalanches.&quot; Much debate has been generated about
the possible scale invariance or criticality of such avalanches and its
relevance for brain function. Aimed at shedding light onto this, here we
analyze the large-scale collective properties of the cortex by using a
mesoscopic approach following the principle of parsimony of Landau-Ginzburg.
Our model is similar to that of Wilson-Cowan for neural dynamics but crucially,
includes stochasticity and space; synaptic plasticity and inhibition are
considered as possible regulatory mechanisms. Detailed analyses uncover a phase
diagram including down-state, synchronous, asynchronous, and up-state phases
and reveal that empirical findings for neuronal avalanches are consistently
reproduced by tuning our model to the edge of synchronization. This reveals
that the putative criticality of cortical dynamics does not correspond to a
quiescent-to-active phase transition as usually assumed in theoretical
approaches but to a synchronization phase transition, at which incipient
oscillations and scale-free avalanches coexist. Furthermore, our model also
accounts for up and down states as they occur (e.g., during deep sleep). This
approach constitutes a framework to rationalize the possible collective phases
and phase transitions of cortical networks in simple terms, thus helping to
shed light on basic aspects of brain functioning from a very broad perspective.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: A Rational Distributed Process-level Account of Independence Judgment. (arXiv:1801.10186v1 [cs.AI])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1801.10186</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;It is inconceivable how chaotic the world would look to humans, faced with
innumerable decisions a day to be made under uncertainty, had they been lacking
the capacity to distinguish the relevant from the irrelevant---a capacity which
computationally amounts to handling probabilistic independence relations. The
highly parallel and distributed computational machinery of the brain suggests
that a satisfying process-level account of human independence judgment should
also mimic these features. In this work, we present the first rational,
distributed, message-passing, process-level account of independence judgment,
called $\mathcal{D}^\ast$. Interestingly, $\mathcal{D}^\ast$ shows a curious,
but normatively-justified tendency for quick detection of dependencies,
whenever they hold. Furthermore, $\mathcal{D}^\ast$ outperforms all the
previously proposed algorithms in the AI literature in terms of worst-case
running time, and a salient aspect of it is supported by recent work in
neuroscience investigating possible implementations of Bayes nets at the neural
level. $\mathcal{D}^\ast$ nicely exemplifies how the pursuit of cognitive
plausibility can lead to the discovery of state-of-the-art algorithms with
appealing properties, and its simplicity makes $\mathcal{D}^\ast$ potentially a
good candidate for pedagogical purposes.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Signatures of criticality arise in simple neural population models with correlations. (arXiv:1603.00097v2 [q-bio.NC] UPDATED)</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.00097</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Large-scale recordings of neuronal activity make it possible to gain insights
into the collective activity of neural ensembles. It has been hypothesized that
neural populations might be optimized to operate at a 'thermodynamic critical
point', and that this property has implications for information processing.
Support for this notion has come from a series of studies which identified
statistical signatures of criticality in the ensemble activity of retinal
ganglion cells. What are the underlying mechanisms that give rise to these
observations? Here we show that signatures of criticality arise even in simple
feed-forward models of retinal population activity. In particular, they occur
whenever neural population data exhibits correlations, and is randomly
sub-sampled during data analysis. These results show that signatures of
criticality are not necessarily indicative of an optimized coding strategy, and
challenge the utility of analysis approaches based on equilibrium
thermodynamics for understanding partially observed biological systems.

	<content:encoded>The hippocampus is one of the brain’s great mysteries. Historically, theories of its function included emotion, response inhibition, general memory and spatial perception/learning, with memory versus space emerging as a particular focus of more recent debates. A 1978 paper by Olton and colleagues captured this dichotomy by exploiting their newly developed radial maze task to reveal a profound deficit in the ability of hippocampally lesioned rats to execute a spatial memory task. This finding supported the emerging spatial map theory of hippocampal function, and helped pave the way for the subsequent uncovering of an entire brain system linking space and memory.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>2018 marks the 40th anniversary of Trends in Neurosciences (TINS), which I had the honor of joining last summer as its editor. As part of the anniversary, we will be issuing a series of 40 short Science and Society articles, each highlighting a past paper (or two) published during one of the years 1978–2017. At its core, the series aims to showcase the breadth of neuroscientific research, and give a glimpse of the remarkable progress during the last few decades. The February issue of TINS launches the series, with four articles discussing papers from 1978, 1988, 1998, and 2008.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Prior to the 21st century, genetic mechanisms that regulate sleep were largely unknown. In 1998, de Lecea et al. [1] (Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95:322–327) and Sakurai et al. [2] (Cell 1998; 92: 573–585) reported the discovery of a gene they named hypocretin and orexin, respectively, which led to a revolution in our understanding of genetic and neuronal mechanisms that regulate sleep.</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: GSimp: A Gibbs sampler based left-censored missing value imputation approach for metabolomics studies</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/TpqgoEqOUBM/article</link>

Left-censored missing values commonly exist in targeted metabolomics datasets and can be considered as missing not at random (MNAR). Improper data processing procedures for missing values will cause adverse impacts on subsequent statistical analyses. However, few imputation methods have been developed and applied to the situation of MNAR in the field of metabolomics. Thus, a practical left-censored missing value imputation method is urgently needed. We developed an iterative Gibbs sampler based left-censored missing value imputation approach (GSimp). We compared GSimp with other three imputation methods on two real-world targeted metabolomics datasets and one simulation dataset using our imputation evaluation pipeline. The results show that GSimp outperforms other imputation methods in terms of imputation accuracy, observation distribution, univariate and multivariate analyses, and statistical sensitivity. Additionally, a parallel version of GSimp was developed for dealing with large scale metabolomics datasets. The R code for GSimp, evaluation pipeline, tutorial, real-world and simulated targeted metabolomics datasets are available at: https://github.com/WandeRum/GSimp.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/TpqgoEqOUBM&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

The Binary State Speciation and Extinction (BiSSE) model is a branching process based model that allows the diversification rates to be controlled by a binary trait. We develop a general approach, based on the BiSSE model, for predicting pathogenicity in bacterial populations from microsatellites profiling data. A comprehensive approach for predicting pathogenicity in &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; populations is proposed using the state-dependent branching process model combined with microsatellites TRS-PCR profiling. Additionally, we have evaluated the possibility of using the BiSSE model for estimating parameters from genetic data. We analyzed a real dataset (from 251 &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; strains) and confirmed previous biological observations demonstrating a prevalence of some virulence traits in specific bacterial sub-groups. The method may be used to predict pathogenicity of other bacterial taxa.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Uz6bdMXl0nc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Prefrontal Corticostriatal Disconnection Blocks the Acquisition of Goal-Directed Action</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/5/1311?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The acquisition of goal-directed action requires encoding of the association between an action and its specific consequences or outcome. At a neural level, this encoding has been hypothesized to involve a prefrontal corticostriatal circuit involving the projection from the prelimbic cortex (PL) to the posterior dorsomedial striatum (pDMS); however, no direct evidence for this claim has been reported. In a series of experiments, we performed functional disconnection of this pathway using targeted lesions of the anterior corpus callosum to disrupt contralateral corticostriatal projections with asymmetrical lesions of the PL and/or pDMS to block plasticity in this circuit in rats. We first demonstrated that unilaterally blocking the PL input to the pDMS prevented the phosphorylation of extracellular signal-related kinase/mitogen activated protein kinase (pERK/pMAPK) induced by instrumental training. Next, we used a full bilateral disconnection of the PL from the pDMS and assessed goal-directed action using an outcome-devaluation test. Importantly, we found evidence that rats maintaining an ipsilateral and/or contralateral connection between the PL and the pDMS were able to acquire goal-directed actions. In contrast, bilateral PL–pDMS disconnection abolished the acquisition of goal-directed actions. Finally, we used a temporary pharmacological disconnection to disrupt PL inputs to the pDMS by infusing the NMDA antagonist dl-2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoic acid into the pDMS during instrumental training and found that this manipulation also disrupted goal-directed learning. These results establish that, in rats, the acquisition of new goal-directed actions depends on a prefrontal–corticostriatal circuit involving a connection between the PL and the pDMS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; It has been hypothesized that the prelimbic cortex (PL) and posterior dorsomedial striatum (pDMS) in rodents interact in a corticostriatal circuit to mediate goal-directed learning. However, no direct evidence supporting this claim has been reported. Using targeted lesions, we performed functional disconnection of the PL–pDMS pathway to assess its role in goal-directed learning. In the first experiment, we demonstrated that PL input to the pDMS is necessary for instrumental training-induced neuronal activity. Next, we disrupted ipsilateral, contralateral, or bilateral PL–pDMS connections and found that only bilateral PL–pDMS disconnection disrupted the acquisition of goal-directed actions, a finding we replicated in our final study using a pharmacological disconnection procedure.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Visually-Driven Maps in Area 3b</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/5/1295?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Sensory perception relies on the precise neuronal encoding of modality-specific environmental features in primary sensory cortices. Some studies have reported the penetration of signals from other modalities even into early sensory areas. So far, no comprehensive account of maps induced by &quot;foreign sources&quot; exists. We addressed this question using surface-based topographic mapping techniques applied to ultra-high resolution fMRI neuroimaging data, measured in female participants. We show that fine-grained finger maps in human primary somatosensory cortex, area 3b, are somatotopically activated not only during tactile mechanical stimulation, but also when viewing the same fingers being touched. Visually-induced maps were weak in amplitude, but overlapped with the stronger tactile maps tangential to the cortical sheet when finger touches were observed in both first- and third-person perspectives. However, visually-induced maps did not overlap tactile maps when the observed fingers were only approached by an object but not actually touched. Our data provide evidence that &quot;foreign source maps&quot; in early sensory cortices are present in the healthy human brain, that their arrangement is precise, and that their induction is feature-selective. The computations required to generate such specific responses suggest that counterflow (feedback) processing may be much more spatially specific than has been often assumed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Using ultra-high field fMRI, we provide empirical evidence that viewing touches activates topographically aligned single finger maps in human primary somatosensory cortical area 3b. This shows that &quot;foreign source maps&quot; in early sensory cortices are topographic, precise, and feature-selective in healthy human participants with intact sensory pathways.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Meis1 Coordinates Cerebellar Granule Cell Development by Regulating Pax6 Transcription, BMP Signaling and Atoh1 Degradation</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/5/1277?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Cerebellar granule cell precursors (GCPs) and granule cells (GCs) represent good models to study neuronal development. Here, we report that the transcription factor myeloid ectopic viral integration site 1 homolog (Meis1) plays pivotal roles in the regulation of mouse GC development. We found that Meis1 is expressed in GC lineage cells and astrocytes in the cerebellum during development. Targeted disruption of the Meis1 gene specifically in the GC lineage resulted in smaller cerebella with disorganized lobules. Knock-down/knock-out (KO) experiments for Meis1 and &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; assays showed that Meis1 binds to an upstream sequence of Pax6 to enhance its transcription in GCPs/GCs and also suggested that the Meis1–Pax6 cascade regulates morphology of GCPs/GCs during development. In the conditional KO (cKO) cerebella, many Atoh1-positive GCPs were observed ectopically in the inner external granule layer (EGL) and a similar phenomenon was observed in cultured cerebellar slices treated with a bone morphogenic protein (BMP) inhibitor. Furthermore, expression of Smad proteins and Smad phosphorylation were severely reduced in the cKO cerebella and Meis1-knock-down GCPs cerebella. Reduction of phosphorylated Smad was also observed in cerebellar slices electroporated with a Pax6 knock-down vector. Because it is known that BMP signaling induces Atoh1 degradation in GCPs, these findings suggest that the Meis1–Pax6 pathway increases the expression of Smad proteins to upregulate BMP signaling, leading to degradation of Atoh1 in the inner EGL, which contributes to differentiation from GCPs to GCs. Therefore, this work reveals crucial functions of Meis1 in GC development and gives insights into the general understanding of the molecular machinery underlying neural differentiation from neural progenitors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; We report that myeloid ectopic viral integration site 1 homolog (Meis1) plays pivotal roles in the regulation of mouse granule cell (GC) development. Here, we show Meis1 is expressed in GC precursors (GCPs) and GCs during development. Our knock-down and conditional knock-out (cKO) experiments and &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; assays revealed that Meis1 is required for proper cerebellar structure formation and for &lt;i&gt;Pax6&lt;/i&gt; transcription in GCPs and GCs. The Meis1–Pax6 cascade regulates the morphology of GCs. In the cKO cerebella, Smad proteins and bone morphogenic protein (BMP) signaling are severely reduced and Atoh1-expressing GCPs are ectopically detected in the inner external granule layer. These findings suggest that Meis1 regulates degradation of Atoh1 via BMP signaling, contributing to GC differentiation in the inner EGL, and should provide understanding into GC development.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Selective Suppression of Local Interneuron Circuits in Human Motor Cortex Contributes to Movement Preparation</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/5/1264?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Changes in neural activity occur in the motor cortex before movement, but the nature and purpose of this preparatory activity is unclear. To investigate this in the human (male and female) brain noninvasively, we used transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to probe the excitability of distinct sets of excitatory inputs to corticospinal neurons during the warning period of various reaction time tasks. Using two separate methods (H-reflex conditioning and directional effects of TMS), we show that a specific set of excitatory inputs to corticospinal neurons are suppressed during motor preparation, while another set of inputs remain unaffected. To probe the behavioral relevance of this suppression, we examined whether the strength of the selective preparatory inhibition in each trial was related to reaction time. Surprisingly, the greater the amount of selective preparatory inhibition, the faster the reaction time was. This suggests that the inhibition of inputs to corticospinal neurons is not involved in preventing the release of movement but may in fact facilitate rapid reactions. Thus, selective suppression of a specific set of motor cortical neurons may be a key aspect of successful movement preparation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Movement preparation evokes substantial activity in the motor cortex despite no apparent movement. One explanation for the lack of movement is that motor cortical output in this period is gated by an inhibitory mechanism. This notion was supported by previous noninvasive TMS studies of human motor cortex indicating a reduction of corticospinal excitability. On the contrary, our data support the idea that there is a coordinated balance of activity upstream of the corticospinal output neurons. This includes a suppression of specific local circuits that supports, rather than inhibits, the rapid generation of prepared movements. Thus, the selective suppression of local circuits appears to be an essential part of successful movement preparation instead of an external control mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone (GnRH) Neuron Excitability Is Regulated by Estradiol Feedback and Kisspeptin</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/5/1249?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons produce the central output controlling fertility and are regulated by steroid feedback. A switch from estradiol negative to positive feedback initiates the GnRH surge, ultimately triggering ovulation. This occurs on a daily basis in ovariectomized, estradiol-treated (OVX+E) mice; GnRH neurons are suppressed in the morning and activated in the afternoon. To test the hypotheses that estradiol and time of day signals alter GnRH neuron responsiveness to stimuli, GFP-identified GnRH neurons in brain slices from OVX+E or OVX female mice were recorded during the morning or afternoon. No differences were observed in baseline membrane potential. Current-clamp revealed GnRH neurons fired more action potentials in response to current injection during positive feedback relative to all other groups, which were not different from each other despite reports of differing ionic conductances. Kisspeptin increased GnRH neuron response in cells from OVX and OVX+E mice in the morning but not afternoon. Paradoxically, excitability in kisspeptin knock-out mice was similar to the maximum observed in control mice but was unchanged by time of day or estradiol. A mathematical model applying a Markov Chain Monte Carlo method to estimate probability distributions for estradiol- and time of day–dependent parameters was used to predict intrinsic properties underlying excitability changes. A single identifiable distribution of solutions accounted for similar GnRH neuron excitability in all groups other than positive feedback despite different underlying conductance properties; this was attributable to interdependence of voltage-gated potassium channel properties. In contrast, redundant solutions may explain positive feedback, perhaps indicative of the importance of this state for species survival.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Infertility affects 15%–20% of couples; failure to ovulate is a common cause. Understanding how the brain controls ovulation is critical for new developments in both infertility treatment and contraception. Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons are the final common pathway for central neural control of ovulation. We studied how estradiol feedback regulates GnRH excitability, a key determinant of neural firing rate using laboratory and computational approaches. GnRH excitability is upregulated during positive feedback, perhaps driving increased neural firing rate at this time. Kisspeptin increased GnRH excitability and was essential for estradiol regulation of excitability. Modeling predicts that multiple combinations of changes to GnRH intrinsic conductances can produce the firing response in positive feedback, suggesting the brain has many ways to induce ovulation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Tenuous Inhibitory GABAergic Signaling in the Reticular Thalamus</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/5/1232?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Maintenance of a low intracellular Cl&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt; concentration ([Cl&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;) is critical for enabling inhibitory neuronal responses to GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptor-mediated signaling. Cl&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt; transporters, including KCC2, and extracellular impermeant anions ([A]&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;) of the extracellular matrix are both proposed to be important regulators of [Cl&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;. Neurons of the reticular thalamic (RT) nucleus express reduced levels of KCC2, indicating that GABAergic signaling may produce excitation in RT neurons. However, by performing perforated patch recordings and calcium imaging experiments in rats (male and female), we find that [Cl&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; remains relatively low in RT neurons. Although we identify a small contribution of [A]&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt; to a low [Cl&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; in RT neurons, our results also demonstrate that reduced levels of KCC2 remain sufficient to maintain low levels of Cl&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt;. Reduced KCC2 levels, however, restrict the capacity of RT neurons to rapidly extrude Cl&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt; following periods of elevated GABAergic signaling. In a computational model of a local RT network featuring slow Cl&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt; extrusion kinetics, similar to those we found experimentally, model RT neurons are predisposed to an activity-dependent switch from GABA-mediated inhibition to excitation. By decreasing the activity threshold required to produce excitatory GABAergic signaling, weaker stimuli are able to propagate activity within the model RT nucleus. Our results indicate the importance of even diminished levels of KCC2 in maintaining inhibitory signaling within the RT nucleus and suggest how this important activity choke point may be easily overcome in disorders such as epilepsy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Precise regulation of intracellular Cl&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt; levels ([Cl&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;) preserves appropriate, often inhibitory, GABAergic signaling within the brain. However, there is disagreement over the relative contribution of various mechanisms that maintain low [Cl&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;. We found that the Cl&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt; transporter KCC2 is an important Cl&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt; extruder in the reticular thalamic (RT) nucleus, despite this nucleus having remarkably low KCC2 immunoreactivity relative to other regions of the adult brain. We also identified a smaller contribution of fixed, impermeant anions ([A]&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;) to lowering [Cl&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; in RT neurons. Inhibitory signaling among RT neurons is important for preventing excessive activation of RT neurons, which can be responsible for generating seizures. Our work suggests that KCC2 critically restricts the spread of activity within the RT nucleus.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Conditional Deletion of Hippocampal CA2/CA3a Oxytocin Receptors Impairs the Persistence of Long-Term Social Recognition Memory in Mice</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/5/1218?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Oxytocin (OXT) receptors (OXTRs) are prominently expressed in hippocampal CA2 and CA3 pyramidal neurons, but little is known about its physiological function. As the functional necessity of hippocampal CA2 for social memory processing, we tested whether CA2 OXTRs may contribute to long-term social recognition memory (SRM) formation. Here, we found that conditional deletion of &lt;i&gt;Oxtr&lt;/i&gt; from forebrain (&lt;i&gt;Oxtr&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt;) or CA2/CA3a-restricted excitatory neurons in adult male mice impaired the persistence of long-term SRM but had no effect on sociability and preference for social novelty. Conditional deletion of CA2/CA3a &lt;i&gt;Oxtr&lt;/i&gt; showed no changes in anxiety-like behavior assessed using the open-field, elevated plus maze and novelty-suppressed feeding tests. Application of a highly selective OXTR agonist [Thr&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;,Gly&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;]-OXT to hippocampal slices resulted in an acute and lasting potentiation of excitatory synaptic responses in CA2 pyramidal neurons that relied on &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-methyl-d-aspartate receptor activation and calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II activity. In addition, &lt;i&gt;Oxtr&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt; mice displayed a defect in the induction of long-term potentiation, but not long-term depression, at the synapses between the entorhinal cortex and CA2 pyramidal neurons. Furthermore, &lt;i&gt;Oxtr&lt;/i&gt; deletion led to a reduced complexity of basal dendritic arbors of CA2 pyramidal neurons, but caused no alteration in the density of apical dendritic spines. Considering that the methodologies we have used to delete &lt;i&gt;Oxtr&lt;/i&gt; do not rule out targeting the neighboring CA3a region, these findings suggest that OXTR signaling in the CA2/CA3a is crucial for the persistence of long-term SRM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Oxytocin receptors (OXTRs) are abundantly expressed in hippocampal CA2 and CA3 regions, but there are little known about their physiological function. Taking advantage of the conditional &lt;i&gt;Oxtr&lt;/i&gt; knock-out mice, the present study highlights the importance of OXTR signaling in the induction of long-term potentiation at the synapses between the entorhinal cortex and CA2 pyramidal neurons and the persistence of long-term social recognition memory. Thus, OXTRs in the CA2/CA3a may provide a new target for therapeutic approaches to the treatment of social cognition deficits, which are often observed in patients with neuropsychiatric disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Attention Shifts Recruit the Monkey Default Mode Network</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/5/1202?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A unifying function associated with the default mode network (DMN), which is more active during rest than under active task conditions, has been difficult to define. The DMN is activated during monitoring the external world for unexpected events, as a sentinel, and when humans are engaged in high-level internally focused tasks. The existence of DMN correlates in other species, such as mice, challenge the idea that internally focused, high-level cognitive operations, such as introspection, autobiographical memory retrieval, planning the future, and predicting someone else's thoughts, are evolutionarily preserved defining properties of the DMN. A recent human study demonstrated that demanding cognitive shifts could recruit the DMN, yet it is unknown whether this holds for nonhuman species. Therefore, we tested whether large changes in cognitive context would recruit DMN regions in female and male nonhuman primates. Such changes were measured as displacements of spatial attentional weights based on internal rules of relevance (spatial shifts) compared with maintaining attentional weights at the same location (stay events). Using fMRI in macaques, we detected that a cortical network, activated during shifts, largely overlapped with the DMN. Moreover, fMRI time courses sampled from independently defined DMN foci showed significant shift selectivity during the demanding attention task. Finally, functional clustering based on independent resting state data revealed that DMN and shift regions clustered conjointly, whereas regions activated during the stay events clustered apart. We therefore propose that cognitive shifting in primates generally recruits DMN regions. This might explain a breakdown of the DMN in many neurological diseases characterized by declined cognitive flexibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Activation of the human default mode network (DMN) can be measured with fMRI when subjects shift thoughts between high-level internally directed cognitive states, when thinking about the self, the perspective of others, when imagining future and past events, and during mind wandering. Furthermore, the DMN is activated as a sentinel, monitoring the environment for unexpected events. Arguably, these cognitive processes have in common fast and substantial changes in cognitive context. As DMN activity has also been reported in nonhuman species, we tested whether shifts in spatial attention activated the monkey DMN. Core monkey DMN and shift-selective regions shared several functional properties, indicating that cognitive shifting, in general, might constitute one of the evolutionarily preserved functions of the DMN.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Prismatic Adaptation Modulates Oscillatory EEG Correlates of Motor Preparation but Not Visual Attention in Healthy Participants</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/5/1189?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Prismatic adaption (PA) has been proposed as a tool to induce neural plasticity and is used to help neglect rehabilitation. It leads to a recalibration of visuomotor coordination during pointing as well as to aftereffects on a number of sensorimotor and attention tasks, but whether these effects originate at a motor or attentional level remains a matter of debate. Our aim was to further characterize PA aftereffects by using an approach that allows distinguishing between effects on attentional and motor processes. We recorded EEG in healthy human participants (9 females and 7 males) while performing a new double step, anticipatory attention/motor preparation paradigm before and after adaptation to rightward-shifting prisms, with neutral lenses as a control. We then examined PA aftereffects through changes in known oscillatory EEG signatures of spatial attention orienting and motor preparation in the alpha and beta frequency bands. Our results were twofold. First, we found PA to rightward-shifting prisms to selectively affect EEG signatures of motor but not attentional processes. More specifically, PA modulated preparatory motor EEG activity over central electrodes in the right hemisphere, contralateral to the PA-induced, compensatory leftward shift in pointing movements. No effects were found on EEG signatures of spatial attention orienting over occipitoparietal sites. Second, we found the PA effect on preparatory motor EEG activity to dominate in the beta frequency band. We conclude that changes to intentional visuomotor, rather than attentional visuospatial, processes underlie the PA aftereffect of rightward-deviating prisms in healthy participants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Prismatic adaptation (PA) has been proposed as a tool to induce neural plasticity in both healthy participants and patients, due to its aftereffect impacting on a number of visuospatial and visuomotor functions. However, the neural mechanisms underlying PA aftereffects are poorly understood as only little neuroimaging evidence is available. Here, we examined, for the first time, the origin of PA aftereffects studying oscillatory brain activity. Our results show a selective modulation of preparatory motor activity following PA in healthy participants but no effect on attention-related activity. This provides novel insight into the PA aftereffect in the healthy brain and may help to inform interventions in neglect patients.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Attention Is Required for Knowledge-Based Sequential Grouping: Insights from the Integration of Syllables into Words</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/5/1178?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;How the brain groups sequential sensory events into chunks is a fundamental question in cognitive neuroscience. This study investigates whether top–down attention or specific tasks are required for the brain to apply lexical knowledge to group syllables into words. Neural responses tracking the syllabic and word rhythms of a rhythmic speech sequence were concurrently monitored using electroencephalography (EEG). The participants performed different tasks, attending to either the rhythmic speech sequence or a distractor, which was another speech stream or a nonlinguistic auditory/visual stimulus. Attention to speech, but not a lexical-meaning-related task, was required for reliable neural tracking of words, even when the distractor was a nonlinguistic stimulus presented cross-modally. Neural tracking of syllables, however, was reliably observed in all tested conditions. These results strongly suggest that neural encoding of individual auditory events (i.e., syllables) is automatic, while knowledge-based construction of temporal chunks (i.e., words) crucially relies on top–down attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Why we cannot understand speech when not paying attention is an old question in psychology and cognitive neuroscience. Speech processing is a complex process that involves multiple stages, e.g., hearing and analyzing the speech sound, recognizing words, and combining words into phrases and sentences. The current study investigates which speech-processing stage is blocked when we do not listen carefully. We show that the brain can reliably encode syllables, basic units of speech sounds, even when we do not pay attention. Nevertheless, when distracted, the brain cannot group syllables into multisyllabic words, which are basic units for speech meaning. Therefore, the process of converting speech sound into meaning crucially relies on attention.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Loss of Intercalated Cells (ITCs) in the Mouse Amygdala of Tshz1 Mutants Correlates with Fear, Depression, and Social Interaction Phenotypes</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/5/1160?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The intercalated cells (ITCs) of the amygdala have been shown to be critical regulatory components of amygdalar circuits, which control appropriate fear responses. Despite this, the molecular processes guiding ITC development remain poorly understood. Here we establish the zinc finger transcription factor Tshz1 as a marker of ITCs during their migration from the dorsal lateral ganglionic eminence through maturity. Using germline and conditional knock-out (cKO) mouse models, we show that &lt;i&gt;Tshz1&lt;/i&gt; is required for the proper migration and differentiation of ITCs. In the absence of &lt;i&gt;Tshz1&lt;/i&gt;, migrating ITC precursors fail to settle in their stereotypical locations encapsulating the lateral amygdala and BLA. Furthermore, they display reductions in the ITC marker Foxp2 and ectopic persistence of the dorsal lateral ganglionic eminence marker Sp8. &lt;i&gt;Tshz1&lt;/i&gt; mutant ITCs show increased cell death at postnatal time points, leading to a dramatic reduction by 3 weeks of age. In line with this, &lt;i&gt;Foxp2&lt;/i&gt;-null mutants also show a loss of ITCs at postnatal time points, suggesting that &lt;i&gt;Foxp2&lt;/i&gt; may function downstream of &lt;i&gt;Tshz1&lt;/i&gt; in the maintenance of ITCs. Behavioral analysis of male &lt;i&gt;Tshz1&lt;/i&gt; cKOs revealed defects in fear extinction as well as an increase in floating during the forced swim test, indicative of a depression-like phenotype. Moreover, &lt;i&gt;Tshz1&lt;/i&gt; cKOs display significantly impaired social interaction (i.e., increased passivity) regardless of partner genetics. Together, these results suggest that &lt;i&gt;Tshz1&lt;/i&gt; plays a critical role in the development of ITCs and that fear, depression-like and social behavioral deficits arise in their absence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; We show here that the zinc finger transcription factor Tshz1 is expressed during development of the intercalated cells (ITCs) within the mouse amygdala. These neurons have previously been shown to play a crucial role in fear extinction. &lt;i&gt;Tshz1&lt;/i&gt; mouse mutants exhibit severely reduced numbers of ITCs as a result of abnormal migration, differentiation, and survival of these neurons. Furthermore, the loss of ITCs in mouse &lt;i&gt;Tshz1&lt;/i&gt; mutants correlates well with defects in fear extinction as well as the appearance of depression-like and abnormal social interaction behaviors reminiscent of depressive disorders observed in human patients with distal 18q deletions, including the &lt;i&gt;Tshz1&lt;/i&gt; locus.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Cocaine Selectively Reorganizes Excitatory Inputs to Substantia Nigra Pars Compacta Dopamine Neurons</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/5/1151?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) dopamine neurons and their targets are involved in addiction and cue-induced relapse. However, afferents onto SNc dopamine neurons themselves appear insensitive to drugs of abuse, such as cocaine, when afferents are collectively stimulated electrically. This contrasts with ventral tegmental area (VTA) dopamine neurons, whose glutamate afferents react robustly to cocaine. We used an optogenetic strategy to isolate identified SNc inputs and determine whether cocaine sensitivity in the mouse SNc circuit is conferred at the level of three glutamate afferents: dorsal raphé nucleus (DR), pedunculopontine nucleus (PPN), and subthalamic nucleus (STN). We found that excitatory afferents to SNc dopamine neurons are sensitive to cocaine in an afferent-specific manner. A single exposure to cocaine &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; led to PPN-innervated synapses reducing the AMPA-to-NMDA receptor-mediated current ratio. In contrast to work in the VTA, this was due to increased NMDA receptor function with no change in AMPA receptor function. STN synapses showed a decrease in calcium-permeable AMPA receptors after cocaine, but no change in the AMPA-to-NMDA ratio. Cocaine also increased the release probability at DR-innervated and STN-innervated synapses, quantified by decreases in paired-pulse ratios. However, release probability at PPN-innervated synapses remained unaffected. By examining identified inputs, our results demonstrate a functional distribution among excitatory SNc afferent nuclei in response to cocaine, and suggest a compelling architecture for differentiation and separate parsing of inputs within the nigrostriatal system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Prior studies have established that substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) dopamine neurons are a key node in the circuitry that drives addiction and relapse, yet cocaine apparently has no effect on electrically stimulated excitatory inputs. Our study is the first to demonstrate the functional impact of a drug of abuse on synaptic mechanisms of identified afferents to the SNc. Optogenetic dissection of inputs originating from dorsal raphé, pedunculopontine, and subthalamic nuclei were tested for synaptic modifications following &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; cocaine exposure. Our results demonstrate that cocaine differentially induces modifications to SNc synapses depending on input origin. This presents implications for understanding dopamine processing of motivated behavior; most critically, it indicates that dopamine neurons selectively modulate signal reception processed by afferent nuclei.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Cholinergic Overstimulation Attenuates Rule Selectivity in Macaque Prefrontal Cortex</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/5/1137?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Acetylcholine is released in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and is a key modulator of cognitive performance in primates. Cholinergic stimulation has been shown to have beneficial effects on performance of cognitive tasks, and cholinergic receptors are being actively explored as promising targets for ameliorating cognitive deficits in Alzheimer's disease. We hypothesized that cholinergic stimulation of PFC during performance of a cognitive task would augment neuronal activity and neuronal coding of task attributes. We iontophoretically applied the general cholinergic receptor agonist carbachol onto neurons in dorsolateral PFC (DLPFC) of male rhesus macaques performing rule-guided prosaccades and antisaccades, a well established oculomotor task for testing cognitive control. Carbachol application had heterogeneous effects on neuronal excitability, with both excitation and suppression observed in significant proportions. Contrary to our prediction, neurons with rule-selective activity exhibited a reduction in selectivity during carbachol application. Cholinergic stimulation disrupted rule selectivity regardless of whether it had suppressive or excitatory effects on these neurons. In addition, cholinergic stimulation excited putative pyramidal neurons, whereas the activity of putative interneurons remained unchanged. Moreover, cholinergic stimulation attenuated saccade direction selectivity in putative pyramidal neurons due to nonspecific increases in activity. Our results suggest excessive cholinergic stimulation has detrimental effects on DLPFC representations of task attributes. These findings delineate the complexity and heterogeneity of neuromodulation of cerebral cortex by cholinergic stimulation, an area of active exploration with respect to the development of cognitive enhancers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The neurotransmitter acetylcholine is known to be important for cognitive processes in the prefrontal cortex. Removal of acetylcholine from prefrontal cortex can disrupt short-term memory performance and is reminiscent of Alzheimer's disease, which is characterized by degeneration of acetylcholine-producing neurons. Stimulation of cholinergic receptors is being explored to create cognitive enhancers for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease and other psychiatric diseases. Here, we stimulated cholinergic receptors in prefrontal cortex and examined its effects on neurons that are engaged in cognitive behavior. Surprisingly, cholinergic stimulation decreased neurons' ability to discriminate between rules. This work suggests that overstimulation of acetylcholine receptors could disrupt neuronal processing during cognition and is relevant to the design of cognitive enhancers based on stimulating the cholinergic system.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: DRG Voltage-Gated Sodium Channel 1.7 Is Upregulated in Paclitaxel-Induced Neuropathy in Rats and in Humans with Neuropathic Pain</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/5/1124?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) is a common adverse effect experienced by cancer patients receiving treatment with paclitaxel. The voltage-gated sodium channel 1.7 (Na&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;1.7) plays an important role in multiple preclinical models of neuropathic pain and in inherited human pain phenotypes, and its gene expression is increased in dorsal root ganglia (DRGs) of paclitaxel-treated rats. Hence, the potential of change in the expression and function of Na&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;1.7 protein in DRGs from male rats with paclitaxel-related CIPN and from male and female humans with cancer-related neuropathic pain was tested here. Double immunofluorescence in CIPN rats showed that Na&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;1.7 was upregulated in small DRG neuron somata, especially those also expressing calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), and in central processes of these cells in the superficial spinal dorsal horn. Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings in rat DRG neurons revealed that paclitaxel induced an enhancement of ProTx II (a selective Na&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;1.7 channel blocker)-sensitive sodium currents. Bath-applied ProTx II suppressed spontaneous action potentials in DRG neurons occurring in rats with CIPN, while intrathecal injection of ProTx II significantly attenuated behavioral signs of CIPN. Complementarily, DRG neurons isolated from segments where patients had a history of neuropathic pain also showed electrophysiological and immunofluorescence results indicating an increased expression of Na&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;1.7 associated with spontaneous activity. Na&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;1.7 was also colocalized in human cells expressing transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 and CGRP. Furthermore, ProTx II decreased firing frequency in human DRGs with spontaneous action potentials. This study suggests that Na&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;1.7 may provide a potential new target for the treatment of neuropathic pain, including chemotherapy (paclitaxel)-induced neuropathic pain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; This work demonstrates that the expression and function of the voltage-gated sodium channel Na&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;1.7 are increased in a preclinical model of chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN), the most common treatment-limiting side effect of all the most common anticancer therapies. This is key as gain-of-function mutations in human Na&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;1.7 recapitulate both the distribution and pain percept as shown by CIPN patients. This work also shows that Na&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;1.7 is increased in human DRG neurons only in dermatomes where patients are experiencing acquired neuropathic pain symptoms. This work therefore has major translational impact, indicating an important novel therapeutic avenue for neuropathic pain as a class.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Decoding Trans-Saccadic Memory</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/5/1114?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;We examine whether peripheral information at a planned saccade target affects immediate postsaccadic processing at the fovea on saccade landing. Current neuroimaging research suggests that presaccadic stimulation has a late effect on postsaccadic processing, in contrast to the early effect seen in behavioral studies. Human participants (both male and female) were instructed to saccade toward a face or a house that, on different trials, remained the same, changed, or disappeared during the saccade. We used a multivariate pattern analysis of electroencephalography data to decode face versus house processing directly after the saccade. The classifier was trained on separate trials without a saccade, where a house or face was presented at the fovea. When the saccade target remained the same across the saccade, we could reliably decode the target 123 ms after saccade offset. In contrast, when the target was changed during the saccade, the new target was decoded at a later time-point, 151 ms after saccade offset. The &quot;same&quot; condition advantage suggests that congruent presaccadic information facilitates processing of the postsaccadic stimulus compared with incongruent information. Finally, the saccade target could be decoded above chance even when it had been removed during the saccade, albeit with a slower time course (162 ms) and poorer signal strength. These findings indicate that information about the (peripheral) presaccadic stimulus is transferred across the saccade so that it becomes quickly available and influences processing at its expected new retinal position (the fovea).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Here we provide neural evidence for early information transfer across saccades. Specifically, we examined the effect of presaccadic sensory information on the initial neuronal processing of a postsaccadic stimuli. Using electroencephalography and multivariate pattern analysis, we found the following: (1) that the identity of the presaccadic stimulus modulated the postsaccadic latency of stimulus relevant information; and (2) that a saccadic neural marker for a saccade target stimulus could be detected even when the stimulus had been removed during saccade. These results demonstrate that information about the peripheral presaccadic stimulus was transferred across the saccade and influenced processing at a new retinal position (the fovea) directly after the saccade landed.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Disruption of Interneuron Neurogenesis in Premature Newborns and Reversal with Estrogen Treatment</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/5/1100?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Many Preterm-born children suffer from neurobehavioral disorders. Premature birth terminates the hypoxic &lt;i&gt;in utero&lt;/i&gt; environment and supply of maternal hormones. As the production of interneurons continues until the end of pregnancy, we hypothesized that premature birth would disrupt interneuron production and that restoration of the hypoxic milieu or estrogen treatment might reverse interneuron generation. To test these hypotheses, we compared interneuronal progenitors in the medial ganglionic eminences (MGEs), lateral ganglionic eminences (LGEs), and caudal ganglionic eminences (CGEs) between preterm-born [born on embryonic day (E) 29; examined on postnatal day (D) 3 and D7] and term-born (born on E32; examined on D0 and D4) rabbits at equivalent postconceptional ages. We found that both total and cycling Nkx2.1&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, Dlx2&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, and Sox2&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cells were more abundant in the MGEs of preterm rabbits at D3 compared with term rabbits at D0, but not in D7 preterm relative to D4 term pups. Total Nkx2.1&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; progenitors were also more numerous in the LGEs of preterm pups at D3 compared with term rabbits at D0. Dlx2&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cells in CGEs were comparable between preterm and term pups. Simulation of hypoxia by dimethyloxalylglycine treatment did not affect the number of interneuronal progenitors. However, estrogen treatment reduced the density of total and proliferating Nkx2.1&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and Dlx2&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cells in the MGEs and enhanced Ascl1 transcription factor. Estrogen treatment also reduced Ki67, c-Myc, and phosphorylation of retinoblastoma protein, suggesting inhibition of the G1-to-S phase transition. Hence, preterm birth disrupts interneuron neurogenesis in the MGE and estrogen treatment reverses interneuron neurogenesis in preterm newborns by cell-cycle inhibition and elevation of Ascl1. We speculate that estrogen replacement might partially restore neurogenesis in human premature infants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Prematurity results in developmental delays and neurobehavioral disorders, which might be ascribed to disturbances in the development of cortical interneurons. Here, we show that preterm birth disrupts interneuron neurogenesis in the medial ganglionic eminence (MGE) and, more importantly, that estrogen treatment reverses this perturbation in the population of interneuron progenitors in the MGE. The estrogen seems to restore neurogenesis by inhibiting the cell cycle and elevating Ascl1 expression. As preterm birth causes plasma estrogen level to drop 100-fold, the estrogen replacement in preterm infants is physiological. We speculate that estrogen replacement might ameliorate disruption in production of interneurons in human premature infants.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: A{beta} mediates F-actin disassembly in dendritic spines leading to cognitive deficits in Alzheimer's disease</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/5/1085?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Dendritic spine loss is recognized as an early feature of Alzheimer's disease (AD), but the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. Dendritic spine structure is defined by filamentous actin (F-actin) and we observed depolymerization of synaptosomal F-actin accompanied by increased globular-actin (G-actin) at as early as 1 month of age in a mouse model of AD (APPswe/PS1E9, male mice). This led to recall deficit after contextual fear conditioning (cFC) at 2 months of age in APPswe/PS1E9 male mice, which could be reversed by the actin-polymerizing agent jasplakinolide. Further, the F-actin-depolymerizing agent latrunculin induced recall deficit after cFC in WT mice, indicating the importance of maintaining F-/G-actin equilibrium for optimal behavioral response. Using direct stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (dSTORM), we show that F-actin depolymerization in spines leads to a breakdown of the nano-organization of outwardly radiating F-actin rods in cortical neurons from APPswe/PS1E9 mice. Our results demonstrate that synaptic dysfunction seen as F-actin disassembly occurs very early, before onset of pathological hallmarks in AD mice, and contributes to behavioral dysfunction, indicating that depolymerization of F-actin is causal and not consequent to decreased spine density. Further, we observed decreased synaptosomal F-actin levels in postmortem brain from mild cognitive impairment and AD patients compared with subjects with normal cognition. F-actin decrease correlated inversely with increasing AD pathology (Braak score, Aβ load, and tangle density) and directly with performance in episodic and working memory tasks, suggesting its role in human disease pathogenesis and progression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Synaptic dysfunction underlies cognitive deficits in Alzheimer's disease (AD). The cytoskeletal protein actin plays a critical role in maintaining structure and function of synapses. Using cultured neurons and an AD mouse model, we show for the first time that filamentous actin (F-actin) is lost selectively from synapses early in the disease process, long before the onset of classical AD pathology. We also demonstrate that loss of synaptic F-actin contributes directly to memory deficits. Loss of synaptosomal F-actin in human postmortem tissue correlates directly with decreased performance in memory test and inversely with AD pathology. Our data highlight that synaptic cytoarchitectural changes occur early in AD and they may be targeted for the development of therapeutics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: HRPU-2, a Homolog of Mammalian hnRNP U, Regulates Synaptic Transmission by Controlling the Expression of SLO-2 Potassium Channel in Caenorhabditis elegans</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/5/1073?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Slo2 channels are large-conductance potassium channels abundantly expressed in the nervous system. However, it is unclear how their expression level in neurons is regulated. Here we report that HRPU-2, an RNA-binding protein homologous to mammalian heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein U (hnRNP U), plays an important role in regulating the expression of SLO-2 (a homolog of mammalian Slo2) in &lt;i&gt;Caenorhabditis elegans&lt;/i&gt;. Loss-of-function (&lt;i&gt;lf&lt;/i&gt;) mutants of &lt;i&gt;hrpu-2&lt;/i&gt; were isolated in a genetic screen for suppressors of a sluggish phenotype caused by a hyperactive SLO-2. In &lt;i&gt;hrpu-2(lf)&lt;/i&gt; mutants, SLO-2-mediated delayed outward currents in neurons are greatly decreased, and neuromuscular synaptic transmission is enhanced. These mutant phenotypes can be rescued by expressing wild-type HRPU-2 in neurons. HRPU-2 binds to &lt;i&gt;slo-2&lt;/i&gt; mRNA, and &lt;i&gt;hrpu-2(lf)&lt;/i&gt; mutants show decreased SLO-2 protein expression. In contrast, &lt;i&gt;hrpu-2(lf)&lt;/i&gt; does not alter the expression of either the BK channel SLO-1 or the &lt;i&gt;Shaker&lt;/i&gt; type potassium channel SHK-1. &lt;i&gt;hrpu-2(lf)&lt;/i&gt; mutants are indistinguishable from wild type in gross motor neuron morphology and locomotion behavior. Together, these observations suggest that HRPU-2 plays important roles in SLO-2 function by regulating SLO-2 protein expression, and that SLO-2 is likely among a restricted set of proteins regulated by HRPU-2. Mutations of human Slo2 channel and hnRNP U are strongly linked to epileptic disorders and intellectual disability. The findings of this study suggest a potential link between these two molecules in human patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein U (hnRNP U) belongs to a family of RNA-binding proteins that play important roles in controlling gene expression. Recent studies have established a strong link between mutations of hnRNP U and human epilepsies and intellectual disability. However, it is unclear how mutations of hnRNP U may cause such disorders. This study shows that mutations of HRPU-2, a worm homolog of mammalian hnRNP U, result in dysfunction of a Slo2 potassium channel, which is critical to neuronal function. Because mutations of Slo2 channels are also strongly associated with epileptic encephalopathies and intellectual disability in humans, the findings of this study point to a potential mechanism underlying neurological disorders caused by hnRNP U mutations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Glutamatergic Transmission to Hypothalamic Kisspeptin Neurons Is Differentially Regulated by Estradiol through Estrogen Receptor {alpha} in Adult Female Mice</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/5/1061?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Estradiol feedback regulates gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons and subsequent luteinizing hormone (LH) release. Estradiol acts via estrogen receptor α (ERα)-expressing afferents of GnRH neurons, including kisspeptin neurons in the anteroventral periventricular (AVPV) and arcuate nuclei, providing homeostatic feedback on episodic GnRH/LH release as well as positive feedback to control ovulation. Ionotropic glutamate receptors are important for estradiol feedback, but it is not known where they fit in the circuitry. Estradiol-negative feedback decreased glutamatergic transmission to AVPV and increased it to arcuate kisspeptin neurons; positive feedback had the opposite effect. Deletion of ERα in kisspeptin cells decreased glutamate transmission to AVPV neurons and markedly increased it to arcuate kisspeptin neurons, which also exhibited increased spontaneous firing rate. KERKO mice had increased LH pulse frequency, indicating loss of negative feedback. These observations indicate that ERα in kisspeptin cells is required for appropriate differential regulation of these neurons and neuroendocrine output by estradiol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The brain regulates fertility through gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons. Ovarian estradiol regulates the pattern of GnRH (negative feedback) and initiates a surge of release that triggers ovulation (positive feedback). GnRH neurons do not express the estrogen receptor needed for feedback (estrogen receptor α [ERα]); kisspeptin neurons in the arcuate and anteroventral periventricular nuclei are postulated to mediate negative and positive feedback, respectively. Here we extend the network through which feedback is mediated by demonstrating that glutamatergic transmission to these kisspeptin populations is differentially regulated during the reproductive cycle and by estradiol. Electrophysiological and &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; hormone profile experiments on kisspeptin-specific ERα knock-out mice demonstrate that ERα in kisspeptin cells is required for appropriate differential regulation of these neurons and for neuroendocrine output.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1801.09997</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Low-dimensional yet rich dynamics often emerge in the brain. Examples include
oscillations and chaotic dynamics during sleep, epilepsy, and voluntary
movement. However, a general mechanism for the emergence of low dimensional
dynamics remains elusive. Here, we consider Wilson-Cowan networks and
demonstrate through numerical and analytical work that a type of homeostatic
regulation of the network firing rates can paradoxically lead to a rich
dynamical repertoire. The dynamics include mixed-mode oscillations, mixed-mode
chaos, and chaotic synchronization. This is true for single recurrently coupled
node, pairs of reciprocally coupled nodes without self-coupling, and networks
coupled through experimentally determined weights derived from functional
magnetic resonance imaging data. In all cases, the stability of the homeostatic
set point is analytically determined or approximated. The dynamics at the
network level are directly determined by the behavior of a single node system
through synchronization in both oscillatory and non-oscillatory states. Our
results demonstrate that rich dynamics can be preserved under homeostatic
regulation or even be caused by homeostatic regulation.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1801.09900</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;We investigated, by using auditory models, how three perceptual parameters,
loudness, pitch and sharpness, determine human echolocation. We used acoustic
recordings from two previous studies, both from stationary situations, and
their resulting perceptual data as input to our analysis. An initial analysis
was on the room acoustics of the recordings. The parameters of interest were
sound pressure level, autocorrelation and spectral centroid. The auditory
models were used to analyze echolocation resulting from the perceptual
variables, i.e. loudness, pitch and sharpness. Relevant auditory models were
chosen to simulate each variable. Based on these results, we calculated
psychophysical thresholds for detecting a reflecting object with constant
physical size. A non-parametric method was used to determine thresholds for
distance, loudness, pitch and sharpness. Difference thresholds were calculated
for the psychophysical variables, since a 2-Alternative-Forced-Choice Paradigm
had originally been used. We found that (1) blind persons could detect objects
at lower loudness values, lower pitch strength, different sharpness values and
at further distances than sighted persons, (2) detection thresholds based on
repetition pitch, loudness and sharpness varied and depended on room acoustics
and type of sound stimuli, (3) repetition pitch was useful for detection at
shorter distances and was determined from the peaks in the temporal profile of
the autocorrelation function, (4) loudness at shorter distances provides
echolocation information, (5) at longer distances, timbre aspects, such as
sharpness, might be used to detect objects. We also discuss binaural
information, movements and the auditory model approach. Autocorrelation was
assumed as a proper measure for pitch, but the question is raised whether a
mechanism based on strobe integration is a viable possibility.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1801.09858</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Decoding specific task states from human fMRI (functional magnetic resonance
imaging) signals constitutes a major goal of neuroimaging. Previous studies of
task-state classification have focused largely on processed fMRI
characteristics (e.g. functional connectivity patterns, activity patterns) or a
single fMRI volume. Here, we assembled a novel deep neural network (DNN) for
classifying directly from 4-D fMRI time series, retaining both spatial and
temporal information of fMRI signals. We trained and tested the DNN classifier
by task fMRI data from human connectome project (HCP) S1200 dataset. Reading
just a single block of fMRI time series of each task for each individual, the
novel classification method identified the seven tasks with 91.75% accuracy in
test. Then we extracted task heatmaps of each time series by a guided
backpropagation approach, and found that the heatmaps had a high similarity
with the group average result of traditional contrast of parameter estimate
(COPE). Furthermore, the DNN could be applied to small dataset. The features
from the intermediate layer of the DNN were trained and used to train a support
vector machine (SVM) to classify four conditions within 300 blocks of task-fMRI
scans, data amount comparable to a usual neuroimaging research, and obtained a
95% accuracy. Our reported findings were the first to demonstrate the ability
of DNN to classify and extract heatmaps from a 4-D fMRI time series, as well as
its ability to be transfer trained by a small dataset. This approach should
enable decoding and mapping subject's task status and furthermore help with
classification and diagnosis of neuropsychiatric diseases.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1801.09848</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The Availability bias, manifested in the over-representation of extreme
eventualities in decision-making, is a well-known cognitive bias, and is
generally taken as evidence of human irrationality. In this work, we present
the first rational, metacognitive account of the Availability bias, formally
articulated at Marr's algorithmic level of analysis. Concretely, we present a
normative, metacognitive model of how a cognitive system should over-represent
extreme eventualities, depending on the amount of time available at its
disposal for decision-making. Our model also accounts for two well-known
framing effects in human decision-making under risk---the fourfold pattern of
risk preferences in outcome probability (Tversky &amp;amp; Kahneman, 1992) and in
outcome magnitude (Markovitz, 1952)---thereby providing the first
metacognitively-rational basis for those effects. Empirical evidence,
furthermore, confirms an important prediction of our model. Surprisingly, our
model is unimaginably robust with respect to its focal parameter. We discuss
the implications of our work for studies on human decision-making, and conclude
by presenting a counterintuitive prediction of our model, which, if confirmed,
would have intriguing implications for human decision-making under risk. To our
knowledge, our model is the first metacognitive, resource-rational process
model of cognitive biases in decision-making.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Yonathan Murin, Jeremy Kim, Josef Parvizi, Andrea Goldsmith&lt;/p&gt;

Epilepsy is one of the most common neurological disorders affecting about 1% of the world population. For patients with focal seizures that cannot be treated with antiepileptic drugs, the common treatment is a surgical procedure for removal of the seizure onset zone (SOZ). In this work we introduce an algorithm for automatic localization of the seizure onset zone (SOZ) in epileptic patients based on electrocorticography (ECoG) recordings. The proposed algorithm builds upon the hypothesis that the abnormal excessive (or synchronous) neuronal activity in the brain leading to seizures &lt;i&gt;starts in the SOZ&lt;/i&gt; and then &lt;i&gt;spreads&lt;/i&gt; to other areas in the brain. Thus, when this abnormal activity starts, signals recorded at electrodes close to the SOZ should have a relatively large &lt;i&gt;causal influence&lt;/i&gt; on the rest of the recorded signals. The SOZ localization is executed in two steps. First, the algorithm represents the set of electrodes using a directed graph in which nodes correspond to recording electrodes and the edges’ weights quantify the &lt;i&gt;pair-wise&lt;/i&gt; causal influence between the recorded signals. Then, the algorithm infers the SOZ from the estimated graph using a variant of the &lt;i&gt;PageRank&lt;/i&gt; algorithm followed by a novel post-processing phase. Inference results for 19 patients show a close match between the SOZ inferred by the proposed approach and the SOZ estimated by expert neurologists (success rate of 17 out of 19).&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/jWjec7d9uT0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Francesco Alessandro Massucci, Francesc Sagués, M. Ángeles Serrano&lt;/p&gt;

The most frequent form of pairwise synthetic lethality (SL) in metabolic networks is known as plasticity synthetic lethality. It occurs when the simultaneous inhibition of paired functional and silent metabolic reactions or genes is lethal, while the default of the functional partner is backed up by the activation of the silent one. Using computational techniques on bacterial genome-scale metabolic reconstructions, we found that the failure of the functional partner triggers a critical reorganization of fluxes to ensure viability in the mutant which not only affects the SL pair but a significant fraction of other interconnected reactions, forming what we call a SL cluster. Interestingly, SL clusters show a strong entanglement both in terms of reactions and genes. This strong overlap mitigates the acquired vulnerabilities and increased structural and functional costs that pay for the robustness provided by essential plasticity. Finally, the participation of coessential reactions and genes in different SL clusters is very heterogeneous and those at the intersection of many SL clusters could serve as supertargets for more efficient drug action in the treatment of complex diseases and to elucidate improved strategies directed to reduce undesired resistance to chemicals in pathogens.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/RgV2wA7v53Q&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Reactome is a free, open-source, open-data, curated and peer-reviewed knowledgebase of biomolecular pathways. One of its main priorities is to provide easy and efficient access to its high quality curated data. At present, biological pathway databases typically store their contents in relational databases. This limits access efficiency because there are performance issues associated with queries traversing highly interconnected data. The same data in a graph database can be queried more efficiently. Here we present the rationale behind the adoption of a graph database (Neo4j) as well as the new ContentService (REST API) that provides access to these data. The Neo4j graph database and its query language, Cypher, provide efficient access to the complex Reactome data model, facilitating easy traversal and knowledge discovery. The adoption of this technology greatly improved query efficiency, reducing the average query time by 93%. The web service built on top of the graph database provides programmatic access to Reactome data by object oriented queries, but also supports more complex queries that take advantage of the new underlying graph-based data storage. By adopting graph database technology we are providing a high performance pathway data resource to the community. The Reactome graph database use case shows the power of NoSQL database engines for complex biological data types.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/7RLEkfWxsdM&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: The extent of ribosome queuing in budding yeast</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/EGKWmrKeD6Y/article</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Alon Diament, Anna Feldman, Elisheva Schochet, Martin Kupiec, Yoav Arava, Tamir Tuller&lt;/p&gt;

Ribosome queuing is a fundamental phenomenon suggested to be related to topics such as genome evolution, synthetic biology, gene expression regulation, intracellular biophysics, and more. However, this phenomenon hasn't been quantified yet at a genomic level. Nevertheless, methodologies for studying translation (e.g. ribosome footprints) are usually calibrated to capture only single ribosome protected footprints (mRPFs) and thus limited in their ability to detect ribosome queuing. On the other hand, most of the models in the field assume and analyze a certain level of queuing. Here we present an experimental-computational approach for studying ribosome queuing based on sequencing of RNA footprints extracted from pairs of ribosomes (dRPFs) using a modified ribosome profiling protocol. We combine our approach with traditional ribosome profiling to generate a detailed profile of ribosome traffic. The data are analyzed using computational models of translation dynamics. The approach was implemented on the &lt;i&gt;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&lt;/i&gt; transcriptome. Our data shows that ribosome queuing is more frequent than previously thought: the measured ratio of ribosomes within dRPFs to mRPFs is 0.2–0.35, suggesting that at least one to five translating ribosomes is in a traffic jam; these queued ribosomes cannot be captured by traditional methods. We found that specific regions are enriched with queued ribosomes, such as the 5’-end of ORFs, and regions upstream to mRPF peaks, among others. While queuing is related to higher density of ribosomes on the transcript (characteristic of highly translated genes), we report cases where traffic jams are relatively more severe in lowly expressed genes and possibly even selected for. In addition, our analysis demonstrates that higher adaptation of the coding region to the intracellular tRNA levels and longer genes are associated with lower queuing levels. Our analysis also suggests that the &lt;i&gt;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&lt;/i&gt; transcriptome undergoes selection for eliminating traffic jams. Thus, our proposed approach is an essential tool for high resolution analysis of ribosome traffic during mRNA translation and understanding its evolution.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/EGKWmrKeD6Y&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Identification of allosteric inhibitors of the ecto-5'-nucleotidase (CD73) targeting the dimer interface</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/MmJFMNHwHpM/article</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Rahila Rahimova, Simon Fontanel, Corinne Lionne, Lars Peter Jordheim, Suzanne Peyrottes, Laurent Chaloin&lt;/p&gt;

The ecto-5’-nucleotidase CD73 plays an important role in the production of immune-suppressive adenosine in tumor micro-environment, and has become a validated drug target in oncology. Indeed, the anticancer immune response involves extracellular ATP to block cell proliferation through T-cell activation. However, in the tumor micro-environment, two extracellular membrane-bound enzymes (CD39 and CD73) are overexpressed and hydrolyze efficiently ATP into AMP then further into immune-suppressive adenosine. To circumvent the impact of CD73-generated adenosine, we applied an original bioinformatics approach to identify new allosteric inhibitors targeting the dimerization interface of CD73, which should impair the large dynamic motions required for its enzymatic function. Several hit compounds issued from virtual screening campaigns showed a potent inhibition of recombinant CD73 with inhibition constants in the low micromolar range and exhibited a non-competitive inhibition mode. The structure-activity relationships studies indicated that several amino acid residues (D366, H456, K471, Y484 and E543 for polar interactions and G453-454, I455, H456, L475, V542 and G544 for hydrophobic contacts) located at the dimerization interface are involved in the tight binding of hit compounds and likely contributed for their inhibitory activity. Overall, the gathered information will guide the upcoming lead optimization phase that may lead to potent and selective CD73 inhibitors, able to restore the anticancer immune response.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/MmJFMNHwHpM&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Biophysical network modeling of the dLGN circuit: Effects of cortical feedback on spatial response properties of relay cells</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/2Ye3WzHcxNo/article</link>

Despite half-a-century of research since the seminal work of Hubel and Wiesel, the role of the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN) in shaping the visual signals is not properly understood. Placed on route from retina to primary visual cortex in the early visual pathway, a striking feature of the dLGN circuit is that both the relay cells (RCs) and interneurons (INs) not only receive feedforward input from retinal ganglion cells, but also a prominent feedback from cells in layer 6 of visual cortex. This feedback has been proposed to affect synchronicity and other temporal properties of the RC firing. It has also been seen to affect spatial properties such as the center-surround antagonism of thalamic receptive fields, i.e., the suppression of the response to very large stimuli compared to smaller, more optimal stimuli. Here we explore the spatial effects of cortical feedback on the RC response by means of a a comprehensive network model with biophysically detailed, single-compartment and multicompartment neuron models of RCs, INs and a population of orientation-selective layer 6 simple cells, consisting of pyramidal cells (PY). We have considered two different arrangements of synaptic feedback from the ON and OFF zones in the visual cortex to the dLGN: phase-reversed (‘push-pull’) and phase-matched (‘push-push’), as well as different spatial extents of the corticothalamic projection pattern. Our simulation results support that a phase-reversed arrangement provides a more effective way for cortical feedback to provide the increased center-surround antagonism seen in experiments both for flashing spots and, even more prominently, for patch gratings. This implies that ON-center RCs receive direct excitation from OFF-dominated cortical cells and indirect inhibitory feedback from ON-dominated cortical cells. The increased center-surround antagonism in the model is accompanied by spatial focusing, i.e., the maximum RC response occurs for smaller stimuli when feedback is present.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/2Ye3WzHcxNo&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Foxg1 Overexpression in Neocortical Pyramids Stimulates Dendrite Elongation Via Hes1 and pCreb1 Upregulation</title>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy007/4828055?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;The architecture of neocortical projection neurons is subject of a complex gene control. Here we demonstrated that &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Foxg1&lt;/span&gt;, a transcription factor gene which patterns the early rostral brain and sets the pace of telencephalic neuronogenesis, specifically stimulates dendrite elongation. This phenomenon occurs in vivo like in vitro, and it is detectable even upon moderate changes of &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Foxg1&lt;/span&gt; expression levels. We found that &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Foxg1&lt;/span&gt; acts by stimulating &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Hes1&lt;/span&gt;, which in turn upregulates pCreb1, a well-known pro-dendritogenic effector, and downregulates &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Syt&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Ndr1&lt;/span&gt;, namely two established antagonizers of dendrite elongation. Moreover, &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Foxg1&lt;/span&gt;-driven pCreb1 upregulation requires PKA and AKT, and correlates with reduced PP1 and PP2A phosphatase activity. These findings contribute to clarify normal neurodevelopmental and activity-related regulation of neuritogenesis. They further suggest that an abnormal sizing of the dendritic tree of neocortical projection neurons may occur in West and Rett syndrome patients with anomalous &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;FOXG1&lt;/span&gt; allele dosages and contribute to their neurolopathological profiles.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: MUMmer4: A fast and versatile genome alignment system</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/ad66bIHbWNc/article</link>

The MUMmer system and the genome sequence aligner nucmer included within it are among the most widely used alignment packages in genomics. Since the last major release of MUMmer version 3 in 2004, it has been applied to many types of problems including aligning whole genome sequences, aligning reads to a reference genome, and comparing different assemblies of the same genome. Despite its broad utility, MUMmer3 has limitations that can make it difficult to use for large genomes and for the very large sequence data sets that are common today. In this paper we describe MUMmer4, a substantially improved version of MUMmer that addresses genome size constraints by changing the 32-bit suffix tree data structure at the core of MUMmer to a 48-bit suffix array, and that offers improved speed through parallel processing of input query sequences. With a theoretical limit on the input size of 141Tbp, MUMmer4 can now work with input sequences of any biologically realistic length. We show that as a result of these enhancements, the nucmer program in MUMmer4 is easily able to handle alignments of large genomes; we illustrate this with an alignment of the human and chimpanzee genomes, which allows us to compute that the two species are 98% identical across 96% of their length. With the enhancements described here, MUMmer4 can also be used to efficiently align reads to reference genomes, although it is less sensitive and accurate than the dedicated read aligners. The nucmer aligner in MUMmer4 can now be called from scripting languages such as Perl, Python and Ruby. These improvements make MUMer4 one the most versatile genome alignment packages available.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/ad66bIHbWNc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: The role of spatial heterogeneity in the evolution of local and global infections of viruses</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/QvuUxAMbOWQ/article</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Koich Saeki, Akira Sasaki&lt;/p&gt;

Viruses have two modes spread in a host body, one is to release infectious particles from infected cells (global infection) and the other is to infect directly from an infected cell to an adjacent cell (local infection). Since the mode of spread affects the evolution of life history traits, such as virulence, it is important to reveal what level of global and local infection is selected. Previous studies of the evolution of global and local infection have paid little attention to its dependency on the measures of spatial configuration. Here we show the evolutionarily stable proportion of global and local infection, and how it depends on the distribution of target cells. Using an epidemic model on a regular lattice, we consider the infection dynamics by pair approximation and check the evolutionarily stable strategy. We also conduct the Monte-Carlo simulation to observe evolutionary dynamics. We show that a higher local infection is selected as target cells become clustered. Surprisingly, the selected strategy depends not only on the degree of clustering but also the abundance of target cells per se.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/QvuUxAMbOWQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Gamma-glutamyl transferase predicts future stroke: a Korean nationwide study</title>
	<link>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25158</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h3&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Objective&lt;/b&gt;: Although gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) is generally regarded as an alternative biomarker for alcohol consumption, its independent role in vascular diseases emerged recently. However, its role in stroke remains unknown. The aim of this study is to clarify the impact of GGT on stroke in a large-sized, national, standardized population cohort in Korea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Methods&lt;/b&gt;: In Korea, the National Health Insurance Service (NHIS) provides full-coverage health insurance service for all citizens. Using data from the NHIS, the NHIS-National Sample Cohort (NHIS-NSC) was designed by randomly selecting 2% of Koreans, carefully considering demographic characteristics. We analyzed eligible individuals from this standardized cohort. The Cox proportional hazards model was used for the longitudinal study investigating the relationship between GGT and stroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Results&lt;/b&gt;: Among the 456,100 eligible participants, 7,459 patients (1.64%) developed stroke as follows: 5,789 ischemic strokes, 1,046 intracerebral hemorrhages (ICHs), and 624 subarachnoid hemorrhages. GGT was independently correlated with increased risk of stroke after adjustment for alcohol consumption and stroke risk factors (hazard ratio (HR), 1.39; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.29–1.51). The risks of both ischemic stroke (HR, 1.45; 95% CI, 1.32–1.58) and ICH (HR, 1.46; 95% CI, 1.18–1.80) were significantly elevated with increasing GGT. Despite some effect modifications by sex, age and alcohol, the risk of total stroke and ischemic stroke in association with GGT remained significant in all subgroups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Interpretation&lt;/b&gt;: In a standard Korean population, GGT was a novel biomarker predicting stroke risk, independently from alcohol consumption and other risk factors.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Pallidal deep brain stimulation modulates cortical excitability and plasticity</title>
	<link>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25156</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h3&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Objective&lt;/b&gt;: Internal globus pallidus (GPi) deep brain stimulation (DBS) relieves symptoms in dystonia patients. However, the physiological effects produced by GPi DBS are not fully understood. In particular, how a single-pulse GPi DBS changes cortical circuits has never been investigated. We studied the modulation of motor cortical excitability and plasticity with single-pulse GPi DBS in dystonia patients with bilateral implantation of GPi DBS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Methods&lt;/b&gt;: The cortical evoked potentials from DBS were recorded with electroencephalography. Transcranial magnetic stimulation with a conditioning-test paired-pulse paradigm was used to investigate the effect of GPi DBS on the primary motor cortex. How GPi DBS might modulate the motor cortical plasticity was tested using a paired associative stimulation paradigm with repetitive pairs of GPi DBS and motor cortical stimulation at specific time intervals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Results&lt;/b&gt;: GPi stimulation produced two peaks of cortical evoked potentials with latencies of ∼10 and ∼25 ms in the motor cortical area. Cortical facilitation was observed at ∼10 ms after single-pulse GPi DBS and cortical inhibition was observed at ∼25 ms interval. Repetitive pairs of GPi stimulation with cortical stimulation at these two time intervals produced long term potentiation-like effects in the motor cortex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Interpretation&lt;/b&gt;: Single-pulse DBS modulates cortical excitability and plasticity at specific time intervals. These effects may be related to the mechanism of action of DBS. Combination of DBS with cortical stimulation at appropriate timing has therapeutic potential and could be explored in the future as a method to enhance the effects of neuromodulation for neurological and psychiatric diseases.

&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;To assess the association between incident Parkinson's disease (PD) and subsequent incident epileptic seizures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;We conducted a retrospective cohort study with a nested case-control analysis using data from the UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink. We identified patients aged ≥40 years with an incident diagnosis of PD between 1995 and 2016 and a matched comparison group of PD-free individuals. We calculated crude incidence rates (IRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of epileptic seizures in PD patients and the PD-free comparison group, and corresponding crude incidence rate ratios (IRRs). In the nested case-control analysis, we calculated adjusted odds ratios (adj. ORs) of incident PD among cases with incident epileptic seizures and seizure-free controls overall and stratified by various, seizure-provoking comorbidities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among 23,086 incident PD patients and 92,343 PD-free individuals, we identified 898 patients with incident epileptic seizures. The crude IR of epileptic seizures in PD patients was 266.7/100,000 person years (95% CI 235.6-297.7), and in PD-free individuals 112.4/100,000 person years (95% CI 103.5-121.3) [IRR: 2.37, 95% CI 2.06-2.37]. The adj. OR of epileptic seizures was 1.68 [95% CI 1.43-1.98]) in PD patients compared with PD-free individuals. PD patients with comorbid brain disorders (adj. OR 12.36 [95% CI 8.74-17.48]) or with &amp;gt;1 seizure-provoking comorbidity (adj. OR 13.24 [95% CI 10.15-17.25]) were at the highest risk of epileptic seizures compared with PD-free individuals with no seizure-provoking comorbidities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interpretation&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;This study suggests that incident PD is associated with an increased risk of incident epileptic seizures. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Neutrophil hyperactivation correlates with Alzheimer's disease progression</title>
	<link>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25159</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h3&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Objective&lt;/b&gt;: Recent studies have underlined the effect of systemic inflammation on the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease. Neutrophils are key components of early innate immunity and contribute to uncontrolled systemic inflammation if not tightly regulated. The aim of our study was to fully characterize human circulating neutrophils at different disease stages in Alzheimer's disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Methods&lt;/b&gt;: We analyzed neutrophil phenotypes and functions in forty-two patients with Alzheimer's disease (sixteen with mild cognitive impairment and twenty-six with dementia), and compared them with twenty-two age-matched healthy subjects. This study was performed directly in whole blood to avoid issues with data interpretation related to cell isolation procedures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Results&lt;/b&gt;: Blood samples from Alzheimer's diseases patients with dementia revealed neutrophil hyperactivation associated with increased reactive oxygen species production and increased levels of intravascular neutrophil extravascular traps. The homeostasis of circulating neutrophils in these patients also changed: the ratio between the harmful hyperreactive CXCR4&lt;sup&gt;high&lt;/sup&gt;/CD62L&lt;sup&gt;low&lt;/sup&gt; senescent and the CD16&lt;sup&gt;bright&lt;/sup&gt;/CD62L&lt;sup&gt;dim&lt;/sup&gt; immunosuppressive neutrophil subsets rose in the later stage of the disease. These abnormalities were greater in fast-decliner than in slow-decliner patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Interpretation&lt;/b&gt;: Our results indicate that the inflammatory properties of circulating neutrophils shift as the percentage of aged neutrophils expands in patients with Alzheimer's disease — changes that may play an instrumental role in establishing systemic chronic inflammation. Most important, our data strongly suggest that the neutrophil phenotype may be associated with the rate of cognitive decline and may thus constitute an innovative and prognostic blood biomarker in patients with Alzheimer's disease.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Metallothioneins are Neuroprotective Agents in Lysosomal Storage Disorders</title>
	<link>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25161</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h3&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Objective&lt;/b&gt;: Lysosomal Storage Disorders (LSDs) are a broad class of inherited metabolic diseases caused by the defective activity of lysosomal enzymes. Central nervous system (CNS) manifestations are present in roughly 50% of LSD patients and represent an unmet medical need for them. We explored the therapeutic potential of Metallothioneins (MTs), a newly identified family of proteins with reported neuroprotective roles, in the murine models of two LSDs with CNS involvement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Methods&lt;/b&gt;: MT-1 over-expressing transgenic mice (MTtg) were crossed with the murine models of Batten and Krabbe diseases. Changes in the survival and in the manifestations of the disease in the MTtg setting were assessed. In addition, we analyzed the therapeutic effects of MT-1 CNS gene delivery in one of these LSD models.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Results&lt;/b&gt;: Constitutive expression of MT-1 exerted favorable phenotypic effects in both LSD models. MT-LSD mice showed a 5-10% increase in survival and slower disease progression as compared to not-transgenic LSD mice. Rescue of Purkinje cells from degeneration and apoptosis was also observed in the MT- LSD models. This phenotypic amelioration was accompanied by a modulation of the disease-associated activated inflammatory microglia phenotype, and by a reduction of oxidative stress. Importantly for the clinical translation of our findings, the very same effects were obtained when MTs were delivered to the brains by systemic AAV gene transfer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Interpretation&lt;/b&gt;: MTs can be considered novel therapeutic agents (and targets) in LSDs and potentiate the effects of approaches aiming at correction of the disease-causing enzyme deficiency in the CNS.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Expression profiling suggests microglial impairment in HIV neuropathogenesis</title>
	<link>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25160</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h3&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Objective&lt;/b&gt;: CD16&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/CD163&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; macrophages (MΦ)s and microglia accumulate in the brains of patients with HIV encephalitis (HIVE), a neuropathological correlate of the most severe form of HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND), HIV-associated dementia (HIV-D). Recently, we found that some parenchymal microglia in brain of HIV&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; subjects without encephalitis (HIV/noE) but with varying degrees of neurocognitive impairment express CD16 and CD163, even in the absence of detectable virus production. To further our understanding of microglial activation in HIV, we investigated expression of specific genes by profiling parenchymal microglia from archival brain tissue of patients with HIVE, HIV/noE, and HIV&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; controls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Methods&lt;/b&gt;: Single-population microarray analyses were performed on ∼2,500 laser capture microdissected CD163&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, CD16&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; or CD68&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; MΦs/microglia per case, using terminal continuation (TC) RNA amplification and a custom-designed array platform.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Results&lt;/b&gt;: Several classes of microglial transcripts in HIVE and HIV/noE, were altered, relative to HIV&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; subjects, including factors related to cell stress, immune activation, and apoptosis. Additionally, several neurotrophic factors are reduced in HIV infection, suggesting an additional mechanism of neuropathogenesis. The majority of transcripts altered in HIVE displayed intermediate changes in HIV/noE.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Interpretation&lt;/b&gt;: Our results support the notion that microglia contribute to the maintenance of brain homeostasis and their potential loss of function in the context of chronic inflammation contributes to neuropathogenesis. Furthermore, they indicate the utility of profiling MΦs/microglia to increase our understanding of microglia function, as well as ascertain alterations in specific pathways, genes, and, ostensibly, encoded proteins that may be amenable to targeted treatment modalities in diseases affecting the brain.

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Subthreshold Activity Underlying the Diversity and Selectivity of the Primary Auditory Cortex Studied by Intracellular Recordings in Awake Marmosets</title>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy006/4824653?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Extracellular recording studies have revealed diverse and selective neural responses in the primary auditory cortex (A1) of awake animals. However, we have limited knowledge on subthreshold events that give rise to these responses, especially in non-human primates, as intracellular recordings in awake animals pose substantial technical challenges. We developed a novel intracellular recording technique in awake marmosets to systematically study subthreshold activity of A1 neurons that underlies their diverse and selective spiking responses. Our findings showed that in contrast to predominantly transient depolarization observed in A1 of anesthetized animals, both transient and sustained depolarization (during or beyond the stimulus period) were observed. Comparing with spiking responses, subthreshold responses were often longer lasting in duration and more broadly tuned in frequency, and showed narrower intensity tuning in non-monotonic neurons and lower response threshold in monotonic neurons. These observations demonstrated the enhancement of stimulus selectivity from subthreshold to spiking responses in individual A1 neurons. Furthermore, A1 neurons classified as regular- or fast-spiking subpopulation based on their spike shapes exhibited distinct response properties in frequency and intensity domains. These findings provide valuable insights into cortical integration and transformation of auditory information at the cellular level in auditory cortex of awake non-human primates.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Genetic Influences on the Development of Cerebral Cortical Thickness During Childhood and Adolescence in a Dutch Longitudinal Twin Sample: The Brainscale Study</title>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy005/4824648?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Previous studies have demonstrated that cortical thickness (CT) is under strong genetic control across the life span. However, little is known about genetic influences that cause changes in cortical thickness (Î”CT) during brain development. We obtained 482 longitudinal MRI scans at ages 9, 12, and 17 years from 215 twins and applied structural equation modeling to estimate genetic influences on (1) cortical thickness between regions and across time, and (2) changes in cortical thickness between ages. Although cortical thickness is largely mediated by the same genetic factor throughout late childhood and adolescence, we found evidence for influences of distinct genetic factors on regions across space and time. In addition, we found genetic influences for cortical thinning during adolescence that is mostly due to fluctuating influences from the same genetic factor, with evidence of local influences from a second emerging genetic factor. This fluctuating core genetic factor and emerging novel genetic factor might be implicated in the rapid cognitive and behavioral development during childhood and adolescence, and could potentially be targets for investigation into the manifestation of psychiatric disorders that have their origin in childhood and adolescence.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy002/4824647?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Quantifying the genetic architecture of the cerebral cortex is necessary for understanding disease and changes to the brain across the lifespan. Prior work shows that both surface area (SA) and cortical thickness (CT) are heritable. However, we do not yet understand the extent to which region-specific genetic factors (i.e., independent of global effects) play a dominant role in the regional patterning or inter-regional associations across the cortex. Using a population sample of young adult twins (&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;N&lt;/span&gt; = 923), we show that the heritability of SA and CT varies widely across regions, generally independent of measurement error. When global effects are controlled for, we detected a complex pattern of genetically mediated clusters of inter-regional associations, which varied between hemispheres. There were generally weak associations between the SA of different regions, except within the occipital lobe, whereas CT was positively correlated within lobar divisions and negatively correlated across lobes, mostly due to genetic covariation. These findings were replicated in an independent sample of twins and siblings (&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;N&lt;/span&gt; = 698) from the Human Connectome Project. The different genetic contributions to SA and CT across regions reveal the value of quantifying sources of covariation to appreciate the genetic complexity of cortical structures.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Predicting peak spectral sensitivities of vertebrate cone visual pigments using atomistic molecular simulations</title>

Vision is the dominant sensory modality in many organisms for foraging, predator avoidance, and social behaviors including mate selection. Vertebrate visual perception is initiated when light strikes rod and cone photoreceptors within the neural retina of the eye. Sensitivity to individual colors, i.e., peak spectral sensitivities (λ&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;) of visual pigments, are a function of the type of chromophore and the amino acid sequence of the associated opsin protein in the photoreceptors. Large differences in peak spectral sensitivities can result from minor differences in amino acid sequence of cone opsins. To determine how minor sequence differences could result in large spectral shifts we selected a spectrally-diverse group of 14 teleost Rh2 cone opsins for which sequences and λ&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; are experimentally known. Classical molecular dynamics simulations were carried out after embedding chromophore-associated homology structures within explicit bilayers and water. These simulations revealed structural features of visual pigments, particularly within the chromophore, that contributed to diverged spectral sensitivities. Statistical tests performed on all the observed structural parameters associated with the chromophore revealed that a two-term, first-order regression model was sufficient to accurately predict λ&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; over a range of 452–528 nm. The approach was accurate, efficient and simple in that site-by-site molecular modifications or complex quantum mechanics models were not required to predict λ&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;. These studies identify structural features associated with the chromophore that may explain diverged spectral sensitivities, and provide a platform for future, functionally predictive opsin modeling.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/zs0zKBCg8z8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Autoimmune encephalitis diagnosis and subgroups were defined by 2016 diagnostic criteria, and infectious encephalitis diagnosis required a confirmed infectious pathogen. Age- and sex-adjusted prevalence and incidence rates were calculated. Patients with encephalitis of uncertain etiology were excluded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

The incidence rates (1995–2015) of autoimmune and infectious encephalitis were 0.8/100,000 and 1.0/100,000 person-years, respectively (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.58). The number of relapses or recurrent hospitalizations was higher for autoimmune than infectious encephalitis (&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.03). The incidence of autoimmune encephalitis increased over time from 0.4/100,000 person-years (1995–2005) to 1.2/100,000 person-years (2006–2015; &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.02), attributable to increased detection of autoantibody-positive cases. The incidence (2.8 vs 0.7/100,000 person-years, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.01) and prevalence (38.3 vs 13.7/100,000, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.04) of autoimmune encephalitis was higher among African Americans than Caucasians. The prevalence of specific neural autoantibodies was as follows: myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein, 1.9/100,000; glutamic acid decarboxylase 65, 1.9/100,000; unclassified neural autoantibody, 1.4/100,000; leucine-rich glioma-inactivated protein 1, 0.7/100,000; collapsin response-mediator protein 5, 0.7/100,000; N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor, 0.6/100,000; antineuronal nuclear antibody type 2, 0.6/100,000; and glial fibrillary acidic protein α, 0.6/100,000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Presynaptic GABAA Receptors Modulate Thalamocortical Inputs in Layer 4 of Rat V1</title>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhx364/4823223?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Fast inhibitory GABAergic transmission plays a fundamental role in neural circuits. Current theories of cortical function assume that fast GABAergic inhibition acts via GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptors on postsynaptic neurons, while presynaptic effects of GABA depend on GABA&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; receptor activation. Manipulations of GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptor activity in vivo produced different effects on cortical function, which were generally ascribed to the mode of action of a drug, more than its site of action. Here we show that in rodent primary visual cortex, α4-containing GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptors can be located on subsets of glutamatergic and GABAergic presynaptic terminals and decrease synaptic transmission. Our data provide a novel mechanistic insight into the effects of changes in cortical inhibition; the ability to modulate inputs onto cortical circuits locally, via presynaptic regulation of release by GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptors.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Cortical Responses to Input From Distant Areas are Modulated by Local Spontaneous Alpha/Beta Oscillations</title>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhx361/4823221?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Any given area in human cortex may receive input from multiple, functionally heterogeneous areas, potentially representing different processing threads. Alpha (8–13 Hz) and beta oscillations (13–20 Hz) have been hypothesized by other investigators to gate local cortical processing, but their influence on cortical responses to input from other cortical areas is unknown. To study this, we measured the effect of local oscillatory power and phase on cortical responses elicited by single-pulse electrical stimulation (SPES) at distant cortical sites, in awake human subjects implanted with intracranial electrodes for epilepsy surgery. In 4 out of 5 subjects, the amplitudes of corticocortical evoked potentials (CCEPs) elicited by distant SPES were reproducibly modulated by the power, but not the phase, of local oscillations in alpha and beta frequencies. Specifically, CCEP amplitudes were higher when average oscillatory power just before distant SPES (−110 to −10 ms) was high. This effect was observed in only a subset (0–33%) of sites with CCEPs and, like the CCEPs themselves, varied with stimulation at different distant sites. Our results suggest that although alpha and beta oscillations may gate local processing, they may also enhance the responsiveness of cortex to input from distant cortical sites.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Rat somatosensory genital cortex contains a large sexually monomorphic representation of the penis in males and the clitoris in females. Genital cortex microstimulation-evoked movements of legs, trunk and genitals, which showed sex-specific differences related to mating behaviors and included thrusting in males and lordosis-like movements in females. Erections/tumescence of penis or clitoris could not be evoked, however. Anterograde tracer injections into penis/clitoris cortex revealed eleven corticocortical and 10 subcortical projection targets, which were qualitatively similar in both sexes. Corticocortical genital-cortex-projections innervated about 3% of the cortical surface and most were analog to other somatosensory projections targeting motor cortex, secondary somatosensory cortex, parietal cortex and perirhinal cortex. Corticocortical projections that differed from other parts of somatosensory cortex targeted male scrotum cortex, female vulva cortex, the somatosensory–ear–auditory-cortex-region and the caudal parietal area. Aligning cytoarchitectonic borders with motor topography, sensory genital responses and corticocortical projections identified a candidate region for genital motor cortex. Most subcortical genital-cortex-projections were analog to other thalamic, tectal or pontine projections of somatosensory cortex. Genital-cortex-specific subcortical projections targeted amygdala and nucleus submedius and accumbens. Microstimulation-effects and projections support a sexual function of genital cortex and suggest that genital cortex is a major hub of sexual sensorimotor processing in rodents.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

While evidence identifying candidate brain areas for each of these processes is well established, the precise mechanistic role carried out by each brain region is still debated. In this article, we present a computational model that clarifies the unique contribution of frontoparietal cortex regions to intertemporal decision making. The model we develop samples reward and delay information stochastically on a moment-by-moment basis. As preference for the choice alternatives evolves, dynamic inhibitory processes are executed by way of asymmetric lateral inhibition. We find that it is these lateral inhibition processes that best explain the contribution of frontoparietal regions to intertemporal decision making exhibited in our data.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: A Brief History of the Encoding of Hand Position by the Cerebral Cortex: Implications for Motor Control and Cognition</title>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhx354/4823218?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Encoding hand position by the cerebral cortex is essential not only for the neural representation of the body image but also for different actions based on eye–hand coordination. These include reaching for visual objects as well as complex movement sequences, such as tea-making, tool use, and object construction, among many others. All these functions depend on a continuous refreshing of the hand position representation, relying on both predictive signaling and afferent information. The hand position influence on neural activity in the parietofrontal system, together with eye position signals, are the basic elements of an eye–hand matrix from which all the above functions can emerge and could be regarded as key features of a network with several entry points, command nodes and outflow pathways, as confirmed by the discovery of a direct parietospinal projection for the control of hand action. The integrity of this system is crucial for daily life, as testified by the consequences of cortical lesions, spanning from severe paralysis to complex forms of apraxia. In this review, I will sketch my personal understanding of the scientific and conceptual trajectory of a line of investigation with many unexpected influences on cortical function and disease, from motor behavior to cognition.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Fear Extinction Recall Modulates Human Frontomedial Theta and Amygdala Activity</title>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhx353/4823217?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Human functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and electroencephalography (EEG) studies, as well as animal studies, indicate that the amygdala and frontomedial brain regions are critically involved in conditioned fear and that frontomedial oscillations in the theta range (4–8 Hz) may support communication between these brain regions. However, few studies have used a multimodal approach to probe interactions among these key regions in humans. Here, our goal was to bridge the gap between prior human fMRI, EEG, and animal findings. Using simultaneous EEG–fMRI recordings 24 h after fear conditioning and extinction, conditioned stimuli presented (CS+E, CS−E) and not presented during extinction (CS+N, CS−N) were compared to identify effects specific to extinction versus fear recall. Differential (CS+ vs. CS−) electrodermal, frontomedial theta (EEG) and amygdala responses (fMRI) were reduced for extinguished versus nonextinguished stimuli. Importantly, effects on theta power covaried with effects on amygdala activation. Fear and extinction recall as indicated by theta explained 60% of the variance for the analogous effect in the right amygdala. Our findings show for the first time the interplay of amygdala and frontomedial theta activity during fear and extinction recall in humans and provide insight into neural circuits consistently linked with top-down amygdala modulation in rodents.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>
