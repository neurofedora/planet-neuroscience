These behavioral responses are thought to be largely driven by genetically pre-programmed circuits. However, they can also vary significantly according to the animal’s previous social experience and physiological state, suggesting that the underlying circuits are shaped by adaptive modulatory changes. Modern tools of neuroscience have enabled the direct interrogation of circuits driving sex-specific behaviors and helped unravel key neural mechanisms underlying their function and modulation. In particular, recent work has shown how individual neuronal responses may combine with population activity to encode specific social information in both sexes. In this review, we summarize recent findings on how sex-specific sensory information is processed in social behavioral circuits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Activation of the DNA-repair mechanism through NBS1 and MRE11 diffusion</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/Goom-28bvCg/article</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Ida Friis, Ilia A. Solov’yov&lt;/p&gt;

The non-homologous end joining of a DNA double strand break is initiated by the MRE11-NBS1-RAD50 complex whose subunits are the first three proteins to arrive to the breakage site thereby making the recruitment time of MRE11, NBS1 and RAD50 essential for cell survival. In the present investigation, the nature of MRE11 and NBS1 transportation from the cytoplasm to the nucleus, hosting the damaged DNA strand, is hypothesized to be a passive diffusive process. The feasibility of such a mechanism is addressed through theoretical and computational approaches which permit establishing the characteristic recruitment time of MRE11 and NBS1 by the nucleus. A computational model of a cell is constructed from a set of biological parameters and the kinetic Monte Carlo algorithm is used to simulate the diffusing MRE11 and NBS1 particles as a random walk process. To accurately describe the experimented data, it is discovered that MRE11 and NBS1 should start diffusion from significantly different starting positions which suggests that diffusion might not be the only transport mechanism of repair protein recruitment to the DNA break.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Goom-28bvCg&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Bayesian comparison of explicit and implicit causal inference strategies in multisensory heading perception</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/ZGcPnbf7Gpw/article</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Luigi Acerbi, Kalpana Dokka, Dora E. Angelaki, Wei Ji Ma&lt;/p&gt;

The precision of multisensory perception improves when cues arising from the same cause are integrated, such as visual and vestibular heading cues for an observer moving through a stationary environment. In order to determine how the cues should be processed, the brain must infer the causal relationship underlying the multisensory cues. In heading perception, however, it is unclear whether observers follow the Bayesian strategy, a simpler non-Bayesian heuristic, or even perform causal inference at all. We developed an efficient and robust computational framework to perform Bayesian model comparison of causal inference strategies, which incorporates a number of alternative assumptions about the observers. With this framework, we investigated whether human observers’ performance in an &lt;i&gt;explicit&lt;/i&gt; cause attribution and an &lt;i&gt;implicit&lt;/i&gt; heading discrimination task can be modeled as a causal inference process. In the explicit causal inference task, all subjects accounted for cue disparity when reporting judgments of common cause, although not necessarily all in a Bayesian fashion. By contrast, but in agreement with previous findings, data from the heading discrimination task only could not rule out that several of the same observers were adopting a forced-fusion strategy, whereby cues are integrated regardless of disparity. Only when we combined evidence from both tasks we were able to rule out forced-fusion in the heading discrimination task. Crucially, findings were robust across a number of variants of models and analyses. Our results demonstrate that our proposed computational framework allows researchers to ask complex questions within a rigorous Bayesian framework that accounts for parameter and model uncertainty.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/ZGcPnbf7Gpw&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Publication date: February 2019&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Source:&lt;/b&gt; Current Opinion in Neurobiology, Volume 54&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Author(s): Aparna Suvrathan&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Synaptic plasticity, induced by the close temporal association of two neural signals, supports associative forms of learning. However, the millisecond timescales for association often do not match the much longer delays for behaviorally relevant signals that supervise learning. In particular, information about the behavioral outcome of neural activity can be delayed, leading to a problem of temporal credit assignment. Recent studies suggest that synaptic plasticity can have temporal rules that not only accommodate the delays relevant to the circuit, but also be precisely tuned to the behavior the circuit supports. These discoveries highlight the diversity of plasticity rules, whose temporal requirements may depend on circuit delays and the contingencies of behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>RSS PAP: Microstructural White Matter Abnormalities in the Dorsal Cingulum of Adolescents with IBS</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0354-17.2018v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Alterations in fractional anisotropy (FA) have been considered to reflect microstructural white matter changes in disease conditions, however no study to date has examined white matter changes using diffusion tensor imaging in adolescents with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). The objective of the present study was two-fold: 1) to determine whether differences in FA, and other non-FA metrics, were present in adolescents with IBS compared to healthy controls using a whole-brain analysis and a ROI-restricted tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) and canonical ROI-based DTI analysis for the cingulum bundle, and 2) to determine if these metrics were related to clinical measures of disease duration and pain intensity in the IBS group. A total of 16 adolescents with a ROME III diagnosis of IBS (females = 12; mean age = 16.29, age range: 11.96-18.5 yrs) and 16 age- and gender-matched controls (females = 12; mean age = 16.24; age range: 11.71-20.32 yrs) participated in this study. Diffusion-weighted images were acquired using a Siemens 3-T Trio Tim Syngo MRI scanner with a 32-channel head coil. The ROI-restricted TBSS and canonical ROI-based DTI analyses revealed that adolescents with IBS showed decreased FA in the right dorsal cingulum bundle compared to controls. No relationship between FA and disease severity measures was found. Microstructural white matter alterations in the right dorsal cingulum bundle in adolescents with IBS may reflect the emergence of a premorbid brain state or a disease-driven process that results from complex changes in pain- and affect-related processing via spinothalamic and corticolimbic pathways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; In the present study we observed white matter abnormalities indexed by decreased fractional anisotropy (FA) in the right dorsal cingulum in adolescents with IBS compared to a healthy cohort. However, this decrease in white matter FA was not related to disease severity measures. These findings represent the first report of white matter brain changes in an adolescent population with IBS.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

detected in intracranial EEG (iEEG) recordings of epilepsy patients, correlate
with an enhancement or disruption of verbal episodic memory encoding. Methods:
We defined ripple and spike events in depth iEEG recordings during list
learning in 107 patients with focal epilepsy. We used logistic regression
models (LRMs) to investigate the relationship between the occurrence of ripple
and spike events during word presentation and the odds of successful word
recall following a distractor epoch, and included the seizure onset zone (SOZ)
as a covariate in the LRMs. Results: We detected events during 58,312 word
presentation trials from 7,630 unique electrode sites. The probability of
ripple on spike (RonS) events was increased in the seizure onset zone (SOZ,
p&amp;lt;0.04). In the left temporal neocortex RonS events during word presentation
corresponded with a decrease in the odds ratio (OR) of successful recall,
however this effect only met significance in the SOZ (OR of word recall 0.71,
95% CI: 0.59-0.85, n=158 events, adaptive Hochberg p&amp;lt;0.01). Ripple on
oscillation events (RonO) that occurred in the left temporal neocortex non-SOZ
also correlated with decreased odds of successful recall (OR 0.52, 95% CI:
0.34-0.80, n=140, adaptive Hochberg , p&amp;lt;0.01). Spikes and RonS that occurred
during word presentation in the left middle temporal gyrus during word
presentation correlated with the most significant decrease in the odds of
successful recall, irrespective of the location of the SOZ (adaptive Hochberg,
p&amp;lt;0.01). Conclusion: Ripples and spikes generated in left temporal neocortex
are associated with impaired verbal episodic memory encoding.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: A simple device for microinjections, manipulations and measurements using an electromorphological chip under microinterferometric control of the interface and membrane processes at the thickness range of 5-1000 nm at different angles.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Micromanipulations, perfusions and measurements performed using glass
microelectrodes filled with an electrolyte is a conventional technique for
experimental morphological and membrane electrophysiological studies at a
single cell and membrane surface level. The typical (effective) diameter of the
end of the glass microelectrode is from 500 up to less than 100 nm, which
prevents one from observing it using a standard optical microscope in
accordance with the optical resolution criteria, since the diameter less than
500 nm is indistinguishable within the interference zone. Microprocessor
programming of the puller (microforge) that provides pulling and tearing allows
to obtain in certain regimes the adjusted diameter and shape of the
micropipette tip, although this result is not fully controlled due to the above
limitations. In this connection it is necessary to design the control devices
for the micropipette tips both at the preparation and operation stages
(intracellular or extracellular insertion). This method also should provide
visualization of the processes occurring upon interaction of the microelectrode
tip with the cell in real time, depending on the electrode type and state,
which allows to level the artifacts arising with the systematic error frequency
from the uncontrolled operation of the micropipette tip after different ways of
the microelectrode filling with the electrolyte. We propose an installation
scheme that solves the above problems by means of introducing an
interferometric device for microscopic control of the microelectrode and
micromanipulator or microperfusor, for the first time for a given type of
optical instruments combined with the interferometric optical scheme.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Fitting a recurrent dynamical neural network to neural spiking data: Tackling with the sigmoidal gain function issues. (arXiv:1807.10048v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1807.10048</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;This is a continuation of a recent study on the modeling of the information
coding in sensory system in the brain. The data from a sensory neurons are
available as discrete spike timings with no amplitude information. In the
simulations, these are generated from a data generator model which has certain
differences from the model being estimated. The model under consideration is
simpler than the one used as a data generator as it has no sigmoidal gain
function parameters. This choice is based on a suggestion from a recent study
which states that inclusion of gain functions to the estimation algorithm
increases issues such as parameter confounding which leads to performance
degradation issues like increased or unpredictable variance changes with
different stimuli configurations. To resolve this issue we consider a more
generic model that has no sigmoidal gain functions to be estimated. Like that
of the first research, we applied a Fourier series stimulus to both data
generator and the estimated network. In order to test the performance of the
proposed scheme, we have repeated the simulations with different sample sizes,
stimulus component counts, amplitude and base frequencies. Mean values of
estimation are presented as tables and the statistical analysis results are
presented in graphical forms. In addition, since we do not have any true
parameter data (for the estimated model) we compare the firing rate responses
of both data generator and estimated models to different stimuli. It appeared
that the responses of both models are almost the same.

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/36523</link>
	<content:encoded>Insights from causal manipulations of brain activity depend on targeting the spatial and temporal scales most relevant for behavior. Using a sensitive perceptual decision task in monkeys, we examined the effects of rapid, reversible inactivation on a spatial scale previously achieved only with electrical microstimulation. Inactivating neurons in area MT with consistent direction tuning produced systematic effects on choice and confidence. Behavioral effects were attenuated over the course of each session, suggesting compensatory adjustments in the downstream readout of MT over tens of minutes. Compensation also occurred on a sub-second time scale: behavior was largely unaffected when the visual stimulus (and concurrent suppression) lasted longer than 350 ms. These trends were similar for choice and confidence, consistent with the idea of a common mechanism underlying both measures. The findings demonstrate the utility of hyperpolarizing opsins for linking neural population activity at fine spatial and temporal scales to cognitive functions in primates.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Genome-wide screens in &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; cells have offered numerous insights into gene function, yet a major limitation has been the inability to stably deliver large multiplexed DNA libraries to cultured cells allowing barcoded pooled screens. Here, we developed a site-specific integration strategy for library delivery and performed a genome-wide CRISPR knockout screen in &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; S2R+ cells. Under basal growth conditions, 1235 genes were essential for cell fitness at a false-discovery rate of 5%, representing the highest-resolution fitness gene set yet assembled for &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt;, including 407 genes which likely duplicated along the vertebrate lineage and whose orthologs were underrepresented in human CRISPR screens. We additionally performed context-specific fitness screens for resistance to or synergy with trametinib, a Ras/ERK/ETS inhibitor, or rapamycin, an mTOR inhibitor, and identified key regulators of each pathway. The results present a novel, scalable, and versatile platform for functional genomic screens in invertebrate cells.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: latest articles: Npas4 recruits CCK basket cell synapses and enhances cannabinoid-sensitive inhibition in the mouse hippocampus</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/35927</link>
	<content:encoded>Experience-dependent expression of immediate-early gene transcription factors (IEG-TFs) can transiently change the transcriptome of active neurons and initiate persistent changes in cellular function. However, the impact of IEG-TFs on circuit connectivity and function is poorly understood. We investigate the specificity with which the IEG-TF NPAS4 governs experience-dependent changes in inhibitory synaptic input onto CA1 pyramidal neurons (PNs). We show that novel sensory experience selectively enhances somatic inhibition mediated by cholecystokinin-expressing basket cells (CCKBCs) in an NPAS4-dependent manner. NPAS4 specifically increases the number of synapses made onto PNs by individual CCKBCs without altering synaptic properties. Additionally, we find that sensory experience-driven NPAS4 expression enhances depolarization-induced suppression of inhibition (DSI), a short-term form of cannabinoid-mediated plasticity expressed at CCKBC synapses. Our results indicate that CCKBC inputs are a major target of the NPAS4-dependent transcriptional program in PNs and that NPAS4 is an important regulator of plasticity mediated by endogenous cannabinoids.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/35869</link>
	<content:encoded>The cellular and synaptic mechanisms driving cell-type-specific function during various cortical network activities and behaviors are poorly understood. Here, we targeted whole-cell recordings to two classes of inhibitory GABAergic neurons in layer 2/3 of the barrel cortex of awake head-restrained mice and correlated spontaneous membrane potential dynamics with cortical state and whisking behavior. Using optogenetic stimulation of single layer 2/3 excitatory neurons we measured unitary excitatory postsynaptic potentials (uEPSPs) across states. During active states, characterized by whisking and reduced low-frequency activity in the local field potential, parvalbumin-expressing neurons depolarized and, albeit in a small number of recordings, received uEPSPs with increased amplitude. In contrast, somatostatin-expressing neurons hyperpolarized and reduced firing rates during active states without consistent change in uEPSP amplitude. These results further our understanding of neocortical inhibitory neuron function in awake mice and are consistent with the hypothesis that distinct genetically-defined cell classes have different state-dependent patterns of activity.</content:encoded>

The cellular mechanisms underlying CNS alterations are poorly understood and no useful treatments exist for the neuropsychological deficits observed in DM1 patients. We investigated the progression of behavioral deficits present in male and female muscleblind-like 2 (&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Mbnl2&lt;/span&gt;) knockout (KO) mice, a rodent model of CNS alterations in DM1, and determined the biochemical and electrophysiological correlates in medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), striatum and hippocampus (HPC). Male KO exhibited more cognitive impairment and depressive-like behavior than female KO mice. In the mPFC, KO mice showed an overexpression of proinflammatory microglia, increased transcriptional levels of &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Dat&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Drd1&lt;/span&gt;, and &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Drd2&lt;/span&gt;, exacerbated dopamine levels, and abnormal neural spiking and oscillatory activities in the mPFC and HPC.

	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Posterior parietal cortex (PPC) is thought to encode and represent the number of objects in a visual scene (i.e., numerosity). Whether this representation is shared for simultaneous and sequential stimuli (i.e., mode independency) is debated. We tested the existence of a common neural substrate for the encoding of these modes using fMRI. While both modes elicited overlapping BOLD response in occipital areas, only simultaneous numerosities significantly activated PPC. Unique activation for sequential numerosities was found in bilateral temporal areas. Multivoxel pattern analysis revealed numerosity selectivity in PPC only for simultaneous numerosities and revealed differential encoding of presentation modes. Voxel-wise numerosity tuning functions for simultaneous numerosities in occipital and parietal ROIs revealed increasing numerosity selectivity along an occipito-to-parietal gradient. Our results suggest that the parietal cortex is involved in the extraction of spatial but not temporal numerosity and question the idea of commonly used cortical circuits for a mode-independent numerosity representation.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

Here, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging and multivariate pattern analyses to examine the effects of acute stress during retrieval. We report that stress reduced the probability of recollecting the details of past experience, and that this impairment was driven, in part, by a disruption of the relationship between hippocampal activation, cortical reinstatement, and memory performance. Moreover, even memories expressed with high confidence were less accurate under stress, and this stress-induced decline in accuracy was explained by reduced posterior hippocampal engagement despite similar levels of category-level cortical reinstatement. Finally, stress degraded the relationship between the engagement of frontoparietal control networks and retrieval decision uncertainty. Collectively, these findings demonstrate the widespread consequences of acute stress on the neural systems of remembering.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Mitochondria play a key role in energy production and calcium buffering, among many other functions. They provide most of the energy required by neurons, and they are transported along axons and dendrites to the regions of higher energy demands. We have used focused ion beam milling and scanning electron microscopy (FIB/SEM) to obtain stacks of serial sections from the somatosensory cortex of the juvenile rat. We have estimated the volume fraction occupied by mitochondria and their distribution between dendritic, axonal, and nonsynaptic processes. The volume fraction of mitochondria increased from layer I (4.59%) to reach its maximum in layer IV (7.74%) and decreased to its minimum in layer VI (4.03%). On average, 44% of mitochondrial volume was located in dendrites, 15% in axons and 41% in nonsynaptic elements. Given that dendrites, axons, and nonsynaptic elements occupied 38%, 23%, and 39% of the neuropil, respectively, it can be concluded that dendrites are proportionally richer in mitochondria with respect to axons, supporting the notion that most energy consumption takes place at the postsynaptic side. We also found a positive correlation between the volume fraction of mitochondria located in neuronal processes and the density of synapses.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;The Ras-MAPK pathway has an established role in neural development and synaptic signaling. Mutations in this pathway are associated with a collection of neurodevelopmental syndromes, Rasopathies; among these, Noonan syndrome (NS) is the most common (1:2000). Prior research has focused on identifying genetic mutations and cellular mechanisms of the disorder, however, effects of NS on the human brain remain unknown. Here, imaging and cognitive data were collected from 12 children with &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;PTPN11&lt;/span&gt;-related NS, ages 4.0–11.0 years (8.98 ± 2.33) and 12 age- and sex-matched typically developing controls (8.79 ± 2.17). We observe reduced gray matter volume in bilateral corpus striatum (Cohen’s &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;d&lt;/span&gt; = −1.0:−1.3), reduced surface area in temporal regions (&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;d&lt;/span&gt; = −1.8:−2.2), increased cortical thickness in frontal regions (&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;d&lt;/span&gt; = 1.2–1.3), and reduced cortical thickness in limbic regions (&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;d&lt;/span&gt; = −1.6), including limbic structures integral to the circuitry of the hippocampus. Further, we find high levels of inattention, hyperactivity, and memory deficits in children with NS. Taken together, these results identify effects of NS on specific brain regions associated with ADHD and learning in children. While our research lays the groundwork for elucidating the neural and behavioral mechanisms of NS, it also adds an essential tier to understanding the Ras-MAPK pathway’s role in human brain development.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Mental Imagery Follows Similar Cortical Reorganization as Perception: Intra-Modal and Cross-Modal Plasticity in Congenitally Blind</title>

	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Cortical plasticity in congenitally blind individuals leads to cross-modal activation of the visual cortex and may lead to superior perceptual processing in the intact sensory domains. Although mental imagery is often defined as a quasi-perceptual experience, it is unknown whether it follows similar cortical reorganization as perception in blind individuals. In this study, we show that auditory versus tactile perception evokes similar intra-modal discriminative patterns in congenitally blind compared with sighted participants. These results indicate that cortical plasticity following visual deprivation does not influence broad intra-modal organization of auditory and tactile perception as measured by our task. Furthermore, not only the blind, but also the sighted participants showed cross-modal discriminative patterns for perception modality in the visual cortex. During mental imagery, both groups showed similar decoding accuracies for imagery modality in the intra-modal primary sensory cortices. However, no cross-modal discriminative information for imagery modality was found in early visual cortex of blind participants, in contrast to the sighted participants. We did find evidence of cross-modal activation of higher visual areas in blind participants, including the representation of specific-imagined auditory features in visual area V4.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Target Interneuron Preference in Thalamocortical Pathways Determines the Temporal Structure of Cortical Responses</title>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy148/5060266?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Sensory processing relies on fast detection of changes in environment, as well as integration of contextual cues over time. The mechanisms by which local circuits of the cerebral cortex simultaneously perform these opposite processes remain obscure. Thalamic “specific” nuclei relay sensory information, whereas “nonspecific” nuclei convey information on the environmental and behavioral contexts. We expressed channelrhodopsin in the ventrobasal specific (sensory) or the rhomboid nonspecific (contextual) thalamic nuclei. By selectively activating each thalamic pathway, we found that nonspecific inputs powerfully activate adapting (slow-responding) interneurons but weakly connect fast-spiking interneurons, whereas specific inputs exhibit opposite interneuron preference. Specific inputs thereby induce rapid feedforward inhibition that limits response duration, whereas, in the same cortical area, nonspecific inputs elicit delayed feedforward inhibition that enables lasting recurrent excitation. Using a mean field model, we confirm that cortical response dynamics depends on the type of interneuron targeted by thalamocortical inputs and show that efficient recruitment of adapting interneurons prolongs the cortical response and allows the summation of sensory and contextual inputs. Hence, target choice between slow- and fast-responding inhibitory neurons endows cortical networks with a simple computational solution to perform both sensory detection and integration.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/379149v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Purkinje cells in the cerebellar cortex fire complex spikes in response to sensory stimulation. These complex spikes are triggered by activity of climbing fibers originating in neurons of the inferior olive. The neurons of the inferior olive are electrically coupled. Strong sensory input has been shown to preferentially recruit coherent climbing fiber activity within one or more specific parasagittal microzones of Purkinje cells, but it is unclear to what extent different types of sensory inputs can drive complex spikes within the same Purkinje cells and how the strength as well as the history of these inputs influence climbing fiber activity. Here, we characterized complex spike responses in crus 1 and crus 2 to various types of sensory stimulation in awake male mice using two-photon calcium imaging. We find that stimulations of different sensory modalities and at different locations have a weak, but consistent, tendency to converge on individual Purkinje cells. The Purkinje cells encoding the same stimulus show increased coherence in their firing patterns and tend to lie close together. Moreover, the complex spike response probability increases when the inter-trial intervals decrease, whereas it depends only weakly on the strength of the sensory stimulus. Our data point towards a mechanism in the olivo-cerebellar system that regulates complex spike firing during mono- or multisensory stimulation around a relatively low set-point, highlighting an integrative coding scheme of complex spike firing under homeostatic control.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Dynamic recovery from depression enables rate encoding in inhibitory synapses</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/379081v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Cortical synapses exhibit a marked short-term depression (STD) during sustained activation, largely due to the depletion of synaptic resources (vesicles). In most excitatory synapses the rate of replenishment of depleted vesicles is constant, determining an inverse relationship between the STD level and the activation rate, which theoretically, severely limits rate coding capabilities in these synapses. In contrast STD in inhibitory synapses made by parvalbumin-positive interneurons (PV-INs) is less affected by usage. We examined STD of the PV-IN to Pyramidal cell synapse in the mouse visual cortex, and found that in these synapses the recovery of depleted resources is not constant but increases linearly with the frequency of use. By combining modeling, dynamic clamp and optogenetics, we demonstrated that this dynamic regulation of recovery enables PV-INs to reduce pyramidal cell firing in a linear manner, which, theoretically, is crucial for controlling the gain of cortical visual responses.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/378760v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>The neocortex is organized into distinct areas, whose interconnectivity underlies sensorimotor transformations and integration. These behaviorally critical functions are mediated by intracortically-projecting neurons (ICPN), which are a heterogeneous population of cells sending axonal branches to distinct cortical areas as well as to subcortical targets. Although population-based and single-cell intracortical wiring diagrams are being identified, the transcriptional signatures corresponding to single-cell axonal projections of ICPN to multiple sites remain unknown. To address this question, we developed a high-throughput approach, &quot;ConnectID&quot;, to link connectome and transcriptome in single neurons. ConnectID combines MAPseq projection mapping (to identify single-neuron multiplex projections) with single-cell RNA sequencing (to identify corresponding gene expression). Using primary somatosensory cortex (S1) ICPN as proof-of-principle neurons, we identify three cardinal targets: (1) the primary motor cortex (M1), (2) the secondary somatosensory cortex (S2) and (3) subcortical targets (Sub). Using ConnectID, we identify transcriptional modules whose combined activities reflect multiplex projections to these cardinal targets. Based on these findings, we propose that the combinatorial activity of connectivity-defined transcriptional modules serves as a generic molecular mechanism to create diverse axonal projection patterns within and across neuronal cell types.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/378588v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Congenital toxoplasmosis is a parasitic disease that occurs due vertical transmission of the protozoan Toxoplasma gondii (T. gondii) during pregnancy. The parasite crosses the placental barrier and reaches the developing brain, infecting progenitor, glial, neuronal and vascular cell types. Although the role of Radial glia (RG) neural stem cells in the development of the brain vasculature has been recently investigated, the impact of T. gondii infection in these events is not yet understood. Herein, we studied the role of T. gondii infection on RG cell function and its interaction with endothelial cells. By infecting isolated RG cells with T. gondii tachyzoites, we observed reduced cell proliferation and neurogenesis without affecting gliogenesis levels. Conditioned medium (CM) from RG control cultures increased ZO-1 and {beta}-catenin protein levels and organization on endothelial bEnd.3 cells membranes, which was completely impaired by CM from infected RG, resulting in decreased transendothelial electrical resistance (TEER). Cytokine Bead Array and ELISA assays revealed the presence of increased levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-6 and reduced levels of anti-inflammatory cytokine TGF-{beta}1 in CM from T. gondii-infected RG cells. Treatment with recombinant TGF-{beta}1 concomitantly with CM from infected RG cultures led to restoration of ZO-1 staining in bEnd.3 cells. Our results suggest that infection of RG cells by T. gondii modulate cytokine secretion, which might contribute to endothelial loss of barrier properties, thus leading to impairment of neurovascular interaction establishment.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/378562v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>A growing literature conceptualises human brain development from a network perspective, but it remains unknown how functional brain networks are refined during the preschool years. The extant literature diverges in its characterisation of functional network development, with little agreement between haemodynamic- and electrophysiology-based measures. In children aged from 4 to 12 years, as well as adults, age appropriate magnetoencephalography was used to estimate unbiased network topology, using minimum spanning tree (MST) constructed from phase synchrony between beamformer-reconstructed time-series. During childhood, network topology becomes increasingly segregated, while cortical regions decrease in centrality. We propose a heuristic MST model, in which a clear developmental trajectory for the emergence of complex brain networks is delineated. Our results resolve topological reorganisation of functional networks across temporal and special scales in youth and fill a gap in the literature regarding neurophysiological mechanisms of functional brain maturation during the preschool years.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/378547v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Microglia are resident immune cells that play critical roles in maintaining normal physiology of the central nervous system. Remarkably, microglia have intrinsic capacity to replenish after being acutely ablated. However, the underlying mechanisms that drive such microglial restoration remain elusive. Here, we removed microglia via CSF1R inhibitor PLX5622 and characterized repopulation both spatially and temporally. We also investigated the cellular origin of repopulated microglia and report that microglia are replenished via self-renewal, with little contribution from non-microglial lineage progenitors, including nestin+ progenitors and the circulating myeloid population. Interestingly, spatial analyses with multi-color labeling reveal that newborn microglia recolonize the parenchyma by forming distinctive clusters that maintain stable territorial boundaries over time, indicating proximal expansion nature of adult microgliogenesis and stability of microglia tiling. Temporal transcriptome profiling from newborn microglia at different repopulation stages revealed that the adult newborn microglia gradually regain steady-state maturity from an immature state that is reminiscent of neonatal stage and follow a series of maturation programs that include NF-kB activation, interferon immune activation and apoptosis, etc. Importantly, we show that the restoration of microglial homeostatic density requires NF-kB signaling as well as apoptotic egress of excessive cells. In summary, our study reports key events that take place from microgliogenesis to homeostasis re-establishment.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/378372v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>The striatum controls behaviors via the activity of direct and indirect pathway projection neurons (dSPN and iSPN) that are intermingled in all compartments. While such mosaic ensures the balanced activity of the two pathways, how it emerges remains largely unknown. Here, we show that both SPN populations are specified embryonically and progressively intermix through multidirectional iSPN migration. Using conditional mutants of the dSPN-specific transcription factor Ebf1, we found that inactivating this gene impaired selective dSPN properties, including axon pathfinding, whereas molecular and functional features of iSPN were preserved. Remarkably, Ebf1 mutation disrupted iSPN/dSPN intermixing, resulting in an uneven distribution. Such architectural defect was selective of the matrix compartment, revealing that intermixing is a parallel process to compartment formation. Our study reveals that, while iSPN/dSPN specification is largely independent, their intermingling emerges from an active migration of iSPN, thereby providing a novel framework for the building of striatal architecture.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/378323v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>We present a computational observer model of the human spatial contrast sensitivity (CSF) function based on the Image Systems EngineeringTools for Biology (ISETBio) simulation framework. We demonstrate that ISETBio-derived CSFs agree well with CSFs derived using traditional ideal observer approaches, when the mosaic, optics, and inference engine are matched. Further simulations extend earlier work by considering more realistic cone mosaics, more recent measurements of human physiological optics, and the effect of varying the inference engine used to link visual representations to psychohysical performance. Relative to earlier calculations, our simulations show that the spatial structure of realistic cone mosaics reduces upper bounds on performance at low spatial frequencies, whereas realistic optics derived from modern wavefront measurements lead to increased upper bounds high spatial frequencies. Finally, we demonstrate that the type of inference engine used has a substantial effect on the absolute level of predicted performance. Indeed, the performance gap between an ideal observer with exact knowledge of the relevant signals and human observers is greatly reduced when the inference engine has to learn aspects of the visual task. ISETBio-derived estimates of stimulus representations at different stages along the visual pathway provide a powerful tool for computing the limits of human performance.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/378307v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>The role of large, rare copy number variants (CNVs) in neurodevelopmental disorders is well established, but their contribution to common psychiatric disorders, such as depression, remains unclear. We have previously shown that a substantial proportion of CNV enrichment in schizophrenia is explained by CNVs associated with neurodevelopmental disorders. Depression shares genetic risk with schizophrenia and is frequently comorbid with neurodevelopmental disorders, suggesting to us the hypothesis that if CNVs play a role in depression, neurodevelopmental CNVs are those most likely to be associated. We confirmed this in UK Biobank by showing that neurodevelopmental CNVs were associated with depression (24,575 cases, 5.87%; OR=1.36, 95% CI 1.22-1.51, p=1.61x10-8), whilst finding no evidence implicating other CNVs. Four individual neurodevelopmental CNVs increased risk of depression (1q21.1 duplication, PWS duplication, 16p13.11 deletion, 16p11.2 duplication). The association between neurodevelopmental CNVs and depression was partially explained by social deprivation but not by education attainment or physical illness.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/378281v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Depression is characterized by a marked decrease in social interactions and blunted sensitivity to rewards. Surprisingly, despite the importance of social deficits in depression, non-social aspects have been disproportionally investigated. As a consequence, the cognitive mechanisms underlying atypical decision-making in social contexts in depression are poorly understood. In the present study, we investigate whether deficits in reward processing interact with the social context and how this interaction is affected by self-reported depression and anxiety symptoms. Two cohorts of subjects (discovery and replication sample: N = 50 each) took part in a task involving reward learning in a social context with different levels of social information (absent, partial and complete). Behavioral analyses revealed a specific detrimental effect of depressive symptoms, but not anxiety; on behavioral performance in the presence of social information, i.e. when participants were informed about the choices of another player. Model-based analyses further characterized the computational nature of this deficit as a negative audience effect, rather than a deficit in the way choices of others and rewards are integrated in decision making. To conclude, our results shed light on the cognitive and computational mechanisms underlying the interaction between social cognition, reward learning and decision-making in depressive disorders.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/378224v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Typicality, or averageness, is one of the key features that influences face evaluation, but the role of this property in the perception of facial expressions of emotions is still not fully understood. Typical faces are usually considered more pleasant and trustworthy, and neuroimaging results suggest typicality modulates amygdala and fusiform activation, influencing face perception. At the same time, there is evidence that arousal is a key affective feature that modulates neural reactivity to emotional expressions. In this sense, it remains unclear whether the neural effects of typicality depend on altered perceptions of affect from facial expressions or if the effects of typicality and affect independently modulate face processing. The goal of this work was to dissociate the effects of typicality and affective properties, namely valence and arousal, in electrophysiological responses and self-reported ratings across several facial expressions of emotion. Two ERP components relevant for face processing were measured, the N170 and Vertex Positive Potential (VPP), complemented by subjective ratings of typicality, valence, and arousal, in a sample of 30 healthy young adults (21 female). The results point out to a modulation of the electrophysiological responses by arousal, regardless of the typicality or valence properties of the face. These findings suggest that previous findings of neural responses to typicality may be better explained by accounting for the subjective perception of arousal in facial expressions.</content:encoded>

Integrated information theory provides a mathematical framework to fully characterize the cause-effect structure of a physical system. Here, we introduce &lt;i&gt;PyPhi&lt;/i&gt;, a Python software package that implements this framework for causal analysis and unfolds the full cause-effect structure of discrete dynamical systems of binary elements. The software allows users to easily study these structures, serves as an up-to-date reference implementation of the formalisms of integrated information theory, and has been applied in research on complexity, emergence, and certain biological questions. We first provide an overview of the main algorithm and demonstrate PyPhi’s functionality in the course of analyzing an example system, and then describe details of the algorithm’s design and implementation. PyPhi can be installed with Python’s package manager via the command ‘pip install pyphi’ on Linux and macOS systems equipped with Python 3.4 or higher. PyPhi is open-source and licensed under the GPLv3; the source code is hosted on GitHub at https://github.com/wmayner/pyphi. Comprehensive and continually-updated documentation is available at https://pyphi.readthedocs.io. The pyphi-users mailing list can be joined at https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/pyphi-users.

With remarkable spatial and temporal specificities, peripheral membrane proteins bind to biological membranes. They do this without compromising solubility of the protein, and their binding sites are not easily distinguished. Prototypical peripheral membrane binding sites display a combination of patches of basic and hydrophobic amino acids that are also frequently present on other protein surfaces. The purpose of this contribution is to identify simple but essential components for membrane binding, through structural criteria that distinguish exposed hydrophobes at membrane binding sites from those that are frequently found on any protein surface. We formulate the concepts of &lt;i&gt;protruding hydrophobes&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;co-insertability&lt;/i&gt; and have analysed more than 300 families of proteins that are classified as peripheral membrane binders. We find that this structural motif strongly discriminates the surfaces of membrane-binding and non-binding proteins. Our model constitutes a novel formulation of a structural pattern for membrane recognition and emphasizes the importance of subtle structural properties of hydrophobic membrane binding sites.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/2OkhnFitdjc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Movement is fundamental to human and animal life, emerging through interaction of complex neural, muscular, and skeletal systems. Study of movement draws from and contributes to diverse fields, including biology, neuroscience, mechanics, and robotics. OpenSim unites methods from these fields to create fast and accurate simulations of movement, enabling two fundamental tasks. First, the software can calculate variables that are difficult to measure experimentally, such as the forces generated by muscles and the stretch and recoil of tendons during movement. Second, OpenSim can predict novel movements from models of motor control, such as kinematic adaptations of human gait during loaded or inclined walking. Changes in musculoskeletal dynamics following surgery or due to human–device interaction can also be simulated; these simulations have played a vital role in several applications, including the design of implantable mechanical devices to improve human grasping in individuals with paralysis. OpenSim is an extensible and user-friendly software package built on decades of knowledge about computational modeling and simulation of biomechanical systems. OpenSim’s design enables computational scientists to create new state-of-the-art software tools and empowers others to use these tools in research and clinical applications. OpenSim supports a large and growing community of biomechanics and rehabilitation researchers, facilitating exchange of models and simulations for reproducing and extending discoveries. Examples, tutorials, documentation, and an active user forum support this community. The OpenSim software is covered by the Apache License 2.0, which permits its use for any purpose including both nonprofit and commercial applications.

	<title>RSS PAP: Central Compensation in Auditory Brainstem after Damaging Noise Exposure</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0250-18.2018v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Noise exposure is one of the most common causes of hearing loss and peripheral damage to the auditory system. A growing literature suggests that the auditory system can compensate for peripheral loss through increased central neural activity. The current study sought to investigate the link between noise exposure, increases in central gain, synaptic reorganization, and auditory function. All axons of the auditory nerve project to the cochlear nucleus, making it a requisite nucleus for sound detection. As the first synapse in the central auditory system, the cochlear nucleus is well-positioned to respond plastically to loss of peripheral input. To investigate noise-induced compensation in the central auditory system, we measured auditory brainstem responses (ABRs), auditory perception, and collected tissue from mice exposed to broadband noise. Noise-exposed mice showed elevated ABR thresholds, reduced ABR wave 1 amplitudes, and spiral ganglion neuron loss. Despite peripheral damage, noise-exposed mice were hyper-reactive to loud sounds and showed nearly normal behavioral sound detection thresholds. Ratios of late ABR peaks (2-4) relative to the first ABR peak indicated that brainstem pathways were hyperactive in noise-exposed mice, while anatomical analysis indicated there was an imbalance between expression of excitatory and inhibitory proteins in the ventral cochlear nucleus. The results of the current study suggest that a reorganization of excitation and inhibition in the ventral cochlear nucleus may drive hyperactivity in the central auditory system. This increase in central gain can compensate for peripheral loss to restore some aspects of auditory function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Noise exposure can cause significant damage to the peripheral auditory system. Previous work has shown that the dorsal cochlear nucleus, inferior colliculus, auditory thalamus, and auditory cortex become hyperactive following damage to the peripheral auditory system, which may compensate for decreased sensory input. Here we show that after noise exposure, hyperactivity develops in the auditory brainstem as a result of reorganization of excitation and inhibition in the ventral cochlear nucleus. The compensatory plasticity observed at this early stage of the primary auditory pathway may contribute to the hyperactivity reported at later stages. Further, we show that this hyperactivity can compensate for reduced sensory input to partially restore some aspects of auditory function.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>RSS PAP: Sensory Adaptation to Chemical Cues by Vomeronasal Sensory Neurons</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0223-18.2018v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Sensory adaptation is a source of experience-dependent feedback that impacts responses to environmental cues. In the mammalian main olfactory system (MOS), adaptation influences sensory coding at its earliest processing stages. Sensory adaptation in the accessory olfactory system (AOS) remains incompletely explored, leaving many aspects of the phenomenon unclear. We investigated sensory adaptation in vomeronasal sensory neurons (VSNs) using a combination of &lt;i&gt;in situ&lt;/i&gt; Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; imaging and electrophysiology. Parallel studies revealed prominent short-term sensory adaptation in VSNs upon repeated stimulation with mouse urine and monomolecular bile acid ligands at inter-stimulus intervals (ISIs) less than 30 s. In such conditions, Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; signals and spike rates were often reduced by more than 50%, leading to dramatically reduced chemosensory sensitivity. Short-term adaptation was reversible over the course of minutes. Population Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; imaging experiments revealed the presence of a slower form of VSN adaptation that accumulated over dozens of stimulus presentations delivered over tens of minutes. Most VSNs showed strong adaptation, but in a substantial VSN subpopulation adaptation was diminished or absent. Investigation of same- and opposite-sex urine responses in male and female VSNs revealed that adaptation to same-sex cues occurred at ISIs up to 180 s, conditions that did not induce adaptation to opposite-sex cues. This result suggests that VSN sensory adaptation can be modulated by sensory experience. These studies comprehensively establish the presence of VSN sensory adaptation and provide a foundation for future inquiries into the molecular and cellular mechanisms of this phenomenon and its impact on mammalian behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Peripheral sensory adaptation is an initial mechanism for experience-driven feedback in the nervous system. In the mammalian accessory olfactory system, which senses many social chemosignals, peripheral adaptation remains a subject of some debate. We investigated sensory adaptation to natural cues and monomolecular ligands in acute preparations of the vomeronasal organ, finding evidence for short- and long-term adaptation on repeated stimulation at defined intervals. We further tested whether adaptation differed to same-sex versus opposite-sex cues, finding that sensory adaptation was more prominent for same-sex cues in both males and females. These inquiries into accessory olfactory system adaptation provide a foundation for future inquiries into this phenomenon.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Neural measures of causal role of observers' facial mimicry on visual working memory for facial expressions. (arXiv:1807.09505v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1807.09505</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Simulation models of facial expressions propose that sensorimotor regions may
increase the clarity of facial expressions representations in extrastriate
areas. We monitored the event-related potential marker of visual working memory
(VWM) representations, namely the sustained posterior contralateral negativity
(SPCN), also termed contralateral delay activity (CDA), while participants
performed a change detection task including to-be-memorized faces with
different intensities of anger. In one condition participants could freely use
their facial mimicry during the encoding/VWM maintenance of the faces, while in
a different condition, participants had their facial mimicry blocked by a gel.
Notably, SPCN amplitude was reduced for faces in the blocked mimicry condition
when compared to the free mimicry condition. This modulation interacted with
the empathy levels of participants such that only participants with medium-high
empathy scores showed such reduction of the SPCN amplitude when their mimicry
was blocked. The SPCN amplitude was larger for full expressions when compared
to neutral and subtle expressions, while subtle expressions elicited lower SPCN
amplitudes than neutral faces. These findings provide evidence of a functional
link between mimicry and VWM for faces, and further shed light on how this
memory system may receive feedbacks from sensorimotor regions during the
processing of facial expressions.

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/38958</link>
	<content:encoded>The innate immune sensor RIG-I detects cytosolic viral RNA and requires a conformational change caused by both ATP and RNA binding to induce an active signalling state and to trigger an immune response. Previously, we showed that ATP hydrolysis removes RIG-I from lower affinity self-RNAs (Lässig et al., 2015), revealing how ATP turnover helps RIG‑I distinguish viral from self-RNA and explaining why a mutation in a motif that slows down ATP hydrolysis causes the autoimmune disease Singleton-Merten syndrome (SMS). Here we show that a different, mechanistically unexplained SMS variant, C268F, localised in the ATP binding P-loop, can signal independently of ATP but still dependent on RNA. The structure in complex with dsRNA reveals that C268F helps induce a similar structural conformation in RIG-I than ATP. Our results uncover an unexpected mechanism how a mutation in a P-loop ATPase can induce a gain-of-function ATP state in the absence of ATP.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>The nuclear RNA exosome complex mediates the processing of structured RNAs and the decay of aberrant non-coding RNAs, an important function particularly in human cells. Most mechanistic studies to date have focused on the yeast system. Here, we reconstituted and studied the properties of a recombinant 14-subunit human nuclear exosome complex. In biochemical assays, the human exosome embeds a longer RNA channel than its yeast counterpart. The 3.8 Å resolution cryo-EM structure of the core complex bound to a single-stranded RNA reveals that the RNA channel path is formed by two distinct features of the hDIS3 exoribonuclease: an open conformation and a domain organization more similar to bacterial RNase II than to yeast Rrp44. The cryo-EM structure of the holo-complex shows how obligate nuclear cofactors position the hMTR4 helicase at the entrance of the core complex, suggesting a striking structural conservation from lower to higher eukaryotes.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/38564</link>
	<content:encoded>Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC1) is a polytopic membrane protein with 13 transmembrane helices that exports LDL-derived cholesterol from lysosomes by carrying it through the 80 Å glycocalyx and the 40 Å lipid bilayer. Transport begins when cholesterol binds to the N-terminal domain (NTD) of NPC1, which projects to the surface of the glycocalyx. Here, we reconstitute cholesterol transport by expressing the NTD as a fragment separate from the remaining portion of NPC1. When co-expressed, the two NPC1 fragments reconstitute cholesterol transport, indicating that the NTD has the flexibility to interact with the remaining parts of NPC1 even when not covalently linked. We also show that cholesterol can be transferred from the NTD of one full-length NPC1 to another NPC1 molecule that lacks the NTD. These data support the hypothesis that cholesterol is transported through interactions between two or more NPC1 molecules.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/37503</link>
	<content:encoded>Tryparedoxin peroxidases, distant relatives of glutathione peroxidase 4 in higher eukaryotes, are responsible for the detoxification of lipid-derived hydroperoxides in African trypanosomes. The lethal phenotype of procyclic &lt;i&gt;Trypanosoma brucei&lt;/i&gt; that lack the enzymes fulfils all criteria defining a form of regulated cell death termed ferroptosis. Viability of the parasites is preserved by α-tocopherol, ferrostatin-1, liproxstatin-1 and deferoxamine. Without protecting agent, the cells display, primarily mitochondrial, lipid peroxidation, loss of the mitochondrial membrane potential and ATP depletion. Sensors for mitochondrial oxidants and chelatable iron as well as overexpression of a mitochondrial iron-superoxide dismutase attenuate the cell death. Electron microscopy revealed mitochondrial matrix condensation and enlarged cristae. The peroxidase-deficient parasites are subject to lethal iron-induced lipid peroxidation that probably originates at the inner mitochondrial membrane. Taken together, ferroptosis is an ancient cell death program that can occur at individual subcellular membranes and is counterbalanced by evolutionary distant thiol peroxidases.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/34414</link>
	<content:encoded>Many microbes induce striking behavioral changes in their animal hosts, but how they achieve this is poorly understood, especially at the molecular level. Mechanistic understanding has been largely constrained by the lack of an experimental system amenable to molecular manipulation. We recently discovered a strain of the behavior-manipulating fungal pathogen &lt;i&gt;Entomophthora muscae &lt;/i&gt;infecting wild &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt;, and established methods to infect &lt;i&gt;D. melanogaster &lt;/i&gt;in the lab. Lab-infected flies manifest the moribund behaviors characteristic of &lt;i&gt;E. muscae &lt;/i&gt;infection: hours before death, they climb upward, extend their proboscides, affixing in place, then raise their wings, clearing a path for infectious spores to launch from their abdomens. We found that &lt;i&gt;E. muscae &lt;/i&gt;invades the nervous system, suggesting a direct means by which the fungus could induce behavioral changes. Given the vast molecular toolkit available for &lt;i&gt;D. melanogaster&lt;/i&gt;, we believe this new system will enable rapid progress in understanding how &lt;i&gt;E. muscae &lt;/i&gt;manipulates host behavior.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/378414v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Taste circuits are genetically determined to elicit an innate appetitive or aversive response, ensuring that animals consume nutritious foods and avoid the ingestion of toxins. We have examined the response of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster to acetic acid, a tastant that can be a metabolic resource but can also be toxic to the fly. Our data reveal that flies accommodate these conflicting attributes of acetic acid by virtue of a hunger-dependent switch in their behavioral response to this stimulus. Fed flies show taste aversion to acetic acid, likely a response to its potential toxicity, whereas starved flies show a robust appetitive response that may reflect their overriding need for calories. These opposing responses are mediated by two different classes of taste neurons. Acetic acid activates both the sugar and bitter pathways, which have opposing effects on feeding behavior. Hunger shifts the response from aversion to attraction by enhancing the appetitive sugar pathway as well as suppressing the aversive bitter pathway. Thus a single tastant can drive opposing behaviors by activating distinct taste pathways modulated by internal state.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Sex differences in hippocampal cytokines after systemic immune challenge</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/378257v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Illness or injury causes an inflammatory state consisting of activation of immune cells and increased production of cytokines in the periphery and in the brain, resulting changes in physiological processes, behavior, and cognition. The immune and neuroimmune response consist of a tightly controlled activation and resolution of cytokine networks, the precise patterns of which are determined, in part, by the immune stimulus. Importantly, the pattern of cytokines, rather than the presence of any individual cytokine, determines the functional outcome of immune signaling. In this project, we hypothesized that given sex differences in behavioral responses to immune challenge, the patterns of cytokine activation induced in the hippocampus after a systemic immune challenge differ between males and females. We examined 32 cytokines in the hippocampus and periphery of male and female mice 2, 6, 24, 48, and 168 hours after an acute systemic injection of lipopolysaccharides (LPS; 250g/kg). All animals showed resolution of the neuroimmune response 168 hours after immune challenge Males and females differed in the specific cytokines activated in the hippocampus, the magnitude of elevation, and the timecourse of activation and resolution of neuroimmune signaling. Briefly, male-specific elevations included IFN{gamma}, CSF1 (M-CSF) and CSF2 (GM-CSF), and the regulatory cytokine IL-10, whereas female-specific activation included the IL-2 family and the regulatory IL-4. Females showed rapid elevation and resolution of the hippocampal immune response, with cytokine levels peaking at 2 and 6 hours after immune challenge. In contrast, males showed slower and more persistent activation, with peaks at 6-24 hours. These findings demonstrate that sex differences in neuroimmune response are not limited to the intensity of the cytokine response, but more importantly differs in the cytokine networks activated. These findings suggest that delineating the broad, sex-specific patterns of cytokine activity in the brain is critical for understanding of the role of neuroimmune signaling in neural function.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Desensitization of NMDA receptors depends of their association with plasma membrane sodium-calcium exchangers in lipid nanoclasters</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/378026v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>The plasma membrane Na+/Ca2+-exchanger (NCX) has recently been shown to regulate Ca2+-dependent N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) desensitization, suggesting tight interaction of NCXs and NMDARs in lipid nanoclaster or &quot;rafts&quot;. To evaluate possible role of this interaction we studied effects of Li+ on NMDA-elicited whole-cell currents and Ca2+ responses of rat cortical neurons in vitro before and after cholesterol extraction by methyl-{beta}-cyclodextrin (M{beta}CD). Substitution Li+ for Na+ in the external solution caused a concentration-dependent decrease of steady-state NMDAR currents from 440 {+/-} 71 pA to 111 {+/-} 29 pA in 140 mM Na+ and 140 mM Li+, respectively. Li+ inhibition of NMDAR currents disappeared in the absence of Ca2+ in the external solution (Ca2+-free), suggesting that Li+ enhanced Ca2+-dependent NMDAR desensitization. Whereas the cholesterol extraction with M{beta}CD induced NMDAR current decrease to 136 {+/-} 32 pA in 140 mM Na+ and 46 {+/-} 15 pA in 140 mM Li+, the IC50 values for the Li+ inhibition were similar (about 44 mM Li+) before and after this procedure. In Ca2+-free Na+ solution steady-state NMDAR currents after the cholesterol extraction were 47 {+/-} 6 % of control currents. Apparently this amplitude decrease was not Ca2+-dependent. In 1 mM Ca2+ Na+ solution the Ca2+-dependent NMDAR desensitization was greater when cholesterol was extracted. Obviously, this procedure promoted its development. In agreement, Li+ and KB-R7943, an inhibitor of NCX, both considerably reduced NMDAR-mediated Ca2+ responses. The cholesterol extraction itself caused a decrease of NMDAR-mediated Ca2+ responses and, in addition, abolished the effects of Li+ and KB-R7943. Taken together our data suggest that NCXs downregulate the Ca2+-dependent NMDAR desensitization. Most likely, this is determined by co-localization and tight functional interaction of NCX and NMDAR molecules in membrane lipid rafts. Their destruction is accompanied by an enhancement of NMDAR desensitization and a loss of NCX-selective agent effects on NMDARs.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/377887v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Much of what is known about the timing of visual processing in the brain is inferred from intracranial studies in monkeys, with human data limited to mainly non-invasive methods with lower spatial resolution. Here, we estimated visual onset latencies from electrocorticographic (ECoG) recordings in a patient who was implanted with 112 sub-dural electrodes, distributed across the posterior cortex of the right hemisphere, for pre-surgical evaluation of intractable epilepsy. Functional MRI prior to surgery was used to determine boundaries of visual areas. The patient was presented with images of objects from several categories. Event Related Potentials (ERPs) were calculated across all categories excluding targets, and statistically reliable onset latencies were determined using a bootstrapping procedure over the single trial baseline activity in individual electrodes. The distribution of onset latencies broadly reflected the known hierarchy of visual areas, with the earliest cortical responses in primary visual cortex, and higher areas showing later responses. A clear exception to this pattern was robust, statistically reliable and spatially localized, very early responses on the bank of the posterior intra-parietal sulcus (IPS). The response in the IPS started nearly simultaneously with responses detected in peristriate visual areas, around 60 milliseconds post-stimulus onset. Our results support the notion of early visual processing in the posterior parietal lobe, not respecting traditional hierarchies, and give direct evidence for the upper limit of onset times of visual responses across the human cortex.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Auditory and Language Contributions to Neural Encoding of Speech Features in Noisy Environments</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/377838v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Recognizing speech in noisy environments is a challenging task that involves both auditory and language mechanisms. Previous studies have demonstrated noise-robust neural tracking of the speech envelope, i.e., fluctuations in sound intensity, in human auditory cortex, which provides a plausible neural basis for noise-robust speech recognition. The current study aims at teasing apart auditory and language contributions to noise-robust envelope tracking by comparing 2 groups of listeners, i.e., native listeners of the testing language and foreign listeners who do not understand the testing language. In the experiment, speech is mixed with spectrally matched stationary noise at 4 intensity levels and the neural responses are recorded using electroencephalography (EEG). When the noise intensity increases, an increase in neural response gain is observed for both groups of listeners, demonstrating auditory gain control mechanisms. Language comprehension creates no overall boost in the response gain or the envelope-tracking precision but instead modulates the spatial and temporal profiles of envelope-tracking activity. Based on the spatio-temporal dynamics of envelope-tracking activity, the 2 groups of listeners and the 4 levels of noise intensity can be jointly decoded by a linear classifier. All together, the results show that without feedback from language processing, auditory mechanisms such as gain control can lead to a noise-robust speech representation. High-level language processing, however, further modulates the spatial-temporal profiles of the neural representation of the speech envelope.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Increased {alpha}-2,8-sialyltransferase 8B (ST8SIA2) expression in schizophrenia superior temporal gyrus</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/377770v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Reduced polysialylation of neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) in schizophrenia has been suggested to contribute to abnormal neuroplasticity and neurodevelopmental features of this illness. The posttranslational addition of sialic acid is mediated by sialyltransferases, and polysialylation (the addition of [≥] 8 -2,8-linked sialic acid residues) is catalyzed by three enzymes: ST8SIA2 (also called STX), ST8SIA4 (also called PST), and/or ST8SIA3. ST8SIA2 and ST8SIA4 are the primary mediators of NCAM polysialylation. The gene encoding ST8SIA2 maps to schizophrenia risk locus 15q26, and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and SNP haplotypes of the ST8SIA2 gene have been associated with schizophrenia in multiple populations. The current study in elderly schizophrenia (N = 16) and comparison (N = 14) subjects measured the protein expression of NCAM, polysialylated-NCAM (PSA-NCAM), and three poly--2,8-sialyltransferases (ST8SIA2, ST8SIA3, and ST8SIA4) in postmortem superior temporal gyrus. Although expression of NCAM, PSA-NCAM, ST8SIA3, and ST8SIA4 were not different in schizophrenia, increased protein levels of ST8SIA2 were identified. It has been reported that ST8SIA2 mutations associated with increased schizophrenia risk impair PSA-NCAM synthesis, suggesting that increased protein expression of ST8SIA2 may represent a compensatory mechanism in the face of impaired enzyme function. This interpretation is further supported by our finding that the relationship between ST8SIA2 enzyme expression and PSA-NCAM levels are different between schizophrenia and comparison subjects. Together these findings suggest a possible neurodevelopmentally-regulated mechanism which could contribute to abnormal synaptic plasticity evident in schizophrenia.</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Intranasal wnt3a Attenuates Neuronal Apoptosis through Frz1/PIWIL1a/FOXM1 Pathway in MCAO Rats</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/30/6787?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;After ischemic stroke, apoptosis of neurons is a primary factor in determining outcome. Wnt3a is a naturally occurring protein that has been shown to have protective effects in the brain for traumatic brain injury. Although wnt3a has been investigated in the phenomena of neurogenesis, anti-apoptosis, and anti-inflammation, it has never been investigated as a therapy for stroke. We hypothesized that the potential neuroprotective agent wnt3a would reduce infarction and improve behavior following ischemic stroke by attenuating neuronal apoptosis and promoting cell survival through the Frizzled-1/PIWI1a/FOXM1 pathway in middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) rats. A total of 229 Sprague Dawley rats were assigned to male, female, and 9-month-old male MCAO or sham groups followed by reperfusion 2 h after MCAO. Animals assigned to MCAO were either given wnt3a or its control. To explore the downstream signaling of wnt3a, the following interventions were given: Frizzled-1 siRNA, PIWI1a siRNA, and PIWI1a-clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats, along with the appropriate controls. Post-MCAO assessments included neurobehavioral tests, infarct volume, Western blot, and immunohistochemistry. Endogenous levels of wnt3a and Frizzled-1/PIWI1a/FOXM1 were lowered after MCAO. The administration of intranasal wnt3a, 1 h after MCAO, increased PIWIL1a and FOXM1 expression through Frizzled-1, reducing brain infarction and neurological deficits at 24 and 72 h. Frizzled-1 and PIWI1a siRNAs reversed the protective effects of wnt3a after MCAO. Restoration of PIWI1a after knockdown of Frizzled-1 increased FOXM1 survival protein and reduced cleaved caspase-3 levels. In summary, wnt3a decreases neuronal apoptosis and improves neurological deficits through Frizzled-1/PIWI1a/FOXM1 pathway after MCAO in rats. Therefore, wnt3a is a novel intranasal approach to decrease apoptosis after stroke.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Only 5% of patients receive recombinant tissue plasminogen activator after stroke, and few qualify for mechanical thrombectomy. No neuroprotective agents have been successfully translated to promote neuronal survival in stroke. Thus, using a clinically relevant rat model of stroke, middle cerebral artery occlusion, we explored a novel intranasal administration of wnt3a. wnt3a naturally occurs in the body and crosses the blood–brain barrier, supporting the clinically translatable approach of intranasal administration. Significant neuronal apoptosis occurs during stroke, and wnt3a shows promise due to its antiapoptotic effects. We investigated whether wnt3a mediates its poststroke effects via Frizzled-1 and the impact on its downstream signaling molecules, PIWI1a and FOXM1, in apoptosis. Elucidating the mechanism of wnt3a will identify additional pharmacological targets and further understanding of stroke.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Orbitofrontal Signaling of Future Reward is Associated with Hyperactivity in Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/30/6779?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Alterations in motivated behavior are a hallmark of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), one of the most common psychiatric disorders in children and adolescents. The orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) plays a key role in controlling goal-directed behavior, but the link between OFC dysfunction and behavioral deficits in ADHD, particularly in adolescence, remains poorly understood. Here we used advanced high-resolution functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) of the human OFC in adolescents with ADHD and typically developing (TD) controls (&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt; = 39, age 12–16, all male except for one female per group) to study reward-related OFC responses and how they relate to behavioral dysfunction in ADHD. During fMRI data acquisition, participants performed a simple decision-making task, allowing us to image expectation-related responses to small and large monetary outcomes. Across all participants, we observed significant signal increases to large versus small expected rewards in the OFC. These responses were significantly enhanced in ADHD relative to TD participants. Moreover, stronger reward-related activity was correlated with individual differences in hyperactive/impulsive symptoms in the ADHD group, whereas high cognitive ability was associated with normalized OFC responses. These results provide evidence for the importance of OFC dysfunctions in the neuropathology of ADHD, highlighting the role of OFC-dependent goal-directed control mechanisms in this disorder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is characterized by alterations in motivated behavior which can be understood as diminished goal-directed control. The orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) plays a key role in controlling goal-directed behavior, but its potential contribution to ADHD symptomatology remains poorly understood. Using high-resolution fMRI, we show that adolescent ADHD patients display enhanced OFC signaling of future rewards and that these increased reward-related responses are correlated with the severity of hyperactivity/impulsivity. These findings suggest that an inability to adequately evaluate future outcomes may translate into maladaptive behavior in ADHD patients. They also challenge the idea that dysfunctions in dopaminergic brain areas are the sole contributor to reward-related symptoms in ADHD and point to a central contribution of goal-directed control circuits in hyperactivity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Differential Representation of Landmark and Self-Motion Information along the CA1 Radial Axis: Self-Motion Generated Place Fields Shift toward Landmarks during Septal Inactivation</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/30/6766?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Spatial location in the environment can be defined in relation to specific landmarks or in relation to the global context, and is estimated from both the sensing of landmarks and the inner sense of cumulated locomotion referred to as path-integration. The respective contribution of landmark and path-integration to place-cell activity in the hippocampus is still unclear and complicated by the fact that the two mechanisms usually overlap. To bias spatial mechanisms toward landmark or path-integration, we use a treadmill equipped with a long belt on which male mice run sequentially through a zone enriched and a zone impoverished in visual-tactile cues. We show that inactivation of the medial septum (MS), which is known to disrupt the periodic activity of grid cells, impairs mice ability to anticipate the delivery of a reward in the cue-impoverished zone and transiently alter the spatial configuration of place fields in the cue-impoverished zone selectively: following MS inactivation, place fields in the cue-impoverished zone progressively shift backward and stabilize near the cues, resulting in the contraction of the spatial representation around cues; following MS recovery, the initial spatial representation is progressively restored. Furthermore, we found that place fields in the cue-rich and cue-impoverished zones are preferentially generated by cells from the deep and superficial sublayers of CA1, respectively. These findings demonstrate with mechanistic insights the contribution of MS to the spread of spatial representations in cue-impoverished zones, and indicate a segregation of landmark-based and path-integration-assisted spatial mechanisms into deep and superficial CA1, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Cells encoding a cue-impoverished zone and the vicinity of landmarks responded differentially to septal inactivation and resided in distinct sublayers of CA1. These findings provide new insights on place field mechanisms: septal activity is critical for maintaining the spread of place fields in cue-impoverished areas, but not for the generation of place fields; Following MS inactivation, trial-by-trial network modifications by activity-dependent mechanisms are responsible for the gradual collapse of spatial representations. Furthermore, the findings suggest parallel coding streams for landmark and self-motion information. Superficial CA1 cells are better suited for encoding global position via the assist of path-integration, whereas deep CA1 cells can support spatial memory processes on an object-specific basis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Cerebellar Learning Properties Are Modulated by the CRF Receptor</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/30/6751?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) and its type 1 receptor (CRFR&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) play an important role in the responses to stressful challenges. Despite the well established expression of CRFR&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; in granular cells (GrCs), its role in procedural motor performance and memory formation remains elusive. To investigate the role of CRFR&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; expression in cerebellar GrCs, we used a mouse model depleted of CRFR&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; in these cells. We detected changes in the cellular learning mechanisms in GrCs depleted of CRFR&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; in that they showed changes in intrinsic excitability and long-term synaptic plasticity. Analysis of cerebella transcriptome obtained from KO and control mice detected prominent alterations in the expression of calcium signaling pathways components. Moreover, male mice depleted of CRFR&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; specifically in GrCs showed accelerated Pavlovian associative eye-blink conditioning, but no differences in baseline motor performance, locomotion, or fear and anxiety-related behaviors. Our findings shed light on the interplay between stress-related central mechanisms and cerebellar motor conditioning, highlighting the role of the CRF system in regulating particular forms of cerebellar learning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Although it is known that the corticotropin-releasing factor type 1 receptor (CRFR&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) is highly expressed in the cerebellum, little attention has been given to its role in cerebellar functions in the behaving animal. Moreover, most of the attention was directed at the effect of CRF on Purkinje cells at the cellular level and, to this date, almost no data exist on the role of this stress-related receptor in other cerebellar structures. Here, we explored the behavioral and cellular effect of granular cell-specific ablation of CRFR&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;. We found a profound effect on learning both at the cellular and behavioral levels without an effect on baseline motor skills.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Galectin-3 in M2 Macrophages Plays a Protective Role in Resolution of Neuropathology in Brain Parasitic Infection by Regulating Neutrophil Turnover</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/30/6737?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Macrophages/microglia with M2-activation phenotype are thought to play important anti-inflammatory and tissue reparative functions in the brain, yet the molecular bases of their functions in the CNS remain to be clearly defined. In a preclinical model of neurocysticercosis using brain infection with a parasite &lt;i&gt;Mesocestoides corti&lt;/i&gt;, we previously reported the presence of large numbers of M2 cells in the CNS. In this study using female mice, we report that M2 macrophages in the parasite-infected brain display abundant galectin-3 expression. Disease severity was increased in &lt;i&gt;Galectin-3&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt; mice correlating with increased neurological defects, augmented cell death and, importantly, massive accumulation of neutrophils and M2 macrophages in the CNS of these mice. Because neutrophil clearance by efferocytosis is an important function of M2 macrophages, we investigated a possible role of galectin-3 in this process. Indeed, galectin-3-deficient M2 macrophages exhibited a defect in efferocytic clearance of neutrophils &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;. Furthermore, adoptive transfer of M2 macrophages from galectin-3-sufficient WT mice reduced neutrophilia in the CNS and ameliorated disease severity in parasite-infected &lt;i&gt;Galectin-3&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt; mice. Together, these results demonstrate, for the first time, a novel role of galectin-3 in M2 macrophage function in neutrophil turnover and resolution of inflammatory pathology in the CNS. This likely will have implications in neurocysticercosis and neuroinflammatory diseases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Macrophages/microglia with M1-activation phenotype are thought to promote CNS pathology, whereas M2-anti-inflammatory phenotype promote CNS repair. However, the mechanisms regulating M2 cell-protective functions in the CNS microenvironment are undefined. The current study reports that helminth infection of the brain induces an increased expression of galectin-3 in M2 macrophages accumulated in the CNS. Using multiple experimental models &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;, they show that galectin-3 in M2 macrophages functions to clear neutrophils accumulated in the CNS. Importantly, galectin-3 in M2 macrophages plays a central role in the containment of neuropathology and disease severity. These results provide a direct mechanistic evidence of the protective function of M2 macrophages in the CNS.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Endogenous Protection from Ischemic Brain Injury by Preconditioned Monocytes</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/30/6722?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Exposure to low-dose lipopolysaccharide (LPS) before cerebral ischemia is neuroprotective in stroke models, a phenomenon termed preconditioning (PC). Although it is well established that LPS-PC induces central and peripheral immune responses, the cellular mechanisms modulating ischemic injury remain unclear. Here, we investigated the role of immune cells in the brain protection afforded by PC and tested whether monocytes may be reprogrammed by &lt;i&gt;ex vivo&lt;/i&gt; LPS exposure, thus modulating inflammatory injury after cerebral ischemia in male mice. We found that systemic injection of low-dose LPS induces a Ly6C&lt;sup&gt;hi&lt;/sup&gt; monocyte response that protects the brain after transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) in mice. Remarkably, adoptive transfer of monocytes isolated from preconditioned mice into naive mice 7 h after transient MCAO reduced brain injury. Gene expression and functional studies showed that IL-10, inducible nitric oxide synthase, and CCR2 in monocytes are essential for neuroprotection. This protective activity was elicited even if mouse or human monocytes were exposed &lt;i&gt;ex vivo&lt;/i&gt; to LPS and then injected into male mice after stroke. Cell-tracking studies showed that protective monocytes are mobilized from the spleen and reach the brain and meninges, where they suppress postischemic inflammation and neutrophil influx into the brain parenchyma. Our findings unveil a previously unrecognized subpopulation of splenic monocytes capable of protecting the brain with an extended therapeutic window and provide the rationale for cell therapies based on the delivery of autologous or allogeneic protective monocytes in patients after ischemic stroke.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Inflammation is a key component of the pathophysiology of the brain in stroke, a leading cause of death and disability with limited therapeutic options. Here, we investigate endogenous mechanisms of protection against cerebral ischemia. Using lipopolysaccharide (LPS) preconditioning (PC) as an approach to induce ischemic tolerance in mice, we found generation of neuroprotective monocytes within the spleen, from which they traffic to the brain and meninges, suppressing postischemic inflammation. Importantly, systemic LPS-PC can be mimicked by adoptive transfer of &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;-preconditioned mouse or human monocytes at translational relevant time points after stroke. This model of neuroprotection may facilitate clinical efforts to increase the efficacy of BM mononuclear cell treatments in acute neurological diseases such as cerebral ischemia.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: PTP{sigma} Drives Excitatory Presynaptic Assembly via Various Extracellular and Intracellular Mechanisms</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/30/6700?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Leukocyte common antigen-receptor protein tyrosine phosphatases (LAR-RPTPs) are hub proteins that organize excitatory and inhibitory synapse development through binding to various extracellular ligands. Here, we report that knockdown (KD) of the LAR-RPTP family member PTP reduced excitatory synapse number and transmission in cultured rat hippocampal neurons, whereas KD of PTP produced comparable decreases at inhibitory synapses, in both cases without altering expression levels of interacting proteins. An extensive series of rescue experiments revealed that extracellular interactions of PTP with Slitrks are important for excitatory synapse development. These experiments further showed that the intracellular D2 domain of PTP is required for induction of heterologous synapse formation by Slitrk1 or TrkC, suggesting that interaction of LAR-RPTPs with distinct intracellular presynaptic proteins, drives presynaptic machinery assembly. Consistent with this, double-KD of liprin-α2 and -α3 or KD of PTP substrates (N-cadherin and p250RhoGAP) in neurons inhibited Slitrk6-induced, PTP-mediated heterologous synapse formation activity. We propose a synaptogenesis model in presynaptic neurons involving LAR-RPTP-organized retrograde signaling cascades, in which both extracellular and intracellular mechanisms are critical in orchestrating distinct synapse types.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; In this study, we sought to test the unproven hypothesis that PTP and PTP are required for excitatory and inhibitory synapse formation/transmission, respectively, in cultured hippocampal neurons, using knockdown-based loss-of-function analyses. We further performed extensive structure–function analyses, focusing on PTP-mediated actions, to address the mechanisms of presynaptic assembly at excitatory synaptic sites. Using interdisciplinary approaches, we systematically applied a varied set of PTP deletion variants, point mutants, and splice variants to demonstrate that both extracellular and intracellular mechanisms are involved in organizing presynaptic assembly. Strikingly, extracellular interactions of PTP with heparan sulfates and Slitrks, intracellular interactions of PTP with liprin-α and its associated proteins through the D2 domain, as well as distinct substrates are all critical.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Aspirin Induces Lysosomal Biogenesis and Attenuates Amyloid Plaque Pathology in a Mouse Model of Alzheimer's Disease via PPAR{alpha}</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/30/6682?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Lysosomes play a central role in cellular homeostasis by regulating the cellular degradative machinery. Because aberrant lysosomal function has been associated with multiple lysosomal storage and neurodegenerative disorders, enhancement of lysosomal clearance has emerged as an attractive therapeutic strategy. Transcription factor EB (TFEB) is known as a master regulator of lysosomal biogenesis and, here, we reveal that aspirin, one of the most widely used medications in the world, upregulates TFEB and increases lysosomal biogenesis in brain cells. Interestingly, aspirin induced the activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARα) and stimulated the transcription of &lt;i&gt;Tfeb&lt;/i&gt; via PPARα. Finally, oral administration of low-dose aspirin decreased amyloid plaque pathology in both male and female 5X familial Alzheimer's disease (5XFAD) mice in a PPARα-dependent fashion. This study reveals a new function of aspirin in stimulating lysosomal biogenesis via PPARα and suggests that low-dose aspirin may be used in lowering storage materials in Alzheimer's disease and lysosomal storage disorders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Developing drugs for the reduction of amyloid β containing senile plaques, one of the pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD), is an important area of research. Aspirin, one of the most widely used medications in the world, activates peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARα) to upregulate transcription factor EB and increase lysosomal biogenesis in brain cells. Accordingly, low-dose aspirin decreases cerebral plaque load in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease via PPARα. These results reveal a new mode of action of aspirin that may be beneficial for AD and lysosomal storage disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Human ApoE Isoforms Differentially Modulate Brain Glucose and Ketone Body Metabolism: Implications for Alzheimer's Disease Risk Reduction and Early Intervention</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/30/6665?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Humans possess three genetic isoforms of apolipoprotein E (ApoE)—ApoE2, ApoE3, and ApoE4—that confer differential risk for Alzheimer's disease (AD); however, the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. This study sought to investigate the impact of human ApoE isoforms on brain energy metabolism, an area significantly perturbed in preclinical AD. A TaqMan custom array was performed to examine the expression of a total of 43 genes involved in glucose and ketone body transport and metabolism, focusing on pathways leading to the generation of acetyl-CoA, in human ApoE gene-targeted replacement female mice. Consistent with our previous findings, brains expressing ApoE2 exhibited the most robust profile, whereas brains expressing ApoE4 displayed the most deficient profile on the uptake and metabolism of glucose, the primary fuel for the brain. Specifically, the three ApoE brains differed significantly in facilitated glucose transporters, which mediate the entry of glucose into neurons, and hexokinases, which act as the &quot;gateway enzyme&quot; in glucose metabolism. Interestingly, on the uptake and metabolism of ketone bodies, the secondary energy source for the brain, ApoE2 and ApoE4 brains showed a similar level of robustness, whereas ApoE3 brains presented a relatively deficient profile. Further, ingenuity pathway analysis indicated that the PPAR-/PGC-1α signaling pathway could be activated in the ApoE2 brain and inhibited in the ApoE4 brain. Notably, PGC-1α overexpression ameliorated ApoE4-induced deficits in glycolysis and mitochondrial respiration. Overall, our data provide additional evidence that human ApoE isoforms differentially modulate brain bioenergetic metabolism, which could serve as a potential mechanism contributing to their discrete risk impact in AD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; We uncovered hexokinase as a key cytosolic point in the glucose metabolism that is differentially modulated by the three ApoE genotypes. The differences in hexokinase expression and activity exhibited in the three ApoE brains may underlie their distinct impact on brain glucose utilization and further susceptibility to AD. Therefore, a therapeutic approach that could circumvent the deficiencies in the cytosolic metabolism of glucose by providing glucose metabolizing intermediates, e.g., pyruvate, may hold benefits for ApoE4 carriers, who are at high risk for AD. The bioenergetic robustness may translate into enhanced synaptic activity and, ultimately, reduces the risk of developing AD and/or delays the onset of clinical manifestation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Behavioral Evidence and Neural Correlates of Perceptual Grouping by Motion in the Barn Owl</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/30/6653?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Perceiving an object as salient from its surround often requires a preceding process of grouping the object and background elements as perceptual wholes. In humans, motion homogeneity provides a strong cue for grouping, yet it is unknown to what extent this occurs in nonprimate species. To explore this question, we studied the effects of visual motion homogeneity in barn owls of both genders, at the behavioral as well as the neural level. Our data show that the coherency of the background motion modulates the perceived saliency of the target object. An object moving in an odd direction relative to other objects attracted more attention when the other objects moved homogeneously compared with when moved in a variety of directions. A possible neural correlate of this effect may arise in the population activity of the intermediate/deep layers of the optic tectum. In these layers, the neural responses to a moving element in the receptive field were suppressed when additional elements moved in the surround. However, when the surrounding elements all moved in one direction (homogeneously moving), they induced less suppression of the response compared with nonhomogeneously moving elements. Moreover, neural responses were more sensitive to the homogeneity of the background motion than to motion-direction contrasts between the receptive field and the surround. The findings suggest similar principles of saliency-by-motion in an avian species as in humans and show a locus in the optic tectum where the underlying neural circuitry may exist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; A critical task of the visual system is to arrange incoming visual information to a meaningful scene of objects and background. In humans, elements that move homogeneously are grouped perceptually to form a categorical whole object. We discovered a similar principle in the barn owl's visual system, whereby the homogeneity of the motion of elements in the scene allows perceptually distinguishing an object from its surround. The novel findings of these visual effects in an avian species, which lacks neocortical structure, suggest that our basic visual perception shares more universal principles across species than presently thought, and shed light on possible brain mechanisms for perceptual grouping.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Pharmacological Inhibition of ERK Signaling Rescues Pathophysiology and Behavioral Phenotype Associated with 16p11.2 Chromosomal Deletion in Mice</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/30/6640?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The human &lt;i&gt;16p11.2&lt;/i&gt; microdeletion is one of the most common gene copy number variations linked to autism, but the pathophysiology associated with this chromosomal abnormality is largely unknown. The 593 kb deletion contains the ERK1 gene and other genes that converge onto the ERK/MAP kinase pathway. Perturbations in ERK signaling are linked to a group of related neurodevelopmental disorders hallmarked by intellectual disability, including autism. We report that mice harboring the &lt;i&gt;16p11.2&lt;/i&gt; deletion exhibit a paradoxical elevation of ERK activity, cortical cytoarchitecture abnormalities and behavioral deficits. Importantly, we show that treatment with a novel ERK pathway inhibitor during a critical period of brain development rescues the molecular, anatomical and behavioral deficits in the &lt;i&gt;16p11.2&lt;/i&gt; deletion mice. The ERK inhibitor treatment administered to adult mice ameliorates a subset of these behavioral deficits. Our findings provide evidence for potential targeted therapeutic intervention in &lt;i&gt;16p11.2&lt;/i&gt; deletion carriers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The ERK/MAPK pathway is genetically linked to autism spectrum disorders and other syndromes typified by intellectual disability. We provide direct evidence connecting the ERK/MAP kinases to the developmental abnormalities in neurogenesis and cortical cytoarchitecture associated with the &lt;i&gt;16p11.2&lt;/i&gt; chromosomal deletion. Most importantly, we demonstrate that treatment with a novel ERK-specific inhibitor during development rescues aberrant cortical cytoarchitecture and restores normal levels of cell-cycle regulators during cortical neurogenesis. These treatments partially reverse the behavioral deficits observed in the &lt;i&gt;16p11.2del&lt;/i&gt; mouse model, including hyperactivity, memory as well as olfaction, and maternal behavior. We also report a rescue of a subset of these deficits upon treatment of adult &lt;i&gt;16p11.2del&lt;/i&gt; mice. These data provide a strong rationale for therapeutic approaches to this disorder.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Prostaglandin Signaling Governs Spike Timing-Dependent Plasticity at Sensory Synapses onto Mouse Spinal Projection Neurons</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/30/6628?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Highly correlated presynaptic and postsynaptic activity evokes spike timing-dependent long-term potentiation (t-LTP) at primary afferent synapses onto spinal projection neurons. While prior evidence indicates that t-LTP depends upon an elevation in intracellular Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; within projection neurons, the downstream signaling pathways that trigger the observed increase in glutamate release from sensory neurons remain poorly understood. Using &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; patch-clamp recordings from female mouse lamina I spino-parabrachial neurons, the present study demonstrates a critical role for prostaglandin synthesis in the generation of t-LTP. Bath application of the selective phospholipase A&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (PLA&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) inhibitor arachidonyl trifluoromethyl ketone (AACOCF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) or the cyclooxygenase 2 (Cox-2) inhibitor nimesulide prevented t-LTP at sensory synapses onto spino-parabrachial neurons. Similar results were observed following the block of the EP2 subtype of prostaglandin E&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (PGE&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) receptor with PF 04418948. Meanwhile, perfusion with PGE&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; or the EP2 agonist butaprost potentiated the amplitude of monosynaptic primary afferent-evoked EPSCs while decreasing the paired-pulse ratio, suggesting a presynaptic site of action. Cox-2 was constitutively expressed in both spinal microglia and lamina I projection neurons within the superficial dorsal horn (SDH). Suppression of microglial activation with minocycline had no effect on the production of t-LTP, suggesting the possibility that prostaglandins produced within projection neurons could contribute to an enhanced probability of glutamate release at primary afferent synapses. Collectively, the results suggest that the amplification of ascending nociceptive transmission by the spinal SDH network is governed by PLA&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;–Cox-2–PGE&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; signaling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Long-term potentiation (LTP) of primary afferent synapses contributes to the sensitization of spinal nociceptive circuits and has been linked to greater pain sensation in humans. Prior work has implicated elevated glutamate release in the generation of spike timing-dependent LTP (t-LTP) at sensory synapses onto ascending spinal projection neurons, but the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. Here we provide evidence that the activation of EP2 prostaglandin receptors by prostaglandin E&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, occurring downstream of phospholipase A&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and cyclooxygenase 2 activation, mediates t-LTP at these synapses via changes in presynaptic function. This suggests that prostaglandins can increase the flow of nociceptive information from the spinal cord to the brain independently of their known ability to suppress synaptic inhibition within the dorsal horn.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Suppression of Hyperpolarization-Activated Cyclic Nucleotide-Gated Channel Function in Thalamocortical Neurons Prevents Genetically Determined and Pharmacologically Induced Absence Seizures</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/30/6615?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) channels and the &lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt; current they generate contribute to the pathophysiological mechanisms of absence seizures (ASs), but their precise role in neocortical and thalamic neuronal populations, the main components of the network underlying AS generation, remains controversial. In diverse genetic AS models, &lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt; amplitude is smaller in neocortical neurons and either larger or unchanged in thalamocortical (TC) neurons compared with nonepileptic strains. A lower expression of neocortical HCN subtype 1 channels is present in genetic AS-prone rats, and HCN subtype 2 knock-out mice exhibit ASs. Furthermore, whereas many studies have characterized &lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt; contribution to &quot;absence-like&quot; paroxysmal activity &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;, no data are available on the specific role of cortical and thalamic HCN channels in behavioral seizures. Here, we show that the pharmacological block of HCN channels with the antagonist ZD7288 applied via reverse microdialysis in the ventrobasal thalamus (VB) of freely moving male Genetic Absence Epilepsy Rats from Strasbourg decreases TC neuron firing and abolishes spontaneous ASs. A similar effect is observed on -hydroxybutyric acid-elicited ASs in normal male Wistar rats. Moreover, thalamic knockdown of HCN channels via virally delivered shRNA into the VB of male Stargazer mice, another genetic AS model, decreases spontaneous ASs and &lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;-dependent electrophysiological properties of VB TC neurons. These findings provide the first evidence that block of TC neuron HCN channels prevents ASs and suggest that any potential anti-absence therapy that targets HCN channels should carefully consider the opposite role for cortical and thalamic &lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt; in the modulation of absence seizures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) channels play critical roles in the fine-tuning of cellular and network excitability and have been suggested to be a key element of the pathophysiological mechanism underlying absence seizures. However, the precise contribution of HCN channels in neocortical and thalamic neuronal populations to these nonconvulsive seizures is still controversial. In the present study, pharmacological block and genetic suppression of HCN channels in thalamocortical neurons in the ventrobasal thalamic nucleus leads to a marked reduction in absence seizures in one pharmacological and two genetic rodent models of absence seizures. These results provide the first evidence that block of TC neuron HCN channels prevents absence seizures.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Functional Connectivity of Chronic Cocaine Use Reveals Progressive Neuroadaptations in Neocortical, Striatal, and Limbic Networks</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/5/4/ENEURO.0081-18.2018?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Brain imaging studies indicate that chronic cocaine users display altered functional connectivity between prefrontal cortical, thalamic, striatal, and limbic regions; however, the use of cross-sectional designs in these studies precludes measuring baseline brain activity prior to cocaine use. Animal studies can circumvent this limitation by comparing functional connectivity between baseline and various time points after chronic cocaine use. In the present study, adult male Long–Evans rats were trained to self-administer cocaine intravenously for 6 h sessions daily over 14 consecutive days. Two additional groups serving as controls underwent sucrose self-administration or exposure to the test chambers alone. Functional magnetic resonance imaging was conducted before self-administration and after 1 and 14 d of abstinence (1d and 14d Abs). After 1d Abs from cocaine, there were increased clustering coefficients in brain areas involved in reward seeking, learning, memory, and autonomic and affective processing, including amygdala, hypothalamus, striatum, hippocampus, and thalamus. Similar changes in clustering coefficient after 1d Abs from sucrose were evident in predominantly thalamic brain regions. Notably, there were no changes in strength of functional connectivity at 1 or 14 d after either cocaine or sucrose self-administration. The results suggest that cocaine and sucrose can change the arrangement of functional connectivity of brain regions involved in cognition and emotion, but that these changes dissipate across the early stages of abstinence. The study also emphasizes the importance of including baseline measures in longitudinal functional neuroimaging designs seeking to assess functional connectivity in the context of substance use.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1807.09194</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The emergence of syntax during childhood is a remarkable example of how
complex correlations unfold in nonlinear ways through development. In
particular, rapid transitions seem to occur as children reach the age of two,
which seems to separate a two-word, tree-like network of syntactic relations
among words from a scale-free graphs associated to the adult, complex grammar.
Here we explore the evolution of syntax networks through language acquisition
using the {\em chromatic number}, which captures the transition and provides a
natural link to standard theories on syntactic structures. The data analysis is
compared to a null model of network growth dynamics which is shown to display
nontrivial and sensible differences. In a more general level, we observe that
the chromatic classes define independent regions of the graph, and thus, can be
interpreted as the footprints of incompatibility relations, somewhat as opposed
to modularity considerations.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Sampling-based probabilistic inference emerges from learning in neural circuits with a cost on reliability. (arXiv:1807.08952v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1807.08952</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Neural responses in the cortex change over time both systematically, due to
ongoing plasticity and learning, and seemingly randomly, due to various sources
of noise and variability. Most previous work considered each of these
processes, learning and variability, in isolation -- here we study neural
networks exhibiting both and show that their interaction leads to the emergence
of powerful computational properties. We trained neural networks on classical
unsupervised learning tasks, in which the objective was to represent their
inputs in an efficient, easily decodable form, with an additional cost for
neural reliability which we derived from basic biophysical considerations. This
cost on reliability introduced a tradeoff between energetically cheap but
inaccurate representations and energetically costly but accurate ones. Despite
the learning tasks being non-probabilistic, the networks solved this tradeoff
by developing a probabilistic representation: neural variability represented
samples from statistically appropriate posterior distributions that would
result from performing probabilistic inference over their inputs. We provide an
analytical understanding of this result by revealing a connection between the
cost of reliability, and the objective for a state-of-the-art Bayesian
inference strategy: variational autoencoders. We show that the same cost leads
to the emergence of increasingly accurate probabilistic representations as
networks become more complex, from single-layer feed-forward, through
multi-layer feed-forward, to recurrent architectures. Our results provide
insights into why neural responses in sensory areas show signatures of
sampling-based probabilistic representations, and may inform future deep
learning algorithms and their implementation in stochastic low-precision
computing systems.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1807.08900</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In this study, we analyzed the activity of monkey V1 neurons responding to
grating stimuli of different orientations using inference methods for a
time-dependent Ising model. The method provides optimal estimation of
time-dependent neural interactions with credible intervals according to the
sequential Bayes estimation algorithm. Furthermore, it allows us to trace
dynamics of macroscopic network properties such as entropy, sparseness, and
fluctuation. Here we report that, in all examined stimulus conditions, pairwise
interactions contribute to increasing sparseness and fluctuation. We then
demonstrate that the orientation of the grating stimulus is in part encoded in
the pairwise interactions of the neural populations. These results demonstrate
the utility of the state-space Ising model in assessing contributions of neural
interactions during stimulus processing.

	<content:encoded>Fast inhibitory neurotransmission in mammalian nervous system is largely mediated by GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptors, chloride-selective members of the superfamily of pentameric Cys-loop receptors. Native GABAA receptors are heteromeric assemblies sensitive to many important drugs, from sedatives to anesthetics and anticonvulsant agents, with mutant forms of GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptors implicated in multiple neurological diseases. Despite profound importance of heteromeric GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptors in neuroscience and medicine, they have proven recalcitrant to structure determination. Here we present the structure of tri-heteromeric α1β1γ2S&lt;sub&gt;EM&lt;/sub&gt; GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptor in complex with GABA, determined by single particle cryo-EM at 3.1-3.8 Å resolution, elucidating molecular principles of receptor assembly and agonist binding. Remarkable N-linked glycosylation on the α1 subunit occludes the extracellular vestibule of the ion channel and is poised to modulate receptor assembly and perhaps ion channel gating. Our work provides a pathway to structural studies of heteromeric GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptors and a framework for rational design of novel therapeutic agents.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/38981</link>
	<content:encoded>ComplexinII (CpxII) inhibits non-synchronized vesicle fusion, but the underlying mechanisms have remained unclear. Here, we provide evidence that the far C-terminal domain (CTD) of CpxII interferes with SNARE assembly, thereby arresting tonic exocytosis. Acute infusion of a CTD-derived peptide into mouse chromaffin cells enhances synchronous release by diminishing premature vesicle fusion like full-length CpxII, indicating a direct, inhibitory function of the CTD that sets the magnitude of the primed vesicle pool. We describe a high degree of structural similarity between the CpxII CTD and the SNAP25-SN1 domain (C-terminal half) and show that the CTD peptide lowers the rate of SDS-resistant SNARE complex formation &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;. Moreover, corresponding CpxII:SNAP25 chimeras do restore complexin's function and even 'superclamp' tonic secretion. Collectively, these results support a so far unrecognized clamping mechanism wherein the CpxII C-terminus hinders spontaneous SNARE complex assembly, enabling the build-up of a release-ready pool of vesicles for synchronized Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-triggered exocytosis.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/38089</link>
	<content:encoded>Cytokines and interferons initiate intracellular signaling via receptor dimerization and activation of Janus kinases (JAKs). How JAKs structurally respond to changes in receptor conformation induced by ligand binding is not known.  Here we present two crystal structures of the human JAK2 FERM and SH2 domains bound to Leptin receptor (LEPR) and Erythropoietin receptor (EPOR), which identify a novel dimeric conformation for JAK2. This 2:2 JAK2/receptor dimer, observed in both structures, identifies a previously uncharacterized receptor interaction essential to dimer formation that is mediated by a membrane-proximal peptide motif called the 'switch' region. Mutation of the receptor switch region disrupts STAT phosphorylation but does not affect JAK2 binding, indicating that receptor-mediated formation of the JAK2 FERM dimer is required for kinase activation. These data uncover the structural and molecular basis for how a cytokine-bound active receptor dimer brings together two JAK2 molecules to stimulate JAK2 kinase activity.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/38014</link>
	<content:encoded>Translation and mRNA degradation are intimately connected, yet the mechanisms that link them are not fully understood. Here we studied these mechanisms in embryonic stem cells (ESCs). Transcripts showed a wide range of stabilities, which correlated with their relative translation levels and that did not change during early ESC differentiation. The protein DHH1 links translation to mRNA stability in yeast; however, loss of the mammalian homolog, DDX6, in ESCs did not disrupt the correlation across transcripts. Instead, the loss of DDX6 led to upregulated translation of microRNA targets, without concurrent changes in mRNA stability. The &lt;i&gt;Ddx6 &lt;/i&gt;knockout cells were phenotypically and molecularly similar to cells lacking all microRNAs (&lt;i&gt;Dgcr8 &lt;/i&gt;knockout ESCs). These data show that the loss of DDX6 can separate the two canonical functions of microRNAs: translational repression and transcript destabilization. Furthermore, these data uncover a central role for translational repression independent of transcript destabilization in defining the downstream consequences of microRNA loss.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/37357</link>
	<content:encoded>The orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) is critical for updating reward-directed behaviours flexibly when outcomes are devalued or when task contingencies are reversed. Failure to update behaviour in outcome devaluation and reversal learning procedures are considered canonical deficits following OFC lesions in non-human primates and rodents. We examined the generality of these findings in rodents using lesions of the rodent lateral OFC (LO) in instrumental action-outcome and Pavlovian cue-outcome devaluation procedures. LO lesions disrupted outcome devaluation in Pavlovian but not instrumental procedures. Furthermore, although both anterior and posterior LO lesions disrupted Pavlovian outcome devaluation, only posterior LO lesions were found to disrupt reversal learning. Posterior but not anterior LO lesions were also found to disrupt the attribution of motivational value to Pavlovian cues in sign-tracking. These novel dissociable task- and subregion-specific effects suggest a way to reconcile contradictory findings between rodent and non-human primate OFC research.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/36392</link>
	<content:encoded>Proper kinetochore-microtubule attachments, mediated by the NDC80 complex, are required for error-free chromosome segregation. Erroneous attachments are corrected by the tension dependence of kinetochore-microtubule interactions. Here, we present a method, based on fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy and Förster resonance energy transfer, to quantitatively measure the fraction of NDC80 complexes bound to microtubules at individual kinetochores in living human cells. We found that NDC80 binding is modulated in a chromosome autonomous fashion over prometaphase and metaphase, and is predominantly regulated by centromere tension. We show that this tension dependency requires phosphorylation of the N-terminal tail of Hec1, a component of the NDC80 complex, and the proper localization of Aurora B kinase, which modulates NDC80 binding. Our results lead to a mathematical model of the molecular basis of tension-dependent NDC80 binding to kinetochore microtubules in vivo.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/36340</link>
	<content:encoded>Rapid generation of drug-resistant mutations in HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT), a prime target for anti-HIV therapy, poses a major impediment to effective anti-HIV treatment. Our previous efforts have led to the development of two novel non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) with piperidine-substituted thiophene[3,2-&lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt;]pyrimidine scaffolds, compounds K-5a2 and 25a, which demonstrate highly potent anti-HIV-1 activities and improved resistance profiles compared with etravirine and rilpivirine, respectively. Here, we have determined the crystal structures of HIV-1 wild-type (WT) RT and seven RT variants bearing prevalent drug-resistant mutations in complex with K-5a2 or 25a at ~2 Å resolution. These high-resolution structures illustrate the molecular details of the extensive hydrophobic interactions and the network of main chain hydrogen bonds formed between the NNRTIs and the RT inhibitor binding pocket, and provide valuable insights into the favorable structural features that can be employed for designing NNRTIs that are broadly active against drug-resistant HIV-1 variants.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/36021</link>
	<content:encoded>Regulating nuclear histone balance is essential for survival, yet in early &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;melanogaster&lt;/i&gt; embryos many regulatory strategies employed in somatic cells are unavailable. Previous work had suggested that lipid droplets (LDs) buffer nuclear accumulation of the histone variant H2Av. Here we elucidate the buffering mechanism and demonstrate that it is developmentally controlled. Using live imaging, we find that H2Av continuously exchanges between LDs. Our data suggest that the major driving force for H2Av accumulation in nuclei is H2Av abundance in the cytoplasm and that LD binding slows nuclear import kinetically, by limiting this cytoplasmic pool. Nuclear H2Av accumulation is indeed inversely regulated by overall buffering capacity. Histone exchange between LDs abruptly ceases during the midblastula transition, presumably to allow canonical regulatory mechanisms to take over. These findings provide a mechanistic basis for the emerging role of LDs as regulators of protein homeostasis and demonstrate that LDs can control developmental progression.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/35832</link>
	<content:encoded>Fundamental gaps remain in our understanding of how immunity to malaria develops. We used detailed clinical and entomological data from parallel cohort studies conducted across the malaria transmission spectrum in Uganda to quantify the development of immunity against symptomatic &lt;i&gt;P. falciparum&lt;/i&gt; as a function of age and transmission intensity. We focus on: anti-parasite immunity (i.e; ability to control parasite densities) and anti-disease immunity (i.e; ability to tolerate higher parasite densities without fever). Our findings suggest a strong effect of age on both types of immunity, not explained by cumulative-exposure. They also show an independent effect of exposure, where children living in moderate/high transmission settings develop immunity faster as transmission increases. Surprisingly, children in the lowest transmission setting appear to develop immunity more efficiently than those living in moderate transmission settings. Anti-parasite and anti-disease immunity develop in parallel, reducing the probability of experiencing symptomatic malaria upon each subsequent &lt;i&gt;P. falciparum&lt;/i&gt; infection.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/35684</link>
	<content:encoded>XY systems usually show chromosome-wide compensation of X-linked genes, while in many ZW systems, compensation is restricted to a minority of dosage sensitive genes. Why such differences arose is still unclear. Here, we combine comparative genomics, transcriptomics and proteomics to obtain a complete overview of the evolution of gene dosage on the Z-chromosome of &lt;i&gt;Schistosoma&lt;/i&gt; parasites. We compare the Z-chromosome gene content of African (&lt;i&gt;Schistosoma mansoni&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;S. haematobium&lt;/i&gt;) and Asian (&lt;i&gt;S. japonicum&lt;/i&gt;) schistosomes, and describe lineage-specific evolutionary strata. We use these to assess gene expression evolution following sex-linkage. The resulting patterns suggest a reduction in expression of Z-linked genes in females, combined with up-regulation of the Z in both sexes, in line with the first step of Ohno's classic model of dosage compensation evolution. Quantitative proteomics suggest that post-transcriptional mechanisms do not play a major role in balancing the expression of Z-linked genes.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Narcolepsy type 1 patients have abnormal brain activation to neutral-rated movies in humor-paradigm</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/377499v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Narcolepsy type 1 is a neurological sleep disorder mainly characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness, fragmented night sleep, and cataplexy (muscle atonia triggered by emotions). To characterize brain activation patterns in response to neutral-rated and fun-rated movies in narcolepsy type 1 we performed functional magnetic resonance imaging during a paradigm consisting of 30 short movies (25/30 with a humorous punchline; 5/30 without a humorous punchline (but with similar build-up/anticipation)) that the participants rated based on their humor experience. We included 41 narcolepsy type 1 patients (31 females, mean age 23.6 years, 38/41 H1N1-vaccinated, 41/41 HLA-DQB1*06:02-positive, 40/40 hypocretin-deficient) and 44 first-degree relatives (24 females, mean age 19.6 years, 30/44 H1N1-vaccinated, 27/44 HLA-DQB1*06:02-positive) as controls. Group-level inferences were made using permutation testing. Permutation testing revealed no significant differences in the average ratings of patients and controls. Functional magnetic resonance imaging analysis revealed that both groups showed higher activations in response to fun-rated movies in several brain regions associated with humor processing, with no significant group differences. In contrast, patients showed significantly higher activation compared to controls during neutral-rated movies; including bilaterally in the thalamus, pallidum, putamen, amygdala, hippocampus, middle temporal gyrus, cerebellum, brainstem and in the left precuneus, supramarginal gyrus and caudate. The presence of a humorous punchline in a neutral-rated movie is important since we found no brain overactivation for narcolepsy type 1 patients for movies without a humorous punchline (89.0% neutral-rated) compared with controls. Further, a comparison between fun-rated and neutral-rated movies revealed a pattern of higher activation during fun-rated movies in controls, patients showed no significant differentiation between these states. Group analyses revealed significantly stronger differentiation between fun-rated and neutral-rated movies in controls compared with patients, including bilaterally in the inferior frontal gyrus, thalamus, putamen, precentral gyrus, lingual gyrus, supramarginal gyrus, occipital areas, temporal areas, cerebellum and in the right hippocampus, postcentral gyrus, pallidum and insula. In conclusion, during neutral-rated movies, narcolepsy type 1 patients showed significantly higher activation in several cortical and subcortical regions previously implicated in humor and REM sleep, including the thalamus and basal ganglia. The relative lack of differentiation between neutral-rated and fun-rated movies in narcolepsy type 1 patients might represent insight into the mechanisms associated with cataplexy, in which a long-lasting hypervigilant state could represent risk (hypersensitivity to potential humorous stimuli) for the narcolepsy type 1 patients, which seem to have a lower threshold for activating the humor response, even during neutral-rated movies.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Neural Circuit Mechanism of Decision Uncertainty and Change-of-Mind</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/377432v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Decision-making is often accompanied by a degree of confidence on whether a choice is correct. Decision uncertainty, or lack in confidence, may lead to change-of-mind. Studies have identified the behavioural characteristics associated with decision confidence or change-of-mind, and their neural correlates. Although several theoretical accounts have been proposed, there is no neural model that can compute decision uncertainty and explain its effects on change-of-mind. We propose a neuronal circuit model that computes decision uncertainty while accounting for a variety of behavioural and neural data of decision confidence and change-of-mind, including testable model predictions. Our theoretical analysis suggests that change-of-mind occurs due to the presence of a transient uncertainty- induced choice-neutral stable steady state and noisy fluctuation within the neuronal network. Our distributed network model indicates that the neural basis of change-of-mind is more distinctively identified in motor-based neurons. Overall, our model provides a framework that unifies decision confidence and change-of-mind.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/377408v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Autobiographical memory, future thinking and spatial navigation are critical cognitive functions that are thought to be related, and are known to depend upon a brain structure called the hippocampus. Surprisingly, direct evidence for their interrelatedness is lacking, as is an understanding of why they might be related. There is debate about whether they are linked by an underlying memory-related process or, as has more recently been suggested, because they each require the endogenous construction of scene imagery. Here, using a large sample of participants and multiple cognitive tests with a wide spread of individual differences in performance, we found that these functions are indeed related. Mediation analyses further showed that scene construction, and not memory, mediated (explained) the relationships between the functions. These findings offer a fresh perspective on autobiographical memory, future thinking, navigation, and also on the hippocampus, where scene imagery appears to play a highly influential role.</content:encoded>

Microorganisms modify their environment by excreting by-products of metabolism, which can create new ecological niches that can help microbial populations diversify. A striking example comes from experimental evolution of genetically identical &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; populations that are grown in a homogeneous environment with the single carbon source glucose. In such experiments, stable communities of genetically diverse cross-feeding &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; cells readily emerge. Some cells that consume the primary carbon source glucose excrete a secondary carbon source, such as acetate, that sustains other community members. Few such cross-feeding polymorphisms are known experimentally, because they are difficult to screen for. We studied the potential of bacterial metabolism to create new ecological niches based on cross-feeding. To do so, we used genome scale models of the metabolism of &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; and metabolisms of similar complexity, to identify unique pairs of primary and secondary carbon sources in these metabolisms. We then combined dynamic flux balance analysis with analytical calculations to identify which pair of carbon sources can sustain a polymorphic cross-feeding community. We identified almost 10,000 such pairs of carbon sources, each of them corresponding to a unique ecological niche. Bacterial metabolism shows an immense potential for the construction of new ecological niches through cross feeding.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/4j1AnbKj0ts&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Visual scene category representations emerge very rapidly, yet the computational transformations that enable such invariant categorizations remain elusive. Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) perform visual categorization at near human-level accuracy using a feedforward architecture, providing neuroscientists with the opportunity to assess one successful series of representational transformations that enable categorization &lt;i&gt;in silico&lt;/i&gt;. The goal of the current study is to assess the extent to which sequential scene category representations built by a CNN map onto those built in the human brain as assessed by high-density, time-resolved event-related potentials (ERPs). We found correspondence both over time and across the scalp: earlier (0–200 ms) ERP activity was best explained by early CNN layers at all electrodes. Although later activity at most electrode sites corresponded to earlier CNN layers, activity in right occipito-temporal electrodes was best explained by the later, fully-connected layers of the CNN around 225 ms post-stimulus, along with similar patterns in frontal electrodes. Taken together, these results suggest that the emergence of scene category representations develop through a dynamic interplay between early activity over occipital electrodes as well as later activity over temporal and frontal electrodes.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/ZEQaAbJ1Wsg&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Numerous gene fusions have been uncovered across multiple cancer types. Although the ability to target several of these fusions has led to the development of some successful anti-cancer drugs, most of them are not druggable. Understanding the molecular pathways of a fusion is important in determining its function in oncogenesis and in developing therapeutic strategies for patients harboring the fusion. However, the molecular pathways have been elucidated for only a few fusions, in part because of the labor-intensive nature of the required functional assays. Therefore, we developed a domain-based network approach to infer the pathways of a fusion. Molecular interactions of a fusion are first predicted by using its protein domain composition, and its associated pathways are then inferred from these molecular interactions. We demonstrated the capabilities of this approach by primarily applying it to the well-studied BCR-ABL1 fusion. The approach was also applied to two undruggable fusions in sarcoma, EWS-FL1 and FUS-DDIT3. We successfully identified known genes and pathways associated with these fusions and satisfactorily validated these predictions using several benchmark sets. The predictions of EWS-FL1 and FUS-DDIT3 also correlate with results of high-throughput drug screening. To our best knowledge, this is the first approach for inferring pathways of fusions.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/AlUtclLYt3M&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

In the event of a new infectious disease outbreak, mathematical and simulation models are commonly used to inform policy by evaluating which control strategies will minimize the impact of the epidemic. In the early stages of such outbreaks, substantial parameter uncertainty may limit the ability of models to provide accurate predictions, and policymakers do not have the luxury of waiting for data to alleviate this state of uncertainty. For policymakers, however, it is the selection of the optimal control intervention in the face of uncertainty, rather than accuracy of model predictions, that is the measure of success that counts. We simulate the process of real-time decision-making by fitting an epidemic model to observed, spatially-explicit, infection data at weekly intervals throughout two historical outbreaks of foot-and-mouth disease, UK in 2001 and Miyazaki, Japan in 2010, and compare forward simulations of the impact of switching to an alternative control intervention at the time point in question. These are compared to policy recommendations generated in hindsight using data from the entire outbreak, thereby comparing the best we could have done at the time with the best we could have done in retrospect.
Our results show that the control policy that would have been chosen using all the data is also identified from an early stage in an outbreak using only the available data, despite high variability in projections of epidemic size. Critically, we find that it is an improved understanding of the locations of infected farms, rather than improved estimates of transmission parameters, that drives improved prediction of the relative performance of control interventions. However, the ability to estimate undetected infectious premises is a function of uncertainty in the transmission parameters. Here, we demonstrate the need for both real-time model fitting and generating projections to evaluate alternative control interventions throughout an outbreak. Our results highlight the use of using models at outbreak onset to inform policy and the importance of state-dependent interventions that adapt in response to additional information throughout an outbreak.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/ssEqx6ziHQk&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

This has spurred current consideration of DLK as a candidate therapeutic target, and raises a vital question: in what context is DLK a friend or foe to neurons? Here, we review our current understanding of DLK’s function and mechanisms in regulating both regenerative and degenerative responses to axonal damage and stress in the nervous system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded>

The specific patterns and properties of these synaptic connections are fundamental to the computations cortical neurons perform. How such specificity arises in cortical circuits has remained elusive. Here, we first consider the cell-type, subcellular and synaptic specificity required for generating mature patterns of cortical connectivity and responses. Next, we focus on recent progress in understanding how the synaptic connections among excitatory cortical projection neurons are established during development using the primary visual cortex of the mouse as a model.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Graphical abstract&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Graphical abstract for this article&quot; src=&quot;https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S0959438818300655-fx1.jpg&quot; title=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;301&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1807.08686</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;We first review traditional approaches to memory storage and formation,
drawing on the literature of quantitative neuroscience as well as statistical
physics. These have generally focused on the fast dynamics of neurons; however,
there is now an increasing emphasis on the slow dynamics of synapses, whose
weight changes are held to be responsible for memory storage. An important
first step in this direction was taken in the context of Fusi's cascade model,
where complex synaptic architectures were invoked, in particular, to store
long-term memories. No explicit synaptic dynamics were, however, invoked in
that work. These were recently incorporated theoretically using the techniques
used in agent-based modelling, and subsequently, models of competing and
cooperating synapses were formulated. It was found that the key to the storage
of long-term memories lay in the competitive dynamics of synapses. In this
review, we focus on models of synaptic competition and cooperation, and look at
the outstanding challenges that remain.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1807.08476</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Our eyes sample a disproportionately large amount of information at the
centre of gaze with increasingly sparse sampling into the periphery. This
sampling scheme is widely believed to be a wiring constraint whereby high
resolution at the centre is achieved by sacrificing spatial acuity in the
periphery. Here we propose that this sampling scheme may be optimal for object
recognition because the relevant spatial content is dense near an object and
sparse in the surrounding vicinity. We tested this hypothesis by training deep
convolutional neural networks on full-resolution and foveated images. Our main
finding is that networks trained on images with foveated sampling show better
object classification compared to networks trained on full resolution images.
Importantly, blurring images according to the human blur function yielded the
best performance compared to images with shallower or steeper blurring. Taken
together our results suggest that, peripheral blurring in our eyes may have
evolved for optimal object recognition, rather than merely to satisfy wiring
constraints.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;This paper outlines the implications of neural-level accounts of insight, and
models of the conceptual interactions that underlie creativity, for a theory of
cultural evolution. Since elements of human culture exhibit cumulative,
adaptive, open-ended change, it seems reasonable to view culture as an
evolutionary process, one fueled by creativity. Associative memory models of
creativity and mathematical models of how concepts combine and transform
through interaction with a context, support a view of creativity that is
incompatible with a Darwinian (selectionist) framework for cultural evolution,
but compatible with a non-Darwinian (Self-Other Reorganization) framework. A
theory of cultural evolution in which creativity is centre stage could provide
the kind of integrative framework for the behavioral sciences that Darwin
provided for the life sciences.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Neuronal network dynamics depends on network structure. It is often assumed
that neurons are connected at random when their actual connectivity structure
is unknown. Such models are then often approximated by replacing the random
network by an all-to-all network, where every neuron is connected to all other
neurons. This mean-field approximation is a common approach in statistical
physics. In this paper we show that such approximation can be invalid. We solve
analytically a neuronal network model with binary-state neurons in both random
and all-to-all networks. We find strikingly different phase diagrams
corresponding to each network structure. Neuronal network dynamics is not only
different within certain parameter ranges, but it also undergoes different
bifurcations. Our results therefore suggest cautiousness when using mean-field
models based on all-to-all network topologies to represent random networks.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Information Estimation Using Non-Parametric Copulas. (arXiv:1807.08018v1 [stat.ME])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1807.08018</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Estimation of mutual information between random variables has become crucial
in a range of fields, from physics to neuroscience to finance. Estimating
information accurately over a wide range of conditions relies on the
development of flexible methods to describe statistical dependencies among
variables, without imposing potentially invalid assumptions on the data. Such
methods are needed in cases that lack prior knowledge of their statistical
properties and that have limited sample numbers. Here we propose a powerful and
generally applicable information estimator based on non-parametric copulas.
This estimator, called the non-parametric copula-based estimator (NPC), is
tailored to take into account detailed stochastic relationships in the data
independently of the data's marginal distributions. The NPC estimator can be
used both for continuous and discrete numerical variables and thus provides a
single framework for the mutual information estimation of both continuous and
discrete data. By extensive validation on artificial samples drawn from various
statistical distributions, we found that the NPC estimator compares well
against commonly used alternatives. Unlike methods not based on copulas, it
allows an estimation of information that is robust to changes of the details of
the marginal distributions. Unlike parametric copula methods, it remains
accurate regardless of the precise form of the interactions between the
variables. In addition, the NPC estimator had accurate information estimates
even at low sample numbers, in comparison to alternative estimators. The NPC
estimator therefore provides a good balance between general applicability to
arbitrarily shaped statistical dependencies in the data and shows accurate and
robust performance when working with small sample sizes.

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: A marginalized two-part Beta regression model for microbiome compositional data</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/PdhaI1pPOFI/article</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Haitao Chai, Hongmei Jiang, Lu Lin, Lei Liu&lt;/p&gt;

In microbiome studies, an important goal is to detect differential abundance of microbes across clinical conditions and treatment options. However, the microbiome compositional data (quantified by relative abundance) are highly skewed, bounded in [0, 1), and often have many zeros. A two-part model is commonly used to separate zeros and positive values explicitly by two submodels: a logistic model for the probability of a specie being present in Part I, and a Beta regression model for the relative abundance conditional on the presence of the specie in Part II. However, the regression coefficients in Part II cannot provide a marginal (unconditional) interpretation of covariate effects on the microbial abundance, which is of great interest in many applications. In this paper, we propose a marginalized two-part Beta regression model which captures the zero-inflation and skewness of microbiome data and also allows investigators to examine covariate effects on the marginal (unconditional) mean. We demonstrate its practical performance using simulation studies and apply the model to a real metagenomic dataset on mouse skin microbiota. We find that under the proposed marginalized model, without loss in power, the likelihood ratio test performs better in controlling the type I error than those under conventional methods.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/PdhaI1pPOFI&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0183-18.2018v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Recent work suggests that the brain represents probability distributions and performs Bayesian integration during sensorimotor learning. However, our understanding of the neural representation of this learning remains limited. To begin to address this, we performed two experiments. In the first experiment, we replicated the key behavioral findings of Körding and Wolpert (2004), demonstrating that humans can perform in a Bayes-optimal manner by combining information about their own sensory uncertainty and a statistical distribution of lateral shifts encountered in a visuomotor adaptation task. In the second experiment, we extended these findings by testing whether visuomotor learning occurring during the same task generalizes from one limb to the other, and relatedly, whether this learning is represented in an extrinsic or intrinsic reference frame. We found that the learned mean of the distribution of visuomotor shifts generalizes to the opposite limb only when the perturbation is congruent in extrinsic coordinates, indicating that the underlying representation of learning acquired during training is available to the untrained limb and is coded in an extrinsic reference frame.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Generalization provides unique insights into the motor learning process. However, this type of learning has typically been investigated using fixed or deterministic perturbations and noise-free feedback information, which are not naturalistic. Here we replicate important findings indicating that information is integrated in a Bayes-optimal manner during sensorimotor learning under uncertainty. We then extend these findings by showing that this learning generalises to the opposite limb. These results have implications for our understanding of the neural mechanisms of motor learning as well as practical application to the contexts of sport training and motor rehabilitation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>RSS PAP: {Delta}FosB Decreases Excitability of Dorsal Hippocampal CA1 Neurons</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0104-18.2018v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Both the function of hippocampal neurons and hippocampus-dependent behaviors are dependent on changes in gene expression, but the specific mechanisms that regulate gene expression in hippocampus are not yet fully understood. The stable, activity-dependent transcription factor FosB plays a role in various forms of hippocampal-dependent learning and in structural plasticity of synapses onto CA1 neurons. The authors examined the consequences of viral-mediated overexpression or inhibition of FosB on the function of adult mouse hippocampal CA1 neurons using &lt;i&gt;ex vivo&lt;/i&gt; slice whole-cell physiology. We found that overexpression of FosB decreased excitability of CA1 pyramidal neurons, while inhibition increased excitability. Interestingly, these manipulations did not affect resting membrane potential or spike frequency adaptation, but FosB overexpression reduced hyperpolarization-activated current. Both FosB overexpression and inhibition decreased spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents, while only FosB inhibition affected AMPA/NMDA ratio which was mediated by decreased NMDA receptor current, suggesting complex effects on synaptic inputs to CA1 that may be driven by homeostatic cell-autonomous or network-driven adaptations to the changes in CA1 cell excitability. Because FosB is induced in hippocampus by drugs of abuse, stress, or antidepressant treatment, these results suggest that FosB-driven changes in hippocampal cell excitability may be critical for learning and, in maladaptive states, are key drivers of aberrant hippocampal function in diseases such as addiction and depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Memory consolidation is a key component of adaptive learned behavior which can be disrupted in psychiatric conditions, and regulated gene expression in hippocampus is critical for learning and memory. FosB is a highly stable, activity-dependent transcription factor that regulates hippocampus-dependent memory, yet its specific role in hippocampal neuronal function is unclear. The authors use whole-cell slice electrophysiology to uncover a novel role for FosB in regulating neuronal excitability in the CA1 region of hippocampus. These findings suggest that FosB-driven changes in gene expression drive intrinsic excitability of hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons, potentially regulating learning, antidepressant responses, and psychiatric diseases such as drug addiction and depression.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>RSS PAP: Maternal Regulation of Pups' Cortical Activity: role of Serotonergic Signaling</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0093-18.2018v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;A developing brain shows intense re-organization and heightened neuronal plasticity allowing for environmental modulation of its development. During early life, maternal care is a key factor of this environment and defects in this care can derail adaptive brain development and may result in susceptibility to neuropsychiatric disorders. Nevertheless, the mechanisms by which those maternal interactions immediately impact the offspring’s brain activity to initiate the pathway to pathology are not well understood. We do know that multiple neurotransmitter systems are involved, including the serotonergic system, a key neuromodulator involved in brain development and emotional regulation. We tested the importance of the serotonergic system and pups’ immediate neural response to maternal presence using wireless electrophysiological recordings, a novel approach allowing us to record neural activity during pups’ interactions with their mother.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We found that maternal contact modulates the P10-P12 rat pups’ anterior cingulate cortex activity by notably increasing local field potential power in low-frequency bands. We demonstrated, by blocking serotonergic receptors, that this increase is mediated through 5-HT2 receptors. Finally, we showed in isolated pups that enhancing serotonergic transmission, using a selective-serotonin-reuptake-inhibitor, is sufficient to enhance local field potential power in low frequency bands in a pattern similar to that observed when the mother is in the nest. Our results highlight a significant contribution of the serotonergic system in mediating changes of cortical activity in pups related to maternal presence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Maternal care is a major environmental factor influencing brain development and deficits in this care can result in maladaptive behaviors in the offspring. While maternal interaction is crucial, little is known about the underlying mechanisms by which it modulates infant/pup brain activity. In this study, using wireless electrophysiological recordings, we show that the mother’s contact regulates the activity of key prefrontal regions of 10-12 D-old rat pups. Regarding mechanisms, we found that the serotonergic system contributes to this modulation, notably through 5HT2 receptors. These results suggest maternal care affects serotonergic neural activity during early life and provide key insights into how maternal care affects the adaptive/maladaptive development of brain circuits implicated in adult pathology.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;What is intuitive: pro-social or anti-social behaviour? To answer this
fundamental question, recent studies analyse decision times in game theory
experiments under the assumption that intuitive decisions are fast and that
deliberation is slow. Lacking any knowledge of the underlying dynamics, such
simplistic approach might however lead to erroneous interpretations. Here we
model the cognitive basis of strategic cooperative decision making using the
Drift Diffusion Model to discern between deliberation and intuition and
describe the evolution of the decision making in iterated Prisoner's Dilemma
experiments. We find that rational deliberation quickly becomes dominant over
an initial intuitive bias towards cooperation, which is fostered by positive
interactions as much as frustrated by a negative one. However, this initial
pro-social tendency is resilient, as after a pause it resets to the same
initial value. These results illustrate the new insight that can be achieved
thanks to a quantitative modelling of human behavior.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1807.07687</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Higher socioeconomic status (SES) in childhood is associated with increased
cognitive abilities, higher academic achievement, and decreased incidence of
mental illness later in development. Accumulating evidence suggests that these
effects may be due to changes in brain development induced by environmental
factors. While prior work has mapped the associations between neighborhood SES
and brain structure, little is known about the relationship between SES and
intrinsic neural dynamics. Here, we capitalize upon a large community-based
sample (Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort, ages 8-22 years, n=1012) to
examine developmental changes in functional brain network topology as estimated
from resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging data. We
quantitatively characterize this topology using a local measure of network
segregation known as the clustering coefficient, and find that it accounts for
a greater degree of SES-associated variance than meso-scale segregation
captured by modularity. While whole-brain clustering increased with age,
high-SES youth displayed faster increases in clustering than low-SES youth, and
this effect was most pronounced for regions in the limbic, somatomotor, and
ventral attention systems. The effect of SES on developmental increases in
clustering was strongest for connections of intermediate physical length,
consistent with faster decreases in local connectivity in these regions in
low-SES youth, and tracked changes in BOLD signal complexity in the form of
regional homogeneity. Our findings suggest that neighborhood SES may
fundamentally alter intrinsic patterns of inter-regional interactions in the
human brain in a manner that is consistent with greater segregation of
information processing in late childhood and adolescence.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Modelling of consciousness and interpretation of quantum mechanics. (arXiv:1807.07669v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1807.07669</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;I start from the fundamental principles of non-relativistic quantum
mechanics, without probability, and interpret them using the notion of
coexistence: a quantum state can be read, not uniquely, as a coexistence of
other quantum states, which are pairwise orthogonal. In this formalism, I prove
that a conscious observer is necessarily a physical object that can memorize
local events by setting one of its parts in an exactly specified constant
quantum state (hypotheses H1, H2 and H3). Then I define the probability of a
future event as the proportion of initial observers, all identical, who will
actually experience that event. It then becomes possible to establish the usual
results of quantum mechanics. Furthermore, I detail the link between
probabilities and relative frequencies. Additionally, I study the biological
feasibility of this modelling of observer's mind.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second part of this paper completes the neuronal description of the mind
functions, based on current neuroscientific knowledge. It provides a model that
is compatible with the assumptions of the first part and consistent with our
daily conscious experience. In particular, it develops a model of
self-consciousness based on an explicit use of the random component of neuron
behaviour; according to the first part, that random is in fact the coexistence
of a multiplicity of possibilities. So, when the mind measures the random part
of certain neurons in the brain, he goes himself within each of these
possibilities. The mind has a decision-making component that is active in this
situation, appearing then as the cause of the choice of this possibility among
all the others. This models the self-consciousness which then ensures the unity
of our conscious experience by equating this experience with ``what the ego is
conscious about''. The conclusion details the points that remain to be
developed.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Critique of the Fox-Lu model for Hodgkin-Huxley fluctuations in neuron ion channels. (arXiv:1807.07632v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1807.07632</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Using a well known result that every FP equation has an antecedent Langevin
equation LE Fox and Lu proposed such a description for ion channels in 1994.
Their contraction followed the works of van Kampen and of T. Kurtz. The
contraction produces a diffusion term with a state dependent diffusion matrix,
D, that arises from the coupling matrix, S, in the LE. This S connected the
noise terms to the channel subunit variables in the LE. Fox and Lu and many
others later on observed that SS = D. Since D was determined by the contraction
of the MC equations into the FP equation, this left the problem of determining
the square root matrix, S, for every time step of the simulation. Since this is
time consuming, Fox and Lu introduced simplified models not requiring the
square root of a matrix. Subsequently, numerous studies were published that
showed the several shortcomings of these simplified models. In 2011, Goldwyn et
al. [6] rediscovered the overlooked original matrix dependent approach in the
Fox-Lu 1994 paper. They showed that it produced results in very good agreement
with the MC results. In 1991, Fox and Keizer [7] wrote a paper on an unrelated
topic that utilized the work of van Kampen and of Kurtz. In that work the
connection between D and S is SST = D. ST is the adjoint (transpose) of S. D
remains a positive definite symmetric matrix but S need not be. Fox has
reproduced the 2012 results of Orio and Soudry for potassium channels and has
also found in closed form the solution for the more complicated sodium
channels. The square root problem generally must be done numerically, but the
Cholesky is always doable in closed form. Thereby the S matrix for sodium is
given explicitly for the first time in this paper

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1807.07590</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;We present a complete wireless neural stimulation system consisting of a 2.2
mm3 wireless, batteryless, leadless implantable stimulator implant (the
&quot;mote&quot;), an ultrasonic wireless link for power and bi-directional
communication, and a hand-held external transceiver. The mote consists of a
stimulator integrated circuit (IC), which performs high-efficiency ultrasonic
power harvesting, decodes stimulation parameter downlink data, and generates
current-controlled stimulation pulses. Stimulation parameters are time-encoded
on the fly through the wireless link rather than being programmed and stored on
the mote, enabling complex stimulation protocols with precise timing and
closed-loop capability and without the need for on-chip memory and power
consumption. Uplink data indicates whether or not the mote is currently
stimulating and is encoded by the mote via backscatter modulation and
demodulated at the external receiver. We characterize system power, stimulation
performance, and acoustic link robustness under misalignment. We implant the
mote on the sciatic nerve of anesthetized rats and investigate the full range
of physiological responses achievable with the wireless system.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Three-dimensional alteration of neurons in schizophrenia. (arXiv:1804.00404v2 [q-bio.NC] UPDATED)</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1804.00404</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Psychiatric symptoms of schizophrenia suggest alteration of cerebral neurons.
However, the physical basis of the schizophrenia symptoms has not been
delineated at the cellular level. Here we report nanometer-scale
three-dimensional analysis of brain tissues of schizophrenia and control cases.
Structures of cerebral tissues of the anterior cingulate cortex were visualized
with synchrotron radiation nanotomography. Tissue constituents observed in the
three-dimensional images were traced to build Cartesian coordinate models of
neurons. The obtained Cartesian coordinates were used for calculating curvature
and torsion of neurites. The geometric analyses indicated that the curvature of
neurites is significantly different between schizophrenia and control cases.
The mean curvature of distal neurites of the schizophrenia cases was
approximately 1.5 times higher than that of the controls. A schizophrenia case
carrying a frame shift mutation in the GLO1 gene showed the highest neurite
curvature, suggesting that oxidative stress due to the GLO1 mutation caused the
structural alteration of the neurites. The differences in the neurite curvature
result in differences in the spatial trajectory and hence alter neuronal
circuits. We suggest that the structural alteration of neurons in the
schizophrenia cases should reflect psychiatric symptoms of schizophrenia.

How this map forms when animals are exposed to novel environments has been the subject of a great deal of research. Numerous technical advances over the past decade greatly increased our understanding of the precise mechanisms underlying place field formation. In particular, it is now possible to connect cellular and circuit mechanisms of integration, firing, and plasticity discovered in brain slices, to processes taking place &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt; as animals learn and encode novel environments. Here, we focus on recent results and describe the dendritic mechanisms most likely responsible for the formation of place fields. We also discuss key open questions that are likely to be answered in the coming years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Punishment and inspection for governing the commons in a feedback-evolving game</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/2SnwQ8vO1ew/article</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Xiaojie Chen, Attila Szolnoki&lt;/p&gt;

Utilizing common resources is always a dilemma for community members. While cooperator players restrain themselves and consider the proper state of resources, defectors demand more than their supposed share for a higher payoff. To avoid the tragedy of the common state, punishing the latter group seems to be an adequate reaction. This conclusion, however, is less straightforward when we acknowledge the fact that resources are finite and even a renewable resource has limited growing capacity. To clarify the possible consequences, we consider a coevolutionary model where beside the payoff-driven competition of cooperator and defector players the level of a renewable resource depends sensitively on the fraction of cooperators and the total consumption of all players. The applied feedback-evolving game reveals that beside a delicately adjusted punishment it is also fundamental that cooperators should pay special attention to the growing capacity of renewable resources. Otherwise, even the usage of tough punishment cannot save the community from an undesired end.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/2SnwQ8vO1ew&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Exploration and stabilization of Ras1 mating zone: a mechanism with positive and negative feedbacks</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/ekpK2OCnuMg/article</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Bita Khalili, Laura Merlini, Vincent Vincenzetti, Sophie G. Martin, Dimitrios Vavylonis&lt;/p&gt;

In mating fission yeast cells, sensing and response to extracellular pheromone concentrations occurs through an exploratory Cdc42 patch that stochastically samples the cell cortex before stabilizing towards a mating partner. Active Ras1 (Ras1-GTP), an upstream regulator of Cdc42, and Gap1, the GTPase-activating protein for Ras1, localize at the patch. We developed a reaction-diffusion model of Ras1 patch appearance and disappearance with a positive feedback by a Guanine nucleotide Exchange Factor (GEF) and Gap1 inhibition. The model is based on new estimates of Ras1-GDP, Ras1-GTP and Gap1 diffusion coefficients and rates of cytoplasmic exchange studied by FRAP. The model reproduces exploratory patch behavior and lack of Ras1 patch in cells lacking Gap1. Transition to a stable patch can occur by change of Gap1 rates constants or local increase of the positive feedback rate constants. The model predicts that the patch size and number of patches depend on the strength of positive and negative feedbacks. Measurements of Ras1 patch size and number in cells overexpressing the Ras1 GEF or Gap1 are consistent with the model.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/ekpK2OCnuMg&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: The evolutionary dynamics of metabolic protocells</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/50Cx1p0DxGg/article</link>

Protocell multilevel selection models have been proposed to study the evolutionary dynamics of vesicles encapsulating a set of replicating, competing and mutating sequences. The frequency of the different sequence types determines protocell survival through a fitness function. One of the defining features of these models is the genetic load generated when the protocell divides and its sequences are assorted between the offspring vesicles. However, these stochastic assortment effects disappear when the redundancy of each sequence type is sufficiently high. The fitness dependence of the vesicle with its sequence content is usually defined without considering a realistic account on how the lower level dynamics would specify the protocell fitness. Here, we present a protocell model with a fitness function determined by the output flux of a simple metabolic network with the aim of understanding how the evolution of both kinetic and topological features of metabolism would have been constrained by the particularities of the protocell evolutionary dynamics. In our model, the sequences inside the vesicle are both the carriers of information and Michaelis-Menten catalysts exhibiting saturation. We found that the saturation of the catalysts controlling the metabolic fluxes, achievable by modifying the kinetic or stoichiometric parameters, provides a mechanism to ameliorate the assortment load by increasing the redundancy of the catalytic sequences required to achieve the maximum flux. Regarding the network architecture, we conclude that combinations of parallel network motifs and bimolecular catalysts are a robust way to increase the complexity of the metabolism enclosed by the protocell.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/50Cx1p0DxGg&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: A minimally invasive neurostimulation method for controlling abnormal synchronisation in the neuronal activity</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/HZMLntdffDE/article</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Malbor Asllani, Paul Expert, Timoteo Carletti&lt;/p&gt;

Many collective phenomena in Nature emerge from the -partial- synchronisation of the units comprising a system. In the case of the brain, this self-organised process allows groups of neurons to fire in highly intricate partially synchronised patterns and eventually lead to high level cognitive outputs and control over the human body. However, when the synchronisation patterns are altered and hypersynchronisation occurs, undesirable effects can occur. This is particularly striking and well documented in the case of epileptic seizures and tremors in neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson’s disease. In this paper, we propose an innovative, minimally invasive, control method that can effectively desynchronise misfiring brain regions and thus mitigate and even eliminate the symptoms of the diseases. The control strategy, grounded in the Hamiltonian control theory, is applied to ensembles of neurons modelled via the Kuramoto or the Stuart-Landau models and allows for heterogeneous coupling among the interacting unities. The theory has been complemented with dedicated numerical simulations performed using the small-world Newman-Watts network and the random Erdős-Rényi network. Finally the method has been compared with the gold-standard Proportional-Differential Feedback control technique. Our method is shown to achieve equivalent levels of desynchronisation using lesser control strength and/or fewer controllers, being thus minimally invasive.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/HZMLntdffDE&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Correction of copy number induced false positives in CRISPR screens</title>

Cell autonomous cancer dependencies are now routinely identified using CRISPR loss-of-function viability screens. However, a bias exists that makes it difficult to assess the true essentiality of genes located in amplicons, since the entire amplified region can exhibit lethal scores. These false-positive hits can either be discarded from further analysis, which in cancer models can represent a significant number of hits, or methods can be developed to rescue the true-positives within amplified regions. We propose two methods to rescue true positive hits in amplified regions by correcting for this copy number artefact. The Local Drop Out (LDO) method uses the relative lethality scores within genomic regions to assess true essentiality and does not require additional orthogonal data (e.g. copy number value). LDO is meant to be used in screens covering a dense region of the genome (e.g. a whole chromosome or the whole genome). The General Additive Model (GAM) method models the screening data as a function of the known copy number values and removes the systematic effect from the measured lethality. GAM does not require the same density as LDO, but does require prior knowledge of the copy number values. Both methods have been developed with single sample experiments in mind so that the correction can be applied even in smaller screens. Here we demonstrate the efficacy of both methods at removing the copy number effect and rescuing hits from some of the amplified regions. We estimate a 70–80% decrease of false positive hits with either method in regions of high copy number compared to no correction.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/HKcn4ktDbyU&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Hearing loss in mammals is an irreversible process caused by degeneration of the hair cells of the inner ear. Current therapies for hearing loss include hearing aids and cochlear implants that provide substantial benefits to most patients, but also have several shortcomings. There is great interest in the development of regenerative therapies to treat deafness in the future. Cell-based therapies, based either on adult, multipotent stem, or other types of pluripotent cells, offer promise for generating differentiated cell types to replace lost or damaged hair cells of the inner ear.</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Stochastic resonance enhances the rate of evidence accumulation during combined brain stimulation and perceptual decision-making</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/hJxUrn196_0/article</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Onno van der Groen, Matthew F. Tang, Nicole Wenderoth, Jason B. Mattingley&lt;/p&gt;

Perceptual decision-making relies on the gradual accumulation of noisy sensory evidence. It is often assumed that such decisions are degraded by adding noise to a stimulus, or to the neural systems involved in the decision making process itself. But it has been suggested that adding an optimal amount of noise can, under appropriate conditions, enhance the quality of subthreshold signals in nonlinear systems, a phenomenon known as &lt;i&gt;stochastic resonance&lt;/i&gt;. Here we asked whether perceptual decisions made by human observers obey these stochastic resonance principles, by adding noise directly to the visual cortex using transcranial random noise stimulation (tRNS) while participants judged the direction of coherent motion in random-dot kinematograms presented at the fovea. We found that adding tRNS bilaterally to visual cortex enhanced decision-making when stimuli were just below perceptual threshold, but not when they were well below or above threshold. We modelled the data under a drift diffusion framework, and showed that bilateral tRNS selectively increased the drift rate parameter, which indexes the rate of evidence accumulation. Our study is the first to provide causal evidence that perceptual decision-making is susceptible to a stochastic resonance effect induced by tRNS, and to show that this effect arises from selective enhancement of the rate of evidence accumulation for sub-threshold sensory events.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/hJxUrn196_0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: A biophysically detailed computational model of bladder small DRG neuron soma</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/w7djXqEISFc/article</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Darshan Mandge, Rohit Manchanda&lt;/p&gt;

Bladder small DRG neurons, which are putative nociceptors pivotal to urinary bladder function, express more than a dozen different ionic membrane mechanisms: ion channels, pumps and exchangers. Small-conductance Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-activated K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; (SK&lt;sub&gt;Ca&lt;/sub&gt;) channels which were earlier thought to be gated solely by intracellular Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; concentration ([Ca]&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;) have recently been shown to exhibit inward rectification with respect to membrane potential. The effect of SK&lt;sub&gt;Ca&lt;/sub&gt; inward rectification on the excitability of these neurons is unknown. Furthermore, studies on the role of K&lt;sub&gt;Ca&lt;/sub&gt; channels in repetitive firing and their contributions to different types of afterhyperpolarization (AHP) in these neurons are lacking. In order to study these phenomena, we first constructed and validated a biophysically detailed single compartment model of bladder small DRG soma constrained by physiological data. The model includes twenty-two major known membrane mechanisms along with intracellular Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; dynamics comprising Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; diffusion, cytoplasmic buffering, and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and mitochondrial mechanisms. Using modelling studies, we show that inward rectification of SK&lt;sub&gt;Ca&lt;/sub&gt; is an important parameter regulating neuronal repetitive firing and that its absence reduces action potential (AP) firing frequency. We also show that SK&lt;sub&gt;Ca&lt;/sub&gt; is more potent in reducing AP spiking than the large-conductance K&lt;sub&gt;Ca&lt;/sub&gt; channel (BK&lt;sub&gt;Ca&lt;/sub&gt;) in these neurons. Moreover, BK&lt;sub&gt;Ca&lt;/sub&gt; was found to contribute to the fast AHP (fAHP) and SK&lt;sub&gt;Ca&lt;/sub&gt; to the medium-duration (mAHP) and slow AHP (sAHP). We also report that the slow inactivating A-type K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channel (slow K&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;) current in these neurons is composed of 2 components: an initial fast inactivating (time constant ∼ 25-100 ms) and a slow inactivating (time constant ∼ 200-800 ms) current. We discuss the implications of our findings, and how our detailed model can help further our understanding of the role of C-fibre afferents in the physiology of urinary bladder as well as in certain disorders.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/w7djXqEISFc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;The mammalian visual system consists of several anatomically distinct areas, layers, and cell types. To understand the role of these subpopulations in visual information processing, we analyzed neural signals recorded from excitatory neurons from various anatomical and functional structures. For each of 186 mice, one of six genetically tagged cell types and one of six visual areas were targeted while the mouse was passively viewing various visual stimuli. We trained linear classifiers to decode one of six visual stimulus categories with distinct spatiotemporal structures from the population neural activity. We found that neurons in both the primary visual cortex and secondary visual areas show varying degrees of stimulus-specific decodability, and neurons in superficial layers tend to be more informative about the stimulus categories. Additional decoding analyses of directional motion were consistent with these findings. We observed synergy in the population code of direction in several visual areas suggesting area-specific organization of information representation across neurons. These differences in decoding capacities shed light on the specialized organization of neural information processing across anatomically distinct subpopulations, and further establish the mouse as a model for understanding visual perception.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: A Multilevel Computational Characterization of Endophenotypes in Addiction</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/5/4/ENEURO.0151-18.2018?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Addiction is characterized by a profound intersubject (phenotypic) variability in the expression of addictive symptomatology and propensity to relapse following treatment. However, laboratory investigations have primarily focused on common neural substrates in addiction and have not yet been able to identify mechanisms that can account for the multifaceted phenotypic behaviors reported in the literature. To fill this knowledge gap theoretically, here we simulated phenotypic variations in addiction symptomology and responses to putative treatments, using both a neural model, based on cortico-striatal circuit dynamics, and an algorithmic model of reinforcement learning (RL). These simulations rely on the widely accepted assumption that both the ventral, model-based, goal-directed system and the dorsal, model-free, habitual system are vulnerable to extra-physiologic dopamine reinforcements triggered by addictive rewards. We found that endophenotypic differences in the balance between the two circuit or control systems resulted in an inverted-U shape in optimal choice behavior. Specifically, greater unbalance led to a higher likelihood of developing addiction and more severe drug-taking behaviors. Furthermore, endophenotypes with opposite asymmetrical biases among cortico-striatal circuits expressed similar addiction behaviors, but responded differently to simulated treatments, suggesting personalized treatment development could rely on endophenotypic rather than phenotypic differentiations. We propose our simulated results, confirmed across neural and algorithmic levels of analysis, inform on a fundamental and, to date, neglected quantitative method to characterize clinical heterogeneity in addiction.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>RSS PAP: Eye Movement-Related Confounds in Neural Decoding of Visual Working Memory Representations</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0401-17.2018v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;A relatively new analysis technique, known as neural decoding or multivariate pattern analysis, has become increasingly popular for cognitive neuroimaging studies over recent years. These techniques promise to uncover the representational contents of neural signals, as well as the underlying code and the dynamic profile thereof. A field in which these techniques have led to novel insights in particular is that of visual working memory (VWM). In the present study we subjected human volunteers to a combined VWM/imagery task while recording their neural signals using MEG. We applied multivariate decoding analyses to uncover the temporal profile underlying the neural representations of the memorized item. Analysis of gaze position however revealed that our results were contaminated by systematic eye movements, suggesting that the MEG decoding results from our originally planned analyses were confounded. In addition to the eye movement analyses, we also present the original analyses to highlight how these might have readily led to invalid conclusions. Finally, we demonstrate a potential remedy, whereby we train the decoders on a functional localizer that was specifically designed to target bottom-up sensory signals and as such avoids eye movements. We conclude by arguing for more awareness of the potentially pervasive and ubiquitous effects of eye movement-related confounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Neural decoding is an important and relatively novel technique that has opened up new avenues for cognitive neuroscience research. However, with its promises also come potential caveats. In this study we show that neural decoding may be susceptible to confounds induced by small task- and stimulus-specific eye movements in the context of a visual working memory task. Such eye movements during working memory tasks have been reported before, and may in fact be a common phenomenon. Given the widespread use of neural decoding and the potentially contaminating effects of eye movements, we therefore believe that our results are of significant relevance for the field.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Complex Control of Striatal Neurotransmission by Nicotinic Acetylcholine Receptors via Excitatory Inputs onto Medium Spiny Neurons</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/29/6597?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The prevalence of nicotine dependence is higher than that for any other substance abuse disorder; still, the underlying mechanisms are not fully established. To this end, we studied acute effects by nicotine on neurotransmission in the dorsolateral striatum, a key brain region with respect to the formation of habits. Electrophysiological recordings in acutely isolated brain slices from rodent showed that nicotine (10 nm to 10 μm) produced an LTD of evoked field potentials. Current-clamp recordings revealed no significant effect by nicotine on membrane voltage or action potential frequency, indicating that the effect by nicotine is primarily synaptic. Nicotine did not modulate sIPSCs, or the connectivity between fast-spiking interneurons and medium spiny neurons, as assessed by whole-cell recordings combined with optogenetics. However, the frequency of sEPSCs was significantly depressed by nicotine. The effect by nicotine was mimicked by agonists targeting α7- or α4-containing nAChRs and blocked in slices pretreated with a mixture of antagonists targeting these receptor subtypes. Nicotine-induced LTD was furthermore inhibited by dopamine D2 receptor antagonist and occluded by D2 receptor agonist. In addition, modulation of cholinergic neurotransmission suppressed the responding to nicotine, which might reflect upon the postulated role for nAChRs as a presynaptic filter to differentially govern dopamine release depending on neuronal activity. Nicotine-induced suppression of excitatory inputs onto medium spiny neurons may promote nicotine-induced locomotor stimulation and putatively initiate neuroadaptations that could contribute to the transition toward compulsive drug taking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; To decrease smoking, prevalence factors that may contribute to the development of nicotine addiction need to be identified. The data presented here show that nicotine suppresses striatal neurotransmission by selectively reducing the frequency of excitatory inputs to medium spiny neurons (MSNs) while rendering excitability, inhibitory neurotransmission, and fast-spiking interneuron-MSN connectivity unaltered. In addition, we show that the effect displayed by nicotine outlasts the presence of the drug, which could be fundamental for the addictive properties of nicotine. Considering the inhibitory tone displayed by MSNs on dopaminergic cell bodies and local terminals, nicotine-induced long-lasting depression of striatal output could play a role in behavioral transformations associated with nicotine use, and putatively elicit neuroadaptations underlying compulsive drug-seeking habits.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Axonal Ensheathment in the Nervous System of Lamprey: Implications for the Evolution of Myelinating Glia</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/29/6586?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In the nervous system, myelination of axons enables rapid impulse conduction and is a specialized function of glial cells. Myelinating glia are the last cell type to emerge in the evolution of vertebrate nervous systems, presumably in ancient jawed vertebrates (gnathostomata) because jawless vertebrates (agnathans) lack myelin. We have hypothesized that, in these unmyelinated species, evolutionary progenitors of myelinating cells must have existed that should still be present in contemporary agnathan species. Here, we used advanced electron microscopic techniques to reveal axon–glia interactions in the sea lamprey &lt;i&gt;Petromyzon marinus&lt;/i&gt;. By quantitative assessment of the spinal cord and the peripheral lateral line nerve, we observed a marked maturation-dependent growth of axonal calibers. In peripheral nerves, all axons are ensheathed by glial cells either in bundles or, when larger than the threshold caliber of 3 μm, individually. The ensheathing glia are covered by a basal lamina and express &lt;i&gt;SoxE&lt;/i&gt;-transcription factors, features of mammalian Remak-type Schwann cells. In larval lamprey, the ensheathment of peripheral axons leaves gaps that are closed in adults. CNS axons are also covered to a considerable extent by glial processes, which contain a high density of intermediate filaments, glycogen particles, large lipid droplets, and desmosomes, similar to mammalian astrocytes. Indeed, by &lt;i&gt;in situ&lt;/i&gt; hybridization, these glial cells express the astrocyte marker &lt;i&gt;Aldh1l1&lt;/i&gt;. Specimens were of unknown sex. Our observations imply that radial sorting, ensheathment, and presumably also metabolic support of axons are ancient functions of glial cells that predate the evolutionary emergence of myelin in jawed vertebrates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; We used current electron microscopy techniques to examine axon–glia units in a nonmyelinated vertebrate species, the sea lamprey. In the PNS, lamprey axons are fully ensheathed either individually or in bundles by cells ortholog to Schwann cells. In the CNS, axons associate with astrocyte orthologs, which contain glycogen and lipid droplets. We suggest that ensheathment, radial sorting, and metabolic support of axons by glial cells predate the evolutionary emergence of myelin in ancient jawed vertebrates.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: lncRNA TNXA-PS1 Modulates Schwann Cells by Functioning As a Competing Endogenous RNA Following Nerve Injury</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/29/6574?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;As the major glia in PNS, Schwann cells play a critical role in peripheral nerve injury repair. Finding an efficient approach to promote Schwann cell activation might facilitate peripheral nerve repair. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been shown to regulate gene expression and take part in many biological processes. However, the role of lncRNAs in peripheral nerve regeneration is not fully understood. In this study, we obtained a global lncRNA portrayal following sciatic nerve injury in male rats using microarray and further investigated one of these dys-regulated lncRNAs, TNXA-PS1, confirming its vital role in regulating Schwann cells. Silencing TNAX-PS1 could promote Schwann cell migration and mechanism analyses showed that TNXA-PS1 might exert its regulatory role by sponging miR-24–3p/miR-152–3p and affecting dual specificity phosphatase 1 (Dusp1) expression. Systematic lncRNA expression profiling of sciatic nerve segments following nerve injury in rats suggested lncRNA TNXA-PS1 as a key regulator of Schwann cell migration, providing a potential therapeutic target for nerve injury repair.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The PNS has an intrinsic regeneration capacity after injury in which Schwann cells play a crucial role. Therefore, further exploration of functional molecules in the Schwann cell phenotype modulation is of great importance. We have identified a set of dys-regulated long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) in rats following sciatic nerve injury and found that the expression of TNXA-PS1 was significantly downregulated. Mechanically analyses showed that TNXA-PS1 might act as a competing endogenous RNA to affect dual specificity phosphatase 1 (Dusp1) expression, regulating migration of Schwann cells. This study provides for the first time a global landscape of lncRNAs following sciatic nerve injury in rats and broadens the known functions of lncRNA during nerve injury. The investigation of TNXA-PS1 might facilitate the development of novel targets for nerve injury therapy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Distinct Populations of Motor Thalamic Neurons Encode Action Initiation, Action Selection, and Movement Vigor</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/29/6563?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Motor thalamus (Mthal) comprises the ventral anterior, ventral lateral, and ventral medial thalamic nuclei in rodents. This subcortical hub receives input from the basal ganglia (BG), cerebellum, and reticular thalamus in addition to connecting reciprocally with motor cortical regions. Despite the central location of Mthal, the mechanisms by which it influences movement remain unclear. To determine its role in generating ballistic, goal-directed movement, we recorded single-unit Mthal activity as male rats performed a two-alternative forced-choice task. A large population of Mthal neurons increased their firing briefly near movement initiation and could be segregated into functional groups based on their behavioral correlates. The activity of &quot;initiation&quot; units was more tightly locked to instructional cues than movement onset, did not predict which direction the rat would move, and was anticorrelated with reaction time (RT). Conversely, the activity of &quot;execution&quot; units was more tightly locked to movement onset than instructional cues, predicted which direction the rat would move, and was anticorrelated with both RT and movement time. These results suggest that Mthal influences choice RT performance in two stages: short latency, nonspecific action initiation followed by action selection/invigoration. We discuss the implications of these results for models of motor control incorporating BG and cerebellar circuits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Motor thalamus (Mthal) is a central node linking subcortical and cortical motor circuits, though its precise role in motor control is unclear. Here, we define distinct populations of Mthal neurons that either encode movement initiation, or both action selection and movement vigor. These results have important implications for understanding how basal ganglia, cerebellar, and motor cortical signals are integrated. Such an understanding is critical to defining the pathophysiology of a range of BG- and cerebellum-linked movement disorders, as well as refining pharmacologic and neuromodulatory approaches to their treatment.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Dynamic reshaping of functional brain networks during visual object recognition. (arXiv:1807.06398v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1807.06398</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Emerging evidence shows that the modular organization of the human brain
allows for better and efficient cognitive performance. Many of these cognitive
functions are very fast and occur in subsecond time scale such as the visual
object recognition. Here, we investigate brain network modularity while
controlling stimuli meaningfulness and measuring participant reaction time. We
particularly raised two questions: i) does the dynamic brain network modularity
change during the recognition of meaningful and meaningless visual images? And
ii) is there a correlation between network modularity and the reaction time of
participants? To tackle these issues, we collected dense electroencephalography
(EEG, 256 channels) data from 20 healthy human subjects performing a cognitive
task consisting of naming meaningful (tools, animals) and meaningless
(scrambled) images. Functional brain networks in both categories were estimated
at subsecond time scale using the EEG source connectivity method. By using
multislice modularity algorithms, we tracked the reconfiguration of functional
networks during the recognition of both meaningful and meaningless images.
Results showed a difference in the module characteristics of both conditions in
term of integration (interactions between modules) and occurrence (probability
on average of any two brain regions to fall in the same module during the
task). Integration and occurrence were greater for meaningless than for
meaningful images. Our findings revealed also that the occurrence within the
right frontal regions and the left occipito-temporal can help to predict the
ability of the brain to rapidly recognize and name visual stimuli. We speculate
that these observations are applicable not only to other fast cognitive
functions but also to detect fast disconnections that can occur in some brain
disorders.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Penalized matrix decomposition for denoising, compression, and improved demixing of functional imaging data. (arXiv:1807.06203v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1807.06203</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Calcium imaging has revolutionized systems neuroscience, providing the
ability to image large neural populations with single-cell resolution. The
resulting datasets are quite large, which has presented a barrier to routine
open sharing of this data, slowing progress in reproducible research. State of
the art methods for analyzing this data are based on non-negative matrix
factorization (NMF); these approaches solve a non-convex optimization problem,
and are effective when good initializations are available, but can break down
in low-SNR settings where common initialization approaches fail. Here we
introduce an approach to compressing and denoising functional imaging data. The
method is based on a spatially-localized penalized matrix decomposition (PMD)
of the data to separate (low-dimensional) signal from (temporally-uncorrelated)
noise. This approach can be applied in parallel on local spatial patches and is
therefore highly scalable, does not impose non-negativity constraints or
require stringent identifiability assumptions (leading to significantly more
robust results compared to NMF), and estimates all parameters directly from the
data, so no hand-tuning is required. We have applied the method to a wide range
of functional imaging data (including one-photon, two-photon, three-photon,
widefield, somatic, axonal, dendritic, calcium, and voltage imaging datasets):
in all cases, we observe ~2-4x increases in SNR and compression rates of
20-300x with minimal visible loss of signal, with no adjustment of
hyperparameters; this in turn facilitates the process of demixing the observed
activity into contributions from individual neurons. We focus on two
challenging applications: dendritic calcium imaging data and voltage imaging
data in the context of optogenetic stimulation. In both cases, we show that our
new approach leads to faster and much more robust extraction of activity from
the data.

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: A quantitative physical model of the TMS-induced discharge artifacts in EEG</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/EXQCGpRf8hI/article</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Dominik Freche, Jodie Naim-Feil, Avi Peled, Nava Levit-Binnun, Elisha Moses&lt;/p&gt;

The combination of Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) with Electroencephalography (EEG) exposes the brain’s global response to localized and abrupt stimulations. However, large electric artifacts are induced in the EEG by the TMS, obscuring crucial stages of the brain’s response. Artifact removal is commonly performed by data processing techniques. However, an experimentally verified physical model for the origin and structure of the TMS-induced discharge artifacts, by which these methods can be justified or evaluated, is still lacking. We re-examine the known contribution of the skin in creating the artifacts, and outline a detailed model for the relaxation of the charge accumulated at the electrode-gel-skin interface due to the TMS pulse. We then experimentally validate implications set forth by the model. We find that the artifacts decay like a power law in time rather than the commonly assumed exponential. In fact, the skin creates a power-law decay of order 1 at each electrode, which is turned into a power law of order 2 by the reference electrode. We suggest an artifact removal method based on the model which can be applied from times after the pulse as short as 2 milliseconds onwards to expose the full EEG from the brain. The method can separate the capacitive discharge artifacts from those resulting from cranial muscle activation, demonstrating that the capacitive effect dominates at short times. Overall, our insight into the physical process allows us to accurately access TMS-evoked EEG responses that directly follow the TMS pulse, possibly opening new opportunities in TMS-EEG research.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/EXQCGpRf8hI&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>RSS PAP: Two Sides of the Same Coin: Distinct Sub-Bands in the Alpha Rhythm Reflect Facilitation and Suppression Mechanisms during Auditory Anticipatory Attention</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0141-18.2018v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Anticipatory attention results in enhanced response to task-relevant stimulus, and reduced processing of unattended input, suggesting the deployment of distinct facilitatory and suppressive mechanisms. Alpha oscillations are a suitable candidate for supporting these mechanisms. We aimed to examine the role of alpha oscillations, with a special focus on peak frequencies, in facilitatory and suppressive mechanisms during auditory anticipation, within the auditory and visual regions. MEG data were collected from fourteen healthy young human adults (8 female) performing an auditory task in which spatial attention to sounds was manipulated by visual cues, either informative or not of the target side. By incorporating uninformative cues, we could delineate facilitating and suppressive mechanisms. During anticipation of a visually-cued auditory target, we observed a decrease in alpha power around 9Hz in the auditory cortices; and an increase around 13 Hz in the visual regions. Only this power increase in high alpha significantly correlated with behavior. Importantly, within the right auditory cortex, we showed a larger increase in high alpha power when attending an ipsilateral sound; and a stronger decrease in low alpha power when attending a contralateral sound. In summary, we found facilitatory and suppressive attentional mechanisms with distinct timing in task-relevant and task-irrelevant brain areas, differentially correlated to behavior and supported by distinct alpha sub-bands. We provide new insight into the role of the alpha peak-frequency by showing that anticipatory attention is supported by distinct facilitatory and suppressive mechanisms, mediated in different low and high sub-bands of the alpha rhythm, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; We investigated the role of alpha oscillations, with a special focus on peak frequencies, in facilitatory and suppressive mechanisms during anticipation, using MEG data collected during an auditory spatial attention task. We show, during anticipation of a visually-cued auditory target, a decrease in alpha power around 9Hz in the auditory cortices, simultaneous to an increase around 13 Hz in in the visual regions, the latter significantly correlated with behavioral performances. Within the right auditory cortex, we show a larger increase in high alpha when attending an ipsilateral sound; and a stronger decrease in low alpha when attending a contralateral sound. Therefore, anticipatory attention would be supported by distinct facilitatory and suppressive mechanisms, mediated in different low and high alpha sub-bands, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>RSS PAP: Estradiol Drives the Anorexigenic Activity of Proopiomelanocortin Neurons in Female Mice</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0103-18.2018v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Energy balance is regulated by anorexigenic proopiomelanocortin (POMC) and orexigenic neuropeptide Y/agouti-related peptide (NPY/AgRP) neurons of the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus. POMC neurons make extensive projections and are thought to release both amino acid and peptide neurotransmitters. However, whether they communicate directly with NPY/AgRP neurons is debated. Initially, using single cell RT-PCR, we determined that mouse POMC&lt;sup&gt;eGFP&lt;/sup&gt; neurons express &lt;i&gt;Slc17a6&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;Vglut2&lt;/i&gt;) and &lt;i&gt;Slc18a2&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;Vmat2&lt;/i&gt;), but not &lt;i&gt;Slc31a1&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;Vgat&lt;/i&gt;) mRNA, suggesting glutamate and non-canonical GABA release. Quantitative RT-PCR of POMC&lt;sup&gt;eGFP&lt;/sup&gt; cells revealed that &lt;i&gt;Vglut2&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Vmat2&lt;/i&gt; expression was significantly increased in E2- vs. oil-treated, ovariectomized (OVX) female mice. Since 17β-estradiol (E2) is anorexigenic, we hypothesized that an underlying mechanism was enhancement of POMC signaling. Therefore, we optogenetically stimulated POMC neurons in hypothalamic slices to examine evoked release of neurotransmitters onto NPY/AgRP neurons. Using brief light pulses we primarily observed glutamatergic currents and, based on the paired pulse ratio, determined that release probability was higher in E2- vs oil-treated, OVX female, congruent with increased &lt;i&gt;Vlgut2&lt;/i&gt; expression. Moreover, bath perfusion of the Gq-coupled membrane estrogen receptor agonist STX recapitulated the effects of E2 treatment. In addition, high frequency (20 Hz) stimulation generated a slow outward current that reversed near E&lt;sub&gt;k+&lt;/sub&gt; and was antagonized by naloxone, indicative of β-endorphin release. Furthermore, individual NPY/AgRP neurons were found to express &lt;i&gt;Oprm1,&lt;/i&gt; the transcript for μ-opioid receptor, and DAMGO, a selective agonist, elicited an outward current. Therefore, POMC excitability and neurotransmission are enhanced by E2, which would facilitate decreased food consumption through marked inhibition of NPY/AgRP neurons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Proopiomelanocortin (POMC) neurons of the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus sense the energy state of an animal and regulate satiety to maintain homeostasis. Neuropeptide Y/agouti-related peptide (NPY/AgRP) neurons also participate in energy balance, but instead drive hunger. Disruptions in this circuit can promote the development of obesity, which frequently occurs during menopause due to the loss of estrogens. The primary female sex hormone, 17β-estradiol (E2) exerts an anorexigenic effect, decreasing food intake and increasing activity. These behavioral changes are mediated, in part, through inhibition of NPY/AgRP and potentiation of POMC signaling. For the first time we report that POMC neurons provide direct input to NPY/AgRP neurons primarily through glutamate and β-endorphin release. Furthermore, E2 enhances POMC neurotransmission to inhibit NPY/AgRP neurons.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>RSS PAP: Functional Connectivity of Chronic Cocaine Use Reveals Progressive Neuroadaptations in Neocortical, Striatal and Limbic Networks</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0081-18.2018v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Brain imaging studies indicate that chronic cocaine users display altered functional connectivity between prefrontal cortical, thalamic, striatal, and limbic regions; however, the use of cross-sectional designs in these studies precludes measuring baseline brain activity prior to cocaine use. Animal studies can circumvent this limitation by comparing functional connectivity between baseline and various time points after chronic cocaine use. In the present study, adult male Long-Evans rats were trained to self-administer cocaine intravenously for 6-hour daily sessions over 14 consecutive days. Two additional groups serving as controls underwent sucrose self-administration or exposure to the test chambers alone. Functional magnetic resonance imaging was conducted before self-administration and after 1 and 14 days of abstinence (1d and 14d Abs). At 1d Abs from cocaine, there was increased clustering coefficient in brain areas involved in reward seeking, learning, memory, and autonomic and affective processing, including amygdala, hypothalamus, striatum, hippocampus and thalamus. Similar changes in clustering coefficient after 1d Abs from sucrose were evident in predominantly thalamic brain regions. Notably, there were no changes in strength of functional connectivity at 1d or 14d after either cocaine or sucrose self-administration. The results suggest that cocaine and sucrose can change the arrangement of functional connectivity of brain regions involved in cognition and emotion, but that these changes dissipate across the early stages of abstinence. The study also emphasizes the importance of including baseline measures in longitudinal functional neuroimaging designs seeking to assess functional connectivity in the context of substance use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Although human neuroimaging studies have been invaluable in understanding the relationship between cocaine use and brain functional connectivity, they inherently lack pre-drug baseline information important to establish how cocaine use alters regional interactions. Coupling neuroimaging with rodent models of cocaine self-administration circumvents this issue by controlling variables that can confound human studies and providing pre-drug baseline information. Using such an approach, this study reveals that after cocaine use, functional connectivity patterns change as a function of abstinence duration and that these changes are observed in networks supporting reward and emotion-related cognition and behavior. These findings highlight the importance of using multiple timepoints in preclinical models of substance use to assess effects on functional connectivity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>RSS PAP: Estradiol Increases Glutamate and GABA Neurotransmission into GnRH Neurons via Retrograde NO-Signaling in Proestrous Mice during the Positive Estradiol Feedback Period</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0057-18.2018v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Surge release of gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) is essential in the activation of pituitary gonadal unit at proestrus afternoon preceded by the rise of serum 17β-estradiol level during positive feedback period. Here we describe a mechanism of positive estradiol feedback regulation acting directly on GnRH-GFP neurons of mice. Whole cell clamp and loose patch recordings revealed that a high physiological dose of estradiol (200 pM), significantly increased firing rate at proestrus afternoon. The mPSC frequency at proestrus afternoon also increased, whereas decreased it at metestrus afternoon, and had no effect at proestrus morning. Inhibition of the estrogen receptor beta (ERβ), intracellular blockade of the Src kinase and PI3K and scavenge of nitric oxide inside GnRH neurons prevented the facilitatory estradiol effect indicating involvement of the ERβ/Src/PI3K/Akt/nNOS pathway in this fast, direct stimulatory effect. Immunohistochemistry localized soluble guanylate cyclase, the main nitric oxide receptor, in both glutamatergic and GABAergic terminals innervating GnRH neurons. Accordingly, estradiol facilitated neurotransmissions to GnRH neurons via both GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;-R and glutamate/AMPA/kainate-R. These results indicate that estradiol acts directly on GnRH neurons via the ERβ/Akt/nNOS pathway at proestrus afternoon generating nitric oxide that retrogradely accelerates GABA and glutamate release from the presynaptic terminals contacting GnRH neurons. The newly explored mechanism might contribute to the regulation of the GnRH surge, a fundamental prerequisite of the ovulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; One of the major reasons of infertility is the failure in ovulation. Therefore, understanding of the neuronal processes resulting in proper ovulation is indispensable. Although hypothalamic GnRH neurons are regarded the master-neurons orchestrating reproduction, most of the relevant papers have suggested so far, that the estradiol positive feedback (indispensable for ovulation) acts in these neurons mostly indirectly, via hypothalamic nuclei free of GnRH neurons. Now we have presented strong evidence that estradiol exerts fast direct stimulatory action in GnRH neurons during the positive feedback, by activating retrograde nitric-oxide signaling to accelerate excitatory synaptic inputs to GnRH neurons. In addition, we suggest a putative mechanism, whereby indirect and direct actions of estradiol can work in concert regulating GnRH neurons.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>RSS PAP: Characterization of Tissue Plasminogen Activator Expression and Trafficking in the Adult Murine Brain</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0119-18.2018v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) is an immediate-early gene important for regulating physiological processes like synaptic plasticity and neurovascular coupling. It has also been implicated in several pathological processes including blood-brain barrier permeability, seizure progression, and stroke. These varied reports suggest that tPA is a pleiotropic mediator whose actions are highly compartmentalized in space and time. The specific localization of tPA, therefore, can provide useful information about its function. Accordingly, the goal of this study was to provide a detailed characterization of tPA’s regional, cellular, and subcellular localization in the brain. To achieve this, two new transgenic mouse lines were utilized: (1) a PlatβGAL reporter mouse, which houses the β-galactosidase gene in the tPA locus and (2) a tPA&lt;sup&gt;BAC&lt;/sup&gt;-Cerulean mouse, which has a cerulean-fluorescent protein fused in-frame to the tPA C-terminus. Using these two transgenic reporters, we show that while tPA is expressed throughout most regions of the adult murine brain, it appears to be preferentially targeted to fiber tracts in the limbic system. In the hippocampus, confocal microscopy revealed tPA-Cerulean (tPA-Cer) puncta localized to giant mossy fiber boutons and astrocytes in stratum lucidum. With amplification of the tPA-Cer signal, somatically localized tPA was also observed in the stratum oriens/alveus layer of both CA1 and CA3 subfields. Co-immunostaining of tPA-Cer and interneuronal markers indicates that these tPA-positive cell bodies belong to a subclass of somatostatin/oriens-lacunosum moleculare interneurons. Together, these data imply that tPA’s localization is differentially regulated, suggesting that its neuromodulatory effects may be compartmentalized and specialized to cell-type.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; The serine protease tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) has been shown to modulate numerous neurologic processes including synaptic plasticity and neurodegeneration. Many of the functional conclusions drawn about tPA activity, however, have not been affirmed by high-resolution, imaging analysis of tPA localization. To address these shortcomings, we used two new transgenic reporter mice to provide a detailed characterization of tPA expression in the adult murine brain. A comparison of these reporter mice demonstrates a differential expression pattern between the sites of tPA synthesis and its targeted localization in the hippocampus, amygdala, and basal ganglia. Moreover, colocalization and co-expression analysis reveals that tPA is primarily trafficked to pre-synaptic structures and that it’s predominant somatic and/or axonal localization is cell-type specific.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Cancerin: A computational pipeline to infer cancer-associated ceRNA interaction networks</title>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Duc Do, Serdar Bozdag&lt;/p&gt;

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) inhibit expression of target genes by binding to their RNA transcripts. It has been recently shown that RNA transcripts targeted by the same miRNA could “compete” for the miRNA molecules and thereby indirectly regulate each other. Experimental evidence has suggested that the aberration of such miRNA-mediated interaction between RNAs—called competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) interaction—can play important roles in tumorigenesis. Given the difficulty of deciphering context-specific miRNA binding, and the existence of various gene regulatory factors such as DNA methylation and copy number alteration, inferring context-specific ceRNA interactions accurately is a computationally challenging task. Here we propose a computational method called Cancerin to identify cancer-associated ceRNA interactions. Cancerin incorporates DNA methylation, copy number alteration, gene and miRNA expression datasets to construct cancer-specific ceRNA networks. We applied Cancerin to three cancer datasets from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project. Our results indicated that ceRNAs were enriched with cancer-related genes, and ceRNA modules in the inferred ceRNA networks were involved in cancer-associated biological processes. Using LINCS-L1000 shRNA-mediated gene knockdown experiment in breast cancer cell line to assess accuracy, Cancerin was able to predict expression outcome of ceRNA genes with high accuracy.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/blL43-YkQ6E&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Interaction of the human erythrocyte Band 3 anion exchanger 1 (AE1, SLC4A1) with lipids and glycophorin A: Molecular organization of the Wright (Wr) blood group antigen</title>

The Band 3 (AE1, SLC4A1) membrane protein is found in red blood cells and in kidney where it functions as an electro-neutral chloride/bicarbonate exchanger. In this study, we have used molecular dynamics simulations to provide the first realistic model of the dimeric membrane domain of human Band 3 in an asymmetric lipid bilayer containing a full complement of phospholipids, including phosphatidylinositol 4,5–bisphosphate (PIP&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and cholesterol, and its partner membrane protein Glycophorin A (GPA). The simulations show that the annular layer in the inner leaflet surrounding Band 3 was enriched in phosphatidylserine and PIP&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; molecules. Cholesterol was also enriched around Band 3 but also at the dimer interface. The interaction of these lipids with specific sites on Band 3 may play a role in the folding and function of this anion transport membrane protein. GPA associates with Band 3 to form the Wright (Wr) blood group antigen, an interaction that involves an ionic bond between Glu658 in Band 3 and Arg61 in GPA. We were able to recreate this complex by performing simulations to allow the dimeric transmembrane portion of GPA to interact with Band 3 in a model membrane. Large-scale simulations showed that the GPA dimer can bridge Band 3 dimers resulting in the dynamic formation of long strands of alternating Band 3 and GPA dimers.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Kfh8ScEBncs&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>RSS PAP: Quantification of Total and Mutant Huntingtin Protein Levels in Biospecimens Using a Novel alphaLISA Assay</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0234-18.2018v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;The neurodegenerative Huntington’s disease (HD) is caused by a polyglutamine (polyQ) amplification in the huntingtin protein (HTT). Currently there is no effective therapy available for HD; however, several efforts are directed to develop and optimize HTT lowering methods to improve HD phenotypes. To validate these approaches, there is an immediate need for reliable, sensitive and easily accessible methods to quantify HTT expression. Using the AlphaLISA platform we developed two novel sensitive and robust assays for quantification of HTT in biological samples using commercially available antibodies. The first, a polyQ independent assay, measures the total pool of HTT; whilst the second, a polyQ dependent assay, preferentially detects the mutant form of HTT. Using purified HTT protein standards and brain homogenates from an HD mouse model, we determine a lower limit of quantification of 1 and 3 pM and optimal reproducibility with CV values lower than 7% for intra- and 20% for inter-assay. In addition, we used the assays to quantify HTT in neural stem cells generated from patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; and in human brain tissue lysates. Finally, we could detect changes in HTT levels in a mouse model where mutant HTT was conditionally deleted in neural tissue, verifying the potential to monitor the outcome of HTT lowering strategies. This analytical platform is ideal for high-throughput screens and thus has an added value for the HD community as a tool to optimize novel therapeutic approaches aimed at modulating HTT protein levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; The HTT lowering approaches are widely investigated as possible therapies for HD. to support these strategies, there is a high need for reproducible and sensitive assays able to quantify HTT protein. In this study we describe two robust and sensitive assays based on the AlphaLISA platform, which are able to measure either the pool of wild-type and mutant HTT, polyQ independent assay, or preferentially mutant HTT, polyQ dependent assay, in biological samples. These assays constitute a very valuable tool for HD research as they apply readily accessible antibodies and have a simple implementation. Furthermore, the HTT AlphaLISA assays are suitable for use in high throughput studies and potentially could be multiplexed to monitor simultaneously different forms of HTT.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>RSS PAP: Individual Differences in Motor Noise and Adaptation Rate Are Optimally Related</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0170-18.2018v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Individual variations in motor adaptation rate were recently shown to correlate with movement variability or &quot;motor noise&quot; in a forcefield adaptation task. However, this finding could not be replicated in a meta-analysis of adaptation experiments. Possibly, this inconsistency stems from noise being composed of distinct components which relate to adaptation rate in different ways. Indeed, previous modeling and electrophysiological studies have suggested that motor noise can be factored into planning noise, originating from the brain, and execution noise, stemming from the periphery. Were the motor system optimally tuned to these noise sources, planning noise would correlate positively with adaptation rate and execution noise would correlate negatively with adaptation rate, a phenomenon familiar in Kalman filters. To test this prediction, we performed a visuomotor adaptation experiment in 69 subjects. Using a novel Bayesian fitting procedure, we succeeded in applying the well-established state-space model of adaptation to individual data. We found that adaptation rate correlates positively with planning noise (&lt;i&gt;β&lt;/i&gt;  =  0.44; 95%HDI=[0.27 0.59]) and negatively with execution noise (&lt;i&gt;β&lt;/i&gt; = -0.39; 95%HDI=[-0.50 -0.30]). In addition, the steady-state Kalman gain calculated from planning and execution noise correlated positively with adaptation rate (&lt;i&gt;r&lt;/i&gt; = 0.54; 95%HDI = [0.38 0.66]). These results suggest that motor adaptation is tuned to approximate optimal learning, consistent with the &quot;optimal control&quot; framework that has been used to explain motor control. Since motor adaptation is thought to be a largely cerebellar process, the results further suggest the sensitivity of the cerebellum to both planning noise and execution noise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Our study shows that the adaptation rate is optimally tuned to planning noise and execution noise across individuals. This suggests that motor adaptation is tuned to approximate optimal learning, consistent with &quot;optimal control&quot; approaches to understanding the motor system. In addition, our results imply sensitivity of the cerebellum to both planning noise and execution noise, an idea not previously considered. Finally, our Bayesian statistical approach represents a powerful, novel method for fitting the well-established state-space models that could have an influence on the methodology of the field.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

To study synaptic plasticity in human neuronal circuits poses a huge challenge, since live human neurons and synapses are not readily accessible. Despite this, various lines of research have provided insights in properties of adult human synapses and their plasticity both &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt;, with some unexpected surprises. We first discuss the experimental approaches to study activity-dependent plasticity of adult human synapses, and then highlight rules and mechanisms of Hebbian spike timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) found in these synapses. Finally, we conclude with thoughts on how these synaptic principles can underlie human learning and memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>RSS PAP: Selective Effects of the Loss of NMDA or mGluR5 Receptors in the Reward System on Adaptive Decision-Making</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0331-18.2018v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Selecting the most advantageous actions in a changing environment is a central feature of adaptive behavior. The midbrain dopamine (DA) neurons along with the major targets of their projections, including dopaminoceptive neurons in the frontal cortex and basal ganglia, play a key role in this process. Here, we investigate the consequences of a selective genetic disruption of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) and metabotropic glutamate 5 (mGluR5) receptors in the DA system on adaptive choice behavior, in mice. We tested the effects of the mutation on performance in the probabilistic reinforcement learning and probability discounting tasks. In case of the probabilistic choice, both the loss of NMDA receptors in dopaminergic neurons or loss mGluR5 receptors in D1 receptor-expressing dopaminoceptive neurons reduced the probability of selecting the more rewarded alternative and lowered the likelihood of returning to the previously rewarded alternative (win-stay). When observed behavior was fitted to reinforcement learning models, we found that these two mutations were associated with reduced effect of expected outcome on choice, i.e. more random choices. None of the mutations affected probability discounting, which indicates that all animals had normal ability to assess probability. However, in both behavioral tasks animals with targeted loss of NMDA receptors in dopaminergic neurons or mGluR5 receptors in D1 neurons were significantly slower to perform choices. In conclusion, these results show that glutamate receptor-dependent signaling in the DA system is essential for the speed and accuracy of choices, but at the same time probably not critical for correct estimation of probable outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; We investigated the role of glutamate signaling in the brain’s reward system in adaptive decision-making. We used genetically modified mice with disruption of glutamate signaling, that was caused by deletion of glutamate receptors in dopamine-producing and dopamine-sensitive neurons. When mutant mice were offered a choice between two alternatives with varying chances of being rewarded, the mutations decreased the probability of selecting the more often rewarded alternative, and the likelihood of repeating previously rewarded choice. Moreover, mutant animals were much slower in performing choices. Our results show that when glutamate signaling in the reward system is disrupted, it causes an impairment in decision-making, by increasing randomness and reducing the speed of decision-making process.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>RSS PAP: Conflicted between Goal-Directed and Habitual Control - an fMRI Investigation</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0240-18.2018v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;&quot;Slips of action&quot; occur in everyday life when we momentarily lose sight of a goal (for example when in a rush or distracted). Associative models propose that these habitual responses can be activated via a direct stimulus-response mechanism, regardless of the current hedonic value of the outcome. The slips-of-action task (SOAT) has been extensively used in both healthy and pathological populations to measure habit tendencies – the likelihood of making erroneous responses for devalued outcomes. Inspection of behavioral performance does not reveal, however, whether the impairments were due to impaired goal-directed control or aberrantly strong habit formation. In the current study we used functional MRI while human participants performed both the instrumental training and SOAT test phases, to elucidate the relative contributions of these mechanisms to performance on the SOAT. On trials in which conflict arises between competing goal-directed and habitual responses we observed increased activation across areas including the anterior cingulate cortex, paracingulate gyrus, lateral OFC, insula and inferior frontal gyrus. Responding for devalued outcomes was related to increased activation in the premotor cortex and cerebellum – implicating these regions in habitual responding. Increased activation in the caudate, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and frontal pole during training was associated with better performance during the test phase, indicative of goal-directed action control. These results endorse interpretation of the SOAT in terms of competing goal-directed and habitual mechanisms and highlight that cognitive control processes present an additional bottleneck for successful performance on this task.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Imagine that you step in the car intending to drive to your new office but distracted, end up driving the route to your old office instead. We are all familiar with the feeling that results from inadvertently carrying out a previously valid behavior, even if we no longer desire the consequence. In the current study we examined how the brain reacts to cues that signal a previously rewarded response whose outcome value has now changed. We were also able to identify the brain regions that were activated when participants made an erroneous (habitual) response under time-pressure. These results give us a richer sense of how the brain acts to control behavior when goal-directed processes are otherwise engaged.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Sequential sampling models have provided a dominant theoretical framework guiding computational and neurophysiological investigations of perceptual decision-making. While these models share the basic principle that decisions are formed by accumulating sensory evidence to a bound, they come in many forms that can make similar predictions of choice behaviour despite invoking fundamentally different mechanisms. The identification of neural signals that reflect some of the core computations underpinning decision formation offers new avenues for empirically testing and refining key model assumptions.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>The central nervous system is not a static, hard-wired organ. Examples of neuroplasticity, whether at the level of the synapse, the cell, or within and between circuits, can be found during development, throughout the progression of disease, or after injury. One essential component of the molecular, anatomical, and functional changes associated with neuroplasticity is the spinal interneuron (SpIN). Here, we draw on recent multidisciplinary studies to identify and interrogate subsets of SpINs and their roles in locomotor and respiratory circuits.</content:encoded>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Synaptic Mechanisms for Bandwidth Tuning in Awake Mouse Primary Auditory Cortex</title>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy165/5052731?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Spatial size tuning in the visual cortex has been considered as an important neuronal functional property for sensory perception. However, an analogous mechanism in the auditory system has remained controversial. In the present study, cell-attached recordings in the primary auditory cortex (A1) of awake mice revealed that excitatory neurons can be categorized into three types according to their bandwidth tuning profiles in response to band-passed noise (BPN) stimuli: nonmonotonic (NM), flat, and monotonic, with the latter two considered as non-tuned for bandwidth. The prevalence of bandwidth-tuned (i.e., NM) neurons increases significantly from layer 4 to layer 2/3. With sequential cell-attached and whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings from the same neurons, we found that the bandwidth preference of excitatory neurons is largely determined by the excitatory synaptic input they receive, and that the bandwidth selectivity is further enhanced by flatly tuned inhibition observed in all cells. The latter can be attributed at least partially to the flat tuning of parvalbumin inhibitory neurons. The tuning of auditory cortical neurons for bandwidth of BPN may contribute to the processing of complex sounds.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Heritability of Regional Brain Volumes in Large-Scale Neuroimaging and Genetic Studies</title>

	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Brain genetics is an active research area. The degree to which genetic variants impact variations in brain structure and function remains largely unknown. We examined the heritability of regional brain volumes (&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;P&lt;/span&gt; ~ 100) captured by single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in UK Biobank (&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;n&lt;/span&gt; ~ 9000). We found that regional brain volumes are highly heritable in this study population and common genetic variants can explain up to 80% of their variabilities (median heritability 34.8%). We observed omnigenic impact across the genome and examined the enrichment of SNPs in active chromatin regions. Principal components derived from regional volume data are also highly heritable, but the amount of variance in brain volume explained by the component did not seem to be related to its heritability. Heritability estimates vary substantially across large-scale functional networks, exhibit a symmetric pattern across left and right hemispheres, and are consistent in females and males (correlation = 0.638). We repeated the main analysis in Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;n&lt;/span&gt; ~ 1100), Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort (&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;n&lt;/span&gt; ~ 600), and Pediatric Imaging, Neurocognition, and Genetics (&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;n&lt;/span&gt; ~ 500) datasets, which demonstrated that more stable estimates can be obtained from the UK Biobank.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Audio-Tactile and Peripersonal Space Processing Around the Trunk in Human Parietal and Temporal Cortex: An Intracranial EEG Study</title>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy156/5052728?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Interactions with the environment happen within one’s peripersonal space (PPS)—the space surrounding the body. Studies in monkeys and humans have highlighted a multisensory distributed cortical network representing the PPS. However, knowledge about the temporal dynamics of PPS processing around the trunk is lacking. Here, we recorded intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) in humans while administering tactile stimulation (T), approaching auditory stimuli (A), and the 2 combined (AT). To map PPS, tactile stimulation was delivered when the sound was far, intermediate, or close to the body. The 19% of the electrodes showed AT multisensory integration. Among those, 30% showed a PPS effect, a modulation of the response as a function of the distance between the sound and body. AT multisensory integration and PPS effects had similar spatiotemporal characteristics, with an early response (~50 ms) in the insular cortex, and later responses (~200 ms) in precentral and postcentral gyri. Superior temporal cortex showed a different response pattern with AT multisensory integration at ~100 ms without a PPS effect. These results, represent the first iEEG delineation of PPS processing in humans and show that PPS and multisensory integration happen at similar neural sites and time periods, suggesting that PPS representation is based on a spatial modulation of multisensory integration.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

This process, called arealization, depends on the graded expression of transcription factors in neocortical progenitors and postmitotic neurons prenatally, and on external activity-dependent cues driven by thalamocortical axons during postnatal stages. Thalamic inputs are guided within an intrinsically determined genetic framework to selectively target and innervate layer 4 (L4) cortical neurons in a somatotopic manner. L4 spiny stellate neurons are excitatory locally projecting neurons, which undergo a drastic dendrite remodeling during the first postnatal week and represent the principal sensory gateway to the neocortex. In this review, we will discuss the way intrinsic cortical gene regulation and extrinsic activity-dependent inputs instruct the cellular reorganization of L4 spiny stellate neurons, necessary for proper formation of the barrel cortex during the development of primary somatosensory maps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded>
