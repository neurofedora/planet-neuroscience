	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Expectation Learning for Adaptive Crossmodal Stimuli Association. (arXiv:1801.07654v1 [cs.LG])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1801.07654</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The human brain is able to learn, generalize, and predict crossmodal stimuli.
Learning by expectation fine-tunes crossmodal processing at different levels,
thus enhancing our power of generalization and adaptation in highly dynamic
environments. In this paper, we propose a deep neural architecture trained by
using expectation learning accounting for unsupervised learning tasks. Our
learning model exhibits a self-adaptable behavior, setting the first steps
towards the development of deep learning architectures for crossmodal stimuli
association.

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Presynaptic GABAA Receptors Modulate Thalamocortical Inputs in Layer 4 of Rat V1</title>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhx364/4823223?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Fast inhibitory GABAergic transmission plays a fundamental role in neural circuits. Current theories of cortical function assume that fast GABAergic inhibition acts via GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptors on postsynaptic neurons, while presynaptic effects of GABA depend on GABA&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; receptor activation. Manipulations of GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptor activity in vivo produced different effects on cortical function, which were generally ascribed to the mode of action of a drug, more than its site of action. Here we show that in rodent primary visual cortex, α4-containing GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptors can be located on subsets of glutamatergic and GABAergic presynaptic terminals and decrease synaptic transmission. Our data provide a novel mechanistic insight into the effects of changes in cortical inhibition; the ability to modulate inputs onto cortical circuits locally, via presynaptic regulation of release by GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptors.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Cortical Responses to Input From Distant Areas are Modulated by Local Spontaneous Alpha/Beta Oscillations</title>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhx361/4823221?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Any given area in human cortex may receive input from multiple, functionally heterogeneous areas, potentially representing different processing threads. Alpha (8–13 Hz) and beta oscillations (13–20 Hz) have been hypothesized by other investigators to gate local cortical processing, but their influence on cortical responses to input from other cortical areas is unknown. To study this, we measured the effect of local oscillatory power and phase on cortical responses elicited by single-pulse electrical stimulation (SPES) at distant cortical sites, in awake human subjects implanted with intracranial electrodes for epilepsy surgery. In 4 out of 5 subjects, the amplitudes of corticocortical evoked potentials (CCEPs) elicited by distant SPES were reproducibly modulated by the power, but not the phase, of local oscillations in alpha and beta frequencies. Specifically, CCEP amplitudes were higher when average oscillatory power just before distant SPES (−110 to −10 ms) was high. This effect was observed in only a subset (0–33%) of sites with CCEPs and, like the CCEPs themselves, varied with stimulation at different distant sites. Our results suggest that although alpha and beta oscillations may gate local processing, they may also enhance the responsiveness of cortex to input from distant cortical sites.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Physiological and Anatomical Outputs of Rat Genital Cortex</title>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhx359/4823220?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Rat somatosensory genital cortex contains a large sexually monomorphic representation of the penis in males and the clitoris in females. Genital cortex microstimulation-evoked movements of legs, trunk and genitals, which showed sex-specific differences related to mating behaviors and included thrusting in males and lordosis-like movements in females. Erections/tumescence of penis or clitoris could not be evoked, however. Anterograde tracer injections into penis/clitoris cortex revealed eleven corticocortical and 10 subcortical projection targets, which were qualitatively similar in both sexes. Corticocortical genital-cortex-projections innervated about 3% of the cortical surface and most were analog to other somatosensory projections targeting motor cortex, secondary somatosensory cortex, parietal cortex and perirhinal cortex. Corticocortical projections that differed from other parts of somatosensory cortex targeted male scrotum cortex, female vulva cortex, the somatosensory–ear–auditory-cortex-region and the caudal parietal area. Aligning cytoarchitectonic borders with motor topography, sensory genital responses and corticocortical projections identified a candidate region for genital motor cortex. Most subcortical genital-cortex-projections were analog to other thalamic, tectal or pontine projections of somatosensory cortex. Genital-cortex-specific subcortical projections targeted amygdala and nucleus submedius and accumbens. Microstimulation-effects and projections support a sexual function of genital cortex and suggest that genital cortex is a major hub of sexual sensorimotor processing in rodents.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Intertemporal choice requires a dynamic interaction between valuation and deliberation processes. While evidence identifying candidate brain areas for each of these processes is well established, the precise mechanistic role carried out by each brain region is still debated. In this article, we present a computational model that clarifies the unique contribution of frontoparietal cortex regions to intertemporal decision making. The model we develop samples reward and delay information stochastically on a moment-by-moment basis. As preference for the choice alternatives evolves, dynamic inhibitory processes are executed by way of asymmetric lateral inhibition. We find that it is these lateral inhibition processes that best explain the contribution of frontoparietal regions to intertemporal decision making exhibited in our data.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: A Brief History of the Encoding of Hand Position by the Cerebral Cortex: Implications for Motor Control and Cognition</title>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhx354/4823218?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Encoding hand position by the cerebral cortex is essential not only for the neural representation of the body image but also for different actions based on eye–hand coordination. These include reaching for visual objects as well as complex movement sequences, such as tea-making, tool use, and object construction, among many others. All these functions depend on a continuous refreshing of the hand position representation, relying on both predictive signaling and afferent information. The hand position influence on neural activity in the parietofrontal system, together with eye position signals, are the basic elements of an eye–hand matrix from which all the above functions can emerge and could be regarded as key features of a network with several entry points, command nodes and outflow pathways, as confirmed by the discovery of a direct parietospinal projection for the control of hand action. The integrity of this system is crucial for daily life, as testified by the consequences of cortical lesions, spanning from severe paralysis to complex forms of apraxia. In this review, I will sketch my personal understanding of the scientific and conceptual trajectory of a line of investigation with many unexpected influences on cortical function and disease, from motor behavior to cognition.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Fear Extinction Recall Modulates Human Frontomedial Theta and Amygdala Activity</title>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhx353/4823217?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Human functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and electroencephalography (EEG) studies, as well as animal studies, indicate that the amygdala and frontomedial brain regions are critically involved in conditioned fear and that frontomedial oscillations in the theta range (4–8 Hz) may support communication between these brain regions. However, few studies have used a multimodal approach to probe interactions among these key regions in humans. Here, our goal was to bridge the gap between prior human fMRI, EEG, and animal findings. Using simultaneous EEG–fMRI recordings 24 h after fear conditioning and extinction, conditioned stimuli presented (CS+E, CS−E) and not presented during extinction (CS+N, CS−N) were compared to identify effects specific to extinction versus fear recall. Differential (CS+ vs. CS−) electrodermal, frontomedial theta (EEG) and amygdala responses (fMRI) were reduced for extinguished versus nonextinguished stimuli. Importantly, effects on theta power covaried with effects on amygdala activation. Fear and extinction recall as indicated by theta explained 60% of the variance for the analogous effect in the right amygdala. Our findings show for the first time the interplay of amygdala and frontomedial theta activity during fear and extinction recall in humans and provide insight into neural circuits consistently linked with top-down amygdala modulation in rodents.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Roman Goulard, Jean-Louis Vercher, Stéphane Viollet&lt;/p&gt;

To avoid crashing onto the floor, a free falling fly needs to trigger its wingbeats quickly and control the orientation of its thrust accurately and swiftly to stabilize its pitch and hence its speed. Behavioural data have suggested that the vertical optic flow produced by the fall and crossing the visual field plays a key role in this anti-crash response. Free fall behavior analyses have also suggested that flying insect may not rely on graviception to stabilize their flight. Based on these two assumptions, we have developed a model which accounts for hoverflies´ position and pitch orientation recorded in 3D with a fast stereo camera during experimental free falls. Our dynamic model shows that optic flow-based control combined with closed-loop control of the pitch suffice to stabilize the flight properly. In addition, our model sheds a new light on the visual-based feedback control of fly´s pitch, lift and thrust. Since graviceptive cues are possibly not used by flying insects, the use of a vertical reference to control the pitch is discussed, based on the results obtained on a complete dynamic model of a virtual fly falling in a textured corridor. This model would provide a useful tool for understanding more clearly how insects may or not estimate their absolute attitude.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/4F046xHmM_I&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Diagnostic criteria for disorders of arousal: A video-polysomnography assessment</title>
	<link>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25153</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h3&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Study objectives:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;To assess video-polysomnographic (vPSG) criteria and their cut-off values for the diagnosis of disorders of arousal (DOA; sleepwalking, sleep terror).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;One hundred and sixty adult patients with DOA and 50 sex- and age-matched healthy participants underwent a clinical evaluation and vPSG assessment to quantify slow wave sleep (SWS) interruptions (SWS fragmentation index; slow/mixed and fast arousal ratios and indexes per hour) and the associated behaviors. First, a case-control analysis was performed in 100 patients and the 50 controls to define the optimal cut-off values using receiver operating characteristic curves. Their sensitivity was then assessed in the other 60 patients with DOA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The SWS fragmentation index and the mixed, slow, slow/mixed arousal indexes and ratios were higher in patients with DOA than controls. The highest area under the curve (AUC) values were obtained for the SWS fragmentation and slow/mixed arousal indexes (AUC = 0.88 and 0.90, respectively). The SWS fragmentation index cut-off value of 6.8/h reached a sensitivity of 79% and a specificity of 82%. The slow/mixed arousal index had a sensitivity of 94% for the 2.5/h cut-off, and 100% specificity for 6/h. Both parameters showed good inter-rater agreement, and their sensitivities were confirmed in the second group of patients. Combining EEG parameters and video-based behavioral analyses increased the correct classification rate up to 91.3%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Frequent slow/mixed arousals in SWS and complex behaviors during vPSG are strongly associated with DOA, and could be promising biomarkers for the diagnosis of non-REM parasomnias.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: A Mendelian form of neural tube defect caused by a de novo null variant in SMARCC1 in an identical twin</title>
	<link>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25152</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h3&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neural tube defects (NTD) are among the most common birth defects in humans and yet their molecular etiology remains poorly understood. NTD are believed to result from the complex interaction of environmental factors with a multitude of genetic risk factors in a classical multifactorial disease model. Mendelian forms of NTD in which single variants are sufficient to cause the disease are extremely rare. We report a monozygotic twin with severe NTD (occipital encephalocele and myelomeningocele) and a shared &lt;em&gt;de novo&lt;/em&gt; likely truncating variant in &lt;em&gt;SMARCC1&lt;/em&gt;. RTPCR analysis suggests the potential null nature of the variant due to NMD. &lt;em&gt;SMARCC1&lt;/em&gt; is extremely constrained in humans and encodes a highly conserved core chromatin remodeler BAF155. Mice that are heterozygous for a null allele or homozygous for a hypomorphic allele develop severe NTD in the form of exencephaly. This is the first report of &lt;em&gt;SMARCC1&lt;/em&gt; mutation in humans and it shows a critical and conserved requirement for intact BAF chromatin remodeling complex in neurulation.

Extensive works during the past decade yield ample insights into the molecular and cellular functions of MeCP2 in neural development. Furthermore, genetic manipulations in Mecp2 mouse models strongly suggested that deficiency in synaptic plasticity and various behaviors of Mecp2 null or transgenic mice could be rescued in adulthood. Further studies elucidating neural circuits responsible for symptoms in MECP2-associated disorders in rodent and non-human primate models will shed light on the development of potential therapeutic interventions. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content:encoded>

Clinical and animal model studies have shown that changes in PFC excitation and inhibition are important for cognitive functions as well as related disorders. Here, we discuss recent findings revealing the roles of the excitatory and inhibitory synaptic proteins neuroligin 1 (NLGN1) and NLGN2 in the PFC in memory formation and modulation of memory strength. We propose that shifts in NLGN1 and NLGN2 expression in specific excitatory and inhibitory neuronal subpopulations in response to experience regulate the dynamic processes of memory consolidation and strengthening. Because excitatory/inhibitory imbalances accompany neuropsychiatric disorders in which strength and flexibility of representations play important roles, understanding these mechanisms may suggest novel therapies. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content:encoded>

These limitations reflect what has been dichotomy between the structure and mechanical properties of living brain tissue and non-living neural probes. To bridge the gap between neural and electronic networks, we have introduced the new concept of mesh electronics probes designed with structural and mechanical properties such that the implant begins to ‘look and behave’ like neural tissue. Syringe-implanted mesh electronics have led to the realization of probes that are neuro-attractive and free of the chronic immune response, as well as capable of stable long-term mapping and modulation of brain activity at the single-neuron level. This review provides a historical overview of a 10-year development of mesh electronics by highlighting the tissue-like design, syringe-assisted delivery, seamless neural tissue integration, and single-neuron level chronic recording stability of mesh electronics. We also offer insights on unique near-term opportunities and future directions for neuroscience and neurology that now are available or expected for mesh electronics neurotechnologies. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content:encoded>

Human neuroimaging studies consistently show a hunger-dependent, selective enhancement of responses to images of food in association cortex and amygdala. More recently, cellular-resolution imaging combined with circuit mapping experiments in behaving mice have revealed underlying neuronal population dynamics and enabled tracing of pathways by which hunger circuits influence the assignment of value to visual objects in visual association cortex, insular cortex, and amygdala. These experiments begin to provide a mechanistic understanding of motivation-specific neural processing of need-relevant cues in healthy humans and in disease states such as obesity and other eating disorders. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content:encoded>

Since the earliest days of embryology, lineage questions have been addressed with methods of increasing specificity, capacity, and resolution. Yet, a full realization of individual cell lineages remains challenging for complex systems. A recent explosion of technical advances in genome-editing and single-cell sequencing has enabled lineage analysis in an unprecedented scale, speed, and depth across different species. In this review, we discuss the application of available as well as future genetic labeling techniques for tracking neural lineages in vivo in the mammalian nervous system. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content:encoded>

During development, individual gene activity can dynamically engage different signaling networks; thus genetic mutations can lead to different functional changes at different times. Interpretation of phenotypes can be further complicated if initial functional changes trigger compensatory mechanisms. Examining genetic mouse models of neurodevelopmental disorders reveals cellular phenotypes that change over the course of development and exist long before behavioral deficits are assessed. Correspondingly, earlier genetic interventions in these disorder models have often been more effective at improving behavioral deficits than late interventions. The restricted period of effective intervention demonstrates that identifying a target window is an essential component of treatment. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content:encoded>

During the first three weeks of postnatal development, immature astrocytes express mGlu5 and expands several fold while undergoing a transition towards their mature phase. Although mGlu5-mediated signalling in astrocyte functions has been extensively studied in the last decades, whether this signalling is implicated in the mechanisms governing their development, as well as the effects of dysregulated astrocytic development on neurodevelopmental disorders, are still unclear. The aim of this review is to examine what is known about the mGlu5-mediated signalling in the developing astrocytes and its possible contribution to the pathophysiology of autism spectrum disorders. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content:encoded>

This neural activity reflects internal processes by which the brain plans and executes volitional movements. The study of motor planning offers an opportunity to understand how the structure and dynamics of neural circuits support persistent internal states and how these states influence behavior. Recent advances in large-scale neural recordings are beginning to decipher the relationship of the dynamics of populations of neurons during motor planning and movements. New behavioral tasks in rodents, together with quantified perturbations, link dynamics in specific nodes of neural circuits to behavior. These studies reveal a neural network distributed across multiple brain regions that collectively supports motor planning. We review recent advances and highlight areas where further work is needed to achieve a deeper understanding of the mechanisms underlying motor planning and related cognitive processes. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content:encoded>

In this review, we discuss recent work on two of the circuit elements, which are thought to be fundamental for a wide range of non-sensorimotor behaviors: The role for cerebellar granule cells in multimodal integration in the cerebellar cortex and the long-range connectivity between the deep cerebellar nuclei and the basal ganglia. Lastly, we discuss how studies on synapses and circuits of the cerebellum in rodent models of autism-spectrum disorders might contribute to our understanding of the pathophysiology of this class of neurodevelopmental disorders. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content:encoded>

Studies have found that sensory, prefrontal, hippocampal, cerebellar, and striatal regions, as well as the circuits that connect them, are perturbed in mouse models of ASD and ID. Dissecting the disruptions in morphology and activity in these neural circuits might help us to understand the shared risk between the two disorders as well as their clinical heterogeneity. Treatments that target the balance between excitation and inhibition in these regions are able to reverse pathological phenotypes, elucidating this deficit as a commonality across models and opening new avenues for intervention. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content:encoded>

Neuroscience studies that exploit the unique features of these technologies enable insights into neural function through targeted stimulation, inhibition and recording, with spatially and genetically precise manipulation of neural circuit activity.

Individual network components in the mushroom bodies of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster represent cues, learning signals and behavioral outcomes of learned experience. Recent findings have highlighted the importance of dopamine-driven plasticity and activity in feedback and feedforward connections, between various elements of the mushroom body neural network. These computational motifs have been shown to be crucial for long term olfactory memory consolidation, integration of internal states, re-evaluation and updating of learned information. The often recurrent circuit anatomy and a prolonged requirement for activity in parts of these underlying networks, suggest that self-sustained and precisely timed activity is a fundamental feature of network computations in the insect brain. Together these processes allow flies to continuously adjust the content of their learned knowledge and direct their behavior in a way that best represents learned expectations and serves their most pressing current needs. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content:encoded>

Numerous genes in the endo-lysosomal pathways have been found to associate with neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Mutations of these genes lead to dysfunction in multiple steps of the endo-lysosomal network: autophagy, endocytic trafficking and lysosomal degradation, resulting in accumulation of pathogenic proteins. Although the exact pathogenic mechanism varies for different disease-associated genes, dysfunction of the endo-lysosomal pathways represents a converging mechanism shared by these diseases. Therefore, strategies that correct or compensate for endo-lysosomal dysfunction may be promising therapeutic approaches to treat neurodegenerative diseases. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content:encoded>

These devices, usually sensing cell activity via microelectrodes, should be characterized by safe working conditions in the biological milieu together with a well-controlled operation-life. The stable device/neuronal electrical coupling at the interface requires tight interactions between the electrode surface and the cell membrane. This neuro-electrode hybrid represents the hyphen between the soft nature of neural tissue, generating electrical signals via ion motions, and the rigid realm of microelectronics and medical devices, dealing with electrons in motion. Efficient integration of these entities is essential for monitoring, analyzing and controlling neuronal signaling but poses significant technological challenges. Improving the cell/electrode interaction and thus the interface performance requires novel engineering of (nano)materials: tuning at the nanoscale electrode's properties may lead to engineer interfacing probes that better camouflaged with their biological target. In this brief review, we highlight the most recent concepts in nanotechnologies and nanomaterials that might help reducing the mismatch between tissue and electrode, focusing on the device's mechanical properties and its biological integration with the tissue. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content:encoded>

Activation of excitatory glutamatergic synapses leads to their shuttling from the synapse to the nucleus, mostly importin-mediated, and subsequent regulation of gene transcription needed for long lasting modifications of synaptic function. Accordingly, increasing evidences show that alterations of the activity of synaptonuclear messengers are correlated to synaptic failure as observed in different synaptopathies. Specifically, recent studies demonstrate that the modulation of the activity of synaptonuclear messengers could represent a novel molecular target in the pathogenesis of both neurodevelopmental disorders and neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content:encoded>

negative electrical brain potential, the Bereitschaftspotential (BP), that can

well-controlled laboratory conditions. It is thus not known if this form of
brain activity also underlies motor initiation in possible life-threatening

extraordinary willpower. Here, we report BP before self-initiated 192-meter
extreme bungee jumping across two semi-professional cliff divers (both male,

comparable to that recorded under laboratory conditions. These results,

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/252593v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Understanding heterogeneity in neural phenotypes is an important goal on the path to precision medicine for autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Age is a critically important variable in normal structural brain development and examining structural features with respect to age-related norms could help to explain ASD heterogeneity in neural phenotypes. Here we examined how cortical thickness (CT) in ASD can be parameterized as an individualized metric of deviance relative to typically-developing (TD) age-related norms. Across a large sample (n=942 per group) and wide age range (5-40 years), we applied a normative modelling approach that provides individualized whole-brain maps of age-related CT deviance in ASD. This approach isolates a highly age-deviant CT subtype with a median prevalence of 7.6% across all brain regions and prevalence within specific regions that can be greater than 10%. Individuals in this ASD subtype are statistical outliers in case-control models and this small subset of individuals drives a large majority of small effect results from case-control comparisons. Testing age-normed CT scores also highlights on-average differentiation and associations with behavioural symptomatology that is separate from insights gleaned from traditional case-control approaches. This work showcases a novel individualized approach for understanding ASD heterogeneity that could further prioritize work on a subset of individuals with significant cortical pathophysiology represented in age-related CT deviance.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/252536v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Our sensorimotor system estimates stiffness to form stiffness perception, such as for choosing a ripe fruit, and to generate actions, such as to adjust grip force to avoid slippage of a scalpel during surgery. We examined how temporal manipulation of the haptic and visual feedback affect stiffness perception and grip force adjustment during a stiffness discrimination task. We used delayed force feedback and delayed visual feedback to break the natural relations between these modalities when participants tried to choose the harder spring between pairs of springs. We found that visual delay caused participants to slightly overestimate stiffness while force feedback delay caused a mixed effect on perception; for some it caused underestimation and for some overestimation of stiffness. Interestingly and in contrast to previous findings without vision, we found that participants increased the magnitude of their applied grip force for all conditions. We propose a model that suggests that this increase was a result of coupling the grip force adjustment to their proprioceptive hand position, which was the only modality which we could not delay. Our findings shed light on how the sensorimotor system combines information from different sensory modalities for perception and action. These results are important for the design of improved teleoperation systems that suffer from unavoidable delays.</content:encoded>

Here, we found that mice lacking SALM1/LRFN2 (Lrfn2-/- mice) show a normal density of excitatory synapses but altered excitatory synaptic function, including enhanced NMDAR-dependent synaptic transmission but suppressed NMDAR-dependent synaptic plasticity in the hippocampal CA1 region. Unexpectedly, SALM1 expression is detected in both glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons, and Lrfn2-/- CA1 pyramidal neurons show decreases in the density of inhibitory synapses and frequency of spontaneous inhibitory synaptic transmission. Behaviorally, ultrasonic vocalization was suppressed in Lrfn2-/- pups separated from their mothers, and acoustic startle was enhanced, but locomotion, anxiety-like behavior, social interaction, repetitive behaviors, and learning and memory were largely normal in adult Lrfn2-/- mice. These results suggest that SALM1/LRFN2 regulates excitatory synapse function, inhibitory synapse development, and social communication and startle behaviors in mice.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>The role of phosphorylation of the -opioid receptor (MOR) in desensitization, internalization and long-term tolerance was examined in locus coeruleus (LC) neurons. Viral expression of wild type (exWT) and mutant MORs, where all phosphorylation sites on the C-terminus (Total Phosphorylation Deficient (TPD)) were mutated to alanine, were examined in a MOR knockout rat. Both expressed receptors acutely activate potassium conductance similar to endogenous receptors in wild type animals. The exWT receptors, like endogenous receptors, displayed signs of tolerance after chronic morphine treatment. There was however a loss of agonist-induced desensitization and internalization in experiments with the TPD receptors. In addition the development of tolerance was not observed in the TPD receptors following chronic morphine treatment. The results indicate a key role of C-terminal phosphorylation in the expression of acute desensitization, trafficking and long-term tolerance to morphine.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/252338v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>The characterization of brain subnetwork segregation and integration has previously focused on changes that are detectable at the level of entire sessions or epochs of imaging data. In this study, we applied time-varying functional connectivity analysis together with temporal network theory to calculate point-by-point estimates in subnetwork segregation and integration during an epoch-based (2-back, 0-back, baseline) working memory fMRI experiment as well as during resting-state. This approach allowed us to follow task-related changes in subnetwork segregation and integration at a high temporal resolution. At a global level, the cognitively more taxing 2-back epochs elicited an overall stronger response of integration between subnetworks compared to the 0-back epochs. Moreover, the visual and fronto-parietal subnetworks displayed characteristic and distinct temporal profiles of segregation and integration during the 0- and 2-back epochs. During the interspersed epochs of baseline, many subnetworks, including the default mode, visual, fronto-parietal, cingulo-opercular and dorsal attention subnetworks showed pronounced increases in segregation. Using a drift diffusion model we show that the response time for the 2-back trials are correlated with integration for the fronto-parietal subnetwork and correlated with segregation for the visual subnetwork. Our results elucidate the fast-evolving events with regard to subnetwork integration and segregation that occur in an epoch-related task fMRI experiment. Our findings suggest that minute changes in subnetwork integration are of importance for task performance.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/252320v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Although many studies have focused on abnormal patterns of brain functional connectivity in Autism spectrum disorder (ASD), one important factor, the developmental effect of brain networks was largely overlooked. To clarify the abnormal developmental trajectory of brain functional connectivity in ASD, we focused on the age-related changes in three &quot;core&quot; neurocognitive networks: default mode network (DMN), salience network (SN) and central executive network (CEN, also divided into left and right CEN, i.e., lCEN and rCEN). The development of intrinsic functional connectivity (iFC) within and between these networks were analyzed in 107 Chinese participants, including children, adolescents, and adults (54 patients with ASD and 53 typically developed (TD) participants; ages 6-30 years). We found that diagnosis-related distinctions in age-related changes suggest three maturation patterns in networks' or nodes' iFC: delayed (iFC between SN and rCEN), ectopic (iFC between SN and DMN, and iFC between posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) and right anterior insula/dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC)), and failure maturation (iFC between dACC and ventral medial prefrontal cortex). Compared with age-matched TD participants, ASD patients in children and adolescents exhibited hypo-connectivity, while that in adults showed hyper-connectivity. In addition, an independent verification based on Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE) datasets confirmed our findings of developmental trajectories in ASD group, which also showed unchanged functional connectivity with age between DMN and SN and increasing iFC between rCEN and SN. The conspicuous differences in the development of three &quot;core&quot; networks in ASD were demonstrated, which may lead a nuanced understanding towards the abnormal brain network maturation trajectory of autism.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/252288v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>In rodents, hippocampal cell assemblies formed during learning of a navigation task are observed to re-emerge during resting (offline) periods, accompanied by high frequency oscillations (HFOs). This phenomenon is believed to reflect mechanisms for strengthening newly formed memory traces. Using magnetoencephalography recordings and a beamforming source location algorithm (synthetic aperture magnetometry), we investigated high-gamma (80 - 140 Hz) oscillations in the hippocampal region in 18 human participants during inter-trial rest periods in a virtual navigation task. We found right hippocampal gamma oscillations mirrored the pattern of theta power in the same region during navigation, varying as a function of environmental novelty. Gamma power during inter-trial rest periods was positively correlated with theta power during navigation in the first training set when the environment was new and predicted faster learning in the subsequent training set two where the environment became familiar. These findings provide evidence for human hippocampal reactivation accompanied by high gamma activities immediately after learning and establish a link between hippocampal high gamma activities and memory consolidation.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/252247v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>There is a need in modern neuroscience for accurate and automated image processing techniques for analyzing the large volume of neuroanatomical data. For e.g., the use of light microscopy to image whole mouse brains in a mesoscopic scale produces individual neuroanatomical data volumes in the TerraByte range. A fundamental task involves the detection and quantification of objects of a given type, e.g. neuronal nuclei or somata, in whole mouse brains. Traditionally this quantification is performed by human visual inspection with high accuracy, that is not scalable. When state-of-the-art CNN and SVM-based methods are used to solve this classification problem, they achieve accuracy levels between 85-92%. However, higher rates of precision and recall, close to that of humans are necessary. In this paper, we describe an unsupervised, iterative algorithm, which provides a high close to human performance for a specific problem of broad interest, i.e. detection of Green Fluorescent Protein labeled nuclei in whole mouse brains. The algorithm judiciously combines classical computer vision (CV) techniques and is focused on the complex problem of decomposing strong overlapped objects (nuclei). Our proposed iterative method uses features detected on ridge lines over distance transformation and an arc based iterative spatial-filling method to solve the problem. We demonstrate our results on two whole mouse brain data sets of Gigabyte resolution and compare it with manual annotation of the brains. Our results show that an aptly designed CV algorithm with classical feature extractors, when tailored to this problem of interest, achieves near-ideal humanlike performance. Quantitative analysis, when compared with the manually annotated ground truth, reveals that our approach performs better on whole mouse brain scans than general purpose machine learning (including deep CNN) methods.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/252130v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Growing evidence suggests that distributed spatial attention may invoke theta (3-9 Hz) rhythmic sampling processes. The neuronal basis of such attentional sampling is however not fully understood. Here we show using array recordings in visual cortical area V4 of two awake macaques that presenting separate visual stimuli to the excitatory center and suppressive surround of neuronal receptive fields elicits rhythmic multi-unit activity (MUA) at 3-6 Hz. This neuronal rhythm did not depend on small fixational eye movements. In the context of a distributed spatial attention task, during which the monkeys detected a spatially and temporally uncertain target, reaction times (RT) exhibited similar rhythmic fluctuations. RTs were fast or slow depending on the target occurrence during high or low MUA, resulting in rhythmic MUA-RT cross-correlations at at theta frequencies. These findings suggest that theta-rhythmic neuronal activity arises from competitive receptive field interactions and that this rhythm may subserve attentional sampling.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/249342v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Numerical format describes the way magnitude is conveyed, for example as a digit (&quot;3&quot;) or Roman Numeral (&quot;III&quot;). In the field of numerical cognition, there is an ongoing debate of whether magnitude representation is independent of numerical format. Here, we examine the time course of magnitude processing when using different symbolic formats. We presented participants with a series of digits and dice patterns corresponding to the magnitudes of 1 to 6 while performing a 1-back task on magnitude. Magnetoencephalography (MEG) offers an opportunity to record brain activity with high temporal resolution. Multivariate Pattern Analysis (MVPA) applied to MEG data allows us to draw conclusions about brain activation patterns underlying information processing over time. The results show that we can cross-decode magnitude when training the classifier on magnitude presented in one symbolic format and testing the classifier on the other symbolic format. This suggests similar representation of these numerical symbols. Additionally, results from a time-generalisation analysis show that digits were accessed slightly earlier than dice, demonstrating temporal asynchronies in their shared representation of magnitude. Together, our methods allow a distinction between format-specific signals and format-independent representations of magnitude showing evidence that there is a shared representation of magnitude accessed via different symbols.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/245993v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Repression of target genes by the transcriptional repressor neuronal restrictive silencing factor (NRSF)/repressor element 1 silencing transcription factor (REST) contributes to enduring plasticity in the developing brain. However, the cofactor(s) interacting with NRSF to enable target gene repressor are not well understood, and may vary among neuronal populations and brain regions as well as with different contexts. Here we employed the novel designer drug mS-11 to block the interactions of the cofactor Sin3 with NRSF. We tested if NRSF-Sin3 interaction is required for repression of NRSF target genes in developing hypothalamus after activity-dependent modulation of NRSF function. In the hypothalamus in vitro, blocking glutamatergic neurotransmission robustly increased NRSF binding to the target gene Crh, resulting in its repression. Blocking the binding of NRSF to the chromatin with decoy NRSE-oligodeoxynucleotides abrogated this repression. In contrast, mS-11 at several concentrations did not impede Crh repression. NRSF-mediated repression may underlie disease processes such as the onset of epilepsy. Therefore, identifying small-molecule antagonists of NRSF is crucial for the development of disease-preventing or modifying interventions.</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: What drives the perceptual change resulting from speech motor adaptation? Evaluation of hypotheses in a Bayesian modeling framework</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/847yCSUjhhw/article</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Jean-François Patri, Pascal Perrier, Jean-Luc Schwartz, Julien Diard&lt;/p&gt;

Shifts in perceptual boundaries resulting from speech motor learning induced by perturbations of the auditory feedback were taken as evidence for the involvement of motor functions in auditory speech perception. Beyond this general statement, the precise mechanisms underlying this involvement are not yet fully understood. In this paper we propose a quantitative evaluation of some hypotheses concerning the motor and auditory updates that could result from motor learning, in the context of various assumptions about the roles of the auditory and somatosensory pathways in speech perception. This analysis was made possible thanks to the use of a Bayesian model that implements these hypotheses by expressing the relationships between speech production and speech perception in a joint probability distribution. The evaluation focuses on how the hypotheses can (1) predict the location of perceptual boundary shifts once the perturbation has been removed, (2) account for the magnitude of the compensation in presence of the perturbation, and (3) describe the correlation between these two behavioral characteristics. Experimental findings about changes in speech perception following adaptation to auditory feedback perturbations serve as reference. Simulations suggest that they are compatible with a framework in which motor adaptation updates both the auditory-motor internal model and the auditory characterization of the perturbed phoneme, and where perception involves both auditory and somatosensory pathways.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/847yCSUjhhw&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1801.06452</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;For autonomous robots in dynamic environments mixed with human, it is vital
to detect impending collision quickly and robustly. The biological visual
systems evolved over millions of years may provide us efficient solutions for
collision detection in complex environments. In the cockpit of locusts, two
Lobula Giant Movement Detectors, i.e. LGMD1 and LGMD2, have been identified
which respond to looming objects rigorously with high firing rates. Compared to
LGMD1, LGMD2 matures early in the juvenile locusts with specific selectivity to
dark moving objects against bright background in depth while not responding to
light objects embedded in dark background - a similar situation which ground
vehicles and robots are facing with. However, little work has been done on
modeling LGMD2, let alone its potential in robotics and other vision-based
applications. In this article, we propose a novel way of modeling LGMD2 neuron,
with biased ON and OFF pathways splitting visual streams into parallel channels
encoding brightness increments and decrements separately to fulfill its
selectivity. Moreover, we apply a biophysical mechanism of spike frequency
adaptation to shape the looming selectivity in such a collision-detecting
neuron model. The proposed visual neural network has been tested with
systematic experiments, challenged against synthetic and real physical stimuli,
as well as image streams from the sensor of a miniature robot. The results
demonstrated this framework is able to detect looming dark objects embedded in
bright backgrounds selectively, which make it ideal for ground mobile
platforms. The robotic experiments also showed its robustness in collision
detection - it performed well for near range navigation in an arena with many
obstacles. Its enhanced collision selectivity to dark approaching objects
versus receding and translating ones has also been verified via systematic
experiments.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1801.06226</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The means by which neuronal activity yields robust behavior is a ubiquitous
question in neuroscience. In the songbird, the timing of a highly stereotyped
song motif is attributed to the cortical nucleus HVC, and to feedback to HVC
from downstream nuclei in the song motor pathway. Control of the acoustic
structure appears to be shared by various structures, whose functional
connectivity is largely unknown. Currently there exists no model for functional
synaptic architecture that links HVC to song output in a manner consistent with
experiments. Here we build on a previous model of HVC in which a distinct
functional architecture may act as a pattern generator to drive downstream
regions. Using a specific functional connectivity of the song motor pathway, we
show how this HVC mechanism can generate simple representations of the driving
forces for song. The model reproduces observed correlations between neuronal
and respiratory activity and acoustic features of song. It makes testable
predictions regarding the electrophysiology of distinct populations in the
robust nucleus of the arcopallium (RA), the connectivity within HVC and RA and
between them, and the activity patterns of vocal-respiratory neurons in the
brainstem.

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Receptive field center-surround interactions mediate context-dependent spatial contrast encoding in the retina</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/252148v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Almost every neuron in the early visual system has some form of an antagonistic receptive field surround. But the function of the surround is poorly understood, especially under naturalistic stimulus conditions. Anatomical and functional characterization of the surround of retinal ganglion cells suggests that surround signals combine with the excitatory feedforward pathway upstream of an important synaptic nonlinearity between bipolar cells and postsynaptic ganglion cells. This circuit architecture suggests at least two unexplored consequences for receptive field structure. First, center and surround inputs should interact nonlinearly, even prior to the summation across visual space that forms the full receptive field center. Second, inputs to the surround may alter the sensitivity of the center to spatial contrast in a scene. We test these hypotheses using both synthetic and naturalistic visual stimuli, and find that the statistics of natural scenes promote these nonlinear interactions. This work shows that, unexpectedly, the surround modulates spatial contrast encoding based on visual context.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: BMP Signaling Downstream of the Highwire E3 Ligase Sensitizes Nociceptors.</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/251991v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>A comprehensive understanding of the molecular machinery important for nociception is essential to improving the treatment of pain. Here, we show that the BMP signaling pathway regulates nociception downstream of the E3 ubiquitin ligase highwire (hiw). Hiw loss of function in nociceptors caused antagonistic and pleiotropic phenotypes with simultaneous insensitivity to noxious heat but sensitized responses to optogenetic activation of nociceptors. Thus, hiw functions to both positively and negatively regulate nociceptors. We find that a sensory transduction-independent sensitization pathway was associated with BMP signaling. BMP signaling in nociceptors was up-regulated in hiw mutants, and nociceptor-specific expression of hiw rescued all nociception phenotypes including the increased BMP signaling. Blocking the transcriptional output of the BMP pathway with dominant negative Mad suppressed nociceptive hypersensitivity that was induced by interfering with hiw. The up-regulated BMP signaling phenotype in hiw genetic mutants could not be suppressed by mutation in wallenda suggesting that hiw regulates BMP in nociceptors via a wallenda independent pathway. In a newly established Ca2+ imaging preparation, we observed that up-regulated BMP signaling caused a significantly enhanced Ca2+ signal in the axon terminals of nociceptors that were stimulated by noxious heat. This response likely accounts for the nociceptive hypersensitivity induced by elevated BMP signaling in nociceptors. Finally, we showed that acute activation of BMP signaling in nociceptors was sufficient to sensitize nociceptive responses to optogenetically-triggered nociceptor activation without altering nociceptor morphology. Overall, this study demonstrates the previously unrevealed roles of the Hiw-BMP pathway in the regulation of nociception and provides the first direct evidence that up-regulated BMP signaling physiologically sensitizes responses of nociceptors and nociception behaviors.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/251884v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Humans have an almost unbounded ability to adapt their behaviour to perform different tasks. In the laboratory, this flexibility is sometimes viewed as a nuisance factor that prevents access to the underlying cognitive mechanisms of interest. For example, in order to study automatic lexical processing, psycholinguists have used masked priming or evoked potentials to measure 'automatic' lexical processing. However, the pattern of masked priming can be radically altered by changing the task. In lexical decision, priming is observed for words but not for nonwords, yet in a same-different matching task, priming is observed for same responses but not for different responses, regardless of whether the target is a word or a nonword (Norris &amp;amp; Kinoshita, 2008). Here we show that evoked potentials are equally sensitive to the nature of required decision, with the neural activity normally associated with lexical processing being seen for both words and nonwords on same trials, and for neither on different trials.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/251843v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>GABA neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and substantia nigra pars compact (SNc) play key roles in reward and aversion through their local inhibitory control of dopamine neuron activity and through long-range projections to several target regions including the nucleus accumbens. It is not clear if some of these GABA neurons are dedicated local interneurons or if they all collateralize and send projections externally as well as making local synaptic connections. Testing between these possibilities has been challenging in the absence of interneuron-specific molecular markers. We hypothesised that one potential candidate might be neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS), a common interneuronal marker in other brain regions. To test this, we used a combination of immunolabelling (including antibodies for nNOS that we validated in tissue from nNOS-deficient mice) and cell-type-specific virus-based anterograde tracing in mice. We show that nNOS-expressing neurons in the parabrachial pigmented (PBP) part of the VTA and the SNc are GABAergic local interneurons, whereas nNOS-expressing neurons in the Rostral Linear Nucleus (RLi) are mostly glutamatergic and project to a number of regions, including the lateral hypothalamus, the ventral pallidum, and the median raphe nucleus. Taken together, these findings indicate that nNOS is expressed by neurochemically- and anatomically-distinct neuronal sub-groups in a sub-region-specific manner in the VTA and SNc.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/251835v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Prior to selecting an action, we often consider other possibilities. How does the brain represent these preliminary plans prior to action selection? Here, we investigated this question in the oculomotor system during self-guided search of natural scenes. We found two classes of neurons in the frontal eye field (FEF): 1) &quot;late selection neurons&quot; that represented the selected action plan not long before the upcoming saccade, and 2) &quot;early selection neurons&quot; that became predictive of the upcoming saccade much earlier, often before the previous saccade had even ended. Crucially, these early selection neurons did not only predict the upcoming saccade direction; they also reflected the probabilities of possible upcoming saccades, even when they did not end up being selected. Our results demonstrate that during naturalistic eye movements, separate populations of neurons code for preliminary and definitive plans.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/251827v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Converging evidence from activation, connectivity and stimulation studies suggests that auditory brain networks are lateralized. Here we show that these findings can be at least partly explained by the asymmetric network embedding of the primary auditory cortices. Using diffusion-weighted imaging in three independent datasets, we investigate the propensity for left and right auditory cortex to communicate with other brain areas by quantifying the centrality of the auditory network across a spectrum of communication mechanisms, from shortest path communication to diffusive spreading. Across all datasets, we find that the right auditory cortex is better integrated in the connectome, facilitating more efficient communication with other areas, with much of the asymmetry driven by differences in communication pathways to the opposite hemisphere. Critically, the primacy of the right auditory cortex emerges only when communication is conceptualized as a diffusive process, taking advantage of more than just the topologically shortest paths in the network. Altogether, these results highlight how the network configuration and embedding of a particular region may contribute to its functional lateralization.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Neuromodulation Influences Synchronization and Intrinsic Read-out</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/251801v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>The roles of neuromodulation in a neural network, such as in a cortical microcolumn, are still incompletely understood. Neuromodulation influences neural processing by presynaptic and postsynaptic regulation of synaptic efficacy. Synaptic efficacy modulation can be an effective way to rapidly alter network density and topology. We show that altering network topology, together with density, will affect its synchronization. Fast synaptic efficacy modulation may therefore influence the amount of correlated spiking in a network. Neuromodulation also affects ion channel regulation for intrinsic excitability, which alters the neuron's activation function. We show that synchronization in a network influences the read-out of these intrinsic properties. Highly synchronous input drives neurons, such that differences in intrinsic properties disappear, while asynchronous input lets intrinsic properties determine output behavior. Thus, altering network topology can alter the balance between intrinsically vs. synaptically driven network activity. We conclude that neuromodulation may allow a network to shift between a more synchronized transmission mode and a more asynchronous intrinsic read-out mode.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: The neural representation of missing speech and the influence of prior knowledge on cortical fidelity and latency</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/251793v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>In naturally noisy listening conditions, for example at a cocktail party, noise disruptions may completely mask significant parts of a sentence, and yet listeners may still perceive the missing speech as being present. Here we demonstrate that dynamic speech-related auditory cortical activity, as measured by magnetoencephalography (MEG), which can ordinarily be used to directly reconstruct to the physical speech stimulus, can also be used to &quot;reconstruct&quot; acoustically missing speech. The extent to which this occurs depends on the extent that listeners are familiar with the missing speech, which is consistent with this neural activity being a dynamic representation of perceived speech even if acoustically absence. Our findings are two-fold: first, we find that when the speech is entirely acoustically absent, the acoustically absent speech can still be reconstructed with performance up to 25% of that of acoustically present speech without noise; and second, that this same expertise facilitates faster processing of natural speech by approximately 5 ms. Both effects disappear when listeners have no or very little prior experience with a given sentence. Our results suggest adaptive mechanisms of consolidation of detailed representations about speech, and the enabling of strong expectations this entails, as identifiable factors assisting automatic speech restoration over ecologically relevant timescales.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/251686v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Ciliary and rhabdomeric photoreceptor cells represent two main lines of photoreceptor evolution in animals. The two photoreceptor-cell types coexist in some animals, however how they functionally integrate is unknown. We used connectomics to map synaptic paths between ciliary and rhabdomeric photoreceptors in the planktonic larva of the annelid Platynereis and found that ciliary photoreceptors are presynaptic to the rhabdomeric circuit. The behaviors mediated by the ciliary and rhabdomeric cells also interact hierarchically. The ciliary photoreceptors are UV-sensitive and mediate downward swimming to non-directional UV light, a behavior absent in ciliary-opsin knockouts. UV avoidance antagonizes positive phototaxis mediated by the rhabdomeric eyes so that vertical swimming direction is determined by the ratio of blue/UV light. Since this ratio increases with depth, Platynereis larvae may use it as a depth gauge during planktonic migration. Our results revealed a functional integration of ciliary and rhabdomeric photoreceptors with implications for eye and photoreceptor evolution.</content:encoded>

Subplate neurons (SPNs) are among the first-born cortical neurons and are necessary for normal cerebral development. While moderate or severe HI at P1 in rats leads to SPN loss, it is unclear if HI, esp. forms not associated with overt cell loss lead to altered SPN circuits. Thus, we used two HI models with different severities in P1 rats. Cauterization of the common carotid artery (CCA) causes a largely transient and thus milder ischemia (HI-Caut) while CCA ligation causes more severe ischemia (HI-Lig). While HI-Lig caused subplate damage, HI-Caut did not cause overt histological damage on the light microscopic level. We used laser-scanning photostimulation (LSPS) in acute thalamocortical slices of auditory cortex during P5–10 to study the functional connectivity of SPNs. Both HI categories resulted in hyperconnectivity of excitatory and inhibitory circuits to SPNs. Thus, alterations on the circuit level are present in the absence of cell loss. Our results show that SPN circuits are uniquely susceptible to HI. Given the key developmental role of SPNs, our results suggest that altered SPN circuits might underlie the abnormal development of cortical function after HI.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;In order to efficiently process incoming visual information, selective attention acts as a filter that enhances relevant and suppresses irrelevant information. In this study, we used an event-related potential (ERP) approach with systematic lateralization to investigate enhancement and suppression during encoding of information into visual working memory (WM) separately. We used a change detection task in which observers had to memorize some items while ignoring other items. We found that the to-be-ignored items elicited a PD component in the ERP, suggesting that irrelevant information is actively suppressed from WM. The PD amplitude increased with distractor load and decreased with the ability to group distractors according to Gestalt principles. This suggests that the PD can be used as an indicator of how efficiently items can be suppressed from entering WM. Furthermore, while lateral memory-targets elicited a “traditional” CDA (starting ~300 ms), lateral memory-distractors elicited a sustained positivity contralateral to memory-distractors (CDAp, starting ~400 ms). In sum the results suggest that inhibition of irrelevant information is an important factor for efficient WM and is reflected in spontaneous (PD) and sustained suppression (CDAp).&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;The perception of an acoustic rhythm is invariant to the absolute temporal intervals constituting a sound sequence. It is unknown where in the brain temporal Gestalt, the percept emerging from the relative temporal proximity between acoustic events, is encoded. Two different relative temporal patterns, each induced by three experimental conditions with different absolute temporal patterns as sensory basis, were presented to participants. A linear support vector machine classifier was trained to differentiate activation patterns in functional magnetic resonance imaging data to the 2 different percepts. Across the sensory constituents the classifier decoded which percept was perceived. A searchlight analysis localized activation patterns specific to the temporal Gestalt bilaterally to the temporoparietal junction, including the planum temporale and supramarginal gyrus, and unilaterally to the right inferior frontal gyrus (pars opercularis). We show that auditory areas not only process absolute temporal intervals, but also integrate them into percepts of Gestalt and that encoding of these percepts persists in high-level associative areas. The findings complement existing knowledge regarding the processing of absolute temporal patterns to the processing of relative temporal patterns relevant to the sequential binding of perceptual elements into Gestalt.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

The cochlea not only transduces sound-induced vibration into neural spikes, it also amplifies weak sound to boost its detection. Actuators of this active process are sensory outer hair cells in the organ of Corti, whereas the inner hair cells transduce the resulting motion into electric signals that propagate via the auditory nerve to the brain. However, how the outer hair cells modulate the stimulus to the inner hair cells remains unclear. Here, we combine theoretical modeling and experimental measurements near the cochlear apex to study the way in which length changes of the outer hair cells deform the organ of Corti. We develop a geometry-based kinematic model of the apical organ of Corti that reproduces salient, yet counter-intuitive features of the organ’s motion. Our analysis further uncovers a mechanism by which a static length change of the outer hair cells can sensitively tune the signal transmitted to the sensory inner hair cells. When the outer hair cells are in an elongated state, stimulation of inner hair cells is largely inhibited, whereas outer hair cell contraction leads to a substantial enhancement of sound-evoked motion near the hair bundles. This novel mechanism for regulating the sensitivity of the hearing organ applies to the low frequencies that are most important for the perception of speech and music. We suggest that the proposed mechanism might underlie frequency discrimination at low auditory frequencies, as well as our ability to selectively attend auditory signals in noisy surroundings.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/XnGbn1GAfJQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Targeting key regulators of the cancer stem cell phenotype to overcome their critical influence on tumor growth is a promising new strategy for cancer treatment. Here we present a modeling framework that operates at both the cellular and molecular levels, for investigating IL-6 mediated, cancer stem cell driven tumor growth and targeted treatment with anti-IL6 antibodies. Our immediate goal is to quantify the influence of IL-6 on cancer stem cell self-renewal and survival, and to characterize the subsequent impact on tumor growth dynamics. By including the molecular details of IL-6 binding, we are able to quantify the temporal changes in fractional occupancies of bound receptors and their influence on tumor volume. There is a strong correlation between the model output and experimental data for primary tumor xenografts. We also used the model to predict tumor response to administration of the humanized IL-6R monoclonal antibody, tocilizumab (TCZ), and we found that as little as 1mg/kg of TCZ administered weekly for 7 weeks is sufficient to result in tumor reduction and a sustained deceleration of tumor growth.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/9hxzc5PneJY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;h3&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Objective&lt;/b&gt;: We evaluated whether transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is able to enhance dysphagia rehabilitation following stroke. Besides relating clinical effects with neuroplastic changes in cortical swallowing processing we aimed to identify factors influencing treatment success.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Methods&lt;/b&gt;: In this double-blind, randomized study 60 acute dysphagic stroke patients received contralesional anodal (1 mA, 20 min) or sham tDCS on four consecutive days. Swallowing function was thoroughly assessed before and after the intervention using the validated Fiberoptic Endoscopic Dysphagia Severity Scale (FEDSS) and clinical assessment. In 10 patients, swallowing-related brain activation was recorded applying magnetoencephalography (MEG) before and after the intervention. Voxel-based statistical lesion pattern analysis was also performed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Results&lt;/b&gt;: Study groups did not differ according to demographic data, stroke characteristics, or baseline dysphagia severity. Patients treated with tDCS showed greater improvement in FEDSS than the sham group (1.3 vs 0.4 points, mean difference: 0.9 [95%CI 0.4–1.4], p&amp;lt;0.0005). Functional recovery was accompanied by a significant increase of activation (p&amp;lt;0.05) in the contralesional swallowing network after real but not sham tDCS. Looking for predictors of treatment success every hour of earlier treatment initiation was associated with greater improvement of FEDSS (adjusted OR 0.99 [0.98–1.00], p&amp;lt;0.05) in multivariable analysis. Stroke location in the right insula and operculum was indicative of worse response to tDCS (p&amp;lt;0.05).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Interpretation&lt;/b&gt;: Application of tDCS over the contralesional swallowing motor cortex supports swallowing network reorganization, thereby leading to faster rehabilitation of acute post-stroke dysphagia. Early treatment initiation seems beneficial. TDCS may be less effective in right-hemispheric insulo-opercular stroke. This article is protected by copyright.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1801.06168</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;We study a deterministic version of a one- and two-dimensional attractor
neural network model of hippocampal activity first studied by Itskov et al
2011. We analyze the dynamics of the system on the ring and torus domain with
an even periodized weight matrix, assum- ing weak and slow spike frequency
adaptation and a weak stationary input current. On these domains, we find
transitions from spatially localized stationary solutions (&quot;bumps&quot;) to
(periodically modulated) solutions (&quot;sloshers&quot;), as well as constant and
non-constant velocity traveling bumps depending on the relative strength of
external input current and adaptation. The weak and slow adaptation allows for
a reduction of the system from a distributed partial integro-differential
equation to a system of scalar Volterra integro-differential equations
describing the movement of the centroid of the bump solution. Using this
reduction, we show that on both domains, sloshing solutions arise through an
Andronov-Hopf bifurcation and derive a normal form for the Hopf bifurcation on
the ring. We also show existence and stability of constant velocity solutions
on both domains using Evans functions. In contrast to existing studies, we
assume a general weight matrix of Mexican-hat type in addition to a smooth
firing rate function.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1801.06079</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Brains are spatially embedded networks whose architecture has been shaped by
physical and biochemical constraints throughout evolution. While these networks
provide global connectivity and sustain the broad spectrum of the functions of
the brain, the underlying routing strategies for communication between the
different areas and their control remain to be elucidated. Here, we investigate
the flow of information in connectomes of several species using greedy routing
as a distributed navigation protocol. In Euclidean space, in which brains have
evolved, our results unveil that the navigability of brains vary highly across
species. On the one hand, this result may suggest that the more evolved an
organism is, the more the structure of the connectome is encoded in the spatial
organization of the brain. On the other hand, conclusions obtained using
coarse-grained connectomes, where nodes correspond to areas instead of
individual neurones, may not apply to connectomes obtained at the microscopic,
neuronal level. Moreover, we prove that the effective geometry of the brain is
better described as hyperbolic rather than Euclidean. This indicates that other
factors besides degrees and Euclidean distance play a significant role in the
existence of connections. On a more practical perspective, hyperbolic
embeddings offer a universal and meaningful representations to compare brain
networks across species on an equal footing.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Conditions for traveling waves in spiking neural networks. (arXiv:1801.06046v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1801.06046</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Spatiotemporal patterns such as traveling waves are frequently observed in
recordings of neural activity. The mechanisms underlying the generation of such
patterns are largely unknown. Previous studies have investigated the existence
and uniqueness of different types of waves or bumps of activity using
neural-field models, phenomenological coarse-grained descriptions of
neural-network dynamics. But it remains unclear how these insights can be
transferred to more biologically realistic networks of spiking neurons, where
individual neurons fire irregularly. Here, we employ mean-field theory to
reduce a microscopic model of leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) neurons with
distance-dependent connectivity to an effective neural-field model. In contrast
to existing phenomenological descriptions, the dynamics in this neural-field
model depends on the mean and the variance in the synaptic input, both
determining the amplitude and the temporal structure of the resulting effective
coupling kernel. For the neural-field model we derive conditions for the
existence of spatial and temporal oscillations and periodic traveling waves
using linear stability analysis. We first prove that periodic traveling waves
cannot occur in a single homogeneous population of neurons, irrespective of the
form of distance dependence of the connection probability. Compatible with the
architecture of cortical neural networks, traveling waves emerge in
two-population networks of excitatory and inhibitory neurons as a combination
of delay-induced temporal oscillations and spatial oscillations due to
distance-dependent connectivity profiles. Finally, we demonstrate quantitative
agreement between predictions of the analytically tractable neural-field model
and numerical simulations of both networks of nonlinear rate-based units and
networks of LIF neurons.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Threshold of front propagation in neural fields: An interface dynamics approach. (arXiv:1801.05878v1 [nlin.PS])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1801.05878</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Neural field equations model population dynamics of large-scale networks of
neurons. Wave propagation in neural fields is often studied by constructing
traveling wave solutions in the wave coordinate frame. Nonequilibrium dynamics
are more challenging to study, due to the nonlinearity and nonlocality of
neural fields, whose interactions are described by the kernel of an integral
term. Here, we leverage interface methods to describe the threshold of wave
initiation away from equilibrium. In particular, we focus on traveling front
initiation in an excitatory neural field. In a neural field with a Heaviside
firing rate, neural activity can be described by the dynamics of the
interfaces, where the neural activity is at the firing threshold. This allows
us to derive conditions for the portion of the neural field that must be
activated for traveling fronts to be initiated in a purely excitatory neural
field. Explicit equations are possible for a single active (superthreshold)
region, and special cases of multiple disconnected active regions. The dynamic
spreading speed of the excited region can also be approximated asymptotically.
We also discuss extensions to the problem of finding the critical
spatiotemporal input needed to initiate waves.

The shaping of individual cells requires a tight coordination of cell mechanics and growth. However, it is unclear how information about the mechanical state of the wall is relayed to the molecular processes building it, thereby enabling the coordination of cell wall expansion and assembly during morphogenesis. Combining theoretical and experimental approaches, we show that a mechanical feedback coordinating cell wall assembly and expansion is essential to sustain mating projection growth in budding yeast (&lt;i&gt;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&lt;/i&gt;). Our theoretical results indicate that the mechanical feedback provided by the Cell Wall Integrity pathway, with cell wall stress sensors Wsc1 and Mid2 increasingly activating membrane-localized cell wall synthases Fks1/2 upon faster cell wall expansion, stabilizes mating projection growth without affecting cell shape. Experimental perturbation of the osmotic pressure and cell wall mechanics, as well as compromising the mechanical feedback through genetic deletion of the stress sensors, leads to cellular phenotypes that support the theoretical predictions. Our results indicate that while the existence of mechanical feedback is essential to stabilize mating projection growth, the shape and size of the cell are insensitive to the feedback.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/HJHfrBF1fQE&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Education and training are two essential ingredients for a successful career. On one hand, universities provide students a curriculum for specializing in one’s field of study, and on the other, internships complement coursework and provide invaluable training experience for a fruitful career. Consequently, undergraduates and graduates are encouraged to undertake an internship during the course of their degree. The opportunity to explore one’s research interests in the early stages of their education is important for students because it improves their skill set and gives their career a boost. In the long term, this helps to close the gap between skills and employability among students across the globe and balance the research capacity in the field of computational biology. However, training opportunities are often scarce for computational biology students, particularly for those who reside in less-privileged regions. Aimed at helping students develop research and academic skills in computational biology and alleviating the divide across countries, the Student Council of the International Society for Computational Biology introduced its Internship Program in 2009. The Internship Program is committed to providing access to computational biology training, especially for students from developing regions, and improving competencies in the field. Here, we present how the Internship Program works and the impact of the internship opportunities so far, along with the challenges associated with this program.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/6wQOmQXfI-k&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Functional optimality of the sulcus pattern of the human brain. (arXiv:1801.05703v2 [physics.bio-ph] UPDATED)</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1801.05703</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;We develop a mathematical model of information transmission across the
biological neural network of the human brain. The overall function of the brain
consists of the emergent processes resulting from the spread of information
through the neural network. The capacity of the brain is therefore related to
the rate at which it can transmit information through the neural network. The
particular transmission model under consideration allows for information to be
transmitted along multiple paths between points of the cortex. The resulting
transmission rates are governed by potential theory. According to this theory,
the brain has preferred and quantized transmission modes that correspond to
eigenfunctions of the classical Steklov eigenvalue problem, with the reciprocal
eigenvalues quantifying the corresponding transmission rates. We take the model
as a basis for testing the hypothesis that the sulcus pattern of the human
brain has evolved to maximize the rate of transmission of information between
points in the cerebral cortex. We show that the introduction of sulci, or cuts,
in an otherwise smooth domain indeed increases the overall transmission rate.
We demonstrate this result by means of numerical experiments concerned with a
spherical domain with a varying number of slits on its surface.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1801.05421</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Permutation relative entropy is proposed to quantify time irreversibility in
our nonlinear dynamics analysis of electroencephalogram (EEG). Ordinal patterns
in multi-dimension phase space of time series are symbolized, and the
probabilistic divergences of all symmetric ordinal pairs are measured by
relative entropy as time irreversibility. Analyzing multi-channel EEG from 18
healthy volunteers and 18 epileptic patients (all in their seize-free
intervals), the derived relative entropy of symmetrical ordinal patterns shows
advantages to other time irreversible parameters and significantly distinguish
two kinds of brain electric signals (the epileptic have lower temporal
asymmetries than the healthy). Test results prove that it is effective to
quantity time irreversibility by measuring probabilistic divergence of
symmetrical ordinal patterns and validate our hypothesis that epilepsy has
lasting impacts on brain' nonlinear dynamics, leading to a decline in brain
signals directional asymmetry or time irreversibility, and the losing temporal
asymmetries stemming from our findings may contribute to the preclinical
diagnosis of epilepsy.

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: A theory of how active behavior stabilises neural activity: Neural gain modulation by closed-loop environmental feedback</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/Rfk3vZoQIs4/article</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Christopher L. Buckley, Taro Toyoizumi&lt;/p&gt;

During active behaviours like running, swimming, whisking or sniffing, motor actions shape sensory input and sensory percepts guide future motor commands. Ongoing cycles of sensory and motor processing constitute a closed-loop feedback system which is central to motor control and, it has been argued, for perceptual processes. This closed-loop feedback is mediated by brainwide neural circuits but how the presence of feedback signals impacts on the dynamics and function of neurons is not well understood. Here we present a simple theory suggesting that closed-loop feedback between the brain/body/environment can modulate neural gain and, consequently, change endogenous neural fluctuations and responses to sensory input. We support this theory with modeling and data analysis in two vertebrate systems. First, in a model of rodent whisking we show that negative feedback mediated by whisking vibrissa can suppress coherent neural fluctuations and neural responses to sensory input in the barrel cortex. We argue this suppression provides an appealing account of a &lt;i&gt;brain state transition&lt;/i&gt; (a marked change in global brain activity) coincident with the onset of whisking in rodents. Moreover, this mechanism suggests a novel signal detection mechanism that selectively accentuates &lt;i&gt;active&lt;/i&gt;, rather than &lt;i&gt;passive&lt;/i&gt;, whisker touch signals. This mechanism is consistent with a predictive coding strategy that is sensitive to the consequences of motor actions rather than the difference between the predicted and actual sensory input. We further support the theory by re-analysing previously published two-photon data recorded in zebrafish larvae performing closed-loop optomotor behaviour in a virtual swim simulator. We show, as predicted by this theory, that the degree to which each cell contributes in linking sensory and motor signals well explains how much its neural fluctuations are suppressed by closed-loop optomotor behaviour. More generally we argue that our results demonstrate the dependence of neural fluctuations, across the brain, on closed-loop brain/body/environment interactions strongly supporting the idea that brain function cannot be fully understood through open-loop approaches alone.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Rfk3vZoQIs4&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Alpha Oscillations Reduce Temporal Long-Range Dependence in Spontaneous Human Brain Activity</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/3/755?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Ongoing neural dynamics comprise both frequency-specific oscillations and broadband-features, such as long-range dependence (LRD). Despite both being behaviorally relevant, little is known about their potential interactions. In humans, 8–12 Hz α oscillations constitute the strongest deviation from 1/f power-law scaling, the signature of LRD. We postulated that α oscillations, believed to exert active inhibitory gating, downmodulate the temporal width of LRD in slower ongoing brain activity. In two independent &quot;resting-state&quot; datasets (electroencephalography surface recordings and magnetoencephalography source reconstructions), both across space and dynamically over time, power of α activity covaried with the power slope &amp;lt;5 Hz (i.e., greater α activity shortened LRD). Causality of α activity dynamics was implied by its temporal precedence over changes of slope. A model where power-law fluctuations of the α envelope inhibit baseline activity closely replicated our results. Thus, α oscillations may provide an active control mechanism to adaptively regulate LRD of brain activity at slow temporal scales, thereby shaping internal states and cognitive processes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The two prominent features of ongoing brain activity are oscillations and temporal long-range dependence. Both shape behavioral performance, but little is known about their interaction. Here, we demonstrate such an interaction in EEG and MEG recordings of task-free human brain activity. Specifically, we show that spontaneous dynamics in alpha activity explain ensuing variations of dependence in the low and ultra-low-frequency range. In modeling, two features of alpha oscillations are critical to account for the observed effects on long-range dependence, scale-free properties of alpha oscillations themselves, and a modulation of baseline levels, presumably inhibitory. Both these properties have been observed empirically, and our study hence establishes alpha oscillations as a regulatory mechanism governing long-range dependence or &quot;memory&quot; in slow ongoing brain activity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Retrieval Demands Adaptively Change Striatal Old/New Signals and Boost Subsequent Long-Term Memory</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/3/745?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The striatum is a central part of the dopaminergic mesolimbic system and contributes both to the encoding and retrieval of long-term memories. In this regard, the co-occurrence of striatal novelty and retrieval success effects in independent studies underlines the structure's double duty and suggests dynamic contextual adaptation. To test this hypothesis and further investigate the underlying mechanisms of encoding and retrieval dynamics, human subjects viewed pre-familiarized scene images intermixed with new scenes and classified them as indoor versus outdoor (encoding task) or old versus new (retrieval task), while fMRI and eye tracking data were recorded. Subsequently, subjects performed a final recognition task. As hypothesized, striatal activity and pupil size reflected task-conditional salience of old and new stimuli, but, unexpectedly, this effect was not reflected in the substantia nigra and ventral tegmental area (SN/VTA), medial temporal lobe, or subsequent memory performance. Instead, subsequent memory generally benefitted from retrieval, an effect possibly driven by task difficulty and activity in a network including different parts of the striatum and SN/VTA. Our findings extend memory models of encoding and retrieval dynamics by pinpointing a specific contextual factor that differentially modulates the functional properties of the mesolimbic system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The mesolimbic system is involved in the encoding and retrieval of information but it is unclear how these two processes are achieved within the same network of brain regions. In particular, memory retrieval and novelty encoding were considered in independent studies, implying that novelty (new &amp;gt; old) and retrieval success (old &amp;gt; new) effects may co-occur in the striatum. Here, we used a common framework implicating the striatum, but not other parts of the mesolimbic system, in tracking context-dependent salience of old and new information. The current study, therefore, paves the way for a more comprehensive understanding of the functional properties of the mesolimbic system during memory encoding and retrieval.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Role of the Axon Initial Segment in the Control of Spontaneous Frequency of Nigral Dopaminergic Neurons In Vivo</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/3/733?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The spontaneous tonic discharge activity of nigral dopamine neurons plays a fundamental role in dopaminergic signaling. To investigate the role of neuronal morphology and architecture with respect to spontaneous activity in this population, we visualized the 3D structure of the axon initial segment (AIS) along with the entire somatodendritic domain of adult male mouse dopaminergic neurons, previously recorded &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. We observed a positive correlation of the firing rate with both proximity and size of the AIS. Computational modeling showed that the size of the AIS, but not its position within the somatodendritic domain, is the major causal determinant of the tonic firing rate in the intact model, by virtue of the higher intrinsic frequency of the isolated AIS. Further mechanistic analysis of the relationship between neuronal morphology and firing rate showed that dopaminergic neurons function as a coupled oscillator whose frequency of discharge results from a compromise between AIS and somatodendritic oscillators. Thus, morphology plays a critical role in setting the basal tonic firing rate, which in turn could control striatal dopaminergic signaling that mediates motivation and movement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The frequency at which nigral dopamine neurons discharge action potentials sets baseline dopamine levels in the brain, which enables activity in motor, cognitive, and motivational systems. Here, we demonstrate that the size of the axon initial segment, a subcellular compartment responsible for initiating action potentials, is a key determinant of the firing rate in these neurons. The axon initial segment and all the molecular components that underlie its critical function may provide a novel target for the regulation of dopamine levels in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Dopamine-Dependent Sensitization of Rod Bipolar Cells by GABA Is Conveyed through Wide-Field Amacrine Cells</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/3/723?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The vertebrate retina has the remarkable ability to support visual function under conditions of limited illumination, including the processing of signals evoked by single photons. Dim-light vision is regulated by several adaptive mechanisms. The mechanism explored in this study is responsible for increasing the light sensitivity and operational range of rod bipolar cells, the retinal neurons operating immediately downstream of rod photoreceptors. This sensitization is achieved through the sustained dopamine-dependent GABA release from other retinal neurons. Our goals were to identify the cell type responsible for the GABA release and the site of its modulation by dopamine. Previous studies have suggested the involvement of amacrine and/or horizontal cells. We now demonstrate, using mice of both sexes, that horizontal cells do not participate in this mechanism. Instead, sustained GABA input is provided by a subpopulation of wide-field amacrine cells, which stimulate the GABA&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt; receptors at rod bipolar cell axons. We also found that dopamine does not act directly on either of these cells. Rather, it suppresses inhibition imposed on these wide-field cells by another subpopulation of upstream GABAergic amacrine cells, thereby sustaining the GABA&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt; receptor activation required for rod bipolar cell sensitization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The vertebrate retina has an exquisite ability to adjust information processing to ever-changing conditions of ambient illumination, from bright sunlight to single-photon counting under dim starlight. Operation under each of these functional regimes requires an engagement of specific adaptation mechanisms. Here, we describe a mechanism optimizing the performance of the dim-light channel of vision, which consists of sensitizing rod bipolar cells by a sustained GABAergic input originating from a population of wide-field amacrine cells. Wide-field amacrine cells span large segments of the retina, making them uniquely equipped to normalize and optimize response sensitivity across distant receptive fields and preclude any bias toward local light-intensity fluctuations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Scale-Free Amplitude Modulation of Neuronal Oscillations Tracks Comprehension of Accelerated Speech</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/3/710?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Speech comprehension is preserved up to a threefold acceleration, but deteriorates rapidly at higher speeds. Current models posit that perceptual resilience to accelerated speech is limited by the brain's ability to parse speech into syllabic units using / oscillations. Here, we investigated whether the involvement of neuronal oscillations in processing accelerated speech also relates to their scale-free amplitude modulation as indexed by the strength of long-range temporal correlations (LRTC). We recorded MEG while 24 human subjects (12 females) listened to radio news uttered at different comprehensible rates, at a mostly unintelligible rate and at this same speed interleaved with silence gaps. , , and low- oscillations followed the nonlinear variation of comprehension, with LRTC rising only at the highest speed. In contrast, increasing the rate was associated with a monotonic increase in LRTC in high- activity. When intelligibility was restored with the insertion of silence gaps, LRTC in the , , and low- oscillations resumed the low levels observed for intelligible speech. Remarkably, the lower the individual subject scaling exponents of / oscillations, the greater the comprehension of the fastest speech rate. Moreover, the strength of LRTC of the speech envelope decreased at the maximal rate, suggesting an inverse relationship with the LRTC of brain dynamics when comprehension halts. Our findings show that scale-free amplitude modulation of cortical oscillations and speech signals are tightly coupled to speech uptake capacity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; One may read this statement in 20–30 s, but reading it in less than five leaves us clueless. Our minds limit how much information we grasp in an instant. Understanding the neural constraints on our capacity for sensory uptake is a fundamental question in neuroscience. Here, MEG was used to investigate neuronal activity while subjects listened to radio news played faster and faster until becoming unintelligible. We found that speech comprehension is related to the scale-free dynamics of  and  bands, whereas this property in high- fluctuations mirrors speech rate. We propose that successful speech processing imposes constraints on the self-organization of synchronous cell assemblies and their scale-free dynamics adjusts to the temporal properties of spoken language.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Compressive Temporal Summation in Human Visual Cortex</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/3/691?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Combining sensory inputs over space and time is fundamental to vision. Population receptive field models have been successful in characterizing spatial encoding throughout the human visual pathways. A parallel question, how visual areas in the human brain process information distributed over time, has received less attention. One challenge is that the most widely used neuroimaging method, fMRI, has coarse temporal resolution compared with the time-scale of neural dynamics. Here, via carefully controlled temporally modulated stimuli, we show that information about temporal processing can be readily derived from fMRI signal amplitudes in male and female subjects. We find that all visual areas exhibit subadditive summation, whereby responses to longer stimuli are less than the linear prediction from briefer stimuli. We also find fMRI evidence that the neural response to two stimuli is reduced for brief interstimulus intervals (indicating adaptation). These effects are more pronounced in visual areas anterior to V1-V3. Finally, we develop a general model that shows how these effects can be captured with two simple operations: temporal summation followed by a compressive nonlinearity. This model operates for arbitrary temporal stimulation patterns and provides a simple and interpretable set of computations that can be used to characterize neural response properties across the visual hierarchy. Importantly, compressive temporal summation directly parallels earlier findings of compressive spatial summation in visual cortex describing responses to stimuli distributed across space. This indicates that, for space and time, cortex uses a similar processing strategy to achieve higher-level and increasingly invariant representations of the visual world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Combining sensory inputs over time is fundamental to seeing. Two important temporal phenomena are summation, the accumulation of sensory inputs over time, and adaptation, a response reduction for repeated or sustained stimuli. We investigated these phenomena in the human visual system using fMRI. We built predictive models that operate on arbitrary temporal patterns of stimulation using two simple computations: temporal summation followed by a compressive nonlinearity. Our new temporal compressive summation model captures (1) subadditive temporal summation, and (2) adaptation. We show that the model accounts for systematic differences in these phenomena across visual areas. Finally, we show that for space and time, the visual system uses a similar strategy to achieve increasingly invariant representations of the visual world.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Sustained MAPK/ERK Activation in Adult Schwann Cells Impairs Nerve Repair</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/3/679?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The MAPK/ERK pathway has a critical role in PNS development. It is required for Schwann cell (SC) differentiation and myelination; sustained embryonic MAPK/ERK activation in SCs enhances myelin growth overcoming signals that normally end myelination. Excess activation of this pathway can be maladaptive as in adulthood acute strong activation of MAPK/ERK has been shown to cause SC dedifferentiation and demyelination. We used a mouse model (including male and female animals) in which the gain-of-function &lt;i&gt;MEK1DD&lt;/i&gt; allele produces sustained MAPK/ERK activation in adult SCs, and we determined the impact of such activation on nerve repair. In the uninjured nerve, MAPK/ERK activation neither impaired myelin nor reactivated myelination. However, in the injured nerve it was detrimental and resulted in delayed repair and functional recovery. In the early phase of injury, the rate of myelin clearance was faster. Four weeks following injury, when nerve repair is normally advanced, myelinated axons of &lt;i&gt;MEK1DD&lt;/i&gt; mutants demonstrated higher rates of myelin decompaction, a reduced number of Cajal bands. and decreased internodal length. We noted the presence of abnormal Remak bundles with long SCs processes and reduced numbers of C-fibers/Remak bundle. Both the total number of regenerating axons and the intraepidermal nerve fiber density in the skin were reduced. Sustained activation of MAPK/ERK in adult SCs is therefore deleterious to successful nerve repair, emphasizing the differences in the signaling processes coordinating nerve development and repair. Our results also underline the key role of SCs in axon regeneration and successful target reinnervation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The MAPK/ERK pathway promotes developmental myelination and its sustained activation in SCs induced continuous myelin growth, compensating for the absence of essential myelination signals. However, the strength of activation is fundamental because acute strong induction of MAPK/ERK in adulthood induces demyelination. What has been unknown is the effect of a mild but sustained MAPK/ERK activation in SCs on nerve repair in adulthood. This promoted myelin clearance but led to abnormalities in nonmyelinating and myelinating SCs in the later phases of nerve repair, resulting in slowed axon regeneration, cutaneous reinnervation, and functional recovery. Our results emphasize the distinct role of the MAPK/ERK pathway in developmental myelination versus remyelination and the importance of signaling between SCs and axons for successful axon regeneration.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Object Representations in Human Visual Cortex Formed Through Temporal Integration of Dynamic Partial Shape Views</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/3/659?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;We typically recognize visual objects using the spatial layout of their parts, which are present simultaneously on the retina. Therefore, shape extraction is based on integration of the relevant retinal information over space. The lateral occipital complex (LOC) can represent shape faithfully in such conditions. However, integration over time is sometimes required to determine object shape. To study shape extraction through temporal integration of successive partial shape views, we presented human participants (both men and women) with artificial shapes that moved behind a narrow vertical or horizontal slit. Only a tiny fraction of the shape was visible at any instant at the same retinal location. However, observers perceived a coherent whole shape instead of a jumbled pattern. Using fMRI and multivoxel pattern analysis, we searched for brain regions that encode temporally integrated shape identity. We further required that the representation of shape should be invariant to changes in the slit orientation. We show that slit-invariant shape information is most accurate in the LOC. Importantly, the slit-invariant shape representations matched the conventional whole-shape representations assessed during full-image runs. Moreover, when the same slit-dependent shape slivers were shuffled, thereby preventing their spatiotemporal integration, slit-invariant shape information was reduced dramatically. The slit-invariant representation of the various shapes also mirrored the structure of shape perceptual space as assessed by perceptual similarity judgment tests. Therefore, the LOC is likely to mediate temporal integration of slit-dependent shape views, generating a slit-invariant whole-shape percept. These findings provide strong evidence for a global encoding of shape in the LOC regardless of integration processes required to generate the shape percept.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Visual objects are recognized through spatial integration of features available simultaneously on the retina. The lateral occipital complex (LOC) represents shape faithfully in such conditions even if the object is partially occluded. However, shape must sometimes be reconstructed over both space and time. Such is the case in anorthoscopic perception, when an object is moving behind a narrow slit. In this scenario, spatial information is limited at any moment so the whole-shape percept can only be inferred by integration of successive shape views over time. We find that LOC carries shape-specific information recovered using such temporal integration processes. The shape representation is invariant to slit orientation and is similar to that evoked by a fully viewed image. Existing models of object recognition lack such capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Local Inhibition of PERK Enhances Memory and Reverses Age-Related Deterioration of Cognitive and Neuronal Properties</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/3/648?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Protein kinase R (PKR)-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK) is one of four known kinases that respond to cellular stress by deactivating the eukaryotic initiation factor 2 α (eIF2α) or other signal transduction cascades. Recently, both eIF2α and its kinases were found to play a role in normal and pathological brain function. Here, we show that reduction of either the amount or the activity of PERK, specifically in the CA1 region of the hippocampus in young adult male mice, enhances neuronal excitability and improves cognitive function. In addition, this manipulation rescues the age-dependent cellular phenotype of reduced excitability and memory decline. Specifically, the reduction of PERK expression in the CA1 region of the hippocampus of middle-aged male mice using a viral vector rejuvenates hippocampal function and improves hippocampal-dependent learning. These results delineate a mechanism for behavior and neuronal aging and position PERK as a promising therapeutic target for age-dependent brain malfunction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; We found that local reduced protein kinase R (PKR)-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK) expression or activity in the hippocampus enhances neuronal excitability and cognitive function in young normal mice, that old CA1 pyramidal cells have reduced excitability and increased PERK expression that can be rescued by reducing PERK expression in the hippocampus, and that reducing PERK expression in the hippocampus of middle-aged mice enhances hippocampal-dependent learning and memory and restores it to normal performance levels of young mice. These findings uncover an entirely new biological link among PERK, neuronal intrinsic properties, aging, and cognitive function. Moreover, our findings propose a new way to fight mild cognitive impairment and aging-related cognitive deterioration.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Repositioning of Somatic Golgi Apparatus Is Essential for the Dendritic Establishment of Adult-Born Hippocampal Neurons</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/3/631?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;New dentate granule cells (DGCs) are continuously generated, and integrate into the preexisting hippocampal network in the adult brain. How an adult-born neuron with initially simple spindle-like morphology develops into a DGC, consisting of a single apical dendrite with further branches, remains largely unknown. Here, using retroviruses to birth date and manipulate newborn neurons, we examined initial dendritic formation and possible underlying mechanisms. We found that GFP-expressing newborn cells began to establish a DGC-like morphology at ~7 d after birth, with a primary dendrite pointing to the molecular layer, but at this stage, with several neurites in the neurogenic zone. Interestingly, the Golgi apparatus, an essential organelle for neurite growth and maintenance, was dynamically repositioning in the soma of newborn cells during this initial integration stage. Two weeks after birth, by which time most neurites in the neurogenic zone were eliminated, a compact Golgi apparatus was positioned exclusively at the base of the primary dendrite. We analyzed the presence of Golgi-associated genes using single-cell transcriptomes of newborn DGCs, and among Golgi-related genes, found the presence of &lt;i&gt;STK25&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;STRAD&lt;/i&gt;, regulators of embryonic neuronal development. When we knocked down either of these two proteins, we found Golgi mislocalization and extensive aberrant dendrite formation. Furthermore, overexpression of a mutated form of STRAD, underlying the disorder polyhydramnios, megalencephaly, and symptomatic epilepsy, characterized by abnormal brain development and intractable epilepsy, caused similar defects in Golgi localization and dendrite formation in adult-born neurons. Together, our findings reveal a role for Golgi repositioning in regulating the initial integration of adult-born DGCs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Since the discovery of the continuous generation of new neurons in the adult hippocampus, extensive effort was directed toward understanding the functional contribution of these newborn neurons to the existing hippocampal circuit and associated behaviors, while the molecular mechanisms controlling their early morphological integration are less well understood. Dentate granule cells (DGCs) have a single, complex, apical dendrite. The events leading adult-born DGCs' to transition from simple spindle-like morphology to mature dendrite morphology are largely unknown. We studied establishment of newborn DGCs dendritic pattern and found it was mediated by a signaling pathway regulating precise localization of the Golgi apparatus. Furthermore, this Golgi-associated mechanism for dendrite establishment might be impaired in a human genetic epilepsy syndrome, polyhydramnios, megalencephaly, and symptomatic epilepsy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: An Image-Based miRNA Screen Identifies miRNA-135s As Regulators of CNS Axon Growth and Regeneration by Targeting Krüppel-like Factor 4</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/3/613?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;During embryonic development, axons extend over long distances to establish functional connections. In contrast, axon regeneration in the adult mammalian CNS is limited in part by a reduced intrinsic capacity for axon growth. Therefore, insight into the intrinsic control of axon growth may provide new avenues for enhancing CNS regeneration. Here, we performed one of the first miRNome-wide functional miRNA screens to identify miRNAs with robust effects on axon growth. High-content screening identified miR-135a and miR-135b as potent stimulators of axon growth and cortical neuron migration &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; in male and female mice. Intriguingly, both of these developmental effects of miR-135s relied in part on silencing of Krüppel-like factor 4 (KLF4), a well known intrinsic inhibitor of axon growth and regeneration. These results prompted us to test the effect of miR-135s on axon regeneration after injury. Our results show that intravitreal application of miR-135s facilitates retinal ganglion cell (RGC) axon regeneration after optic nerve injury in adult mice in part by repressing KLF4. In contrast, depletion of miR-135s further reduced RGC axon regeneration. Together, these data identify a novel neuronal role for miR-135s and the miR-135–KLF4 pathway and highlight the potential of miRNAs as tools for enhancing CNS axon regeneration.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Inhibition in Simple Cell Receptive Fields Is Broad and OFF-Subregion Biased</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/3/595?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Inhibition in thalamorecipient layer 4 simple cells of primary visual cortex is believed to play important roles in establishing visual response properties and integrating visual inputs across their receptive fields (RFs). Simple cell RFs are characterized by nonoverlapping, spatially restricted subregions in which visual stimuli can either increase or decrease the firing rate of the cell, depending on contrast. Inhibition is believed to be triggered exclusively from visual stimulation of individual RF subregions. However, this view is at odds with the known anatomy of layer 4 interneurons in visual cortex and differs from recent findings in mouse visual cortex. Here we show with &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; intracellular recordings in cats that while excitation is restricted to RF subregions, inhibition spans the width of simple cell RFs. Consequently, excitatory stimuli within a subregion concomitantly drive excitation and inhibition. Furthermore, we found that the distribution of inhibition across the RF is stronger toward OFF subregions. This inhibitory OFF-subregion bias has a functional consequence on spatial integration of inputs across the RF. A model based on the known anatomy of layer 4 demonstrates that the known proportion and connectivity of inhibitory neurons in layer 4 of primary visual cortex is sufficient to explain broad inhibition with an OFF-subregion bias while generating a variety of phase relations, including antiphase, between excitation and inhibition in response to drifting gratings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The wiring of excitatory and inhibitory neurons in cortical circuits is key to determining the response properties in sensory cortex. In the visual cortex, the first cells that receive visual input are simple cells in layer 4. The underlying circuitry responsible for the response properties of simple cells is not yet known. In this study, we challenge a long-held view concerning the pattern of inhibitory input and provide results that agree with current known anatomy. We show here that inhibition is evoked broadly across the receptive fields of simple cells, and we identify a surprising bias in inhibition within the receptive field. Our findings represent a step toward a unified view of inhibition across different species and sensory systems.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: A New, High-Efficacy, Noninvasive Transcranial Electric Stimulation Tuned to Local Neurodynamics</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/3/586?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In this paper, we pose the following working hypothesis: in humans, transcranial electric stimulation (tES) with a time course that mimics the endogenous activity of its target is capable of altering the target's excitability. In our case, the target was the primary motor cortex (M1). We identified the endogenous neurodynamics of hand M1's subgroups of pyramidal neuronal pools in each of our subjects by applying Functional Source Separation (FSS) to their EEG recordings. We then tested whether the corticospinal excitability of the hand representation under the above described stimulation, which we named transcranial individual neurodynamics stimulation (tIDS), was higher than in the absence of stimulation (baseline). As a check, we compared tIDS with the most efficient noninvasive facilitatory corticospinal tES known so far, which is 20 Hz transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS). The control conditions were as follows: (1) sham, (2) transcranial random noise stimulation (tRNS) in the same frequency range as tIDS (1–250 Hz), and (3) a low current tIDS (tIDS&lt;sub&gt;low&lt;/sub&gt;). Corticospinal excitability was measured with motor-evoked potentials under transcranial magnetic stimulation. The mean motor-evoked potential amplitude increase was 31% of the baseline during tIDS (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001), and it was 15% during tACS (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.096). tRNS, tIDS&lt;sub&gt;low&lt;/sub&gt;, and sham induced no effects. Whereas tACS did not produce an enhancement in any subject at the individual level, tIDS was successful in producing an enhancement in 8 of the 16 subjects. The results of the present proof-of-principle study showed that proper exploitation of local neurodynamics can enhance the efficacy of personalized tES.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; This study demonstrated that, in humans, transcranial individual neurodynamics stimulation (tIDS), which mimics the endogenous dynamics of the target neuronal pools, effectively changes the excitability of these pools. tIDS holds promise for high-efficacy personalized neuromodulations based on individual local neurodynamics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Inactivation of NMDA Receptors in the Ventral Tegmental Area during Cocaine Self-Administration Prevents GluA1 Upregulation but with Paradoxical Increases in Cocaine-Seeking Behavior</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/3/575?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Cocaine self-administration increases expression of GluA1 subunits in ventral tegmental area (VTA) dopamine neurons, which subsequently enhance the motivation for cocaine. This increase in GluA1 may be dependent on concomitant NMDA receptor (NMDAR) activation during self-administration, similar to cocaine-induced long-term potentiation in the VTA. In this study, we used viral-mediated expression of a dominant-negative GluN1 subunit (HSV-dnGluN1) in VTA neurons to study the effect of transient NMDAR inactivation on the GluA1 increases induced by chronic cocaine self-administration in male rats. We found that dnGluN1 expression in the VTA limited to the 3 weeks of cocaine self-administration prevents the subsequent increase in tissue GluA1 levels when compared with control infusions of HSV-LacZ. Surprisingly, dnGluN1 expression led to an enhancement in the motivation to self-administer cocaine as measured using a progressive ratio reinforcement schedule and to enhanced cocaine seeking measured in extinction/reinstatement tests following an extended 3 week withdrawal period. Despite blocking tissue GluA1 increases in cocaine self-administering animals, the HSV-dnGluN1 treatment resulted in increased membrane levels of GluA1 and GluN2B, along with markedly higher locomotor responses to intra-VTA infusions of AMPA, suggesting a paradoxical increase in VTA AMPA receptor responsiveness. Together, these data suggest that NMDARs mediate cocaine-induced increases in VTA GluA1 expression, but such transient NMDAR inactivation also leads to compensatory scaling of synaptic AMPA receptors that enhance the motivational for cocaine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Dopamine neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) are critical substrates of drug rewards. Animal models indicate that chronic cocaine use enhances excitatory glutamatergic input to these neurons, making them more susceptible to environmental stimuli that trigger drug craving and relapse. We previously found that self-administration of cocaine increases AMPA glutamate receptors in the VTA, and this effect enhances motivation for cocaine. Here we report that the mechanism for this upregulation involves NMDA receptor activity during cocaine use. While interference with NMDA receptor function blocks AMPA receptor upregulation, it also produces a paradoxical enhancement in membrane AMPA receptor subunits, AMPA responsiveness, and the motivation for cocaine. Thus, pharmacotherapy targeting NMDA receptors may inadvertently produce substantial adverse consequences for cocaine addiction.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Phosphorylated CCAAT/Enhancer Binding Protein {beta} Contributes to Rat HIV-Related Neuropathic Pain: In Vitro and In Vivo Studies</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/3/555?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Chronic pain is increasingly recognized as an important comorbidity of HIV-infected patients, however, the exact molecular mechanisms of HIV-related pain are still elusive. CCAAT/enhancer binding proteins (C/EBPs) are expressed in various tissues, including the CNS. C/EBPβ, one of the C/EBPs, is involved in the progression of HIV/AIDS, but the exact role of C/EBPβ and its upstream factors are not clear in HIV pain state. Here, we used a neuropathic pain model of perineural HIV envelope glycoprotein gp120 application onto the rat sciatic nerve to test the role of phosphorylated C/EBPβ (pC/EBPβ) and its upstream pathway in the spinal cord dorsal horn (SCDH). HIV gp120 induced overexpression of pC/EBPβ in the ipsilateral SCDH compared with contralateral SCDH. Inhibition of C/EBPβ using siRNA against C/EBPβ reduced mechanical allodynia. HIV gp120 also increased TNFα, TNFRI, mitochondrial superoxide (mtO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;·–&lt;/sup&gt;), and pCREB in the ipsilateral SCDH. ChIP-qPCR assay showed that pCREB enrichment on the C/EBPβ gene promoter regions in rats with gp120 was higher than that in sham rats. Intrathecal TNF soluble receptor I (functionally blocking TNFα bioactivity) or knockdown of TNFRI using antisense oligodeoxynucleotide against TNFRI reduced mechanical allodynia, and decreased mtO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;·–&lt;/sup&gt;, pCREB and pC/EBPβ. Intrathecal Mito-tempol (a mitochondria-targeted O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;·–&lt;/sup&gt;scavenger) reduced mechanical allodynia and decreased pCREB and pC/EBPβ. Knockdown of CREB with antisense oligodeoxynucleotide against CREB reduced mechanical allodynia and lowered pC/EBPβ. These results suggested that the pathway of TNFα/TNFRI–mtO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;·–&lt;/sup&gt;–pCREB triggers pC/EBPβ in the HIV gp120-induced neuropathic pain state. Furthermore, we confirmed the pathway using both cultured neurons treated with recombinant TNFα &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; and repeated intrathecal injection of recombinant TNFα in naive rats. This finding provides new insights in the understanding of the HIV neuropathic pain mechanisms and treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Painful HIV-associated sensory neuropathy is a neurological complication of HIV infection. Phosphorylated C/EBPβ (pC/EBPβ) influences AIDS progression, but it is still not clear about the exact role of pC/EBPβ and the detailed upstream factors of pC/EBPβ in HIV-related pain. In a neuropathic pain model of perineural HIV gp120 application onto the sciatic nerve, we found that pC/EBPβ was triggered by TNFα/TNFRI–mtO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;·–&lt;/sup&gt;–pCREB signaling pathway. The pathway was confirmed by using cultured neurons treated with recombinant TNFα &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;, and by repeated intrathecal injection of recombinant TNFα in naive rats. The present results revealed the functional significance of TNFα/TNFRI–mtO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;·–&lt;/sup&gt;–pCREB–pC/EBPβ signaling in HIV neuropathic pain, and should help in the development of more specific treatments for neuropathic pain.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Endocannabinoid-Specific Impairment in Synaptic Plasticity in Striatum of Huntington's Disease Mouse Model</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/3/544?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Huntington's disease (HD) is an inherited neurodegenerative disease affecting predominantly striatum and cortex that results in motor and cognitive disorders. Before a motor phenotype, animal models of HD show aberrant cortical-striatal glutamate signaling. Here, we tested synaptic plasticity of cortical excitatory synapses onto striatal spiny projection neurons (SPNs) early in the YAC128 mouse model of HD. High-frequency stimulation-induced long-term depression, mediated by the endocannabinoid anandamide and cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1), was significantly attenuated in male and female YAC128 SPNs. Indirect pathway SPNs, which are more vulnerable in HD, were most affected. Our experiments show metabotropic glutamate receptor and endocannabinoid 2-arachidonoylglycerol-dependent plasticity, as well as direct CB1 activation by agonists, was similar in YAC128 and FVB/N wild-type SPNs suggesting that presynaptic CB1 is functioning normally. These results are consistent with a specific impairment in postsynaptic anandamide synthesis in YAC128 SPN. Strikingly, although suppression of degradation of anandamide was not effective, elevating 2-arachidonoylglycerol levels restored long-term depression in YAC128 striatal neurons. Together, these results have potential implications for neuroprotection and ameliorating early cognitive and motor deficits in HD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Huntington's disease (HD) is an inherited neurodegenerative disease with no cure. Recent studies find impairment of the endocannabinoid system in animal models but the functional implication for synaptic plasticity in HD remains unclear. Sepers et al. show a selective deficit in synaptic plasticity mediated by the endocannabinoid anandamide, but not 2-arachidonoylglycerol in a mouse model of HD. The deficit is rescued by selectively elevating levels of 2-arachidonoylglycerol produced on-demand. This mechanism could be targeted in the development of future therapeutics for HD.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Entorhinal Tau Pathology, Episodic Memory Decline, and Neurodegeneration in Aging</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/3/530?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The medial temporal lobe (MTL) is an early site of tau accumulation and MTL dysfunction may underlie episodic-memory decline in aging and dementia. Postmortem data indicate that tau pathology in the transentorhinal cortex is common by age 60, whereas spread to neocortical regions and worsening of cognition is associated with β-amyloid (Aβ). We used [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]AV-1451 and [&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;C]PiB positron emission tomography, structural MRI, and neuropsychological assessment to investigate how &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; tau accumulation in temporal lobe regions, Aβ, and MTL atrophy contribute to episodic memory in cognitively normal older adults (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 83; age, 77 ± 6 years; 58% female). Stepwise regressions identified tau in MTL regions known to be affected in old age as the best predictor of episodic-memory performance independent of Aβ status. There was no interactive effect of MTL tau with Aβ on memory. Higher MTL tau was related to higher age in the subjects without evidence of Aβ. Among temporal lobe subregions, episodic memory was most strongly related to tau-tracer uptake in the parahippocampal gyrus, particularly the posterior entorhinal cortex, which in our parcellation includes the transentorhinal cortex. In subjects with longitudinal MRI and cognitive data (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 57), entorhinal atrophy mirrored patterns of tau pathology and their relationship with memory decline. Our data are consistent with neuropathological studies and further suggest that entorhinal tau pathology underlies memory decline in old age even without Aβ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Tau tangles and β-amyloid (Aβ) plaques are key lesions in Alzheimer's disease (AD) but both pathologies also occur in cognitively normal older people. Neuropathological data indicate that tau tangles in the medial temporal lobe (MTL) underlie episodic-memory impairments in AD dementia. However, it remains unclear whether MTL tau pathology also accounts for memory impairments often seen in elderly people and how Aβ affects this relationship. Using tau-specific and Aβ-specific positron emission tomography tracers, we show that &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; MTL tau pathology is associated with episodic-memory performance and MTL atrophy in cognitively normal adults, independent of Aβ. Our data point to MTL tau pathology, particularly in the entorhinal cortex, as a substrate of age-related episodic-memory loss.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: MT3-MMP Promotes Excitatory Synapse Formation by Promoting Nogo-66 Receptor Ectodomain Shedding</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/3/518?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Cell-surface molecules are dynamically regulated at the synapse to assemble and disassemble adhesive contacts that are important for synaptogenesis and for tuning synaptic transmission. Metalloproteinases dynamically regulate cellular behaviors through the processing of cell surface molecules. In the present study, we evaluated the role of membrane-type metalloproteinases (MT-MMPs) in excitatory synaptogenesis. We find that MT3-MMP and MT5-MMP are broadly expressed in the mouse cerebral cortex and that MT3-MMP loss-of-function interferes with excitatory synapse development in dissociated cortical neurons and in &lt;i&gt;vivo&lt;/i&gt;. We identify Nogo-66 receptor (NgR1) as an MT3-MMP substrate that is required for MT3-MMP-dependent synapse formation. Introduction of the shed ectodomain of NgR1 is sufficient to accelerate excitatory synapse formation in dissociated cortical neurons and in &lt;i&gt;vivo&lt;/i&gt;. Together, our findings support a role for MT3-MMP-dependent shedding of NgR1 in regulating excitatory synapse development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; In this study, we identify MT3-MMP, a membrane-bound zinc protease, to be necessary for the development of excitatory synapses in cortical neurons. We identify Nogo-66 receptors (NgR1) as a downstream target of MT3-MMP proteolytic activity. Furthermore, processing of surface NgR1 by MT3-MMP generates a soluble ectodomain fragment that accelerates the formation of excitatory synapses. We propose that MT3-MMP activity and NgR1 shedding could stimulate circuitry remodeling in the adult brain and enhance functional connectivity after brain injury.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Eligibility Traces and Plasticity on Behavioral Time Scales: Experimental Support of neoHebbian Three-Factor Learning Rules. (arXiv:1801.05219v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1801.05219</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Most elementary behaviors such as moving the arm to grasp an object or
walking into the next room to explore a museum evolve on the time scale of
seconds; in contrast, neuronal action potentials occur on the time scale of a
few milliseconds. Learning rules of the brain must therefore bridge the gap
between these two different time scales.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modern theories of synaptic plasticity have postulated that the co-activation
of pre- and postsynaptic neurons sets a flag at the synapse, called an
eligibility trace, that leads to a weight change only if an additional factor
is present while the flag is set. This third factor, signaling reward,
punishment, surprise, or novelty, could be implemented by the phasic activity
of neuromodulators or specific neuronal inputs signaling special events. While
the theoretical framework has been developed over the last decades,
experimental evidence in support of eligibility traces on the time scale of
seconds has been collected only during the last few years.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here we review, in the context of three-factor rules of synaptic plasticity,
four key experiments that support the role of synaptic eligibility traces in
combination with a third factor as a biological implementation of neoHebbian
three-factor learning rules.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Constraint-free Natural Image Reconstruction from fMRI Signals Based on Convolutional Neural Network. (arXiv:1801.05151v1 [cs.CV])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1801.05151</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In recent years, research on decoding brain activity based on functional
magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has made remarkable achievements. However,
constraint-free natural image reconstruction from brain activity is still a
challenge. The existing methods simplified the problem by using semantic prior
information or just reconstructing simple images such as letters and digitals.
Without semantic prior information, we present a novel method to reconstruct
nature images from fMRI signals of human visual cortex based on the computation
model of convolutional neural network (CNN). Firstly, we extracted the units
output of viewed natural images in each layer of a pre-trained CNN as CNN
features. Secondly, we transformed image reconstruction from fMRI signals into
the problem of CNN feature visualizations by training a sparse linear
regression to map from the fMRI patterns to CNN features. By iteratively
optimization to find the matched image, whose CNN unit features become most
similar to those predicted from the brain activity, we finally achieved the
promising results for the challenging constraint-free natural image
reconstruction. As there was no use of semantic prior information of the
stimuli when training decoding model, any category of images (not constraint by
the training set) could be reconstructed theoretically. We found that the
reconstructed images resembled the natural stimuli, especially in position and
shape. The experimental results suggest that hierarchical visual features can
effectively express the visual perception process of human brain.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1801.05116</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Neurostimulation is a promising therapy for abating epileptic seizures.
However, it is extremely difficult to identify optimal stimulation patterns
experimentally. In this study human recordings are used to develop a functional
24 neuron network statistical model of hippocampal connectivity and dynamics.
Spontaneous seizure-like activity is induced in-silico in this reconstructed
neuronal network. The network is then used as a testbed to design and validate
a wide range of neurostimulation patterns. Commonly used periodic trains were
not able to permanently abate seizures at any frequency. A simulated annealing
global optimization algorithm was then used to identify an optimal stimulation
pattern which successfully abated 92% of seizures. Finally, in a fully
responsive, or &quot;closed-loop&quot; neurostimulation paradigm, the optimal stimulation
successfully prevented the network from entering the seizure state. We propose
that the framework presented here for algorithmically identifying
patient-specific neurostimulation patterns can greatly increase the efficacy of
neurostimulation devices for seizures.

magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data remains challenging due to the
pronounced noise in neuroimaging data. In this paper, we proposed a high order
relation informed approach based on hypergraph to combine the information from
multi-task data and resting state data to improve subnetwork extraction. Our
assumption is that task data can be beneficial for the subnetwork extraction
process, since the repeatedly activated nodes involved in diverse tasks might
be the canonical network components which comprise pre-existing repertoires of
resting state subnetworks. Our proposed high order relation informed subnetwork
extraction based on a strength information embedded hypergraph, (1) facilitates
the multisource integration for subnetwork extraction, (2) utilizes information
on relationships and changes between the nodes across different tasks, and (3)
enables the study on higher order relations among brain network nodes. On real
data, we demonstrated that fusing task activation, task-induced connectivity
and resting state functional connectivity based on hypergraphs improves
subnetwork extraction compared to employing a single source from either rest or
task data in terms of subnetwork modularity measure, inter-subject
reproducibility, along with more biologically meaningful subnetwork
assignments.

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: The Roles of Left Versus Right Anterior Temporal Lobes in Semantic Memory: A Neuropsychological Comparison of Postsurgical Temporal Lobe Epilepsy Patients</title>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhx362/4812493?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;The presence and degree of specialization between the anterior temporal lobes (ATLs) is a key issue in debates about the neural architecture of semantic memory. Here, we comprehensively assessed multiple aspects of semantic cognition in a large group of postsurgical temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) patients with left versus right anterior temporal lobectomy (&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;n&lt;/span&gt; = 40). Both subgroups showed deficits in expressive and receptive verbal semantic tasks, word and object recognition, naming and recognition of famous faces and perception of faces and emotions. Graded differences in performance between the left and right groups were secondary to the overall mild semantic impairment; primarily, left resected TLE patients showed weaker performance on tasks that required naming or accessing semantic information from a written word. Right resected TLE patients were relatively more impaired at recognizing famous faces as familiar, although this effect was observed less consistently. These findings unify previous partial, inconsistent results and also align directly with fMRI and transcranial magnetic stimulation results in neurologically intact participants. Taken together, these data support a model in which the 2 ATLs act as a coupled bilateral system for the representation of semantic knowledge, and in which graded hemispheric specializations emerge as a consequence of differential connectivity to lateralized speech production and face perception regions.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Lack of Methyl-CpG Binding Protein 2 (MeCP2) Affects Cell Fate Refinement During Embryonic Cortical Development</title>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhx360/4812492?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;During differentiation, neurons progressively restrict their fate repressing the expression of specific genes. Here we describe the involvement in such developmental steps of the methyl-CpG binding protein 2 (MeCP2), an epigenetic factor that participates to chromatin folding and transcriptional regulation. We previously reported that, due to transcriptional impairments, the maturation of &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Mecp2&lt;/span&gt; null neurons is delayed. To evaluate whether this could stem from altered progenitors proliferation and differentiation, we investigated whether lack of Mecp2 affects these features both in vitro and in vivo. We show that in &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Mecp2&lt;/span&gt; null embryonic cortexes the expression of genes defining the identity of proliferating neuroprogenitors is enriched and that their permanence in the G1 phase is prolonged. Moreover, the number of cells transitioning from a stage of maturation to a more mature one is increased in &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Mecp2&lt;/span&gt; null embryonic cortices, in line with the central role of G1 for cell identity refinement. We thus suggest that, possibly due to the lack of proper transcriptional control normally exerted by Mecp2, fate refinement is impaired in developing null cells. We propose that the maturation delay affecting the developing &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Mecp2&lt;/span&gt; null cortex originates, at least in part, from deranged mechanisms of cell fate refinement.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Neurons in primary visual cortex (V1) are more resilient than those in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) in aging, schizophrenia and Alzheimer’s disease. The current study compared glutamate and neuromodulatory actions in macaque V1 to those in dlPFC, and found striking regional differences. V1 neuronal firing to visual stimuli depended on AMPA receptors, with subtle NMDA receptor contributions, while dlPFC depends primarily on NMDA receptors. Neuromodulatory actions also differed between regions. In V1, cAMP signaling increased neuronal firing, and the phosphodiesterase PDE4A was positioned to regulate cAMP effects on glutamate release from axons. HCN channels in V1 were classically located on distal dendrites, and enhanced cell firing. These data contrast with dlPFC, where PDE4A and HCN channels are concentrated in thin spines, and cAMP-HCN signaling gates inputs and weakens firing. These regional differences may explain why V1 neurons are more resilient than dlPFC neurons to the challenges of age and disease.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

Haploid cells are increasingly used for screening of complex pathways in animal genomes. Hemizygous mutations introduced through viral insertional mutagenesis can be directly selected for phenotypic changes. Here we present HaSAPPy a tool for analysing sequencing datasets of screens using insertional mutations in large pools of haploid cells. Candidate gene prediction is implemented through identification of enrichment of insertional mutations after selection by simultaneously evaluating several parameters. We have developed HaSAPPy for analysis of genetic screens for silencing factors of X chromosome inactivation in haploid mouse embryonic stem cells. To benchmark the performance, we further analyse several datasets of genetic screens in human haploid cells for which candidates have been validated. Our results support the effective candidate prediction strategy of HaSAPPy. HaSAPPy is implemented in Python, licensed under the MIT license, and is available from https://github.com/gdiminin/HaSAPPy.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/3K4LRTS9Xj4&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

The dopamine D2 and D3 receptors (D2R and D3R) are important targets for antipsychotics and for the treatment of drug abuse. SB269652, a bitopic ligand that simultaneously binds both the orthosteric binding site (OBS) and a secondary binding pocket (SBP) in both D2R and D3R, was found to be a negative allosteric modulator. Previous studies identified Glu&lt;sup&gt;2.65&lt;/sup&gt; in the SBP to be a key determinant of both the affinity of SB269652 and the magnitude of its cooperativity with orthosteric ligands, as the E&lt;sup&gt;2.65&lt;/sup&gt;A mutation decreased both of these parameters. However, the proposed hydrogen bond (H-bond) between Glu&lt;sup&gt;2.65&lt;/sup&gt; and the indole moiety of SB269652 is not a strong interaction, and a structure activity relationship study of SB269652 indicates that this H-bond may not be the only element that determines its allosteric properties. To understand the structural basis of the observed phenotype of E&lt;sup&gt;2.65&lt;/sup&gt;A, we carried out molecular dynamics simulations with a cumulative length of ~77 μs of D2R and D3R wild-type and their E&lt;sup&gt;2.65&lt;/sup&gt;A mutants bound to SB269652. In combination with Markov state model analysis and by characterizing the equilibria of ligand binding modes in different conditions, we found that in both D2R and D3R, whereas the tetrahydroisoquinoline moiety of SB269652 is stably bound in the OBS, the indole-2-carboxamide moiety is dynamic and only intermittently forms H-bonds with Glu&lt;sup&gt;2.65&lt;/sup&gt;. Our results also indicate that the E&lt;sup&gt;2.65&lt;/sup&gt;A mutation significantly affects the overall shape and size of the SBP, as well as the conformation of the N terminus. Thus, our findings suggest that the key role of Glu&lt;sup&gt;2.65&lt;/sup&gt; in mediating the allosteric properties of SB269652 extends beyond a direct interaction with SB269652, and provide structural insights for rational design of SB269652 derivatives that may retain its allosteric properties.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/vUXB3FyjueQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Microbiota contribute to many dimensions of host phenotype, including disease. To link specific microbes to specific phenotypes, microbiome-wide association studies compare microbial abundances between two groups of samples. Abundance differences, however, reflect not only direct associations with the phenotype, but also indirect effects due to microbial interactions. We found that microbial interactions could easily generate a large number of spurious associations that provide no mechanistic insight. Using techniques from statistical physics, we developed a method to remove indirect associations and applied it to the largest dataset on pediatric inflammatory bowel disease. Our method corrected the inflation of p-values in standard association tests and showed that only a small subset of associations is directly linked to the disease. Direct associations had a much higher accuracy in separating cases from controls and pointed to immunomodulation, butyrate production, and the brain-gut axis as important factors in the inflammatory bowel disease.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/ghtaTpcnfg4&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Synchronization of neural oscillations as a mechanism of brain function is attracting increasing attention. Neural oscillation is a rhythmic neural activity that can be easily observed by noninvasive electroencephalography (EEG). Neural oscillations show the same frequency and cross-frequency synchronization for various cognitive and perceptual functions. However, it is unclear how this neural synchronization is achieved by a dynamical system. If neural oscillations are weakly coupled oscillators, the dynamics of neural synchronization can be described theoretically using a phase oscillator model. We propose an estimation method to identify the phase oscillator model from real data of cross-frequency synchronized activities. The proposed method can estimate the coupling function governing the properties of synchronization. Furthermore, we examine the reliability of the proposed method using time-series data obtained from numerical simulation and an electronic circuit experiment, and show that our method can estimate the coupling function correctly. Finally, we estimate the coupling function between EEG oscillation and the speech sound envelope, and discuss the validity of these results.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/2Kx1kMq3n-k&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Inferring cell state by quantitative motility analysis reveals a dynamic state system and broken detailed balance</title>

Cell populations display heterogeneous and dynamic phenotypic states at multiple scales. Similar to molecular features commonly used to explore cell heterogeneity, cell behavior is a rich phenotypic space that may allow for identification of relevant cell states. Inference of cell state from cell behavior across a time course may enable the investigation of dynamics of transitions between heterogeneous cell states, a task difficult to perform with destructive molecular observations. Cell motility is one such easily observed cell behavior with known biomedical relevance. To investigate heterogenous cell states and their dynamics through the lens of cell behavior, we developed Heteromotility, a software tool to extract quantitative motility features from timelapse cell images. In mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), myoblasts, and muscle stem cells (MuSCs), Heteromotility analysis identifies multiple motility phenotypes within the population. In all three systems, the motility state identity of individual cells is dynamic. Quantification of state transitions reveals that MuSCs undergoing activation transition through progressive motility states toward the myoblast phenotype. Transition rates during MuSC activation suggest non-linear kinetics. By probability flux analysis, we find that this MuSC motility state system breaks detailed balance, while the MEF and myoblast systems do not. Balanced behavior state transitions can be captured by equilibrium formalisms, while unbalanced switching between states violates equilibrium conditions and would require an external driving force. Our data indicate that the system regulating cell behavior can be decomposed into a set of attractor states which depend on the identity of the cell, together with a set of transitions between states. These results support a conceptual view of a cell populations as dynamical systems, responding to inputs from signaling pathways and generating outputs in the form of state transitions and observable motile behaviors.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/zgpmnQO7N_w&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Ideal decision-makers should constantly assess all sources of information about opportunities and threats, and be able to redetermine their choices promptly in the face of change. However, perpetual monitoring and reassessment impose inordinate sensing and computational costs, making them impractical for animals and machines alike. The obvious alternative of committing for extended periods of time to limited sensory strategies associated with particular courses of action can be dangerous and wasteful. Here, we explore the intermediate possibility of making provisional temporal commitments whilst admitting interruption based on limited broader observation. We simulate foraging under threat of predation to elucidate the benefits of such a scheme. We relate our results to diseases of distractibility and roving attention, and consider mechanistic substrates such as noradrenergic neuromodulation.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/k-qhdPPb-R0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: A model for cooperative gating of L-type Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; channels and its effects on cardiac alternans dynamics</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/bxIzGj3eW-A/article</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Daisuke Sato, Rose E. Dixon, Luis F. Santana, Manuel F. Navedo&lt;/p&gt;

In ventricular myocytes, membrane depolarization during the action potential (AP) causes synchronous activation of multiple L-type Ca&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;1.2 channels (LTCCs), which trigger the release of calcium (Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;) from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). This results in an increase in intracellular Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; (Ca&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;) that initiates contraction. During &lt;i&gt;pulsus alternans&lt;/i&gt;, cardiac contraction is unstable, going from weak to strong in successive beats despite a constant heart rate. These cardiac alternans can be caused by the instability of membrane potential (V&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;) due to steep AP duration (APD) restitution (V&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;-driven alternans), instability of Ca&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; cycling (Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-driven alternans), or both, and may be modulated by functional coupling between clustered Ca&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;1.2 (e.g. cooperative gating). Here, mathematical analysis and computational models were used to determine how changes in the strength of cooperative gating between LTCCs may impact membrane voltage and intracellular Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; dynamics in the heart. We found that increasing the degree of coupling between LTCCs increases the amplitude of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; currents (I&lt;sub&gt;CaL&lt;/sub&gt;) and prolongs AP duration (APD). Increased AP duration is known to promote cardiac alternans, a potentially arrhythmogenic substrate. In addition, our analysis shows that increasing the strength of cooperative activation of LTCCs makes the coupling of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; on the membrane voltage (Ca&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;→V&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; coupling) more positive and destabilizes the V&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;-Ca&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; dynamics for V&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;-driven alternans and Ca&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;-driven alternans, but not for quasiperiodic oscillation. These results suggest that cooperative gating of LTCCs may have a major impact on cardiac excitation-contraction coupling, not only by prolonging APD, but also by altering Ca&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;→V&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; coupling and potentially promoting cardiac arrhythmias.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/bxIzGj3eW-A&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Transcriptome-wide time series expression profiling is used to characterize the cellular response to environmental perturbations. The first step to analyzing transcriptional response data is often to cluster genes with similar responses. Here, we present a nonparametric model-based method, Dirichlet process Gaussian process mixture model (DPGP), which jointly models cluster number with a Dirichlet process and temporal dependencies with Gaussian processes. We demonstrate the accuracy of DPGP in comparison to state-of-the-art approaches using hundreds of simulated data sets. To further test our method, we apply DPGP to published microarray data from a microbial model organism exposed to stress and to novel RNA-seq data from a human cell line exposed to the glucocorticoid dexamethasone. We validate our clusters by examining local transcription factor binding and histone modifications. Our results demonstrate that jointly modeling cluster number and temporal dependencies can reveal shared regulatory mechanisms.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A large body of compelling evidence has been accumulated demonstrating that
embodiment - the agent's physical setup, including its shape, materials,
sensors and actuators - is constitutive for any form of cognition and as a
consequence, models of cognition need to be embodied. In contrast to methods
from empirical sciences to study cognition, robots can be freely manipulated
and virtually all key variables of their embodiment and control programs can be
systematically varied. As such, they provide an extremely powerful tool of
investigation. We present a robotic bottom-up or developmental approach,
focusing on three stages: (a) low-level behaviors like walking and reflexes,
(b) learning regularities in sensorimotor spaces, and (c) human-like cognition.
We also show that robotic based research is not only a productive path to
deepening our understanding of cognition, but that robots can strongly benefit
from human-like cognition in order to become more autonomous, robust,
resilient, and safe.

noisy, complex and display statistical properties that evolve continuously over

non-stationary surrogates to detect spatial coherent patterns in non-

surrogate data used here are realisations of a non-stationary linear stochastic
process, preserving both the amplitude and time-frequency distributions of
original data. These surrogate data are used in combination with an extension
of the wavelet coherence to multivariate signals to detect short-lived coherent
spatial patterns. We evaluate this framework on synthetic and real-world time
series, and we show that it can provide useful insights into the time-resolved
structure of spatially extended systems.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The formation of pattern in biological systems may be modeled by a set of
reaction-diffusion equations. A diffusion-type coupling operator biologically
significant in neuroscience is a difference of Gaussian functions (Mexican Hat
operator) used as a spatial-convolution kernel. We are interested in the
difference among behaviors of \emph{stochastic} neural field equations, namely
space-time stochastic differential-integral equations, and similar
deterministic ones. We explore, quantitatively, how the parameters of our model
that measure the shape of the coupling kernel, coupling strength, and aspects
of the spatially-smoothed space-time noise, control the pattern in the
resulting evolving random field. We find that a spatial pattern that is damped
in time in a deterministic system may be sustained and amplified by
stochasticity, most strikingly at an optimal spatio-temporal noise level. In
addition, we find that spatially-smoothed noise alone causes pattern formation
even without spatial coupling.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Sex differences in network controllability as a predictor of executive function in youth. (arXiv:1801.04623v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1801.04623</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Executive function emerges late in development and displays different
developmental trends in males and females. Sex differences in executive
function in youth have been linked to vulnerability to psychopathology as well
as to behaviors that impinge on health. Yet, the neurobiological basis of these
differences is not well understood. Here we test the hypothesis that sex
differences in executive function in youth stem from sex differences in the
controllability of structural brain networks as they rewire over development.
Combining methods from network neuroscience and network control theory, we
characterize the network control properties of structural brain networks
estimated from diffusion imaging data acquired in males and females in a sample
of 882 youth aged 8-22 years. We summarize the control properties of these
networks by estimating average and modal controllability, two statistics that
probe the ease with which brain areas can drive the network towards easy-
versus difficult-to-reach states. We find that females have higher modal
controllability in frontal, parietal, and subcortical regions while males have
higher average controllability in frontal and subcortical regions. Furthermore,
average controllability values in the medial frontal cortex and subcortex, both
higher in males, are negatively related to executive function. Finally, we find
that average controllability predicts sex-dependent individual differences in
activation during an n-back working memory task. Taken together, our findings
support the notion that sex differences in the controllability of structural
brain networks can partially explain sex differences in executive function.
Controllability of structural brain networks also predicts features of
task-relevant activation, suggesting the potential for controllability to
represent context-specific constraints on network state more generally.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1801.04515</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Finding actions that satisfy the constraints imposed by both external inputs
and internal representations is central to decision making. We demonstrate that
some important classes of constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs) can be solved
by networks composed of homogeneous cooperative-competitive modules that have
connectivity similar to motifs observed in the superficial layers of neocortex.
The winner-take-all modules are sparsely coupled by programming neurons that
embed the constraints onto the otherwise homogeneous modular computational
substrate. We show rules that embed any instance of the CSPs planar four-color
graph coloring, maximum independent set, and Sudoku on this substrate, and
provide mathematical proofs that guarantee these graph coloring problems will
convergence to a solution. The network is composed of non-saturating linear
threshold neurons. Their lack of right saturation allows the overall network to
explore the problem space driven through the unstable dynamics generated by
recurrent excitation. The direction of exploration is steered by the constraint
neurons. While many problems can be solved using only linear inhibitory
constraints, network performance on hard problems benefits significantly when
these negative constraints are implemented by non-linear multiplicative
inhibition. Overall, our results demonstrate the importance of instability
rather than stability in network computation, and also offer insight into the
computational role of dual inhibitory mechanisms in neural circuits.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Antisense suppression of glial fibrillary acidic protein as a treatment for Alexander disease</title>

A key feature of pathogenesis is overexpression and accumulation of GFAP, with formation of characteristic cytoplasmic aggregates known as Rosenthal fibers. Here we investigate whether suppressing GFAP with antisense oligonucleotides could provide a therapeutic strategy for treating Alexander disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25118-sec-0002&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this study, we use GFAP mutant mouse models of Alexander disease to test the efficacy of antisense suppression and evaluate the effects on molecular and cellular phenotypes and non–cell-autonomous toxicity. Antisense oligonucleotides were designed to target the murine &lt;em&gt;Gfap&lt;/em&gt; transcript, and screened using primary mouse cortical cultures. Lead oligonucleotides were then tested for their ability to reduce GFAP transcripts and protein, first in wild-type mice with normal levels of GFAP, and then in adult mutant mice with established pathology and elevated levels of GFAP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

GFAP protein was also cleared from cerebrospinal fluid, demonstrating its potential utility as a biomarker in future clinical applications. Finally, treatment led to improved body condition and rescue of hippocampal neurogenesis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Although myeloid cells are generally thought to be proinflammatory, alternatively polarized subsets can serve noninflammatory and/or reparative functions. Here we investigate the heterogeneity and biological properties of myeloid cells during central nervous system autoimmunity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

During EAE, CNS-infiltrating myeloid cells, as well as microglia, shifted from expression of proinflammatory markers to expression of noninflammatory markers immediately prior to clinical remissions. Murine CNS myeloid cells expressing the alternative lineage marker arginase-1 (Arg1) were partially derived from iNOS&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; precursors and were deficient in activating encephalitogenic T cells compared with their Arg1&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; counterparts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Familial and/or recurrent cases with a clinical diagnosis of MERS suggest the presence of genetic factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25125-sec-0002&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;We examined a family in which the proband presented with a history of recurrent encephalopathy with extensive but reversible cerebral myelin vacuolization and neurological symptoms similar to those of MERS spanning 3 generations.

We subsequently screened the coding regions of &lt;em&gt;MYRF&lt;/em&gt; by Sanger sequencing in our cohort comprised of 33 sporadic cases with MERS and 3 cases in another family with extensive myelin vacuolization, and identified the same heterozygous c.1208A&amp;gt;G in all affected members in the second family. Luciferase assay revealed that transcriptional activity of the N-terminal region of &lt;em&gt;MYRF&lt;/em&gt; was significantly diminished by introducing the c.1208A&amp;gt;G variant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Deep grey matter volume loss drives disability worsening in multiple sclerosis</title>
	<link>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25145</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h3&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Objective&lt;/b&gt;: Grey matter (GM) atrophy occurs in all multiple sclerosis (MS) phenotypes. We investigated whether there is a spatiotemporal pattern of GM atrophy that is associated with faster disability accumulation in MS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Methods&lt;/b&gt;: We analysed 3,604 brain high-resolution T1-weighted MRI scans from 1,417 participants: 1,214 MS patients (253 clinically-isolated syndrome[CIS], 708 relapsing-remitting[RRMS], 128 secondary-progressive[SPMS], 125 primary-progressive[PPMS]), over an average follow-up of 2.41 years (standard deviation[SD]=1.97), and 203 healthy controls (HCs) [average follow-up=1.83 year, SD=1.77], attending 7 European centres. Disability was assessed with the Expanded-Disability Status Scale (EDSS). We obtained volumes of the deep GM (DGM), temporal, frontal, parietal, occipital and cerebellar GM, brainstem and cerebral white matter. Hierarchical mixed-models assessed annual percentage rate of regional tissue loss and identified regional volumes associated with time-to-EDSS progression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Results&lt;/b&gt;: SPMS showed the lowest baseline volumes of cortical GM and DGM. Of all baseline regional volumes, only that of the DGM predicted time-to-EDSS progression (hazard ratio=0.73, 95% CIs 0.65, 0.82; &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;&amp;lt;0.001): for every standard deviation decrease in baseline DGM volume, the risk of presenting a shorter time to EDSS worsening during follow-up increased by 27%. Of all longitudinal measures, DGM showed the fastest annual rate of atrophy, which was faster in SPMS (-1.45%), PPMS (-1.66%), and RRMS (-1.34%) than CIS (-0.88%) and HCs (-0.94%)[&lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;&amp;lt;0.01]. The rate of temporal GM atrophy in SPMS (-1.21%) was significantly faster than RRMS (-0.76%), CIS (-0.75%), and HCs (-0.51%). Similarly, the rate of parietal GM atrophy in SPMS (-1.24-%) was faster than CIS (-0.63%) and HCs (-0.23%) (all p values &amp;lt;0.05). Only the atrophy rate in DGM in patients was significantly associated with disability accumulation (beta=0.04, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;&amp;lt;0.001).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Interpretation&lt;/b&gt;: This large multi-centre and longitudinal study shows that DGM volume loss drives disability accumulation in MS, and that temporal cortical GM shows accelerated atrophy in SPMS than RRMS. The difference in regional GM atrophy development between phenotypes needs to be taken into account when evaluating treatment effect of therapeutic interventions.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 and 2 in human temporal lobe epilepsy</title>
	<link>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25149</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h3&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Objective&lt;/b&gt;: Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is a chronic epilepsy syndrome defined by seizures and progressive neurological disabilities, including cognitive impairments, anxiety and depression. Here, human TLE specimens were investigated focusing on the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) Complex 1 (mTORC1) and Complex 2 (mTORC2) activities in the brain, as both pathways may represent unique targets for treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Methods&lt;/b&gt;: Surgically resected hippocampal and temporal lobe samples from therapy-resistant TLE patients were analyzed by Western blotting to quantify the expression of established mTORC1 and mTORC2 activity markers and upstream or downstream signaling pathways involving the two complexes. Histological and immunohistochemical techniques were used to assess hippocampal and neocortical structural abnormalities and cell-specific expression of individual biomarkers. Samples from patients with focal cortical dysplasia (FCD) type II served as positive controls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Results&lt;/b&gt;: We found significantly increased expression of phospho-mTOR (Ser2448), phospho-S6 (Ser235/236), phospho-S6 (Ser240/244) and phospho-Akt (Ser473) in TLE samples compared to controls, consistent with activation of both mTORC1 and mTORC2. Our work identified the PI3K and Ras/ERK signaling pathways as potential mTORC1 and mTORC2 upstream activators. In addition, we found that overactive mTORC2 signaling was accompanied by induction of two Akt-dependent pro-survival pathways, as evidenced by increased inhibitory phosphorylation of FoxO3a (Ser253) and GSK-β (Ser9).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Interpretation&lt;/b&gt;: Our data demonstrate that mTOR signaling is significantly dysregulated in human TLE, offering new targets for pharmacologic interventions. Specifically, clinically available drugs that suppress mTORC1 without compromising mTOR2 signaling, such as rapamycin and its analogs, may represent a new group of antiepileptogenic agents in TLE patients.

	<content:encoded>&lt;h3&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Objective&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The neurodegenerative disease amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a heterogeneous clinical syndrome involving multiple molecular pathways. The development of biomarkers for use in therapeutic trials is a priority. We sought to use a high-throughput proteomic method to identify novel biomarkers in individual cerebrospinal fluid samples.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry with label-free quantification was used to identify cerebrospinal fluid proteins using samples from a well-characterised longitudinal cohort comprising patients with ALS (n=43), the upper motor neuron variant primary lateral sclerosis (PLS, n=6), cross-sectional healthy (n=20) and disease controls (Parkinsons's n=20, ALS mimic disorders n=12).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three macrophage-derived chitinases showed increased abundance in ALS: chitotriosidase (CHIT1), chitinase-3-like protein 1 (CHI3L1) and chitinase-3-like protein 2 (CHI3L2). Elevated CHI3L1 was common to ALS and PLS, whereas CHIT1 and CHI3L2 levels differed. Chitinase levels correlated with disease progression rate (CHIT1 r=0.56, p&amp;lt;0.001; CHI3L1 r=0.31, p=0.028; CHI3L2 r=0.29, p=0.044). CHIT1, CHI3L1 and CHI3L2 levels correlated with phosphorylated neurofilament heavy chain (pNFH; r=0.62, p&amp;lt;0.001; r=0.49, p&amp;lt;0.001; r=0.41, p&amp;lt;0.001). CHI3L1 levels, but not CHIT1 or CHI3L2, increased over time in those with low initial levels (gradient=0.005 log abundance units/month, p=0.001). High CHIT1 was associated with shortened survival (HR 2.84, p=0.009). Inclusion of pNFH in survival models left only an association of pNFH and survival (HR 1.26, p=0.019).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interpretation&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neuroinflammatory mechanisms have been consistently implicated through various experimental paradigms. These results support a key role for macrophage activity in ALS pathogenesis, offering novel target engagement and pharmacodynamic biomarkers for neuroinflammation-focused ALS therapy.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Terminal spreading depolarization and electric silence in death of human cortex</title>
	<link>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25147</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h3&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Objective&lt;/b&gt;: Restoring the circulation is the primary goal in emergency treatment of cerebral ischemia. However, better understanding of how the brain responds to energy depletion could inform the time available for resuscitation until irreversible damage and advance development of interventions that prolong this span. Experimentally, injury to central neurons begins only with anoxic depolarization. This potentially reversible, spreading wave typically starts 2-5 min after the onset of severe ischemia, marking the onset of a toxic intraneuronal change that eventually results in irreversible injury.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Methods&lt;/b&gt;: To investigate this in the human brain, we performed recordings with either subdural electrode strips (n=4) or intraparenchymal electrode arrays (n=5) in patients with devastating brain injury that resulted in activation of a Do Not Resuscitate-Comfort Care order followed by terminal extubation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Results&lt;/b&gt;: Withdrawal of life-sustaining therapies produced a decline in brain tissue partial pressure of oxygen (p&lt;sub&gt;ti&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and circulatory arrest. Silencing of spontaneous electrical activity developed simultaneously across regional electrode arrays in eight patients. This silencing, termed ‘nonspreading depression', developed during the steep falling phase of p&lt;sub&gt;ti&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (intraparenchymal sensor, n=6) at 11 (7, 14) mmHg. Terminal spreading depolarizations started to propagate between electrodes 3.9 (2.6, 6.3) min after onset of the final drop in perfusion and 13 to 266s after nonspreading depression. In one patient, terminal spreading depolarization induced the initial electrocerebral silence in a spreading depression pattern; circulatory arrest developed thereafter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Interpretation&lt;/b&gt;: These results provide fundamental insight into the neurobiology of dying and have important implications for survivable cerebral ischemic insults.

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Modeling the assembly order of multimeric heteroprotein complexes</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/mNJcOk2YMNo/article</link>

Protein-protein interactions are the cornerstone of numerous biological processes. Although an increasing number of protein complex structures have been determined using experimental methods, relatively fewer studies have been performed to determine the assembly order of complexes. In addition to the insights into the molecular mechanisms of biological function provided by the structure of a complex, knowing the assembly order is important for understanding the process of complex formation. Assembly order is also practically useful for constructing subcomplexes as a step toward solving the entire complex experimentally, designing artificial protein complexes, and developing drugs that interrupt a critical step in the complex assembly. There are several experimental methods for determining the assembly order of complexes; however, these techniques are resource-intensive. Here, we present a computational method that predicts the assembly order of protein complexes by building the complex structure. The method, named Path-LzerD, uses a multimeric protein docking algorithm that assembles a protein complex structure from individual subunit structures and predicts assembly order by observing the simulated assembly process of the complex. Benchmarked on a dataset of complexes with experimental evidence of assembly order, Path-LZerD was successful in predicting the assembly pathway for the majority of the cases. Moreover, when compared with a simple approach that infers the assembly path from the buried surface area of subunits in the native complex, Path-LZerD has the strong advantage that it can be used for cases where the complex structure is not known. The path prediction accuracy decreased when starting from unbound monomers, particularly for larger complexes of five or more subunits, for which only a part of the assembly path was correctly identified. As the first method of its kind, Path-LZerD opens a new area of computational protein structure modeling and will be an indispensable approach for studying protein complexes.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/mNJcOk2YMNo&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: A direct interaction of cholesterol with the dopamine transporter prevents its out-to-inward transition</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/hpnuF0uxAAo/article</link>

Monoamine transporters (MATs) carry out neurotransmitter reuptake from the synaptic cleft, a key step in neurotransmission, which is targeted in the treatment of neurological disorders. Cholesterol (CHOL), a major component of the synaptic plasma membrane, has been shown to exhibit a modulatory effect on MATs. Recent crystal structures of the dopamine transporter (DAT) revealed the presence of two conserved CHOL-like molecules, suggesting a functional protein-CHOL direct interaction. Here, we present extensive atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of DAT in an outward-facing conformation. In the absence of bound CHOL, DAT undergoes structural changes reflecting early events of dopamine transport: transition to an inward-facing conformation. In contrast, in the presence of bound CHOL, these conformational changes are inhibited, seemingly by an immobilization of the intracellular interface of TM1a and TM5 by CHOL. We also provide evidence, from coarse grain MD simulations that the CHOL sites observed in the DAT crystal structures are preserved in all human transporters (dopamine, serotonin and norepinephrine), suggesting that our findings might extend to the entire family.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/hpnuF0uxAAo&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: The central vein sign differentiates MS from CNS inflammatory vasculopathies</title>
	<link>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25146</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h3&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Objectives&lt;/b&gt;. In multiple sclerosis (MS), MRI is a sensitive tool for detecting white matter lesions, but its diagnostic specificity is still suboptimal; ambiguous cases are frequent in clinical practice. Detection of perivenular lesions in the brain (the “central vein sign”) improves the pathological specificity of MS diagnosis, but comprehensive evaluation of this MRI biomarker in MS-mimicking inflammatory and/or autoimmune diseases, such as CNS inflammatory vasculopathies, is missing. In a multicenter study, we assessed the frequency of perivenular lesions in MS &lt;em&gt;vs&lt;/em&gt;. systemic autoimmune diseases with CNS involvement and primary angiitis of the CNS (PACNS).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Methods.&lt;/b&gt; In 31 patients with inflammatory CNS vasculopathies and 52 with relapsing-remitting MS, 3D-T2*-weighted and T2-FLAIR images were obtained during a single MRI acquisition after gadolinium injection. For each lesion, the “central vein sign” was evaluated according to consensus guidelines. For each patient, lesion count, volume, and brain location, as well as fulfillment of dissemination in space MRI criteria, were assessed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Results.&lt;/b&gt; MS showed higher frequency of perivenular lesions (median 88%) than did inflammatory CNS vasculopathies (14%), without overlap between groups or differences between 3T and 1.5T MRI. Among inflammatory vasculopathies, Behçet disease showed the highest median frequency of perivenular lesions (34%), followed by PACNS (14%), antiphospholipid syndromes (12%), Sjögren's syndrome (11%), and systemic lupus erythematosus (0%). When a threshold of 50% perivenular lesions was applied, CVS discriminated MS from inflammatory vasculopathies with diagnostic accuracy of 100%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Interpretation.&lt;/b&gt; The “central vein sign” differentiates inflammatory CNS vasculopathies from MS at standard clinical magnetic field strengths.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Dysfunctional sarcomere contractility contributes to muscle weakness in ACTA1-related nemaline myopathy (NEM3)</title>
	<link>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25144</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h3&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;OBJECTIVE&lt;/b&gt;: Nemaline myopathy (NM) is one of the most common congenital non-dystrophic myopathies and is characterized by muscle weakness, often from birth. Mutations in &lt;em&gt;ACTA1&lt;/em&gt; are a frequent cause of NM (i.e. NEM3). &lt;em&gt;ACTA1&lt;/em&gt; encodes alpha-actin 1, the main constituent of the sarcomeric thin filament. The mechanisms by which mutations in &lt;em&gt;ACTA1&lt;/em&gt; contribute to muscle weakness in NEM3 are incompletely understood. We hypothesized that sarcomeric dysfunction contributes to muscle weakness in NEM3 patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;METHODS&lt;/b&gt;: To test this hypothesis, we performed contractility measurements in individual muscle fibers and myofibrils obtained from muscle biopsies of fourteen NEM3 patients with different &lt;em&gt;ACTA1&lt;/em&gt; mutations. To identify the structural basis for impaired contractility, low angle x-ray diffraction and stimulated emission-depletion microscopy were applied.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;RESULTS&lt;/b&gt;: Our findings reveal that muscle fibers of NEM3 patients display a reduced maximal force generating capacity, which is caused by dysfunctional sarcomere contractility in the majority of patients, as revealed by contractility measurements in myofibrils. Low angle x-ray diffraction and stimulated emission-depletion microscopy indicate that dysfunctional sarcomere contractility in NEM3 patients involves a lower number of myosin heads binding to actin during muscle activation. This lower number is not the result of reduced thin filament length. Interestingly, the calcium sensitivity of force is unaffected in some patients, but decreased in others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;INTERPRETATION&lt;/b&gt;: Thus, dysfunctional sarcomere contractility is an important contributor to muscle weakness in the majority of NEM3 patients, information which is crucial for patient stratification in future clinical trials.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Thalamic Atrophy in MS: An MRI Marker of Neurodegeneration Throughout Disease</title>
	<link>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25150</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h3&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;underlined &quot;&gt;Objective&lt;/span&gt;: Thalamic volume is a candidate MRI-based marker associated with neurodegeneration to hasten development of neuroprotective treatments. Our objective is to describe the longitudinal evolution of thalamic atrophy in MS and normal aging, and to estimate sample sizes for study design.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;underlined &quot;&gt;Methods&lt;/span&gt;: 601 subjects (2632 MRI scans) were analyzed. 520 subjects with relapse-onset MS [CIS(90); RR(392); SP(38)] underwent annual standardized 3T MRI scans for an average of 4.1 years, including a 1mm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; 3D T1-weighted sequence (3DT1; 2485 MRI scans). 81 healthy controls (HC) were scanned longitudinally on the same scanner using the same protocol (147 MRI scans). 3DT1s were processed using FreeSurfer's longitudinal pipeline after lesion inpainting. Rates of normalized thalamic volume loss in MS and HC were compared in linear mixed effects models. Simulation-based sample size calculations were performed incorporating the rate of atrophy in HC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;underlined &quot;&gt;Results&lt;/span&gt;: Thalamic volume declined significantly faster in MS subjects compared to HC, with an estimated decline of -0.71% per year (95% CI -0.77%, -0.64%) in MS subjects and -0.28% per year (95% CI -0.58%, 0.02%) in HC (p-value for difference=0.007). The rate of decline was consistent throughout the MS disease duration and across MS clinical subtypes. 80 or 100 subjects per arm (α=0.1 or 0.05, respectively) would be needed to detect the ‘maximal effect size' with 80% power in a 24-month study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;underlined &quot;&gt;Interpretation&lt;/span&gt;: Thalamic atrophy occurs early and consistently throughout MS. Preliminary sample size calculations appear feasible, adding to its appeal as an MRI marker associated with neurodegeneration. This article is protected by copyright.

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Gli2 Rescues Delays in Brain Development Induced by Kif3a Dysfunction</title>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhx356/4802222?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;The primary cilium in neural stem cells plays distinct roles in different stages during cortical development. Ciliary dysfunctions in human (i.e., ciliopathy) cause developmental defects in multiple organs, including brain developmental delays, which lead to intellectual disabilities and cognitive deficits. However, effective treatment to this devastating developmental disorder is still lacking. Here, we first investigated the effects of ciliopathy on neural stem cells by knocking down Kif3a, a kinesin II motor required for ciliogenesis, in the neurogenic stage of cortical development by in utero electroporation of mouse embryos. Brains electroporated with Kif3a shRNA showed defects in neuronal migration and differentiation, delays in neural stem cell cycle progression, and failures in interkinetic nuclear migration. Interestingly, introduction of Gli1 and Gli2 both can restore the cell cycle progression by elevating cyclin D1 in neural stem cells. Remarkably, enforced Gli2 expression, but not Gli1, partially restored the ability of Kif3a-knockdown neurons to differentiate and move from the germinal ventricular zone to the cortical plate. Moreover, Cyclin D1 knockdown abolished Gli2’s rescue effect. These findings suggest Gli2 may rescue neural stem cell proliferation, differentiation and migration through Cyclin D1 pathway and may serve as a potential therapeutic target for human ciliopathy syndromes through modulating the progression of neural stem cell cycle.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Sensory gating is a neurophysiological process whereby the response to a second stimulus in a pair of identical stimuli is attenuated, and it is thought to reflect the capacity of the CNS to preserve neural resources for behaviorally relevant stimuli. Such gating is observed across multiple sensory modalities and is modulated by age, but the mechanisms involved are not understood. In this study, we examined somatosensory gating in 68 healthy adults using magnetoencephalography (MEG) and advanced oscillatory and time-domain analysis methods. MEG data underwent source reconstruction and peak voxel time series data were extracted to evaluate the dynamics of somatosensory gating, and the impact of spontaneous neural activity immediately preceding the stimulation. We found that gating declined with increasing age and that older adults had significantly reduced gating relative to younger adults, suggesting impaired local inhibitory function. Most importantly, older adults had significantly elevated spontaneous activity preceding the stimulation, and this effect fully mediated the impact of aging on sensory gating. In conclusion, gating in the somatosensory system declines with advancing age and this effect is directly tied to increased spontaneous neural activity in the primary somatosensory cortices, which is likely secondary to age-related declines in local GABA inhibitory function.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: The Roles of Subdivisions of Human Insula in Emotion Perception and Auditory Processing</title>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhx334/4802217?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Previous studies have shown insular activations involving sensory, motor, and affective processing. However, the functional roles of subdivisions within the human insula are still not well understood. In the present study, we used intracranial electroencephalography and electrical cortical stimulation to investigate the causal roles of subdivisions of the insula in auditory emotion perception in epilepsy patients implanted with depth electrodes in this brain region. The posterior and the anterior subdivisions of the human insula, identified based on structural and functional analyses, showed distinct response properties to auditory emotional stimuli. The posterior insula showed auditory responses that resemble those observed in Heschl’s gyrus, whereas the anterior insula (AI) responded to the emotional contents of the auditory stimuli in a similar way as observed in the amygdala. Furthermore, the degree of the differentiation between various emotion types increased from the posterior to the AI. Our findings suggest different roles played by the two regions of the human insula and a transformation from sensory to affective representations in auditory modality along the posterior-to-anterior axis in the human insula.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Identifying human diamine sensors for death related putrescine and cadaverine molecules</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/ACfXAu-7iOM/article</link>

Pungent chemical compounds originating from decaying tissue are strong drivers of animal behavior. Two of the best-characterized death smell components are putrescine (PUT) and cadaverine (CAD), foul-smelling molecules produced by decarboxylation of amino acids during decomposition. These volatile polyamines act as ‘necromones’, triggering avoidance or attractive responses, which are fundamental for the survival of a wide range of species. The few studies that have attempted to identify the cognate receptors for these molecules have suggested the involvement of the seven-helix trace amine-associated receptors (TAARs), localized in the olfactory epithelium. However, very little is known about the precise chemosensory receptors that sense these compounds in the majority of organisms and the molecular basis of their interactions. In this work, we have used computational strategies to characterize the binding between PUT and CAD with the TAAR6 and TAAR8 human receptors. Sequence analysis, homology modeling, docking and molecular dynamics studies suggest a tandem of negatively charged aspartates in the binding pocket of these receptors which are likely to be involved in the recognition of these small biogenic diamines.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/ACfXAu-7iOM&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

The development of tracking methods for automatically quantifying individual behavior and social interactions in animal groups has open up new perspectives for building quantitative and predictive models of collective behavior. In this work, we combine extensive data analyses with a modeling approach to measure, disentangle, and reconstruct the actual functional form of interactions involved in the coordination of swimming in Rummy-nose tetra (&lt;i&gt;Hemigrammus rhodostomus&lt;/i&gt;). This species of fish performs burst-and-coast swimming behavior that consists of sudden heading changes combined with brief accelerations followed by quasi-passive, straight decelerations. We quantify the spontaneous stochastic behavior of a fish and the interactions that govern wall avoidance and the reaction to a neighboring fish, the latter by exploiting general symmetry constraints for the interactions. In contrast with previous experimental works, we find that both attraction and alignment behaviors control the reaction of fish to a neighbor. We then exploit these results to build a model of spontaneous burst-and-coast swimming and interactions of fish, with all parameters being estimated or directly measured from experiments. This model quantitatively reproduces the key features of the motion and spatial distributions observed in experiments with a single fish and with two fish. This demonstrates the power of our method that exploits large amounts of data for disentangling and fully characterizing the interactions that govern collective behaviors in animals groups.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/FrGkfbLqiNY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Alternative diagnostic criteria for idiopathic hypersomnia: A 32-hour protocol</title>
	<link>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25141</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h3&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Objective: To assess the diagnostic value of extended sleep duration on a controlled 32-hour bed-rest protocol in idiopathic hypersomnia (IH).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: 116 patients with high suspicion of IH (37 clear-cut-IH according to multiple sleep latency test criteria and 79 probable-IH), 32 with hypersomnolence associated with a comorbid disorder (non-IH) and 21 controls underwent a polysomnography, modified-sleep latency tests and a 32-h bed-rest protocol. Receiver operating characteristic curves were used to find optimal total sleep time (TST) cut-off values on various periods that discriminate patients to controls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Results&lt;/b&gt;: TST was longer in patients with clear-cut-IH than other groups (probable-IH, non-IH and controls) and in patients with probable-IH than non-IH and controls. TST cut-off best discriminating clear-cut-IH and controls was 19h for the 32-h recording (sensitivity 91.9%, specificity 85.7%) and 12h (100%, 85.7%) for the first 24h. The 19-h cut-off displayed a specificity and sensitivity of 91.9% and 81.2% between IH and non-IH patients. Patients with IH above the 19h cut-off were overweight, had more sleep inertia and higher TST on all periods compared to patients below 19h, while no differences were found for the 12h cut-off. An inverse correlation was found between the mean sleep latency and TST during 32-h recording in IH patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interpretation: In standardized and controlled stringent conditions, the optimal cut-off best discriminating patients to controls was 19h over 32-h that allows a clear-cut phenotypical characterization of major interest for research purposes. Sleepier patients on MSLT were also the more severe in terms of extended sleep. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: [18F]AV-1451 clustering of entorhinal and cortical uptake in Alzheimer's disease</title>
	<link>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25142</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h3&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Objective: To use a cluster analysis of [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]AV-1451 tau-PET data to determine how subjects with Alzheimer's disease vary in the relative involvement of the entorhinal cortex and neocortex, and determine whether relative involvement of these two regions can help explain variability in age and clinical phenotype in Alzheimer's disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;METHODS: We calculated [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]AV-1451 uptake in entorhinal cortex and neocortex in 62 amyloid-positive Alzheimer's disease patients (39 typical and 23 atypical presentation). Tau-PET values were normalized to the cerebellum to create SUVRs. Tau-PET SUVRs were log-transformed and clustered blinded to clinical information into three groups using K-median cluster analysis. Demographics, clinical phenotype, cognitive performance, and apolipoprotein e4 frequency were compared across clusters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;RESULTS: The cluster analysis identified a cluster with low entorhinal and cortical uptake (E&lt;sup&gt;Lo&lt;/sup&gt;/C&lt;sup&gt;Lo&lt;/sup&gt;), one with low entorhinal but high cortical uptake (E&lt;sup&gt;Lo&lt;/sup&gt;/C&lt;sup&gt;Hi&lt;/sup&gt;), and one with high cortical and entorhinal uptake (E&lt;sup&gt;Hi&lt;/sup&gt;/C&lt;sup&gt;Hi&lt;/sup&gt;). Clinical phenotype differed across clusters, with typical AD most commonly observed in the E&lt;sup&gt;Lo&lt;/sup&gt;/C&lt;sup&gt;Lo&lt;/sup&gt; and E&lt;sup&gt;Hi&lt;/sup&gt;/C&lt;sup&gt;Hi&lt;/sup&gt; clusters, and atypical AD most commonly observed in the E&lt;sup&gt;Lo&lt;/sup&gt;/C&lt;sup&gt;Hi&lt;/sup&gt; cluster. The E&lt;sup&gt;Lo&lt;/sup&gt;/C&lt;sup&gt;Lo&lt;/sup&gt; cluster had an older age at PET and onset than the other clusters. The apolipoprotein e4 frequency was lower in the E&lt;sup&gt;Lo&lt;/sup&gt;/C&lt;sup&gt;Hi&lt;/sup&gt; cluster. The E&lt;sup&gt;Hi&lt;/sup&gt;/C&lt;sup&gt;Hi&lt;/sup&gt; cluster had the worst memory impairment, while the E&lt;sup&gt;Lo&lt;/sup&gt;/C&lt;sup&gt;Hi&lt;/sup&gt; cluster had the worst impairment in non-memory domains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;INTERPRETATION: This study demonstrates considerable variability in [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]AV-1451 tau-PET uptake in AD, but shows that a straight-forward clustering based on entorhinal and cortical uptake maps well onto age and clinical presentation in AD.

A solid phase binding assay quantified the binding of Caspr2 to contactin-2 in the presence of Caspr2 autoantibodies. Living cultures of primary rat hippocampal neurons were incubated with Caspr2-positive or control sera, and the distribution of Caspr2-positive immunofluorescent puncta and total surface Caspr2 was quantified. HEK cells transfected to express Caspr2 were incubated with Caspr2-positive or control samples, and cell-surface biotinylation and Western blot were used to assess total, internalized, and surface levels of Caspr2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

IgG4 Caspr2 antibodies were present in all 6 cases. Caspr2 interacted with another cell adhesion molecule, contactin-2, with nanomolar affinity in the solid phase assay, and Caspr2 autoantibodies inhibited this interaction. Caspr2 autoantibodies did not affect the surface expression of Caspr2 in rat primary hippocampal neurons or transfected HEK cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Motor sequence awareness is impaired in dystonia despite normal performance</title>
	<link>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25121</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25121-sec-0001&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Objective&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dystonia is a movement disorder that has been associated with impaired motor learning and sequence recognition. However, despite evidence that patients with dystonia have a reduced sense of agency, it is unclear whether dystonia is specifically associated with impaired recognition of a movement sequence. We have shown previously that performance consistency in the temporal and kinematic domains predicts awareness of underlying motor patterns in a finger-tapping task. Since movements in dystonia are characterized by high variability, we predicted that subjects with dystonia would have decreased motor sequence awareness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25121-sec-0002&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Subjects with dystonia (n = 20) and healthy control adults (n = 30) performed finger-tapping sequences with a common motor pattern and changing stimulus-to-response mappings. Subjects were said to be “aware” of the motor pattern if they recognized that their fingers moved in the same order during each stimulus-to-response remapping.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25121-sec-0003&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Subjects with dystonia had decreased motor pattern awareness, but those differences were not due to greater performance variability. Subjects with dystonia tapped sequences as series of discrete movements, rather than as a combined series.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25121-sec-0004&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dystonia is associated with impaired recognition of a repeating movement pattern. This difference may result from a strategy of separating sequential elements and attending to them individually. Ann Neurol 2017&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Morphological and Functional Characterization of Non-fast-Spiking GABAergic Interneurons in Layer 4 Microcircuitry of Rat Barrel Cortex</title>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhx352/4796916?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;GABAergic interneurons are notorious for their heterogeneity, despite constituting a small fraction of the neuronal population in the neocortex. Classification of interneurons is crucial for understanding their widespread cortical functions as they provide a complex and dynamic network, balancing excitation and inhibition. Here, we investigated different types of non-fast-spiking (nFS) interneurons in Layer 4 (L4) of rat barrel cortex using whole-cell patch-clamp recordings with biocytin-filling. Based on a quantitative analysis on a combination of morphological and electrophysiological parameters, we identified 5 distinct types of L4 nFS interneurons: 1) &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;trans-columnar projecting interneurons,&lt;/span&gt;2) &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;locally projecting non-Martinotti-like interneurons,&lt;/span&gt; 3) &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;supra-granular projecting Martinotti-like interneurons,&lt;/span&gt;4) &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;intra-columnar projecting VIP-like interneurons&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;and&lt;/span&gt;5) &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;locally projecting neurogliaform-like interneurons.&lt;/span&gt; Trans-columnar projecting interneurons are one of the most striking interneuron types, which have not been described so far in Layer 4. They feature extensive axonal collateralization not only in their home barrel but also in adjacent barrels. Furthermore, we identified that most of the L4 nFS interneurons express somatostatin, while few are positive for the transcription factor Prox1. The morphological and electrophysiological characterization of different L4 nFS interneuron types presented here provides insights into their synaptic connectivity and functional role in cortical information processing.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhx351/4796921?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;In 2004, two landmark studies described the discovery of brain imaging (functional magnetic resonance imaging and electroencephalography) signals that increase with the number of items held in visual working memory (WM). These studies claimed that the signals leveled off (plateaued) once the number of memoranda reached the capacity of WM, as estimated by the prevailing model of the time. However, alternative models were not considered, and changing concepts of WM in the more than a decade since these studies were published necessitate a re-evaluation of their findings; newer models that provide the most accurate account of behavioral data do not incorporate a fixed limit on the number of items stored. Furthermore, an important claim made about the original studies, that signals plateau at each individual’s estimated capacity, has never been tested. Here, we pit the plateau model of signal strength against an alternative, saturation model, a biophysically plausible account in which signals increase continuously without plateau. We show that the saturation model provides a better description of the original data, challenging the assumption that imaging results provide evidence for a fixed item limit in WM.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: An Orientation Map for Disparity-Defined Edges in Area V4</title>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhx348/4796919?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Binocular disparity information is an important source of 3D perception. Neurons sensitive to binocular disparity are found in almost all major visual areas in nonhuman primates. In area V4, disparity processes are suggested for the purposes of 3D-shape representation and fine disparity perception. However, whether neurons in V4 are sensitive to disparity-defined edges used in shape representation is not clear. Additionally, a functional organization for disparity edges has not been demonstrated so far. With intrinsic signal optical imaging, we studied functional organization for disparity edges in the monkey visual areas V1, V2, and V4. We found that there is an orientation map in V4 activated by edges purely defined by binocular disparity. This map is consistent with the orientation map obtained with regular luminance-defined edges, indicating a cue-invariant edge representation in this area. In contrast, such a map is much weaker in V2 and totally absent in V1. These findings reveal a hierarchical processing of 3D shape along the ventral pathway and the important role that V4 plays in shape-from-disparity detection.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Effects of Anodal Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation Over the Ventrolateral Prefrontal Cortex on Episodic Memory Formation and Retrieval</title>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhx347/4796918?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;In the past decade, several studies have investigated the effects of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) on episodic memory abilities. However, the specific conditions under which tDCS affects memory remain largely unclear. Here, we report data from 4 experiments aimed at investigating the effects of anodal tDCS over the left ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC) on verbal episodic memory. We evaluated tDCS-induced effects as a function of time of administration, nature of the memory encoding task, and age of the participants. A robust enhancement of memory performance was only found when anodal tDCS was delivered during intentional memorization. This enhancement was evident in young and older adults. tDCS applied during incidental memorization or during retrieval did not induce any modulation of memory performance, and memory was unaffected by offline administration before encoding or retrieval. These results show that the modulation of episodic memory functions by anodal tDCS over the left VLPFC is dependent upon the time of administration and the nature of the memory task. The findings may help profile the optimal stimulation protocols for neurorehabilitation interventions on individuals with memory decline.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Heterogeneous Redistribution of Facial Subcategory Information Within and Outside the Face-Selective Domain in Primate Inferior Temporal Cortex</title>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhx342/4796917?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;The inferior temporal cortex (ITC) contains neurons selective to multiple levels of visual categories. However, the mechanisms by which these neurons collectively construct hierarchical category percepts remain unclear. By comparing decoding accuracy with simultaneously acquired electrocorticogram (ECoG), local field potentials (LFPs), and multi-unit activity in the macaque ITC, we show that low-frequency LFPs/ECoG in the early evoked visual response phase contain sufficient coarse category (e.g., face) information, which is homogeneous and enhanced by spatial summation of up to several millimeters. Late-induced high-frequency LFPs additionally carry spike-coupled finer category (e.g., species, view, and identity of the face) information, which is heterogeneous and reduced by spatial summation. Face-encoding neural activity forms a cluster in similar cortical locations regardless of whether it is defined by early evoked low-frequency signals or late-induced high-gamma signals. By contrast, facial subcategory-encoding activity is distributed, not confined to the face cluster, and dynamically increases its heterogeneity from the early evoked to late-induced phases. These findings support a view that, in contrast to the homogeneous and static coarse category-encoding neural cluster, finer category-encoding clusters are heterogeneously distributed even outside their parent category cluster and dynamically increase heterogeneity along with the local cortical processing in the ITC.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Trends in Neurosciences: Mechanisms of Memory Disruption in Depression</title>
	<link>http://www.cell.com/trends/neurosciences/fulltext/S0166-2236(17)30250-3?rss=yes</link>
	<content:encoded>Depressed individuals typically show poor memory for positive events, potentiated memory for negative events, and impaired recollection. These phenomena are clinically important but poorly understood. Compelling links between stress and depression suggest promising candidate mechanisms. Stress can suppress hippocampal neurogenesis, inhibit dopamine neurons, and sensitize the amygdala. We argue that these phenomena may impair pattern separation, disrupt the encoding of positive experiences, and bias retrieval toward negative events, respectively, thus recapitulating core aspects of memory disruption in depression.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Human lateral PPC demonstrates rich, functional heterogeneity across its subregions, including during mnemonic and numerical decision tasks. In this issue of Neuron, Rutishauser et al. (2018) report striking local heterogeneity within a small patch of anterior IPS at the neuronal level during memory-based decisions.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Synaptic plasticity – the directed modulation of synaptic connections by specific activity histories or physiological signals – is believed to be a major mechanism for the modification of neuronal network function. This belief, however, has a ‘flip side’: the supposition that synapses do not change spontaneously in manners unrelated to such signals. Contrary to this supposition, recent studies reveal that synapses do change spontaneously, and to a fairly large extent. Here we review experimental results on spontaneous synaptic remodeling, its relative contributions to total synaptic remodeling, its statistical characteristics, and its physiological importance.</content:encoded>
