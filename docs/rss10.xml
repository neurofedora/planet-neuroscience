	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: With an eye on uncertainty: Modelling pupillary responses to environmental volatility</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/igJm9qjK6Ho/article</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Peter Vincent, Thomas Parr, David Benrimoh, Karl J Friston&lt;/p&gt;

Living creatures must accurately infer the nature of their environments. They do this despite being confronted by stochastic and context sensitive contingencies—and so must constantly update their beliefs regarding their uncertainty about what might come next. In this work, we examine how we deal with uncertainty that evolves over time. This prospective uncertainty (or imprecision) is referred to as volatility and has previously been linked to noradrenergic signals that originate in the locus coeruleus. Using pupillary dilatation as a measure of central noradrenergic signalling, we tested the hypothesis that changes in pupil diameter reflect inferences humans make about environmental volatility. To do so, we collected pupillometry data from participants presented with a stream of numbers. We generated these numbers from a process with varying degrees of volatility. By measuring pupillary dilatation in response to these stimuli—and simulating the inferences made by an ideal Bayesian observer of the same stimuli—we demonstrate that humans update their beliefs about environmental contingencies in a Bayes optimal way. We show this by comparing general linear (convolution) models that formalised competing hypotheses about the causes of pupillary changes. We found greater evidence for models that included Bayes optimal estimates of volatility than those without. We additionally explore the interaction between different causes of pupil dilation and suggest a quantitative approach to characterising a person’s prior beliefs about volatility.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/igJm9qjK6Ho&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Systematic discovery of the functional impact of somatic genome alterations in individual tumors through tumor-specific causal inference</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/CjIns0WTCck/article</link>

Cancer is mainly caused by somatic genome alterations (SGAs). Precision oncology involves identifying and targeting tumor-specific aberrations resulting from causative SGAs. We developed a novel tumor-specific computational framework that finds the likely causative SGAs in an individual tumor and estimates their impact on oncogenic processes, which suggests the disease mechanisms that are acting in that tumor. This information can be used to guide precision oncology. We report a tumor-specific causal inference (TCI) framework, which estimates causative SGAs by modeling causal relationships between SGAs and molecular phenotypes (e.g., transcriptomic, proteomic, or metabolomic changes) within an individual tumor. We applied the TCI algorithm to tumors from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and estimated for each tumor the SGAs that causally regulate the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in that tumor. Overall, TCI identified 634 SGAs that are predicted to cause cancer-related DEGs in a significant number of tumors, including most of the previously known drivers and many novel candidate cancer drivers. The inferred causal relationships are statistically robust and biologically sensible, and multiple lines of experimental evidence support the predicted functional impact of both the well-known and the novel candidate drivers that are predicted by TCI. TCI provides a unified framework that integrates multiple types of SGAs and molecular phenotypes to estimate which genome perturbations are causally influencing one or more molecular/cellular phenotypes in an individual tumor. By identifying major candidate drivers and revealing their functional impact in an individual tumor, TCI sheds light on the disease mechanisms of that tumor, which can serve to advance our basic knowledge of cancer biology and to support precision oncology that provides tailored treatment of individual tumors.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/CjIns0WTCck&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Disease gene prediction for molecularly uncharacterized diseases</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/8WzpOXWlG88/article</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Juan J. Cáceres, Alberto Paccanaro&lt;/p&gt;

Network medicine approaches have been largely successful at increasing our knowledge of molecularly characterized diseases. Given a set of disease genes associated with a disease, neighbourhood-based methods and random walkers exploit the interactome allowing the prediction of further genes for that disease. In general, however, diseases with no known molecular basis constitute a challenge. Here we present a novel network approach to prioritize gene-disease associations that is able to also predict genes for diseases with no known molecular basis. Our method, which we have called Cardigan (ChARting DIsease Gene AssociatioNs), uses semi-supervised learning and exploits a measure of similarity between disease phenotypes. We evaluated its performance at predicting genes for both molecularly characterized and uncharacterized diseases in OMIM, using both weighted and binary interactomes, and compared it with state-of-the-art methods. Our tests, which use datasets collected at different points in time to replicate the dynamics of the disease gene discovery process, prove that Cardigan is able to accurately predict disease genes for molecularly uncharacterized diseases. Additionally, standard leave-one-out cross validation tests show how our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods at predicting genes for molecularly characterized diseases by 14%-65%. Cardigan can also be used for disease module prediction, where it outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 87%-299%.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/8WzpOXWlG88&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Modelling the mechanics of exploration in larval &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt;</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/JJidlxXe2c4/article</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Jane Loveless, Konstantinos Lagogiannis, Barbara Webb&lt;/p&gt;

The &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; larva executes a stereotypical exploratory routine that appears to consist of stochastic alternation between straight peristaltic crawling and reorientation events through lateral bending. We present a model of larval mechanics for axial and transverse motion over a planar substrate, and use it to develop a simple, reflexive neuromuscular model from physical principles. The mechanical model represents the midline of the larva as a set of point masses which interact with each other via damped translational and torsional springs, and with the environment via sliding friction forces. The neuromuscular model consists of: 1. segmentally localised reflexes that amplify axial compression in order to counteract frictive energy losses, and 2. long-range mutual inhibition between reflexes in distant segments, enabling overall motion of the model larva relative to its substrate. In the absence of damping and driving, the mechanical model produces axial travelling waves, lateral oscillations, and unpredictable, chaotic deformations. The neuromuscular model counteracts friction to recover these motion patterns, giving rise to forward and backward peristalsis in addition to turning. Our model produces spontaneous exploration, even though the nervous system has no intrinsic pattern generating or decision making ability, and neither senses nor drives bending motions. Ultimately, our model suggests a novel view of larval exploration as a deterministic superdiffusion process which is mechanistically grounded in the chaotic mechanics of the body. We discuss how this may provide new interpretations for existing observations at the level of tissue-scale activity patterns and neural circuitry, and provide some experimental predictions that would test the extent to which the mechanisms we present translate to the real larva.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/JJidlxXe2c4&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: From voxels to pixels and back: Self-supervision in natural-image reconstruction from fMRI. (arXiv:1907.02431v1 [eess.IV])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1907.02431</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Reconstructing observed images from fMRI brain recordings is challenging.
Unfortunately, acquiring sufficient &quot;labeled&quot; pairs of {Image, fMRI} (i.e.,
images with their corresponding fMRI responses) to span the huge space of
natural images is prohibitive for many reasons. We present a novel approach
which, in addition to the scarce labeled data (training pairs), allows to train
fMRI-to-image reconstruction networks also on &quot;unlabeled&quot; data (i.e., images
without fMRI recording, and fMRI recording without images). The proposed model
utilizes both an Encoder network (image-to-fMRI) and a Decoder network
(fMRI-to-image). Concatenating these two networks back-to-back (Encoder-Decoder
&amp;amp; Decoder-Encoder) allows augmenting the training with both types of unlabeled
data. Importantly, it allows training on the unlabeled test-fMRI data. This
self-supervision adapts the reconstruction network to the new input test-data,
despite its deviation from the statistics of the scarce training data.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Evaluation of the criticality of in vitro neuronal networks: Toward an assessment of computational capacity. (arXiv:1907.02351v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1907.02351</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Novel computing hardwares are necessary to keep up with today's increasing
demand for data storage and processing power. In this research project, we turn
to the brain for inspiration to develop novel computing substrates that are
self-learning, scalable, energy-efficient, and fault-tolerant. The overarching
aim of this work is to develop computational models that are able to reproduce
target behaviors observed in in vitro neuronal networks. These models will be
ultimately be used to aid in the realization of these behaviors in a more
engineerable substrate: an array of nanomagnets. The target behaviors will be
identified by analyzing electrophysiological recordings of the neuronal
networks. Preliminary analysis has been performed to identify when a network is
in a critical state based on the size distribution of network-wide avalanches
of activity, and the results of this analysis are reported here. This
classification of critical versus non-critical networks is valuable in
identifying networks that can be expected to perform well on computational
tasks, as criticality is widely considered to be the state in which a system is
best suited for computation. This type of analysis is expected to enable the
identification of networks that are well-suited for computation and the
classification of networks as perturbed or healthy.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1907.02324</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The intra-axonal water exchange time {\tau}i, a parameter associated with
axonal permeability, could be an important biomarker for understanding
demyelinating pathologies such as Multiple Sclerosis. Diffusion-Weighted MRI is
sensitive to changes in permeability, however, the parameter has remained
elusive due to the intractability of the mathematical models that incorporate
it. Machine learning based computational models can potentially be used to
estimate such parameters, and recently, a theoretical framework using a random
forest (RF) suggests this is a promising approach. In this study, we adopt such
an RF approach and experimentally investigate its suitability as a biomarker
for demyelinating pathologies through direct comparison with histology. For
this, we use an in-vivo cuprizone (CPZ) mouse model of demyelination with
available ex-vivo electron microscopy (EM) data. We test our model on
noise-free simulations and find very strong correlations between the predicted
and ground truth parameters. For realistic noise levels as in our in-vivo data,
the performance is affected, however, the parameters are still well estimated.
We apply our RF model on in-vivo data from 8 CPZ and 8 wild-type (WT) mice and
validate the RF estimates using histology. We find a strong correlation between
the in-vivo RF estimates of {\tau}i and the EM measurements of myelin thickness
({\rho_\tau}i = 0.82), and between RF estimates and EM measurements of
intra-axonal volume fraction ({\rho_f} = 0.98). When comparing {\tau}i in CPZ
and WT mice we find a statistically significant decrease in the corpus callosum
of the CPZ compared to the WT mice, in line with our expectations that {\tau}i
is lower in regions where the myelin sheath is damaged. Overall, these results
demonstrate the suitability of machine learning compartment models with
permeability as a potential biomarker for demyelinating pathologies.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1907.02116</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;There is still much to understand about the color processing mechanisms in
the brain and the transformation from cone-opponent representations to
perceptual hues. Moreover, it is unclear which areas(s) in the brain represent
unique hues. We propose a hierarchical model inspired by the neuronal
mechanisms in the brain for local hue representation, which reveals the
contributions of each visual cortical area in hue representation. Local hue
encoding is achieved through incrementally increasing processing nonlinearities
beginning with cone input. Besides employing nonlinear rectifications, we
propose multiplicative modulations as a form of nonlinearity. Our simulation
results indicate that multiplicative modulations have significant contributions
in encoding of hues along intermediate directions in the MacLeod-Boynton
diagram and that model V4 neurons have the capacity to encode unique hues.
Additionally, responses of our model neurons resemble those of biological color
cells, suggesting that our model provides a novel formulation of the brain's
color processing pathway.

$k$ as the control parameter and an exactly balanced excitation-inhibition
ratio. While critical connectivity has been found to be low in these model
systems, typically around $k=2$, which is unrealistic for natural systems, a
recent study utilizing the excitation-inhibition ratio as the control parameter
found a new, nearly degree independent, critical point when connectivity is
large. However, the new phase transition is accompanied by an unnaturally high
level of activity in the network.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here we study random neural networks with the additional properties of (i) a
high clustering coefficient and (ii) neurons that are solely either excitatory
or inhibitory, a prominent property of natural neurons. As a result, we observe
an additional critical point for networks with large connectivity, regardless
of degree distribution, which exhibits low activity levels that compare well
with neuronal brain networks.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Coding with transient trajectories in recurrent neural networks. (arXiv:1811.07592v2 [q-bio.NC] UPDATED)</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1811.07592</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Following a stimulus, the neural response typically strongly varies in time
and across neurons before settling to a steady-state. While classical
population coding theory disregards the temporal dimension, recent works have
argued that trajectories of transient activity can be particularly informative
about stimulus identity and may form the basis of computations through
dynamics. Yet the dynamical mechanisms needed to generate a population code
based on transient trajectories have not been fully elucidated. Here we examine
transient coding in a broad class of high-dimensional linear networks of
recurrently connected units. We start by reviewing a well-known result that
leads to a distinction between two classes of networks: networks in which all
inputs lead to weak, decaying transients, and networks in which specific inputs
elicit strongly amplified transient responses and are mapped onto orthogonal
output states during the dynamics. Theses two classes are simply distinguished
based on the spectrum of the symmetric part of the connectivity matrix. For the
second class of networks, which is a sub-class of non-normal networks, we
provide a procedure to identify transiently amplified inputs and the
corresponding readouts. We first apply these results to standard
randomly-connected and two-population networks. We then build minimal, low-rank
networks that robustly implement trajectories mapping a specific input onto a
specific output state. Finally, we demonstrate that the capacity of the
obtained networks increases proportionally with their size.

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnint.2019.00021</link>
	<content:encoded>Electrocommunication and -localization behaviors of weakly electric fish have been studied extensively in the lab, mostly by means of short-term observations on constrained fish. Far less is known about their behaviors in more natural-like settings, where fish are less constrained in space and time. We tracked individual fish in a population of fourteen brown ghost knifefish (Apteronotus leptorhynchus) housed in a large 2  indoor tank based on their electric organ discharges (EOD). The tank contained four different natural-like microhabitats (gravel, plants, isolated stones, stacked stones). In particular during the day individual fish showed preferences for specific habitat which provided appropriate shelter. Male fish with higher EOD frequencies spent more time in their preferred habitat during the day, moved more often between habitats during the night, and less often during the day in comparison to low-frequency males. Our data thus revealed a link between dominance indicated by higher EOD frequency, territoriality, and a more explorative personality in male A. leptorhynchus. In females, movement activity during both day and night correlated positively with EOD frequency. In the night, fish of either sex moved to another habitat after about 6 seconds on average. During the day, the average transition time was also very short at about 20 seconds. However, these activity phases were interrupted by phases of inactivity that lasted on average about 20 minutes during the day, but only 3 minutes in the night. The individual preference for daytime retreat sites did not reflect the frequent explorative movements at night.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Accumulation of misfolded proteins results in cellular stress, and is detected by specific sensors in the endoplasmic reticulum, collectively known as the unfolded protein response (UPR). It has been prominently proposed that the UPR is involved in the pathophysiology of Parkinson’s disease (PD). In the present study, the levels of the UPR proteins and mRNA transcripts were quantified in post mortem brain tissue from PD patients and matched controls. The level of a key mediator of the UPR pathway, glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78), was significantly decreased in temporal cortex and cingulate gyrus, whereas there were no significant changes in the caudate nucleus, prefrontal or parietal cortex regions. On the other hand, GRP78 mRNA level was significantly increased in caudate nucleus, cingulate gyrus, prefrontal, and parietal cortex regions. GRP78 protein level was also measured in plasma and cerebrospinal fluid, but there were no differences in these levels between PD patients and control subjects.  Furthermore, immunofluorescence labelling of the CD4+ T cells from PD patients showed that GRP78 protein is found in the cytoplasm. However, GRP78 level in PD patients was not significantly different from control subjects. Unlike the previous Lewy body dementia study, the present investigation reports reduced cortical protein, but increased transcript levels of GPR78 in PD. In summary, these data provide further evidence that GRP78 regulation is dysfunctional in the brains of PD patients.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00689</link>
	<content:encoded>The development of implantable neuroelectrodes is advancing rapidly as these tools are becoming increasingly ubiquitous in clinical practice, especially for the treatment of traumatic and neurodegenerative disorders. Electrodes have been exploited in a wide number of neural interface devices, such as deep brain stimulation, which is one of the most successful therapies with proven efficacy in the treatment of diseases like Parkinson or epilepsy. However, one of the main caveats related to the clinical application of electrodes is the nervous tissue response at the injury site, characterized by a cascade of inflammatory events, which culminate in chronic inflammation, and, in turn, result in the failure of the implant over extended periods of time. To overcome current limitations of the most widespread macroelectrode based systems, new design strategies and the development of innovative materials with superior biocompatibility characteristics are currently being investigated. 
This review describes the current state of the art of in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo models available for the study of neural tissue response to implantable microelectrodes. We particularly highlight new models with increased complexity that closely mimic in vivo scenarios and that can serve as promising alternatives to animal studies for investigation of microelectrodes in neural tissues. Additionally, we also express our view on the impact of the progress in the field of neural tissue engineering on neural implant research.</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Neurodegeneration section | New and Recent Articles: NK1-r Antagonist Treatment Comparable to Decompressive Craniectomy in Reducing Intracranial Pressure Following Stroke</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00681</link>
	<content:encoded>Background and Purpose: The morbidity and early mortality associated with stroke is largely attributable to cerebral edema and elevated intracranial pressure (ICP). Existing pharmacotherapies do not target the underlying pathophysiology and are often ineffective in sustainably lowering ICP whilst decompressive craniectomy (DC) surgery is life-saving yet with surgical/peri-operative risk and increased morbidity in the elderly. Accordingly, there is an urgent need for therapies that directly target the mechanisms of edema genesis. Neurogenic inflammation, mediated by substance P (SP) binding to the tachykinin NK1 receptor (NK1-r), is associated with blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption, cerebral edema and poor outcome post-stroke. NK1-r antagonist treatment ameliorates BBB dysfunction and cerebral edema in rodent stroke models. However, treatment has not been investigated in a large animal model, an important step towards clinical translation. Consequently, the current study compared the efficacy of NK1-r antagonist treatment to DC surgery in reducing ICP post-stroke in a clinically-relevant ovine model. 

Methods: Anaesthetized female Merino sheep (65±6 kg, 18-24 months) underwent sham surgery (n=4) or permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (n=22). Stroke animals were randomized into one of 5 treatments: 1xNK1 bolus (4h), 2xNK1 bolus (4h;9h), 3xNK1 bolus (4h;9h;14h), DC surgery (performed at 4h) or saline vehicle. ICP, blood pressure and blood gases were monitored for 24h post-stroke. At 24h post-stroke anaesthetized animals underwent MRI, followed by perfusion and brains removed and processed for histological assessment. 

Results: 2xNK1, 3xNK1 administration or DC surgery significantly (p&amp;lt;0.05) reduced ICP compared to vehicle. 1xNK1 was ineffective in sustainably lowering ICP. On MRI, midline shift and cerebral edema were more marked in vehicles compared to NK1-r treatment groups. 

Conclusion: Two or 3 boluses of NK1-r antagonist reduced ICP comparable to DC surgery, suggesting it may provide a novel alternative to invasive surgery for management of elevated ICP.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Arterial input function (AIF) is estimated from perfusion images as a basic curve for the calculus of hemodynamic variables used as surrogate markers of the vascular status of tissues. However, at present, identification of AIF is made manually leading by prior knowledge.

The model is trained by manual annotations. The proposed method was trained and tested by 100 cases of PWI images. The result was evaluated by dice similarity coefficient (DSC), which reached to 0.79. The trained model had a better performance than the traditional method. After segmentation of AIF ROI, AIF was calculated by average of all voxels in ROI. We compared AIF result with manual and traditional method, and father process parameter maps such as Tmax and rCBF. The result had a better performance. We had applied the method on a cloud platform Estroke, which can  evaluation ischemic penumbra to help make treatment decision.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2019.00224</link>
	<content:encoded>A major challenge in neuroscience is to understand what happens to a brain as it ages. Such insights could make it possible to distinguish between individuals who will undergo typical aging and those at risk for neurodegenerative disease. Over the last quarter century, thousands of human brain imaging studies have probed the neural basis of age-related cognitive decline.  “Aging” studies generally enroll adults over the age of 65, a historical precedent rooted in the average retirement age of U.S. wage-earners. A consequence of this research tradition is that it overlooks one of the most significant neuroendocrine changes in a woman’s life: the transition to menopause. The menopausal transition is marked by an overall decline in ovarian sex steroid production – up to 90% in the case of estradiol – a dramatic endocrine change that impacts multiple biological systems, including the brain. Despite sex differences in the risk for dementia, the influence that biological sex and sex hormones have on the aging brain is historically understudied, leaving a critical gap in our understanding of the aging process. In this Perspective, we highlight the influence that endocrine factors have on the aging brain. We devote particular attention to the neural and cognitive changes that unfold in the middle decade of life, as a function of reproductive aging. Next, we consider emerging evidence from animal and human studies that other endocrine factors occurring earlier in life (e.g. pregnancy, hormonal birth control use) also shape the aging process.

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2019.00214</link>
	<content:encoded>The amygdala, which is involved in human social information processing and social emotional response neuronal circuits, is segmented into three subregions that are responsible for perception, affiliation, and aversion. Though there is different functional and effective connectivity (EC) among these networks, age-related structural changes and associations between structure and function within the amygdala remain unclear. Here, we used diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data (106 participants) to investigate age-related structural changes in fractional anisotropy (FA) of amygdalar subregions. We also examined the relationship between FA and EC within the subregions. We found that the FA of the amygdalar subregions exhibited inverted-U shape trends with age. Moreover, over the human lifespan, there were negative correlations between the FA of the right ventrolateral amygdala (VLA.R) and the Granger-based EC (GC) of VLA.R → perception network (PerN), the FA of the VLA.R and the GC of the net flow from VLA.R → PerN, and the FA of the left dorsal amygdala (DorA.L) and the GC of the aversion network (AveN). Conversely, there was a positive correlation between the FA of the DorA.L and the GC of the net flow from DorA.L → AveN. Our results suggest that age-related changes in function of brain are constrained by the underlying white matter architectures, while the functional information flow changes influence white matter structure. This work increases our understanding of the neuronal mechanisms in the maturation and aging process.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2019.00043</link>
	<content:encoded>The analysis of Electroencephalographic (EEG) signals is of ulterior importance to aid in the diagnosis of mental disease and to increase our understanding of the brain.  Traditionally, clinical EEG has been analyzed in terms of temporal waveforms, looking at rhythms in spontaneous activity, subjectively identifying troughs and peaks in Event-Related Potentials (ERP), or by studying graphoelements in pathological sleep stages.
Additionally, the discipline of Brain Computer Interfaces (BCI) requires new methods to decode patterns from non-invasive EEG signals.  This field is developing alternative communication pathways to transmit volitional information from the Central Nervous System. The technology could potentially enhance the quality of life of patients affected by neurodegenerative disorders and other mental illness. This work mimics what electroencephalographers have been doing clinically, visually inspecting and categorizing phenomena within the EEG by the extraction of features from images of signal plots.  These features are constructed based on the calculation of histograms of oriented gradients from pixels around the signal plot. It aims to provide a new objective framework to analyze, characterize and classify EEG signal waveforms. The feasibility of the method is outlined by detecting the P300, an ERP elicited by the oddball paradigm of rare events, and implementing an offline P300-based BCI Speller.  The validity of the proposal is shown by offline processing a public dataset of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) patients and an own dataset of healthy subjects.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>The protein parkin, encoded by the PARK2 gene, is vital for mitochondrial homeostasis, and although it has been implicated in Parkinson’s disease (PD), the disease mechanisms remain unclear. We have applied mass spectrometry-based proteomics to investigate the effects of parkin dysfunction on the mitochondrial proteome in human isogenic induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived neurons with and without PARK2 knockout (KO). The proteomic analysis quantified nearly 60% of all mitochondrial proteins, 119 of which were dysregulated in neurons with PARK2 KO. The protein changes indicated disturbances in oxidative stress defense, mitochondrial respiration and morphology, cell cycle control  and cell viability. Structural and functional analyses revealed an increase in mitochondrial area and the presence of elongated mitochondria as well as impaired glycolysis and lactate-supported respiration in PARK2 KO neurons. Furthermore, PARK2 KO caused decreased proliferation and impaired cell survival. This demonstrates the efficiency of mitochondrial proteomics for identifying and elucidating disease-relevant phenotypes in human iPSC-derived neurons.</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Mast Cell/Proteinase Activated Receptor 2 (PAR2) Mediated Interactions in the Pathogenesis of Discogenic Back Pain</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2019.00294</link>
	<content:encoded>Mast cells (MCs) are present in the painful degenerate human intervertebral disc (IVD) and are associated with disease pathogenesis. MCs release granules containing enzymatic and inflammatory factors in response to stimulants or allergens.  The serine protease, tryptase, is unique to MCs and its activation of the G-protein coupled receptor, Protease Activated Receptor 2 (PAR2), induces inflammation and degradation in osteoarthritic cartilage. Our previously published work has demonstrated increased levels of MC marker tryptase in IVD samples from discogenic back pain patients compared to healthy control IVD samples including expression of chemotactic agents that may facilitate MC migration into the IVD. To further elucidate MCs’ role in the IVD and mechanisms underlying its effects, we investigated whether 1) human IVD cells can promote MC migration, 2) MC tryptase can mediate up-regulation of inflammatory/catabolic process in human IVD cells and tissue, and 3) the potential of PAR2 antagonist to function as a therapeutic drug in in vitro human and ex vivo bovine pilot models of disease. MC migration was quantitatively assessed using conditioned media from primary human IVD cells and MC migration examined through matrigel. Exposure to soluble IVD factors significantly enhanced MC migration, suggesting IVD cells can recruit MCs. We also demonstrated significant upregulation of MC chemokine SCF and angiogenic factor VEGFA gene expression in human IVD cells in vitro in response to recombinant human tryptase, suggesting tryptase can enhance recruitment of MCs and promotion of angiogenesis into the usually avascular IVD. Furthermore, tryptase can degrade proteoglycans in IVD tissue as demonstrated by significant increases in glycosaminoglycans released into surrounding media. This can create a catabolic microenvironment compromising structural integrity and facilitating vascular migration usually inhibited by the anti-angiogenic IVD matrix. Finally, as a “proof of concept” study, we examined the therapeutic potential of PAR2 antagonist (PAR2A) on human IVD cells and bovine organ culture IVD model. While preliminary data shows promise and points toward structural restoration of the bovine IVD including down-regulation of VEGFA, effects of PAR2 antagonist on human IVD cells differ between gender and donors suggesting that further validation is required with larger cohorts of human specimens.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnana.2019.00067</link>
	<content:encoded>The artiodactyl brain has multiple levels of vascular pooling and the rostral epidural rete mirabile (RERM) at its base. The current study is the first of its kind to precisely demonstrate the arterial vasculature of the dromedary brain, utilizing a new casting method with coloured latex and epoxy paint.
In total, 35 freshly slaughtered dromedary heads were injected with coloured latex or coloured epoxy paint prior to dissection in order to reveal cerebral vasculature; Ten processed heads were chemically digested with 5% potassium hydroxide to obtain hard casts of cerebral arteries and anastomosing structures. 
The outcomes of this study ascertain the distinct vascular features of dromedaries that set them apart from other artiodactyls. In addition to the RERM, the dromedary possesses a well-developed ophthalmic and chiasmatic rete. The dromedary is similar to giraffe, goat, cat and pig in the contribution of middle meningeal artery to the rete mirabile; however, dromedaries have several arteries emerging directly from the cerebral arterial circle that supply the choroid plexus and pineal gland. Additionally, dromedaries exhibit a dominant basilar system that dominates the, blood supply to the medulla oblongata, pons, and cerebellum. In our study, we were able to graphically prove the lack of connection between the areas supplied by vertebrobasilar system and carotid system in the dromedary. Furthermore, the vertebral artery does not branch into the basilar artery; instead, it acts as a contributing vessel to the ventral spinal artery that later fuse to form the basilar artery. 
This study employed the new casting method to illustrate a new arterial source to RERM and the various anastomoses among arterial sources supplying the brain in the dromedary. These anastomoses play an important role in maintaining an uninterrupted cerebral blood supply, decreasing the vulnerability of the fragile brain against ischaemia and stroke, as well as, play an important role in maintaining blood pressure and flow in long-necked dromedaries when they raise or lower their heads.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>We identified a locus on mouse chromosome 10 that accounts for 60% of the genetic variance in methamphetamine intake in mice selectively bred for high versus low methamphetamine consumption. We nominated the trace amine-associated receptor 1 gene, &lt;i&gt;Taar1&lt;/i&gt;, as the strongest candidate and identified regulation of the mu-opioid receptor 1 gene, &lt;i&gt;Oprm1&lt;/i&gt;, as another contributor.

We used a family of recombinant inbred mouse strains for interval mapping and to examine independent and epistatic effects of &lt;i&gt;Taar1&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Oprm1&lt;/i&gt;. Both methamphetamine intake and the thermal response mapped to &lt;i&gt;Taar1&lt;/i&gt; and the independent effect of &lt;i&gt;Taar1&lt;/i&gt; was dependent on genotype at &lt;i&gt;Oprm1&lt;/i&gt;.

	<link>https://www.cell.com/trends/neurosciences/fulltext/S0166-2236(19)30087-6?rss=yes</link>
	<content:encoded>Stroke patients have only limited therapeutic options and often remain with considerable disabilities. To promote neurological recovery, angiogenesis in the ischemic peri-infarct region has been recognized as an encouraging therapeutic target. Despite advances in mechanistic understanding of vascular growth and repair, effective and safe angiogenic treatments are currently missing. Besides the most intensively studied angiogenic growth factors, recent research has indicated that the process of vascular sprouting and migration also requires the participation of guidance molecules, many of which were initially identified as regulators of axonal growth.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/694141v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>The impact of individual differences on performance monitoring and psychopathology is a question of active debate. Personality traits associated with psychopathology may be related to poor internal performance monitoring (as measured by the error-related negativity [ERN]) but intact external performance monitoring (as measured by the reward positivity [RewP]), suggesting that there are underlying neural differences between internal and external performance monitoring processes. We tested the relationships between individual difference measures of perfectionism, locus of control, and ERN, Pe, and RewP component difference amplitude in a healthy undergraduate sample. A total of 128 participants (69 female, M(SD)age= 20.6(2.0) years) completed two tasks: a modified version of the Eriksen Flanker and a doors gambling task along with the Frost Multidimensional Perfectionism scale, the Rotter Locus of Control scale, and the Levenson Multidimensional Locus of Control scale to quantify perfectionism and locus of control traits, respectively. Linear regressions adjusting for age and gender showed that neither {Delta}ERN nor {Delta}RewP amplitude were significantly moderated by perfectionism or locus of control scores. Findings suggest that, in psychiatrically-healthy individuals, there is not a strong link between perfectionism, locus of control, and ERN or RewP amplitude. Future research on individual difference measures in people with psychopathology may provide further insight into how these personality traits affect performance monitoring.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Differences in strategic abilities but not associative processes explain memory development</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/693895v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Children's learning capabilities change while growing up. One framework that describes the cognitive and neural development of children's growing learning abilities is the two-component model. It distinguishes processes that integrate separate features into a coherent memory representation (associative component) and executive abilities, such as elaboration, evaluation and monitoring, that support memory processing (strategic component). In an fMRI study using an object-location association paradigm, we investigated how the two components influence memory performance across development. We tested children (10-12 yrs., n=31), late adolescents (18 yrs., n=29) and adults (25+ yrs., n=30) of either sex. For studying the associative component, we also probed how the utilisation of prior knowledge (schemas) facilitates memory across age groups. Children had overall lower retrieval performance, while adolescents and adults did not differ from each other. All groups benefitted from schemas, but this effect did not differ between groups. Performance differences between groups were associated with deactivation of the dorsal medial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC), which in turn was linked to executive functioning. These patterns were stronger in adolescents and adults and seemed absent in children. This pattern of results suggests the children's executive system, the strategic component, is not as mature and thus cannot facilitate memory performance in the same way as in adolescents/adults. In contrast, we did not find age-related differences in the associative component; with activity in the angular gyrus predicting memory performance systematically across groups. Overall our results suggest that differences of executive rather than associative abilities explain memory differences between children, adolescents and adults.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/693861v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Learning to produce spatiotemporal sequences is a common task the brain has to solve. The same neural substrate may be used by the brain to produce different sequential behaviours. The way the brain learns and encodes such tasks remains unknown as current computational models do not typically use realistic biologically-plausible learning. Here, we propose a model where a spiking recurrent network of excitatory and inhibitory biophysical neurons drives a read-out layer: the dynamics of the recurrent network is constrained to encode time while the read-out neurons encode space. Space is then linked with time through plastic synapses that follow common Hebbian learning rules. We demonstrate that the model is able to learn spatiotemporal dynamics on a timescale that is behaviourally relevant. Learned sequences are robustly replayed during a regime of spontaneous activity.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/693762v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>In everyday circumstances, human observers can easily discriminate the direction of transparent liquid flow. However, the mechanism of direction discrimination is not so straightforward. The present study focused on the flow of image deformation, which is closely related to the flow of transparent liquid in the natural world. To determine what image information is important in discriminating the direction of deformation flow, a natural image in a stimulus clip was deformed by using a deformation vector map that translated leftward or rightward. The task of the observers was to judge whether the transparent liquid in the clip flowed leftward or rightward. Manipulating the amplitude of deformation, we found that the discrimination performance improved with the amplitude. Interestingly, the observers' performance was high overall only when shearing deformation was applied to the stimuli, while the observers reported an opposite-motion direction when only compressive deformation was applied. We computationally analyzed motion statistics of stimuli and found that the combination of mean and skewness of horizontal motion vectors reliably predicted the performance. The results indicate that human observers use global motion directions in order to determine the direction of deformation flow.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/693754v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Distracted eating is associated with increased food intake and overweight. However, the underlying neurocognitive mechanisms are unknown. To elucidate these mechanisms, 41 healthy normal-weight participants received sips of high- and low-sweet isocaloric chocolate milk, while performing a high- or low-distracting detection task during fMRI on two test days. Subsequently, we measured ad libitum food intake. As expected, a region in the primary taste cortex - located in the insula - responded more to the sweeter drink. Distraction did not affect this right insula sweetness response across the group, but did weaken sweetness-related connectivity of this region to a secondary taste region in the right orbitofrontal cortex. Moreover, distraction-related attenuation of taste processing in the insula predicted increased subsequent ad libitum food intake after distraction between subjects. These results reveal a previously unknown mechanism explaining how distraction during consumption attenuates neural taste processing and increases food intake. The study was preregistered at https://osf.io/vxdhg/register/5771ca429ad5a1020de2872e?view_only=e3207cd6567f41f0a1505e343a64b5aa.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/693580v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>The common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) is a small-bodied New World primate, increasing in prominence as a model animal for neuroscience research. The lissencephalic cortex of this primate species provides substantial advantages for the application of electrophysiological techniques such as high-density and laminar recordings, which have the capacity to advance our understanding of local and laminar cortical circuits and their roles in cognitive and motor functions. This is particularly the case with respect to the oculomotor system, as critical cortical areas of this network such as the frontal eye fields (FEF) and lateral intraparietal area (LIP) lie deep within sulci in macaques. Studies of cytoarchitecture and connectivity have established putative homologies between cortical oculomotor fields in marmoset and macaque, but physiological investigations of these areas, particularly in awake marmosets, have yet to be carried out. Here, we addressed this gap by probing the function of posterior parietal cortex (PPC) of the common marmoset using electrical microstimulation. We implanted two animals with 32-channel Utah arrays at the location of the putative area LIP and applied microstimulation while they viewed a video display and made untrained eye movements. Similar to previous studies in macaques, stimulation evoked fixed-vector and goal-directed saccades, staircase saccades, and eye blinks. These data demonstrate that area LIP of the marmoset plays a role in the regulation of eye movements, provide additional evidence that this area is homologous with that of the macaque, and further establish the marmoset as valuable model for neurophysiological investigations of oculomotor and cognitive control.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/693531v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Understanding how the human brain integrates information from the environment with ongoing, internal brain signals in order to produce individual perspective is an essential element of understanding the human mind. Brain signal complexity, measured with multiscale entropy, has been employed as a measure of information processing in the brain (Carpentier et al., 2016), and we propose that it can also be used to measure the information available from a stimulus. We can directly assess the correspondence, or functional isomorphism, between brain signal complexity and stimulus complexity as an indication of how well the brain reflects the content of the environment in an analysis that we termed complexity matching. Music makes an ideal stimulus input because it is a multidimensional, complex signal, and because of its emotion and reward-inducing potential. We found that electroencephalography (EEG) complexity was lower and more closely resembled the musical complexity when participants performed a perceptual task that required them to closely track the acoustics, compared to an emotional task that asked them to think about how the music made them feel. Music-derived reward scores on the Barcelona Music Reward Questionnaire (Mas-Herrero et al., 2013) correlated with worse complexity matching and higher EEG complexity. Compared to perceptual-level processing, emotional and reward responses are associated with additional internal information processes above and beyond those in the external stimulus.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/693390v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Spontaneous nerve regeneration in cephalopod molluscs occurs in a relative short time after injury, achieving functional recovery of the lost capacities. In particular, transection of the pallial nerve in the common octopus (Octopus vulgaris) determines loss and subsequent restoring of two functions fundamental for survival, i.e. breathing and skin patterning, the latter involved in communication between animals and concealing. The phenomena occurring after lesion have been investigated in a series of previous studies, but a complete analysis of the changes occurring at the level of the axons and the effects on animals appearance during the whole regenerative process is still missing. Our goal is to determine the course of events following injury, from impairment to full recovery. We observed nerve regeneration, end-target re-innervation and functional reconnections between central brain and periphery, using the contralateral nerve in the same animal as internal control. The final architecture of the regenerated nervous tissue does not mirror the original structure, however functionality returns to match the phenotype of an intact octopus, and with no visible impact on the behaviour of the animal. This provides exceptional value to these findings for future studies.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/692970v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>While long-range functional connectivity (FC) has been reported as a necessary condition of conscious state, precise evidence is still scarce. In this work we provide such a direct and conclusive evidence in a set of three experiments. In the two first experiments, intracranial-EEG was recorded in the same individuals during conscious wakefulness (CW), rapid-eye-movement-sleep (REM), stable periods of slow-wave-sleep (SWS) and propofol anaesthesia (PA). We discovered that long-range FC in the 2-5Hz frequency band was a specific marker of conscious states that could discriminate CW and REM from SWS and PA. In the third experiment, we generalized this finding on a large cohort of brain injured patients by revealing that FC in the 2-5 Hz range was also able to discriminate patients in the vegetative state from patients in the minimally conscious state. Taken together these results suggest that 2-5Hz FC is a new and robust signature of conscious states.</content:encoded>

We demonstrate that PIPseq is capable of selecting rare cell types and enriching them by nearly one hundred-fold. We applied PIPseq to the challenge of mapping receptor-ligand pairings among vomeronasal pheromone-sensing neurons in mice. Together with in vivo ectopic expression of vomeronasal chemoreceptors, PIPseq identified the complete combinatorial receptor code for a specific set of ligands, and revealed that the primary sequence of a chemoreceptor was an unexpectedly strong predictor of functional similarity.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Muscarinic modulation of spike-timing dependent plasticity at recurrent layer 2/3 synapses in mouse auditory cortex</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/690446v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Cholinergic systems contribute to the refinement of auditory cortical receptive fields by activating muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChRs). However, the specific cellular and synaptic mechanisms underlying acetylcholine's effects on cortical circuits are not fully understood. In this study, we investigate the effects of muscarinic receptor modulation on spike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP) at synapses onto layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons in mouse auditory cortex (AC). Synapses onto layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons exhibit a STDP rule for pairing of postsynaptic spike bursts with single presynaptic stimuli. Pre-before-post pairing at +10 ms results in a timing-dependent long-term potentiation (tLTP), whereas pre-before-post pairing at +50 ms intervals, and post-before-pre pairing at -10 to -20 ms produce a timing-dependent long-term depression. We also characterize how mAChR activation affects plasticity at these synapses, focusing on the induction of tLTP. During pre-before-post pairing at +10 ms, mAChR activation by either carbachol or oxotremorine-M suppresses tLTP. mAChR activation also reduces the NMDA-receptor dependent synaptically evoked increase in calcium in dendrites, apparently without affecting presynaptic transmitter release. Pharmacological experiments suggest that M1 and M3 receptors are not involved in the mAChR-mediated suppression of tLTP. Taken together, these results suggest activating mAChRs in layer 2/3 intracortical circuits can modify the circuit dynamics of AC by depressing tLTP mediated by NMDA receptors, and depressing calcium influx at excitatory synapses onto layer 2/3 pyramidal cells.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/689505v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Recent reports revealed heterogeneity of oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs). It remains unclear if heterogeneity reflects different types of cells with distinct functions, or rather transiently acquired states of cells with the same function. By integrating lineage formation of individual OPC clones, single-cell transcriptomics, calcium imaging and manipulation of neural activity, we show that OPCs in the zebrafish spinal cord can be divided into two functionally distinct entities. One subgroup forms elaborate networks of processes and exhibits a high degree of calcium signalling, but infrequently differentiates, despite contact to permissive axons. Instead, these OPCs divide in an activity and calcium dependent manner to produce another subgroup with higher process motility and less calcium signaling, which readily differentiates. Our data show that OPC subgroups are functionally diverse in responding to neurons and reveal that activity regulates proliferation of a subset of OPCs that is distinct from the cells that generate differentiated oligodendrocytes.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/688317v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), a form of non-invasive brain stimulation, is a promising treatment for depression. Recent research suggests that tDCS efficacy can be augmented using concurrent cognitive emotional training (CET). However, the neurophysiological changes associated with this combined intervention remain to be elucidated. We therefore examined the effects of tDCS combined with CET using electroencephalography (EEG). A total of 20 participants with treatment resistant depression took part in the study and received 18 sessions over 6 weeks of tDCS and concurrent CET. Resting-state and task-related EEG during a 3-back working memory task were aquired at baseline and immediately following the treatment course. Results showed an improvement in mood and working memory accuracy, but not response time, following the intervention. We did not find significant effects of the intervention on resting-state power spectral density (frontal theta and alpha asymmetry), time-frequency power (alpha event-related desynchronization and theta event-related synchronisation), or event-related potentials (P3 component). There was weak evidence for an increase in P2 amplitude, suggesting an improvement to attentional processes, but this result did not survive correction for multiple comparisons. We therefore identified little evidence of neurophysiological changes associated with treatment using tDCS and concurrent CET, despite significant improvements in mood and near transfer effects of cognitive training to working memory accuracy. Further research incorporating a sham controlled group may be necessary to identify the neurophysiological effects of the intervention.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/682609v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>A major feature of the mammalian auditory system is its extensive feedback architecture. During movement execution, this organization allows the auditory system access to outgoing signals from the motor system, which are thought to be used in differentiating environmental versus self-generated sounds. Building on recent theories of limb control that emphasize the critical function of movement planning in setting up the neural state of motor cortex prior to execution, here we hypothesized that planning may also modulate early auditory cortex. We show, using functional MRI and a delayed object lifting task, that information related to the limb to be used can be decoded, well before movement, from neural activity in human auditory cortex. This suggests that action planning, in addition to preparing the motor system for movement, involves the task-specific preparation of primary sensory areas, such that they are set up to process sensory information arising during the unfolding movement.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25543?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compared to older Caucasians, older African Americans have higher risks of developing Alzheimer's disease (AD), and lower cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) tau biomarker levels. It is not known whether tau‐related differences begin earlier in life, and whether race modifies other AD‐related biomarkers such as inflammatory proteins.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We performed multiplex cytokine analysis in a healthy middle‐aged cohort with family history of AD (n=68) and an older cohort (n=125) with normal cognition (NC), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), or AD dementia. After identifying baseline IL‐9 level and AD‐associated IL‐9 change to differ according to race, we performed immunohistochemical analysis for proteins mechanistically linked to IL‐9 in brains of African Americans and Caucasians (n=38), and analyzed post‐mortem IL‐9‐related gene expression profiles in the publically available Mount Sinai cohort (26 African Americans and 180 Caucasians).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compared to Caucasians with NC, African Americans with NC had lower CSF tau, p‐Tau&lt;sub&gt;181&lt;/sub&gt;, and IL‐9 levels in both living cohorts. Conversely, AD was only correlated with increased CSF IL‐9 levels in African Americans but not Caucasians. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed peri‐vascular, neuronal, and glial cells immunoreactive to IL‐9, and quantitative analysis in two independent US cohorts showed AD to correlate with molecular changes (upstream differentiation marker and downstream effector cell marker) of IL‐9 upregulation only in African Americans but not Caucasians.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Baseline and AD‐associated IL‐9 differences between African Americans and Caucasians point to distinct molecular phenotypes for AD according to ancestry. Genetic and non‐genetic factors need to be considered in future AD research involving unique populations.&lt;/p&gt;

	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Higher plasma total‐tau level is associated with incident dementia but its relationship with stroke risk is unknown. In this prospective community‐based study, we evaluated plasma total‐tau level as a biomarker of stroke risk in 2794 Framingham Heart Study participants. Persons with plasma total‐tau levels in the top quintile, versus the bottom four, had an increased risk of incident stroke over a mean follow‐up of 8.3 years (Hazard Ratio, 2.01; 95% Confidence Interval, 1.32‐3.08) following adjustments for age, sex, and stroke risk factors. Our findings demonstrate that plasma total‐tau relates to the risk of stroke in a community sample.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Effect of assistive method on the sense of fulfillment with agency: Modeling with flow and attribution theory. (arXiv:1907.01934v1 [cs.HC])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1907.01934</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Several assistive technologies for users' operations have been recently
developed. A user's sense of agency (SoA) decreases with increasing system
assistance, possibly resulting in a decrease in the user's sense of
fulfillment. This study aims to provide a design guideline for an assistive
method to maintain and improve the sense of fulfillment with SoA. We propose a
mathematical model describing the mechanisms by which the assistive method
affects SoA and SoA induces a sense of fulfillment. The experience in the flow
state is assumed to be a sense of fulfillment. The assistance effect on the
skill-challenge plane in flow theory is defined as an increase in skill and
decrease in challenge. The factor that separates the two effects from
attribution theory is the locus of causality, which is matched to the judgement
of agency (JoA) from the two-step account of agency. We hypothesized that the
assistance increases the perception of skill and sense of fulfillment is
greater when the locus of causality is internal, rather than external. To
verify this hypothesis, a game task experiment was conducted with assistance
that varied with the ease of recognition. We hypothesized that a player's JoA
is internal for hard-to-recognize assistance, resulting in a high sense of
fulfillment. Experimental results supported this hypothesis.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;This study aimed to develop a method to evaluate the sense of discrepancy to
the operation response quantitatively. We examined the availability of
event-related potential (P300), which is considered to reflect attention to
stimulation, to evaluate the sense of discrepancy to the product response to
the user's action. In the experiment using subjective evaluation and P300 to
investigate the sense of discrepancy due to the lack of operation response
(sound and vibration) to the shutter operation of the mirrorless single-lens
camera, it was confirmed that P300 amplitude corresponds to the degree of the
subjective sense of discrepancy. Our results showed that the P300 amplitude
could evaluate the sense of discrepancy to the operation response.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;While there is still a lot to learn about astrocytes and their
neuromodulatory role associated with their spatial and temporal integration of
synaptic activity, the introduction of an additional to neurons processing unit
into neuromorphic hardware is timely, facilitating their computational
exploration in basic science questions and their exploitation in real-world
applications. Here, we present an astrocytic module that enables the
development of a spiking Neuronal-Astrocytic Network (SNAN) into Intel's Loihi
neuromorphic chip. The basis of our module is an end-to-end biophysically
plausible compartmental model of an astrocyte that simulates how intracellular
activity may encode synaptic activity in space and time. To demonstrate the
functional role of astrocytes in SNANs, we describe how an astrocyte may sense
and induce activity-dependent neuronal synchronization, can endow single-shot
learning capabilities in spike-time-dependent plasticity (STDP), and sense the
transition between ordered and chaotic activity in the neuronal component of an
SNAN. Our astrocytic module may serve as a natural extension for neuromorphic
hardware by mimicking the distinct computational roles of its biological
counterpart.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Reverse engineering neural networks from many partial recordings. (arXiv:1907.01588v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1907.01588</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Much of neuroscience aims at reverse engineering the brain, but we only
record a small number of neurons at a time. We do not currently know if reverse
engineering the brain requires us to simultaneously record most neurons or if
multiple recordings from smaller subsets suffice. This is made even more
important by the development of novel techniques that allow recording from
selected subsets of neurons, e.g. using optical techniques. To get at this
question, we analyze a neural network, trained on the MNIST dataset, using only
partial recordings and characterize the dependency of the quality of our
reverse engineering on the number of simultaneously recorded &quot;neurons&quot;. We find
that reverse engineering of the nonlinear neural network is meaningfully
possible if a sufficiently large number of neurons is simultaneously recorded
but that this number can be considerably smaller than the number of neurons.
Moreover, recording many times from small random subsets of neurons yields
surprisingly good performance. Application in neuroscience suggests to
approximate the I/O function of an actual neural system, we need to record from
a much larger number of neurons. The kind of scaling analysis we perform here
can, and arguably should be used to calibrate approaches that can dramatically
scale up the size of recorded data sets in neuroscience.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1902.06122</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;When designing experimental studies with human participants, experimenters
must decide how many trials each participant will complete, as well as how many
participants to test. Most discussion of statistical power (the ability of a
study design to detect an effect) has focussed on sample size, and assumed
sufficient trials. Here we explore the influence of both factors on statistical
power, represented as a two-dimensional plot on which iso-power contours can be
visualised. We demonstrate the conditions under which the number of trials is
particularly important, i.e. when the within-participant variance is large
relative to the between-participants variance. We then derive power contour
plots using existing data sets for eight experimental paradigms and
methodologies (including reaction times, sensory thresholds, fMRI, MEG, and
EEG), and provide estimates of the within- and between-participant variance for
each method. In all cases, the within-participant variance was larger than the
between-participants variance, meaning that the number of trials has a
meaningful influence on statistical power in commonly used paradigms. An online
tool is provided (https://shiny.york.ac.uk/powercontours/) for generating power
contours, from which the optimal combination of trials and participants can be
calculated when designing future studies.

	<content:encoded>Neural correlates of consciousness (for brevity NCC) are foundational to the scientific study of consciousness. David Chalmers (2000) has provided the most informative and influential definition of NCC, according to which neural correlates are minimally sufficient for consciousness. However, the sense of sufficiency needs further clarification since there are several relevant senses with different entailments. In section one of this article, we give an overview of the desiderata for a good definition of NCC and Chalmers’s definition. The second section analyzes the merit of understanding the sufficiency of neural correlates for corresponding consciousness according to three relevant types of sufficiency: logical, metaphysical, and physical. In section three, a theoretical approach to consciousness studies is suggested in light of the sense in which NCC are sufficient for consciousness. Section four addresses a concern some might have about this approach. By the end, it will become apparent that our conception of NCC has important implications for research methodology, neuroethics, and the vitality of the search for NCC.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2019.00220</link>
	<content:encoded>The tendency of customers’ preference to their local brands over the foreign ones is known as the consumer ethnocentrism, and it is one of the important issues in international marketing. This study aims at identifying the behavioral and neural correlates of Consumer Ethnocentrism in the field of brand preference by using Event-Related Potential (ERP). We sampled subjects from two ethnic groups, the Chinese ethnic group and the sub-Sahara black Africans group from the Zhejiang University. The subjects faced two sequential stimuli, S1 followed by S2. The S1 consisted of 40 pictures of 20 Chinese and 20 Africans black peoples wearing traditional clothes, and S2 consisted of 40 fake brand-logos which were divided randomly into two groups of 20 each. The subjects were informed that the people in the S1 purchased and recommended the products with the brand-logos presented in S2, and the subjects were asked to rate their preference degree toward these logos. The brand-logos were called the “in-group recommended logos” if the recommender in S1 were the same race as the subjects, otherwise, the “out-group recommended logos”.The results revealed that the race of the brand-logo recommender highly impacted the Chinese subjects’ preference for the brand-logos. The N200 component elicited by in-group recommended logos were significantly lower than those elicited by out-group recommended logos. Besides, there was evidence that being familiar with foreign cultures reduces consumer ethnocentrism. The African subjects were familiar with Chinese people and adopted Chinese culture, as a result, they did not differ in showing preferences between in-group and out-group recommended logos.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Language could not exist without memory, in all its forms: working memory for sequential production and understanding, implicit memory for grammatical rules, semantic memory for knowledge, and episodic memory for communicating personal experience. Episodic memory is part of a more general capacity for mental travel both forward and backward in time, and even into fantasy and stories. I argue that the generativity of mental time travel underlies the generativity of language itself, and could be the basis of what Chomsky calls I-language, or universal grammar, a capacity for recursive thought independent of communicative language itself. Whereas Chomsky proposed that I-language evolved in a single step well after the emergence of Homo sapiens, I suggest that generative imagination, extended in space and time, has a long evolutionary history, and that it was the capacity to share internal thoughts, rather than the nature of the thoughts themselves, that more clearly distinguishes humans from other species.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2019.00215</link>
	<content:encoded>Sensory experiences, such as sound, often result from our motor actions. Over time, repeated sound-producing performance can generate sensorimotor associations. However, it is not clear how sensory and motor information are associated. Here, we explore if sensory prediction is associated with the formation of sensorimotor associations during a learning task. We recorded event-related potentials (ERPs) while participants produced index and little finger-swipes on a bespoke device, generating novel sounds. ERPs were also obtained as participants heard those sounds played back. Peak suppression was compared to assess sensory prediction. Additionally, transcranial magnetic stimulation was used during listening to generate finger-motor evoked potentials (MEPs). MEPs were recorded before and after training upon hearing these sounds, and then compared to reveal sensorimotor associations. Finally, we explored the relationship between these components. Results demonstrated that an increased positive-going peak (e.g., P2) and a suppressed negative-going peak (e.g., N2) were recorded during action, revealing some sensory prediction outcomes (P2: p = 0.050, p2 = 0.208; N2: p = 0.001, p2 = 0.474). Increased MEPs were also observed upon hearing congruent compared with incongruent sounds (i.e., associated to a finger), demonstrating precise sensorimotor associations not present before learning (Index finger: p &amp;lt; 0.001, p2 = 0.614; Little finger: p &amp;lt; 0.001, p2 = 0.529). Consistent with our broad hypotheses, a negative association between the MEPs in one finger during listening and ERPs during performance of the other was observed (Index finger MEPs and Fz N1 action ERPs; r = -.655, p = .003). Overall, data suggest predictive mechanisms are associated with fine-tuning of sensorimotor associations.</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: 3D Reconstruction of the Neurovascular Unit Reveals Differential Loss of Cholinergic Innervation in the Cortex and Hippocampus of the Adult Mouse Brain</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2019.00172</link>
	<content:encoded>Increasing evidence supports a role for cerebrovasculature dysfunction in the aetiology of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Blood vessels in the brain are composed of a collection of cells and acellular material that comprise the neurovascular unit (NVU). The NVU in the hippocampus and cortex receives innervation from cholinergic neurons that originate in the basal forebrain.  Death of these neurons and their nerve fibres is an early feature of AD. However, the effect of the loss of cholinergic innervation on the NVU is not well characterised. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of the loss of cholinergic innervation of components of the NVU at capillaries, arteries and veins in the hippocampus and cortex. Adult male C57BL/6 mice received an intracerebroventricular injection of the immunotoxin p75NTR mu-saporin to induce the loss of cholinergic neurons. Quadruple labelling immunohistochemistry and 3D reconstruction were carried out to characterise specific points of contact between cholinergic fibres and collagen IV, smooth muscle cells and astrocyte endfeet. Innate differences were observed between vessels of the hippocampus and cortex of control mice, including a greater amount of cholinergic contact with perivascular astrocytes in hippocampal capillaries and a thicker basement membrane in hippocampal veins. Saporin treatment induced a loss of cholinergic innervation at the arterial basement membrane and smooth muscle cells of both the hippocampus and the cortex. In the cortex, there was an additional loss of innervation at the astrocytic endfeet. The current results suggest that cortical arteries are more strongly affected by cholinergic denervation than arteries in the hippocampus. This regional variation may have implications for the etiology of the vascular pathology that develops in AD.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2019.00161</link>
	<content:encoded>Although genetic factors contribute to neurodegenerative diseases such as dementia, the etiology of these disorders is complex and incompletely understood. Thus, a growing interest in different approaches including a developmental perspective to these pathologies is gaining momentum. Including environmental factors offers the possibility to enhance our understanding of the etiological factors resulting in the emergence of neurodegenerative processes.
Brain, cognitive, and affective reserves can constitute protective factors against the manifestation of symptoms or signs related to cognitive decline in elderly people. These reserves are shaped by the interactions between the person and their environment. Therefore, they are influenced by the quality of the individual’s socio-economic situation, their level of education, the variety and quality of intellectual stimulations and social interactions. 
Both current and past environment may be of importance. Attachment theory appears to be a valuable candidate to approach the study of the relational early-life environment, as it bears on numerous facets of a person’s development. Besides its established impact on the development of social and affective competencies, recent results highlight that the quality of attachment relations between the child and their caregivers also influences the development of cognitive competencies and, thus, may influence the cognitive reserve in later life. Furthermore, attachment is likely to be involved in neurobiological aspects of brain development as well as in certain epigenetic processes. 
Through the lens of the attachment theory, this review will attempt to show how the previously mentioned components participate in the development of affective, cognitive and brain reserves, which can in turn act as protective factors against cognitive decline in elderly people.</content:encoded>

Systemic hyper-inflammation is characteristic in people with TB and concurrent DM (TBDM) at baseline, but the impact of TB treatment on this pattern has not been determined. We measured 17 plasma cytokines and growth factors in longitudinal cohorts of Indian and Brazilian pulmonary TB patients with or without DM. Principal component analysis revealed virtually complete separation of TBDM from TB individuals in both cohorts at baseline, with hyper-inflammation in TBDM that continued through treatment completion at six months. By one year after treatment completion, there was substantial convergence of mediator levels between groups within the India cohort. Non-resolving systemic inflammation in TBDM comorbidity could reflect delayed lesion sterilization or non-resolving sterile inflammation. Either mechanism portends unfavorable long-term outcomes including risk for recurrent TB and for damaging immune pathology.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;i&gt;In-silico&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;in-vitro&lt;/i&gt; studies have made progress in understanding protein-protein complexes formation; however, the molecular mechanisms for their dissociation are unclear. Protein-protein complexes, lasting from microseconds to years, often involve induced-fit, challenging computational or kinetic analysis. Charybdotoxin (CTX), a peptide from the &lt;i&gt;Leiurus&lt;/i&gt; scorpion venom, blocks voltage-gated K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-channels in a unique example of binding/unbinding simplicity. CTX plugs the external mouth of K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-channels pore, stopping K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-ion conduction, without inducing conformational changes. Conflicting with a tight binding, we show that external permeant ions enhance CTX-dissociation, implying a path connecting the pore, in the toxin-bound channel, with the external solution. This sensitivity is explained if CTX &lt;i&gt;wobbles&lt;/i&gt; between several bound conformations, producing transient events that restore the electrical and ionic trans-pore gradients. Wobbling may originate from a network of contacts in the interaction interface that are in dynamic stochastic equilibria.

	<content:encoded>An enigmatic step in&lt;i&gt; de novo&lt;/i&gt; formation of the autophagosome membrane compartment is the expansion of the precursor membrane phagophore, which requires the acquisition of lipids to serve as building blocks. Autophagy-related 2 (ATG2), the rod-shaped protein that tethers phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PI3P)-enriched phagophores to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), is suggested to be essential for phagophore expansion, but the underlying mechanism remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that human ATG2A is a lipid-transferring protein. ATG2A can extract lipids from membrane vesicles and unload them to other vesicles. Lipid transfer by ATG2A is more efficient between tethered vesicles than between untethered vesicles. The PI3P effectors WIPI4 and WIPI1 associate ATG2A stably to PI3P-containing vesicles, thereby facilitating ATG2A-mediated tethering and lipid transfer between PI3P-containing vesicles and PI3P-free vesicles. Based on these results, we propose that ATG2-mediated transfer of lipids from the ER to the phagophore enables phagophore expansion.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: latest articles: Anterior CNS expansion driven by brain transcription factors</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/45274</link>
	<content:encoded>During CNS development there is prominent expansion of the anterior region, the brain. In &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt;, anterior CNS expansion emerges from three rostral features: 1) increased progenitor cell generation, 2) extended progenitor cell proliferation, 3) more proliferative daughters. We find that &lt;i&gt;tailless&lt;/i&gt; (mouse &lt;i&gt;Nr2E1/Tlx&lt;/i&gt;), &lt;i&gt;otp/Rx/hbn&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;Otp/Arx/Rax&lt;/i&gt;) and &lt;i&gt;Doc1/2/3&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;Tbx2/3/6&lt;/i&gt;) are important for brain progenitor generation. These genes, and &lt;i&gt;earmuff&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;FezF1/2&lt;/i&gt;), are also important for subsequent progenitor and/or daughter cell proliferation in the brain. Brain TF co-misexpression can drive brain-profile proliferation in the nerve cord, and can reprogram developing wing discs into brain neural progenitors. Brain TF expression is promoted by the PRC2 complex, acting to keep the brain free of anti-proliferative and repressive action of Hox homeotic genes. Hence, anterior expansion of the &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; CNS is mediated by brain TF driven 'super-generation' of progenitors, as well as 'hyper-proliferation' of progenitor and daughter cells, promoted by PRC2-mediated repression of Hox activity.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Astrocytes play key roles in brain functions through dynamic interactions with neurons. One of their typical features is to express high levels of connexins (Cxs), Cx43 and Cx30, the gap junction (GJ)-forming proteins. Cx30 is involved in basic cognitive processes and shapes synaptic and network activities, as shown by recent studies in transgenic animals. Yet it remains unknown whether astroglial Cx30 expression, localization, and functions are endogenously and dynamically regulated by neuronal activity and could therefore play physiological roles in neurotransmission. We here show that neuronal activity increased hippocampal Cx30 protein levels via a posttranslational mechanism regulating lysosomal degradation. Neuronal activity also increased Cx30 protein levels at membranes and perisynaptic processes, as revealed by superresolution imaging. This translated at the functional level in the activation of Cx30 hemichannels and in Cx30-mediated remodeling of astrocyte morphology independently of GJ biochemical coupling. Altogether, these data show activity-dependent dynamics of Cx30 expression, perisynaptic localization, and functions.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/693382v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Humans automatically detect events that, in deviating from their expectations, may signal prediction failure and a need to reorient behaviour. The pupil dilation response (PDR) to violations has been associated with subcortical signals of arousal and prediction resetting. However, whether and how PDR to a deviant is modulated by the structure of the proximal context remains unexplored. Using ecologically valid musical stimuli that we characterised using a computational model, we showed PDR (to behaviourally irrelevant deviants) to be sensitive to contextual uncertainty (quantified as entropy), whereby PDR was greater in low than high entropy contexts. PDR was also positively correlated with the unexpectedness of deviants in high entropy contexts. No effects of music expertise were found, suggesting a ceiling effect due to enculturation. These results show that the same sudden environmental change can lead to differing arousal levels depending on contextual factors, providing evidence for a sophistication of the PDR to the structure of the sensory environment.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: An adaptive algorithm for fast and reliable online saccade detection</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/693309v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>To investigate visual perception around the time of eye movements, vision scientists manipulate stimuli contingent upon the onset of a saccade. For these experimental paradigms, timing is especially crucial, as saccade offset imposes a deadline on the display change. Although efficient online saccade detection can greatly improve timing, most algorithms rely on spatial-boundary techniques or absolute-velocity thresholds, which both suffer from their respective weaknesses: late detections and false alarms. We propose an adaptive, velocity-based algorithm for online saccade detection that surpasses both standard techniques in speed and accuracy and allows the user to freely define detection criteria. Inspired by the Engbert-Kliegl-algorithm for microsaccade detection, our algorithm computes two-dimensional velocity thresholds from variance in preceding fixation samples, while compensating for noisy or missing data samples. An optional direction criterion limits detection to the instructed saccade direction, further increasing robustness. We validated the algorithm by simulating its performance on a large saccade dataset and found that high detection accuracy (false-alarm rates of &amp;lt;1%) could be achieved with detection latencies of only 3 milliseconds. High accuracy was maintained even under simulated high-noise conditions. To demonstrate that purely intra-saccadic presentations are technically feasible, we devised an experimental test, in which a Gabor patch drifted at saccadic peak velocities. While this stimulus was invisible when presented during fixation, observers reliably detected it during saccades. Photodiode measurements verified that - including all system delays - stimuli were physically displayed on average 20 ms after saccade onset. Thus, the proposed algorithm provides valuable tool for gaze-contingent paradigms.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Reconciling Dimensional and Categorical Models of Autism Heterogeneity: a Brain Connectomics &amp; Behavioral Study</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/692772v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Background: Heterogeneity in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) has hindered the development of biomarkers, thus motivating subtyping efforts. Most subtyping studies divide ASD individuals into non-overlapping (categorical) subgroups. However, continuous inter-individual variation in ASD suggests the need for a dimensional approach. Methods: A Bayesian model was employed to decompose resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) of ASD individuals into multiple abnormal RSFC patterns, i.e., categorical subtypes henceforth referred to as &quot;factors&quot;. Importantly, the model allowed each individual to express one or more factors to varying degrees (dimensional subtyping). The model was applied to 306 ASD individuals (age 5.2-57 years) from two multisite repositories. Posthoc analyses associated factors with symptoms and demographics. Results: Analyses yielded three factors with dissociable whole-brain hypo/hyper RSFC patterns. Most participants expressed multiple (categorical) factors, suggestive of a mosaic of subtypes within individuals. All factors shared abnormal RSFC involving the default network, but the directionality (hypo/hyper RSFC) differed across factors. Factor 1 was associated with core ASD symptoms, while factor 2 was associated with comorbid symptoms. Older males preferentially expressed factor 3. Factors were robust across multiple control analyses and not associated with IQ, nor head motion. Conclusions: There exist at least three ASD factors with dissociable patterns of whole-brain RSFC, behaviors and demographics. Heterogeneous default network hypo/hyper RSFC across the factors might explain previously reported inconsistencies. The factors differentiated between core ASD and comorbid symptoms - a less appreciated domain of heterogeneity in ASD. These factors are co-expressed in ASD individuals with different degrees, thus reconciling categorical and dimensional perspectives of ASD heterogeneity.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/692616v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Evolution provides an important window into how cortical organization shapes function and vice versa. The complex mosaic of changes to brain morphology and functional organization that have shaped the mammalian cortex during evolution, complicates attempts to chart cortical differences across species. It limits our ability to fully appreciate how evolution has shaped our brain, especially in systems associated with unique human cognitive capabilities that lack anatomical homologues in other species. Here, we demonstrate a functional-based method for cross-species cortical alignment that leverages recent advances in understanding cortical organization and that enables the quantification of homologous regions across species, even when their location is decoupled from anatomical landmarks. Critically, our method establishes that cross-species similarity in cortical organization decreases with geodesic distance from unimodal systems, and culminates in the most pronounced changes in posterior regions of the default network (angular gyrus, posterior cingulate and middle temporal cortices). Our findings suggest that the establishment of the default network, as the apex of a cognitive hierarchy, as is seen in humans, is a relatively recent evolutionary adaptation. They also highlight functional changes in regions such as the posterior cingulate cortex and angular gyrus as key influences on uniquely human features of cognition.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Diverse dynamics of glutamatergic input underlie heterogeneous response patterns of olfactory bulb mitral and tufted cells in vivo</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/692574v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>In vertebrates, olfactory sensory neuron (OSN) activation drives glutamatergic excitation of mitral/tufted (MT) cells and juxtaglomerular interneurons in the olfactory bulb (OB). MT cells show diverse temporal response patterns to odorant stimulation, which have been attributed largely to processing by inhibitory circuits. However, this diversity could reflect differences in the temporal dynamics of excitatory input to MT cells. Here, we imaged odorant-evoked glutamate transients onto MT cell dendrites in the OB of anesthetized and awake mice using the glutamate sensors iGluSnFR and SF-iGluSnFR, allowing us to visualize the dynamics of excitatory synaptic inputs onto MT cells in anesthetized and awake mice. We found a surprising amount of diversity in the temporal dynamics of glutamatergic input to MT cells, both within and across successive odorant inhalations. Response patterns included sustained, inhalation-linked glutamate transients; slower, tonic increases in glutamate; rapidly adapting glutamate signas, biphasic responses consisting of a transient increase followed by a decrease below baseline, and even purely suppressive responses. Simultaneous imaging of glutamate and calcium signals from MT cells in the same glomerulus, using iGluSnFR and the red-shifted calcium sensor jRGECO1a, revealed highly correlated pre- and postsynaptic signals across these different response types. Qualitatively similar diversity was seen in the dynamics of glutamatergic input to MT cells in the awake mouse. These results reveal a surprising diversity in the dynamics of excitatory input to MT cells, and suggest that the complex spatiotemporal activity patterns thought to play a critical role in coding odor information at this stage may arise largely from feedforward excitatory pathways, as opposed to being an emergent feature of inhibitory networks. These results also highlight the utility of glutamate imaging for dissecting OB circuit organization and function in vivo.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/692541v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Natural scenes often contain multiple objects. However, how neurons in the visual cortex represent multiple visual stimuli within their receptive fields (RFs) is not well understood. Previous studies have shown that, when multiple stimuli compete in one feature domain, the evoked neuronal response is dominated by the stimulus component that has a stronger signal strength, which can be explained by response normalization. Here we investigate how neurons in middle-temporal (MT) cortex of the macaque monkey represent multiple stimuli that compete in more than one feature domain within their RFs. Visual stimuli were two random-dot patches moving in different directions. One stimulus moved at high coherence with low luminance contrast, whereas the other moved at low coherence with high contrast. We found that, although the peak MT response elicited by the &quot;low contrast &amp;amp; high coherence&quot; stimulus alone was stronger than by the &quot;high contrast &amp;amp; low coherence&quot; stimulus, MT response to both stimuli when they were overlapping was almost completely dominated by the high-contrast stimulus. When two stimuli were spatially separated within the RF, the contrast dominance was abolished. We found the same results when using contrast to compete with motion speed. Computer simulations using a V1-MT model suggest that the contrast dominance is due to normalization occurring at input stage fed to MT and MT neurons cannot overturn it according to their own feature selectivity. Our results reveal new rules on stimulus competition and highlight the importance of hierarchical processing on the neural representation of multiple visual stimuli in the extrastriate cortex.</content:encoded>

The evolutionarily conserved nature of the few well-known anti-aging interventions that affect lifespan, such as caloric restriction, suggests that aging-related research in model organisms is directly relevant to human aging. Since human lifespan is a complex trait, a systems-level approach will contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of the underlying aging landscape. Here, we integrate evolutionary and functional information of normal aging across human and model organisms at three levels: gene-level, process-level, and network-level. We identify evolutionarily conserved modules of normal aging across diverse taxa, and notably show proteostasis to be conserved in normal aging. Additionally, we find that mechanisms related to protein quality control network are enriched for genes harboring genetic variants associated with 22 age-related human traits and associated to caloric restriction. These results demonstrate that a systems-level approach, combined with evolutionary conservation, allows the detection of candidate aging genes and pathways relevant to human normal aging.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/n__Vy_y-Nug&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: PMP22 Regulates Cholesterol Trafficking and ABCA1-Mediated Cholesterol Efflux</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/27/5404?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The absence of functional peripheral myelin protein 22 (PMP22) is associated with shortened lifespan in rodents and severe peripheral nerve myelin abnormalities in several species including humans. Schwann cells and nerves from PMP22 knock-out (KO) mice show deranged cholesterol distribution and aberrant lipid raft morphology, supporting an unrecognized role for PMP22 in cellular lipid metabolism. To examine the mechanisms underlying these abnormalities, we studied Schwann cells and nerves from male and female PMP22 KO mice. Whole-cell current-clamp recordings in cultured Schwann cells revealed increased membrane capacitance and decreased membrane resistance in the absence of PMP22, which was consistent with a reduction in membrane cholesterol. Nerves from PMP22-deficient mice contained abnormal lipid droplets, with both mRNA and protein levels of apolipoprotein E (apoE) and ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) being highly upregulated. Despite the upregulation of ABCA1 and apoE, the absence of PMP22 resulted in reduced localization of the transporter to the cell membrane and diminished secretion of apoE. The absence of PMP22 also impaired ABCA1-mediated cholesterol efflux capacity. In nerves from ABCA1 KO mice, the expression of PMP22 was significantly elevated and the subcellular processing of the overproduced protein was aberrant. In wild-type samples, double immunolabeling identified overlapping distribution of PMP22 and ABCA1 at the Schwann cell plasma membrane and the two proteins were coimmunoprecipitated from Schwann cell and nerve lysates. Together, these results reveal a novel role for PMP22 in regulating lipid metabolism and cholesterol trafficking through functional interaction with the cholesterol efflux regulatory protein ABCA1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Understanding the subcellular events that underlie abnormal myelin formation in hereditary neuropathies is critical for advancing therapy development. Peripheral myelin protein 22 (PMP22) is an essential peripheral myelin protein because its genetic abnormalities account for ~80% of hereditary neuropathies. Here, we demonstrate that in the absence of PMP22, the cellular and electrophysiological properties of the Schwann cells' plasma membrane are altered and cholesterol trafficking and lipid homeostasis are perturbed. The molecular mechanisms for these abnormalities involve a functional interplay among PMP22, cholesterol, apolipoprotein E, and the major cholesterol-efflux transporter protein ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1). These findings establish a critical role for PMP22 in the maintenance of cholesterol homeostasis in Schwann cells.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Mouse Strain and Sex-Dependent Differences in Long-term Behavioral Abnormalities and Neuropathologies after Developmental Zika Infection</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/27/5393?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Exposure of the developing fetus to Zika virus (ZIKV) results in a set of brain abnormalities described as the congenital Zika syndrome. Although microcephaly is the most obvious outcome, neuropathologies, such as intracranial calcifications and polymicrogyria, can occur in the absence of microcephaly. Moreover, the full impact of exposure on motor, social, and cognitive skills during development remains uncharacterized. We examined the long-term neurobehavioral consequences of neonatal ZIKV exposure in four genetically divergent inbred mouse strains (C57BL/6J, 129S1/SvImJ, FVB/NJ, and DBA/2J). Male and female mice were infected on postnatal day 1, considered comparable with exposure late in the second trimester of humans. We demonstrate strain differences in early susceptibility to the virus and the time course of glial reaction in the brain. These changes were associated with strain- and sex-dependent differences in long-term behavioral abnormalities that include hyperactivity, impulsiveness, and motor incoordination. In addition, the adult brains of susceptible mice exhibited widespread calcifications that may underlie the behavioral deficits observed. Characterization of the neuropathological sequelae of developmental exposure to the Zika virus in different immunocompetent mouse strains provides a foundation for identifying genetic and immune factors that contribute to long-term neurobehavioral consequences in susceptible individuals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Developmental Zika virus (ZIKV) infection is now known to cause brain abnormalities in infants that do not display microcephaly at birth, and the full impact of these more subtle neuropathologies has yet to be determined. We demonstrate in a mouse model that long-lasting behavioral aberrations occur after developmental ZIKV exposure. We compare four divergent mouse strains and find that the effects of Zika infection differ greatly between strains, in terms of behavioral changes, sex differences, and the intracranial calcifications that develop in the brains of susceptible mice. These findings provide a foundation for identifying susceptibility factors that lead to the development of abnormal behaviors secondary to ZIKV infection early in life.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/27/5377?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Extracellular ATP activates inflammatory responses to tissue injury. It is also implicated in establishing lasting network hyperexcitability in the brain by acting upon independent receptor systems. Whereas the fast-acting P2X channels have well-established roles driving neuroinflammation and increasing hyperexcitability, the slower-acting metabotropic P2Y receptors have received much less attention. Recent studies of P2Y&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; receptor function in seizures and epilepsy have produced contradictory results, suggesting that the role of this receptor during seizure pathology may be highly sensitive to context. Here, by using male mice, we demonstrate that the metabotropic P2Y&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; receptor mediates either proconvulsive or anticonvulsive responses, dependent on the time point of activation in relation to the induction of status epilepticus. P2Y&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; deficiency or a P2Y&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; antagonist (MRS2500) administered before a chemoconvulsant, exacerbates epileptiform activity, whereas a P2Y&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; agonist (MRS2365) administered at this time point is anticonvulsant. When these drugs are administered after the onset of status epilepticus, however, their effect on seizure severity is reversed, with the antagonist now anticonvulsant and the agonist proconvulsant. This result was consistent across two different mouse models of status epilepticus (intra-amygdala kainic acid and intraperitoneal pilocarpine). Pharmacologic P2Y&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; blockade during status epilepticus reduces also associated brain damage, delays the development of epilepsy and, when applied during epilepsy, suppresses spontaneous seizures, in mice. Our data show a context-specific role for P2Y&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; during seizure pathology and demonstrate that blocking P2Y&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; after status epilepticus and during epilepsy has potent anticonvulsive effects, suggesting that P2Y&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; may be a novel candidate for the treatment of drug-refractory status epilepticus and epilepsy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; This is the first study to fully characterize the contribution of a metabotropic purinergic P2Y receptor during acute seizures and epilepsy. The findings suggest that targeting P2Y&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; may offer a potential novel treatment strategy for drug-refractory status epilepticus and epilepsy. Our data demonstrate a context-specific role of P2Y&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; activation during seizures, switching from a proconvulsive to an anticonvulsive role depending on physiopathological context. Thus, our study provides a possible explanation for seemingly conflicting results obtained between studies of different brain diseases where P2Y&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; targeting has been proposed as a potential treatment strategy and highlights that the timing of pharmacological interventions is of critical importance to the understanding of how receptors contribute to the generation of seizures and the development of epilepsy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Pupil-Linked Arousal Responds to Unconscious Surprisal</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/27/5369?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Pupil size under constant illumination reflects brain arousal state, and dilates in response to novel information, or surprisal. Whether this response can be observed regardless of conscious perception is still unknown. In the present study, male and female adult humans performed an implicit learning task across a series of three experiments. We measured pupil and brain-evoked potentials to stimuli that violated transition statistics but were not relevant to the task. We found that pupil size dilated following these surprising events, in the absence of awareness of transition statistics, and only when attention was allocated to the stimulus. These pupil responses correlated with central potentials, evoking an anterior cingulate origin. Arousal response to surprisal outside the scope of conscious perception points to the fundamental relationship between arousal and information processing and indicates that pupil size can be used to track the progression of implicit learning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Pupil size dilates following increase in mental effort, surprise, or more generally global arousal. However, whether this response arises as a conscious response or reflects a more fundamental mechanism outside the scrutiny of awareness is still unknown. Here, we demonstrate that unexpected changes in the environment, even when processed unconsciously and without being relevant to the task, lead to an increase in arousal levels as reflected by the pupillary response. Further, we show that the concurrent electrophysiological response shares similarities with mismatch negativity, suggesting the involvement of anterior cingulate cortex. All in all, our results establish novel insights about the mechanisms driving global arousal levels, and it provides new possibilities for reliably measuring unconscious processes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Localization of Phonological and Semantic Contributions to Reading</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/27/5361?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Reading involves the rapid extraction of sound and meaning from print through a cooperative division of labor between phonological and lexical–semantic processes. Whereas lesion studies of patients with stereotyped acquired reading deficits contributed to the notion of a dissociation between phonological and lexical–semantic reading, the neuroanatomical basis for effects of lexicality (word vs pseudoword), orthographic regularity (regular vs irregular spelling–sound correspondences), and concreteness (concrete vs abstract meaning) on reading is underspecified, particularly outside the context of strong behavioral dissociations. Support vector regression lesion–symptom mapping (LSM) of 73 left hemisphere stroke survivors (male and female human subjects) not preselected for stereotyped dissociations revealed the differential contributions of specific cortical regions to reading pseudowords (ventral precentral gyrus), regular words (planum temporale, supramarginal gyrus, ventral precentral and postcentral gyrus, and insula), and concrete words (pars orbitalis and pars triangularis). Consistent with the primary systems view of reading being parasitic on language-general circuitry, our multivariate LSM analyses revealed that phonological decoding depends on perisylvian areas subserving sound–motor integration and that semantic effects on reading depend on frontal cortex subserving control over concrete semantic representations that aid phonological access from print. As the first study to localize the differential cortical contributions to reading pseudowords, regular words, and concrete words in stroke survivors with variable reading abilities, our results provide important information on the neurobiological basis of reading and highlight the insights attainable through multivariate, process-based approaches to alexia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Whereas fMRI evidence for neuroanatomical dissociations between phonological and lexical–semantic reading is abundant, evidence from modern lesion studies establishing the differential contributions of specific brain regions to specific reading processes is lacking. Our application of multivariate lesion–symptom mapping revealed that effects of lexicality, orthographic regularity, and concreteness on reading differentially depend on areas subserving auditory–motor integration and semantic control. Phonological decoding of print relies on a dorsal perisylvian network supporting auditory and articulatory representations, with unfamiliar words relying especially on articulatory mapping. In tandem with this dorsal decoding system, anterior inferior frontal gyrus may coordinate control over concrete semantic representations that support mapping of print to sound, which is a novel potential mechanism for semantic influences on reading.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Spaced Learning Enhances Episodic Memory by Increasing Neural Pattern Similarity Across Repetitions</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/27/5351?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Spaced learning has been shown consistently to benefit memory compared with massed learning, yet the neural representations and processes underlying the spacing effect are still poorly understood. In particular, two influential models (i.e., the encoding variability hypothesis and the study-phase retrieval hypothesis) could both model behavioral performance very well, but they make opposite hypotheses regarding the spacing effect's neural mechanisms. The present study attempted to provide empirical neural evidence to adjudicate these competing hypotheses. Using spatiotemporal pattern similarity (STPS) analysis of EEG data, this study investigated whether and how repetition lags (massed/short-spaced/long-spaced) modulated the STPS's contribution to episodic memory encoding in male and female human participants. The results revealed that greater item-specific STPS in the right frontal electrodes at 543–727 ms after stimulus onset was associated with better memory performance. More importantly, this STPS was larger under the spaced-learning condition than the massed-learning condition and partially mediated the spacing effect on memory performance. In addition, we found that massed learning was associated with stronger repetition suppression in the N400 component that reflected momentary retrieval strength, but reduced activity in the late positive component that was associated with memory retrieval. These results suggest that spaced learning improves long-term memory by increasing retrieval effort and enhancing the pattern reinstatement of prior neural representations, which may be achieved by reducing the momentary retrieval strength as the extended repetition lags might help to eliminate the residual representation in working memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; As one of the most ubiquitous and fundamental phenomena in the history of memory research, the spacing effect provides an important window into understanding how enduring memory is formed in the brain and how different practice strategies could modulate these mechanisms to affect memory performance. By leveraging the neural representational analysis on scalp EEG data, the current study provides the first empirical data to show that spaced learning enhances memory by improving the spatiotemporal similarity that occurs at a late time window. Our results support the study-phase retrieval hypothesis but not the encoding variability hypothesis and emphasize the role of neural pattern reinstatement in strengthening memory via repeated study.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Ventromedial Prefrontal Cortex Tracks Multiple Environmental Variables during Search</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/27/5336?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;To make efficient foraging decisions, we must combine information about the values of available options with nonvalue information. Some accounts of ventromedial PFC (vmPFC) suggest that it has a narrow role limited to evaluating immediately available options. We examined responses of neurons in area 14 (a putative macaque homolog of human vmPFC) as 2 male macaques performed a novel foraging search task. Although many neurons encoded the values of immediately available offers, they also independently encoded several other variables that influence choice, but that are conceptually distinct from offer value. These variables include average reward rate, number of offers viewed per trial, previous offer values, previous outcome sizes, and the locations of the currently attended offer. We conclude that, rather than serving as specialized economic value center, vmPFC plays a broad role in integrating relevant environmental information to drive foraging decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Decision makers must often choose whether to take an immediately available option or continue to search for a better one. We hypothesized that this process, which is integral to foraging theory, leaves neural signatures in the brain region ventromedial PFC. Subjects performed a novel foraging task in which they searched through differently valued options and attempted to balance their reward threshold with various time costs. We found that neurons not only encode the values of immediately available offers, but multiplexed these with environmental variables, including reward rate, number of offers viewed, previous offer values, and spatial information. We conclude that vmPFC plays a rich role in encoding and integrating multiple foraging-related variables during economic decisions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Increased Neural Activity in Mesostriatal Regions after Prefrontal Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation and L-DOPA Administration</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/27/5326?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Dopamine dysfunction is associated with a wide range of neuropsychiatric disorders commonly treated pharmacologically or invasively. Recent studies provide evidence for a nonpharmacological and noninvasive alternative that allows similar manipulation of the dopaminergic system: transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS). In rodents, tDCS has been shown to increase neural activity in subcortical parts of the dopaminergic system, and recent studies in humans provide evidence that tDCS over prefrontal regions induces striatal dopamine release and affects reward-related behavior. Based on these findings, we used fMRI in healthy human participants and measured the fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations to assess spontaneous neural activity strength in regions of the mesostriatal dopamine system before and after tDCS over prefrontal regions (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 40, 22 females). In a second study, we examined the effect of a single dose of the dopamine precursor levodopa (l-DOPA) on mesostriatal fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation values in male humans (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 22) and compared the results between both studies. We found that prefrontal tDCS and l-DOPA both enhance neural activity in core regions of the dopaminergic system and show similar subcortical activation patterns. We furthermore assessed the spatial similarity of whole-brain statistical parametric maps, indicating tDCS- and l-DOPA-induced activation, and &amp;gt;100 neuronal receptor gene expression maps based on transcriptional data from the Allen Institute for Brain Science. In line with a specific activation of the dopaminergic system, we found that both interventions predominantly activated regions with high expression levels of the dopamine receptors D2 and D3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Studies in animals and humans provide evidence that transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) allows a manipulation of the dopaminergic system. Based on these findings, we used fMRI to assess changes in spontaneous neural activity strength in the human dopaminergic system after prefrontal tDCS compared with the administration of the dopamine precursor and standard anti-Parkinson drug levodopa (l-DOPA). We found that prefrontal tDCS and l-DOPA both enhance neural activity in core regions of the dopaminergic system and show similar subcortical activation patterns. Using whole-brain transcriptional data of &amp;gt;100 neuronal receptor genes, we found that both interventions specifically activated regions with high expression levels of the dopamine receptors D2 and D3.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Topographic Organization of the 'Third-Tier' Dorsomedial Visual Cortex in the Macaque</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/27/5311?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The boundaries of the visual areas located anterior to V2 in the dorsomedial region of the macaque cortex remain contentious. This region is usually conceptualized as including two functional subdivisions: the dorsal component of area V3 (V3d) laterally and another area named the parietooccipital area (PO) or V6 medially. However, the nature of the putative border between V3d and PO/V6 has remained undefined. We recorded the receptive fields of multiunit clusters in male macaques and reconstructed the locations of recording sites using histological sections and computer-generated maps. Immediately adjacent to dorsomedial V2, we observed a representation of the lower contralateral quadrant that represented the vertical meridian at its rostral border. This region formed a simple eccentricity gradient from ~&amp;lt;5° in the annectant gyrus to &amp;gt;60° in the parietooccipital medial sulcus. There was no topographic reversal where one would expect to find the border between V3d and PO/V6. Rather, near the midline, this lower quadrant map continued directly into a representation of the peripheral upper visual field without an intervening lower quadrant representation. Therefore, cortex previously assigned to the medial part of V3d and to PO/V6 forms a single map that includes parts of both quadrants. Together with previous observations that V3d and PO/V6 are densely myelinated relative to adjacent cortex and share similar input from V1, these results suggest that they are parts of a single area (for which we suggest the designation V6), which is distinct from the one forming the ventral component of the third-tier complex.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The primate visual cortex has a large number of areas. Knowing the extent of each visual area and how they can be distinguished from each other is essential for the interpretation of experiments aimed at understanding visual processing. Currently, there are conflicting models of the organization of the dorsomedial visual cortex rostral to area V2 (one of the earliest stages of cortical processing of vision). By conducting large-scale electrophysiological recordings, we found that what were originally thought to be distinct areas in this region (dorsal V3 and the parietooccipital area PO/V6), together form a single map of the visual field. This will help to guide future functional studies and the interpretation of the outcomes of lesions involving the dorsal visual cortex.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Deletion of Autism Risk Gene Shank3 Disrupts Prefrontal Connectivity</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/27/5299?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Mutations in the synaptic scaffolding protein SHANK3 are a major cause of autism and are associated with prominent intellectual and language deficits. However, the neural mechanisms whereby SHANK3 deficiency affects higher-order socio-communicative functions remain unclear. Using high-resolution functional and structural MRI in adult male mice, here we show that loss of &lt;i&gt;Shank3&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;Shank3B&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt;) results in disrupted local and long-range prefrontal and frontostriatal functional connectivity. We document that prefrontal hypoconnectivity is associated with reduced short-range cortical projections density, and reduced gray matter volume. Finally, we show that prefrontal disconnectivity is predictive of social communication deficits, as assessed with ultrasound vocalization recordings. Collectively, our results reveal a critical role of SHANK3 in the development of prefrontal anatomy and function, and suggest that SHANK3 deficiency may predispose to intellectual disability and socio-communicative impairments via dysregulation of higher-order cortical connectivity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Mutations in the synaptic scaffolding protein SHANK3 are commonly associated with autism, intellectual, and language deficits. Previous research has linked SHANK3 deficiency to basal ganglia dysfunction, motor stereotypies, and social deficits. However, the neural mechanism whereby &lt;i&gt;Shank3&lt;/i&gt; gene mutations affects cortical functional connectivity and higher-order socio-communicative functions remain unclear. Here we show that loss of SHANK3 in mice results in largely disrupted functional connectivity and abnormal gray matter anatomy in prefrontal areas. We also show that prefrontal connectivity disruption is tightly linked to socio-communicative deficits. Our findings suggest that SHANK3 is a critical orchestrator of frontocortical function, and that disrupted connectivity of prefrontal areas may underpin socio-communicative impairments observed in SHANK3 mutation carriers.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Pou4f1 Defines a Subgroup of Type I Spiral Ganglion Neurons and Is Necessary for Normal Inner Hair Cell Presynaptic Ca2+ Signaling</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/27/5284?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Acoustic signals are relayed from the ear to the brain via spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs) that receive auditory information from the cochlear inner hair cells (IHCs) and transmit that information to the cochlear nucleus of the brainstem. Physiologically distinct classes of SGNs have been characterized by their spontaneous firing rate and responses to sound and those physiological distinctions are thought to correspond to stereotyped synaptic positions on the IHC. More recently, single-cell profiling has identified multiple groups of SGNs based on transcriptional profiling; however, correlations between any of these groups and distinct neuronal physiology have not been determined. In this study, we show that expression of the POU (Pit-Oct-Unc) transcription factor Pou4f1 in type I SGNs in mice of both sexes correlates with a synaptic location on the modiolar side of IHCs. Conditional deletion of &lt;i&gt;Pou4f1&lt;/i&gt; in SGNs beginning in mice at embryonic day 13 rescues the early path-finding and apoptotic phenotypes reported for germline deletion of &lt;i&gt;Pou4f1&lt;/i&gt;, resulting in a phenotypically normal development of SGN patterning. However, conditional deletion of &lt;i&gt;Pou4f1&lt;/i&gt; in SGNs alters the activation of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; channels in IHCs primarily by increasing their voltage sensitivity. Moreover, the modiolar to pillar gradient of active zone Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; influx strength is eliminated. These results demonstrate that a subset of modiolar-targeted SGNs retain expression of Pou4f1 beyond the onset of hearing and suggest that this transcription factor plays an instructive role in presynaptic Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; signaling in IHCs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Physiologically distinct classes of type I spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs) are necessary to encode sound intensities spanning the audible range. Although anatomical studies have demonstrated structural correlates for some physiologically defined classes of type I SGNs, an understanding of the molecular pathways that specify each type is only now emerging. Here, we demonstrate that expression of the transcription factor Pou4f1 corresponds to a distinct subgroup of type I SGNs that synapse on the modiolar side of inner hair cells. The conditional deletion of &lt;i&gt;Pou4f1&lt;/i&gt; after SGN formation does not disrupt ganglion size or morphology, change the distribution of IHC synaptic locations, or affect the creation of synapses, but it does influence the voltage dependence and strength of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; influx at presynaptic active zones in inner hair cells.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Transcriptional Regulation of the Glutamate/GABA/Glutamine Cycle in Adult Glia Controls Motor Activity and Seizures in Drosophila</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/27/5269?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The fruitfly &lt;i&gt;Drosophila melanogaster&lt;/i&gt; has been extensively used as a genetic model for the maintenance of nervous system's functions. Glial cells are of utmost importance in regulating the neuronal functions in the adult organism and in the progression of neurological pathologies. Through a microRNA-based screen in adult &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; glia, we uncovered the essential role of a major glia developmental determinant, &lt;i&gt;repo&lt;/i&gt;, in the adult fly. Here, we report that Repo expression is continuously required in adult glia to transcriptionally regulate the highly conserved function of neurotransmitter recycling in both males and females. Transient loss of Repo dramatically shortens fly lifespan, triggers motor deficits, and increases the sensibility to seizures, partly due to the impairment of the glutamate/GABA/glutamine cycle. Our findings highlight the pivotal role of transcriptional regulation of genes involved in the glutamate/GABA/glutamine cycle in glia to control neurotransmitter levels in neurons and their behavioral output. The mechanism identified here in &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; exemplifies how adult functions can be modulated at the transcriptional level and suggest an active synchronized regulation of genes involved in the same pathway. The process of neurotransmitter recycling is of essential importance in human epileptic and psychiatric disorders and our findings may thus have important consequences for the understanding of the role that transcriptional regulation of neurotransmitter recycling in astrocytes has in human disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Glial cells are an essential support to neurons in adult life and have been involved in a number of neurological disorders. What controls the maintenance and modulation of glial functions in adult life is not fully characterized. Through a miR overexpression screen in adult glia in &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt;, we identify an essential role in adult glia of &lt;i&gt;repo&lt;/i&gt;, which directs glial differentiation during embryonic development. Repo levels modulate, via transcriptional regulation, the ability of glial cells to support neurons in the glutamate/GABA/glutamine cycle. This leads to significant abnormalities in motor behavior as assessed through a novel automated paradigm. Our work points to the importance of transcriptional regulation in adult glia for neurotransmitter recycling, a key process in several human neurological disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Lysosomal Dysfunction in Down Syndrome Is APP-Dependent and Mediated by APP-{beta}CTF (C99)</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/27/5255?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Lysosomal failure underlies pathogenesis of numerous congenital neurodegenerative disorders and is an early and progressive feature of Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis. Here, we report that lysosomal dysfunction in Down ayndrome (trisomy 21), a neurodevelopmental disorder and form of early onset AD, requires the extra gene copy of amyloid precursor protein (APP) and is specifically mediated by the β cleaved carboxy terminal fragment of APP (APP-βCTF, C99). In primary fibroblasts from individuals with DS, lysosomal degradation of autophagic and endocytic substrates is selectively impaired, causing them to accumulate in enlarged autolysosomes/lysosomes. Direct measurements of lysosomal pH uncovered a significant elevation (0.6 units) as a basis for slowed LC3 turnover and the inactivation of cathepsin D and other lysosomal hydrolases known to be unstable or less active when lysosomal pH is persistently elevated. Normalizing lysosome pH by delivering acidic nanoparticles to lysosomes ameliorated lysosomal deficits, whereas RNA sequencing analysis excluded a transcriptional contribution to hydrolase declines. Cortical neurons cultured from the Ts2 mouse model of DS exhibited lysosomal deficits similar to those in DS cells. Lowering APP expression with siRNA or BACE1 inhibition reversed cathepsin deficits in both fibroblasts and neurons. Deleting one &lt;i&gt;Bace1&lt;/i&gt; allele from adult Ts2 mice had similar rescue effects &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. The modest elevation of endogenous APP-βCTF needed to disrupt lysosomal function in DS is relevant to sporadic AD where APP-βCTF, but not APP, is also elevated. Our results extend evidence that impaired lysosomal acidification drives progressive lysosomal failure in multiple forms of AD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Down syndrome (trisomy 21) (DS) is a neurodevelopmental disorder invariably leading to early-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD). We showed in cells from DS individuals and neurons of DS models that one extra copy of a normal amyloid precursor protein (&lt;i&gt;APP&lt;/i&gt;) gene impairs lysosomal acidification, thereby depressing lysosomal hydrolytic activities and turnover of autophagic and endocytic substrates, processes vital to neuronal survival. These deficits, which were reversible by correcting lysosomal pH, are mediated by elevated levels of endogenous β-cleaved carboxy-terminal fragment of APP (APP-βCTF). Notably, similar endosomal-lysosomal pathobiology emerges early in sporadic AD, where neuronal APP-βCTF is also elevated, underscoring its importance as a therapeutic target and underscoring the functional and pathogenic interrelationships between the endosomal-lysosomal pathway and genes causing AD.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: H3.3 Barcoding of Nucleus Accumbens Transcriptional Activity Identifies Novel Molecular Cascades Associated with Cocaine Self-administration in Mice</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/27/5247?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Although numerous epigenetic modifications have been associated with addiction, little work has explored the turnover of histone variants. Uniquely, the H3.3 variant incorporates stably and preferentially into chromatin independently of DNA replication at active sites of transcription and transcription factor binding. Thus, genomic regions associated with H3.3-containing nucleosomes are particularly likely to be involved in plasticity, such as following repeated cocaine exposure. A recently developed mouse line expressing a neuron-specific hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged H3.3 protein was used to track transcriptionally active sites cumulatively across 19 d of cocaine self-administration. RNA-seq and H3.3-HA ChIP-seq analyses were performed on NAcc tissue collected following cocaine or food self-administration in male mice. RNA sequencing revealed five genes upregulated in cocaine relative to food self-administering mice: &lt;i&gt;Fosb&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Npas4&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Vgf&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Nptx2&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;Pmepa1&lt;/i&gt;, which reflect known and novel cocaine plasticity-associated genes. Subsequent ChIP-seq analysis confirmed increased H3.3 aggregation at four of these five loci, thus validating H3.3 insertion as a marker of enhanced cocaine-induced transcription. Further motif recognition analysis of the ChIP-seq data showed that cocaine-associated differential H3.3 accumulation correlated with the presence of several transcription factor binding motifs, including RBPJ1, EGR1, and SOX4, suggesting that these are potentially important regulators of molecular cascades associated with cocaine-induced neuronal plasticity. Additional ontological analysis revealed differential H3.3 accumulation mainly near genes involved in neuronal differentiation and dendrite formation. These results establish the &lt;i&gt;H3.3-HA&lt;/i&gt; transgenic mouse line as a compelling molecular barcoding tool to identify the cumulative effects of long-term environmental perturbations, such as exposure to drugs of abuse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Histone H3.3 is a core histone variant that is stably incorporated at active sites of transcription. We used a tagged version of H3.3 expressed exclusively in neurons to delineate active transcription sites following extended cocaine self-administration in mice. This approach revealed the cumulative list of genes expressed in response to cocaine taking over the course of several weeks. We combined this technique with RNA sequencing of tissue collected from the same animals 24 h after the last cocaine exposure. Comparing these datasets provided a full picture of genes that respond to chronic cocaine exposure in NAcc neurons. These studies revealed novel transcription factors that are likely involved in cocaine-induced plasticity and addiction-like behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>RSS PAP: Synaptic strengths dominate phasing of motor circuit: Intrinsic conductances of neuron types need not vary across animals</title>
	<link>http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0417-18.2019v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Identified neurons and the networks they compose produce stereotypical, albeit individually unique, activity across members of a species. We propose, for a motor circuit driven by a central pattern generator (CPG), that the uniqueness derives mainly from differences in synaptic strength rather than from differences in intrinsic membrane conductances. We studied a dataset of recordings from six leech (Hirudo sp.) heartbeat control networks, containing complete spiking activity patterns from inhibitory premotor interneurons, motor output spike patterns, and synaptic strength patterns to investigate the source of uniqueness. We used a conductance-based multi-compartmental motor neuron model to construct a bilateral motor circuit model, and controlled it by playing recorded input spike trains from premotor interneurons to generate output inhibitory synaptic patterns similar to experimental measurements. By generating different synaptic conductance parameter sets of this circuit model, we found that relative premotor synaptic strengths impinging onto motor neurons must be different across individuals to produce animal-specific output burst phasing. Obtaining unique outputs from each individual’s circuit model did not require different intrinsic ionic conductance parameters. Furthermore, changing intrinsic conductances failed to compensate for modified synaptic strength patterns. Thus the pattern of synaptic strengths of motor neuron inputs is critical for the phasing of this motor circuit and can explain individual differences. When intrinsic conductances were allowed to vary, they exhibited the same conductance correlations across individuals, suggesting a motor neuron ’type’ required for proper network function. Our results are general and may translate to other systems and neuronal networks that control output phasing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Each member of a species is unique, down to its neurons. The ability to experimentally identify a specific neuron across individuals allows investigating the neuron’s variability in spiking activity patterns and therefore its function. Identified neuron types produce stereotypical, albeit individually unique, activity patterns. Uniqueness of activity can be caused by variability observed in the intrinsic properties of neurons and the synaptic connections of the circuit. Here, we propose that, for a rhythmic neuronal motor circuit, the uniqueness derives mainly from differences in synaptic strength rather than from differences in intrinsic membrane conductances. The neuron types that we studied are from the leech heartbeat system. However, our results are general and can translate to other neuronal networks that control output phasing.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To determine whether maternal Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) IgG antibody levels are associated with risk of multiple sclerosis (MS) in the offspring.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We conducted a prospective nested case–control study in the Finnish Maternity Cohort (FMC) with serum samples from &amp;gt;800,000 women collected during pregnancy since 1983. Cases of MS among offspring born between 1983 and 1991 were identified via hospital and prescription registries; 176 cases were matched to up to 3 controls (n = 326) on region and dates of birth, sample collection, and mother's birth. We used conditional logistic regression to estimate relative risks (RRs) and adjusted models for sex of the child, gestational age at sample collection, and maternal serum 25‐hydroxyvitamin D and cotinine levels. Similar analyses were conducted among 1,049 women with MS and 1,867 matched controls in the FMC.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maternal viral capsid antigen IgG levels during pregnancy were associated with an increased MS risk among offspring (RR&lt;sub&gt;top vs bottom quintile&lt;/sub&gt; = 2.44, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.20–5.00, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; trend = 0.004); no associations were found between maternal EBV nuclear antigen 1 (EBNA‐1), diffuse early antigen, or cytomegalovirus IgG levels and offspring MS risk. Among women in the FMC, those in the highest versus lowest quintile of EBNA‐1 IgG levels had a 3‐fold higher risk of MS (RR = 3.21, 95% CI = 2.37–4.35, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; trend &amp;lt;1.11e‐16). These associations were not confounded or modified by 25‐hydroxyvitamin D.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Offspring of mothers with high viral capsid antigen IgG during pregnancy appear to have an increased risk of MS. The increase in MS risk among women with elevated prediagnostic EBNA‐1 IgG levels is consistent with previous results. ANN NEUROL 2019&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1907.01355</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Novelty is an important factor of creativity in product design. Acceptance of
novelty, however, depends on one's emotions. Yanagisawa, the last author, and
his colleagues previously developed a mathematical model of emotional
dimensions associated with novelty such as arousal (surprise) and valence. The
model formalized arousal as Bayesian information gain and valence as a function
of arousal based on Berlyne's arousal potential theory. One becomes accustomed
to novelty by repeated exposure. This so-called habituation to novelty is
important in the design of long-term product experience. We herein propose a
mathematical model of habituation to novelty based on the emotional dimension
model. We formalized the habituation as a decrement in information gain from a
novel event through Bayesian update. We derived the information gained from the
repeated exposure of a novel stimulus as a function of three parameters:
initial prediction error, initial uncertainty, and noise of sensory stimulus.
With the proposed model, we discovered an interaction effect of the initial
prediction error and initial uncertainty on habituation. Furthermore, we
demonstrate that a range of positive emotions on prediction errors shift toward
becoming more novel by repeated exposure.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Deep learning methods are increasingly being used with neuroimaging data like
structural and function magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to predict the
diagnosis of neuropsychiatric and neurological disorders. For psychiatric
disorders in particular, it is believed that one of the most promising modality
is the resting-state functional MRI (rsfMRI), which captures the intrinsic
connectivity between regions in the brain. Because rsfMRI data points are
inherently high-dimensional (~1M), it is impossible to process the entire input
in its raw form. In this paper, we propose a very simple transformation of the
rsfMRI images that captures all of the temporal dynamics of the signal but
sub-samples its spatial extent. As a result, we use a very simple 1-D
convolutional network which is fast to train, requires minimal preprocessing
and performs at par with the state-of-the-art on the classification of Autism

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In the brain, the structure of a network of neurons defines how these neurons
implement the computations that underlie the mind and the behavior of animals
and humans. Provided that we can describe the network of neurons as a graph, we
can employ methods from graph theory to investigate its structure or use
cellular automata to mathematically assess its function. Although, software for
the analysis of graphs and cellular automata are widely available. Graph
extraction from the image of networks of brain cells remains difficult. Nervous
tissue is heterogeneous, and differences in anatomy may reflect relevant
differences in function. Here we introduce a deep learning based toolbox to
extracts graphs from images of brain tissue. This toolbox provides an
easy-to-use framework allowing system neuroscientists to generate graphs based
on images of brain tissue by combining methods from image processing, deep
learning, and graph theory. The goals are to simplify the training and usage of
deep learning methods for computer vision and facilitate its integration into
graph extraction pipelines. In this way, the toolbox provides an alternative to
the required laborious manual process of tracing, sorting and classifying. We
expect to democratize the machine learning methods to a wider community of
users beyond the computer vision experts and improve the time-efficiency of
graph extraction from large brain image datasets, which may lead to further
understanding of the human mind.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The Algonauts challenge requires to construct a multi-subject encoder of
images to brain activity. Deep networks such as ResNet-50 and AlexNet trained
for image classification are known to produce feature representations along
their intermediate stages which closely mimic the visual hierarchy. However the
challenges introduced in the Algonauts project, including combining data from
multiple subjects, relying on very few similarity data points, solving for
various ROIs, and multi-modality, require devising a flexible framework which
can efficiently accommodate them. Here we build upon a recent state-of-the-art
classification network (SE-ResNeXt-50) and construct an adaptive combination of
its intermediate representations. While the pretrained network serves as a
backbone of our model, we learn how to aggregate feature representations along
five stages of the network. During learning, our method enables to modulate and
screen outputs from each stage along the network as governed by the optimized
objective. We applied our method to the Algonauts2019 fMRI and MEG challenges.
Using the combined fMRI and MEG data, our approach was rated among the leading
five for both challenges. Surprisingly we find that for both the lower and
higher order areas (EVC and IT) the adaptive aggregation favors features
stemming at later stages of the network.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1906.07663</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Humans and animals show remarkable flexibility in adjusting their behaviour
when their goals, or rewards in the environment change. While such flexibility
is a hallmark of intelligent behaviour, these multi-task scenarios remain an
important challenge for machine learning algorithms and neurobiological models
alike. Factored representations can enable flexible behaviour by abstracting
away general aspects of a task from those prone to change, while nonparametric
methods provide a principled way of using similarity to past experiences to
guide current behaviour. Here we combine the successor representation (SR),
that factors the value of actions into expected outcomes and corresponding
rewards, with evaluating task similarity through nonparametric inference and
clustering the space of rewards. The proposed algorithm improves SR's transfer
capabilities by inverting a generative model over tasks, while also explaining
important neurobiological signatures of place cell representation in the
hippocampus. It dynamically samples from a flexible number of distinct SR maps
while accumulating evidence about the current reward context, and outperforms
competing algorithms in settings with both known and unsignalled rewards
changes. It reproduces the &quot;flickering&quot; behaviour of hippocampal maps seen when
rodents navigate to changing reward locations, and gives a quantitative account
of trajectory-dependent hippocampal representations (so-called splitter cells)
and their dynamics. We thus provide a novel algorithmic approach for multi-task
learning, as well as a common normative framework that links together these
different characteristics of the brain's spatial representation.

	<content:encoded>The investigation of GABAergic inhibitory circuits has substantially expanded over the past few years. The development of new tools and technology has allowed investigators to classify many diverse groups of inhibitory neurons by several delineating factors: these include their connectivity motifs, expression of specific molecular markers, receptor diversity, and ultimately their role in brain function. Despite this progress, however, there is still limited understanding of how GABAergic neurons are recruited by their input and how their activity is modulated by behavioral states. This limitation is primarily due to the fact that studies of GABAergic inhibition are mainly geared toward determining how, once activated, inhibitory circuits regulate the activity of excitatory neurons. In this review, we will outline recent work investigating the anatomical and physiological properties of inputs that activate cortical GABAergic neurons, and discuss how these inhibitory cells are differentially recruited during behavior.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2019.00167</link>
	<content:encoded>Our memories are essential in our daily lives. The frontal and cingulate cortices, hippocampal system and medial temporal lobes are key brain regions. In addition, severe amnesia also occurs after damage or dysfunction to the anterior thalamic nuclei; this subcortical thalamic hub is interconnected to these key cortical memory structures. Behavioural, anatomical, and physiological evidence across mammalian species has shown that interactions between the anterior thalamic nuclei, cortex and hippocampal formation are vital for spatial memory processing. Furthermore, the adjacent laterodorsal thalamic nucleus, interconnected to the retrosplenial cortex and visual system, also contributes to spatial memory in mammals. However, how these thalamic nuclei contribute to memory still remains largely unknown. Fortunately, our understanding of the importance of the thalamus in cognitive processes is being redefined, as widespread evidence challenges the established view of the thalamus as a passive relay of sensory and subcortical information to the cortex. In this review, we examine whether the anterior thalamic nuclei and the adjacent laterodorsal thalamic nuclei are suitable candidates for ‘higher-order’ thalamic nuclei, as defined by the Sherman and Guillery model. Rather than simply relaying information to cortex, ‘higher-order’ thalamic nuclei have a prominent role in cognition, as they can regulate how areas of the cortex interact with one another. These considerations along with a review of the latest research will be used to suggest future studies that will clarify the contributions that the anterior and laterodorsal thalamic nuclei have in supporting cortical functions during cognitive processes.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>A field’s priorities are reflected by the contents of its high-impact journals. Researchers in turn may choose to pursue research objectives based on what is believed to be most highly valued by their peers. However, these assessments of the field’s priorities are often subjective, owing to a lack of formal quantification of high-impact journals’ contents. By compiling a corpus of abstracts from within the field neuroscience, I was able to analyze which terms had differential frequencies between 12 high-impact and 13 medium-impact journals. Approximately 50,000 neuroscience abstracts were analyzed over the years 2014-2018. Several broad trends emerged from the analysis of which terms were biased towards high-impact journals. Generally speaking, high-impact journals tended to feature: genetic or psychiatric studies, use of the latest and most sophisticated methods, examinations of the orbitofrontal cortex or amygdala, and/or use of human or non-mammalian subjects. Medium-impact journals tended to feature motor or cardiovascular studies, use of older methods, examinations of caudal brain regions, and/or rats as subjects. This approach also allowed for the comparison of high-impact bias among: brain regions, methods, neurotransmitters, study species, and broad themes within neuroscience. A systematic approach to the contents of high-impact journals offers the field an objective view of itself.</content:encoded>

The present study aimed to investigate distinctive regional brain activity and connectivity patterns in WMH subjects with and without CI, who displayed comparable WMH burden. 
Methods: Fourteen WMH subjects with CI, 16 WMH subjects without CI and 37 healthy subjects underwent multimodal MRI scans and neuropsychological tests. All WMH subjects displayed Fazekas grade 2 of WMH. Regional Homogeneity (ReHo) and functional connectivity (FC) patterns were identified based on resting-state functional MRI data. 
Results: No significant differences in WMH volume, the number of WMH lesions and brain volume were shown between the 2 WMH groups. In contrast, the WMH with CI group showed higher ReHo in bilateral superior parietal gyrus (SPG)/superior occipital gyrus (SOG) than the WMH without CI group. Compared with the WMH without CI group, the WMH with CI group also displayed higher FC of the left SPG/SOG with frontal regions, and higher FC of the right SPG/SOG with parietal regions. Furthermore, higher FC of the left SPG/SOG with frontal regions were significantly associated with less worse executive dysfunction in WMH with CI subjects, suggesting a compensatory effect. 
Conclusions: Higher local coherence of activities in the SPG/SOG and higher connectivity of the SPG/SOG with parietal and frontal regions are related to CI in WMH subjects. The findings provide novel insights into functional alterations underlying the cognitive variety in WMH subjects.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00693</link>
	<content:encoded>Aggregation of α-synuclein (αSyn) plays a central role in the pathogenesis of Parkinson’s disease (PD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites, which consist mainly of aggregated αSyn, are widely observed in the affected regions of patient brains. Except for some familial forms of PD, most sporadic PD patients express the wild-type αSyn protein without any mutations, and the mechanisms as to how wild-type αSyn gains the propensity to pathologically aggregate still remains unclear. Furthermore, the mechanisms by which the same αSyn protein can cause different synucleinopathies with distinct phenotypes and pathologies, such as PD, DLB, and multiple system atrophy, still remain largely unknown. Recently, mutations in the GBA1 gene have been reported be the strongest risk factor for developing sporadic PD. Furthermore, decreased glucocerebrosidase activity has also been reported in the brains of patients with sporadic PD. Moreover, αSyn pathology have also been shown in the brains of lysosomal storage disorder patients, which show glycosphingolipid accumulation. These observations suggest the possibility that altered lipid metabolism and lipid accumulation play roles in αSyn aggregation and PD pathogenesis. Indeed, several previous studies have demonstrated that lipid interactions affect the conformation of αSyn and induces its oligomerization and aggregation. In this review, we will give an overview of the association between αSyn aggregation and lipid interactions from the viewpoints of the etiology, pathology, and genetics of PD. We also discuss the distinct species of αSyn aggregates and their association with specific types of synucleinopathies, and introduce our hypothesis that lipid interactions play a role as trans-acting effectors in producing distinct strains of αSyn fibrils.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00688</link>
	<content:encoded>Image characteristics of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data (e.g. signal-to-noise ratio, SNR) may change over the course of a study. To monitor these changes a quality assurance (QA) protocol is necessary. QA can be realized both by performing regular phantom measurements and by controlling the human MRI datasets (e.g. noise detection in structural or movement parameters in functional datasets). Several QA tools for the assessment of MRI data quality have been developed. Many of them are freely available. This allows in principle the flexible set-up of a QA protocol specifically adapted to the aims of one’s own study. However, setup and maintenance of these tools bind time, in particular since the installation and operation often require a fair amount of technical knowledge. In this article we present a light-weighted virtual machine, named LAB-QA2GO, which provides scripts for fully automated QA analyses of phantom and human datasets. This virtual machine is ready for analysis by starting it the first time. With minimal configuration in the guided web-interface the first analysis can start within 10 minutes, while adapting to local phantoms and needs is easily possible. The usability and scope of LAB–QA2GO is illustrated using a data set from the QA protocol of our lab. With LAB–QA2GO we hope to provide an easy-to-use toolbox that is able to calculate QA statistics without high effort.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Brain inflammation can result in functional disorders observed in several neurodegenerative diseases and that can be also associated with reduced neurogenesis. In this study, we investigate the effect of mild inflammation, induced by unilateral injection of Endotoxin (ET) in the substantia nigra (SN)/ ventral tegmental area (VTA), on the proliferation and survival of stem/progenitor cells in the dentate gyrus (DG) of the hippocampus. Adult female rats received unilateral injection of ET (2 µg/2 µl saline) or sterile saline (2 µl) in the right SN followed by 5’-Bromo-2’-deoxyuridine (BrdU) injections (66 mg/kg/injection). Intranigral ET injection induced bilateral decrease in the number of newly born BrdU positive cells in the DG. This effect was paralleled by a significant decrease in the exploratory behavior of rats, as assessed by the Y-maze novel arm exploration task. ET also induced a transient decrease in the number of tyrosine hydroxylase -positive cells in the injected SN, impaired motor behavior, and caused microglial activation in the SN. This study provides an experimental simulation of the remote effects of moderate and reversible neuroinflammation resulting in impaired communication between midbrain dopaminergic neurons and the hippocampus.</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Neurodegeneration section | New and Recent Articles: Empiric Methods to Account for Pre-analytical Variability in Digital Histopathology in Frontotemporal Lobar Degeneration</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00682</link>
	<content:encoded>Digital pathology is increasingly prominent in neurodegenerative disease research, but variability in immunohistochemical staining intensity between staining batches prevents large-scale comparative studies. Here we provide a statistically rigorous method to account for staining batch effects in a large sample of brain tissue with frontotemporal lobar degeneration with tau inclusions (FTLD-Tau, N=39) or TDP-43 inclusions (FTLD-TDP, N=53). We analyzed the relationship between duplicate measurements of digital pathology, i.e. percent area occupied by pathology (%AO) for grey matter (GM) and white matter (WM), from two distinct staining batches. We found a significant difference in duplicate measurements from distinct staining batches in FTLD-Tau (mean difference: GM=1.13±0.44, WM=1.28±0.56; p&amp;lt;0.001) and FTLD-TDP (GM=0.95±0.66, WM=0.90±0.77; p&amp;lt;0.001), and these measurements were linearly related (R-squared [Rsq]: FTLD-Tau GM=0.92, WM=0.92; FTLD-TDP GM=0.75, WM=0.78; p&amp;lt;0.001 all). We therefore used linear regression to transform %AO from distinct staining batches into equivalent values. Using a train-test set design, we examined transformation prerequisites (i.e. Rsq) from linear-modeling in training sets, and we applied equivalence factors (i.e. beta, intercept) to independent testing sets to determine transformation outcomes (i.e. intraclass correlation coefficient [ICC]). First, random iterations (x100) of linear regression showed that smaller training sets (N=12-24), feasible for prospective use, have acceptable transformation prerequisites (mean Rsq: FTLD-Tau≥0.9; FTLD-TDP≥0.7). When cross-validated on independent complementary testing sets, in FTLD-Tau, N=12 training sets resulted in 100% of GM and WM transformations with optimal transformation outcomes (ICC≥0.8), while in FTLD-TDP N=24 training sets resulted in optimal ICC in testing sets (GM=72%, WM=98%). We therefore propose training sets of N=12 in FTLD-Tau and N=24 in FTLD-TDP for prospective transformations. Finally, the transformation enabled us to significantly reduce batch-related difference in duplicate measurements in FTLD-Tau (GM/WM: p&amp;lt;0.001 both) and FTLD-TDP (GM/WM: p&amp;lt;0.001 both), and to decrease the necessary sample size estimated in a power analysis in FTLD-Tau (GM:-40%; WM:-34%) and FTLD-TDP (GM:-20%; WM:-30%). Finally, we tested generalizability of our approach using a second, open-source, image analysis platform and found similar results. We concluded that a small sample of tissue stained in duplicate can be used to account for pre-analytical variability such as staining batch effects, thereby improving methods for future studies.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00665</link>
	<content:encoded>Drug-seeking in opioid dependence is due in part to the severe negative emotion associated with the withdrawal syndrome. It is well-established that negative emotional states emerge from activity in the amygdala. More recently, gut microflora have been shown to contribute substantially to such emotions. We measured gene expression in single glia and neurons gathered from the amygdala using laser capture microdissection and simultaneously measured gut microflora in morphine-dependent and withdrawn rats to investigate drivers of negative emotion in opioid withdrawal. We found that neuroinflammatory genes, notably Tnf, were upregulated in the withdrawal condition and that astrocytes, in particular, were highly active. We also observe a decreased Firmicutes to Bacteroides ratio in opioid withdrawal indicating gut dysbiosis. We speculate that these inflammatory and gut microflora changes contribute to the negative emotion experienced in opioid withdrawal that motivates dependence.</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Brain Imaging Methods section | New and Recent Articles: Performing Sparse Regularization and Dimension Reduction Simultaneously in Multimodal Data Fusion</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00642</link>
	<content:encoded>Collecting multiple modalities of neuroimaging data on the same subject is increasingly becoming the norm in clinical practice and research. Fusing multiple modalities to find related patterns is a challenge in neuroimaging analysis. Canonical correlation analysis (CCA) is commonly used as a symmetric data fusion technique to find related patterns among multiple modalities. In CCA-based data fusion, principal component analysis (PCA) is frequently applied as a preprocessing step to reduce data dimension followed by CCA on dimension-reduced data. PCA, however, does not differentiate between informative voxels from non-informative voxels in the dimension reduction step. Sparse PCA (sPCA) extends traditional PCA by adding sparse regularization that assigns zero weights to non-informative voxels. In this study, sPCA is incorporated into CCA-based fusion analysis and applied on neuroimaging data. A cross-validation method is developed and validated to optimize the parameters in sPCA. Different simulations are carried out to evaluate the improvement by introducing sparsity constraint to PCA. Four fusion methods including sPCA+CCA, PCA+CCA, parallel ICA and sparse CCA were applied on structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging data of mild cognitive impairment subjects and normal controls. Our results indicate that sPCA significantly can reduce the impact of non-informative voxels and lead to improved statistical power in uncovering disease-related patterns by a fusion analysis.</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Individual Differences in Math Ability Determine Neurocognitive Processing of Arithmetic Complexity: A Combined fNIRS-EEG Study</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2019.00227</link>
	<content:encoded>Some individuals experience more difficulties with math than others, in particular when arithmetic problems get more complex. Math ability on one hand and arithmetic complexity on the other hand seem to partly share neural underpinnings. This study addresses the question of whether this leads to an interaction of math ability and arithmetic complexity for multiplication and division on behavioral and neural levels. Previously screened individuals with high and low math ability solved multiplication and division problems in a written production paradigm while brain activation was assessed by combined functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) and electroencephalography (EEG). Arithmetic complexity was manipulated by using single-digit operands for simple multiplication problems and operands between 2 and 19 for complex multiplication problems and the corresponding division problems. On the behavioral level, individuals with low math ability needed more time for calculation, especially for complex arithmetic. On the neural level, fNIRS results revealed that these individuals showed less activation in the left supramarginal gyrus, superior temporal gyrus and inferior frontal gyrus than individuals with high math ability when solving complex compared to simple arithmetic. This reflects the greater use of arithmetic fact retrieval and also the more efficient processing of arithmetic complexity by individuals with high math ability. Oscillatory EEG analysis generally revealed theta and alpha desynchronization with increasing arithmetic complexity but showed no interaction with math ability. Because of the discovered interaction for behavior and brain activation, we conclude that the consideration of individual differences is essential when investigating the neurocognitive processing of arithmetic.</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Cross-Domain Associations Between Motor Ability, Independent Exploration, and Large-Scale Spatial Navigation; Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, Williams Syndrome, and Typical Development</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2019.00225</link>
	<content:encoded>In typical infants, the achievement of independent locomotion has a positive impact on the development of both small-scale and large-scale spatial cognition. Here we investigated whether this association between the motor and spatial domain: 1) persists into childhood and 2) is detrimental to the development of spatial cognition in individuals with motor deficits, namely, individuals with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and individuals with Williams syndrome (WS). Despite evidence of a co-occurring motor impairment in many individuals with ADHD, little is known about the developmental consequences of this impairment. Individuals with WS demonstrate impaired motor and spatial competence, yet the relationship between these two impairments is unknown. Typically developing (TD) children (N=71), individuals with ADHD (N=51) and individuals with WS (N=20) completed a battery of motor tasks, a measure of independent exploration, and a virtual reality spatial navigation task. Retrospective motor milestone data was collected for the ADHD and WS groups. Results demonstrated a relationship between fine motor ability and spatial navigation in the TD group, which could reflect the developmental impact of the ability to manually manipulate objects, on spatial knowledge. In contrast, no relationships between the motor and spatial domains were observed for the ADHD or WS groups. Indeed, whilst there was evidence of motor impairment in both groups, only the WS group demonstrated an impairment in large-scale spatial navigation. The motor-spatial relationship in the TD, but not the ADHD and WS groups, suggests that spatial cognition can develop via a developmental pathway which bypasses input from the motor domain.</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Explicit Control of Step Timing During Split-Belt Walking Reveals Interdependent Recalibration of Movements in Space and Time</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2019.00207</link>
	<content:encoded>Split-belt treadmills that move the legs at different speeds are thought to update internal representations of the environment, such that this novel condition generates a new locomotor pattern with distinct spatio-temporal features compared to those of regular walking. It is unclear the degree to which such recalibration of movements in the spatial and temporal domains is interdependent. In this study, we explicitly altered subjects’ limb motion in either space or time during split-belt walking to determine its impact on the adaptation of the other domain. Interestingly, we observed that motor adaptation in the spatial domain was susceptible to altering the temporal domain, whereas motor adaptation in the temporal domain was resilient to modifying the spatial domain. This nonreciprocal relation suggests a hierarchical organization such that the control of timing in locomotion has an effect on the control of limb position. This is of translational interest because clinical populations often have a greater deficit in one domain compared to
14 the other. Our results suggest that explicit changes to temporal deficits cannot occur without modifying the spatial control of the limb.</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Auditory Stream Segregation Can Be Modeled by Neural Competition in Cochlear Implant Listeners</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2019.00042</link>
	<content:encoded>Auditory stream segregation is a perceptual process by which the human auditory system groups sounds from different sources into perceptually meaningful elements (e.g. a voice or a melody). The perceptual segregation of sounds is important, for example, for the understanding of speech in noisy scenarios, a particularly challenging task for listeners with a cochlear implant (CI). It has been suggested that some aspects of stream segregation may be explained by relatively basic neural mechanisms at a cortical level. During the past decades, a variety of models have been proposed to account for the data from stream segregation experiments in normal-hearing (NH) listeners. However, little attention has been given to corresponding findings in CI listeners. The present study investigated whether a neural model of sequential stream segregation, proposed to describe the behavioral effects observed in NH listeners, can account for behavioral data from CI listeners. The model operates on the stimulus features at the cortical level and includes a competition stage between the neuronal units encoding the different percepts. The competition arises from a combination of mutual inhibition, adaptation and additive noise. The model was found to capture the main trends in the behavioral data from CI listeners, such as the larger probability of a segregated percept with increasing the feature difference between the sounds as well as the build-up effect. Importantly, this was achieved without any modification to the model’s competition stage, suggesting that stream segregation could be mediated by a similar mechanism in both groups of listeners.</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neural Circuits | New and Recent Articles: Stimulus-Specific Adaptation Decreases the Coupling of Spikes to LFP Phase</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncir.2019.00044</link>
	<content:encoded>Stimulus repetition suppresses the neural activity in different sensory areas of the brain. This mechanism of so-called stimulus-specific adaptation has been observed in both spiking activity and local field potential (LFP) responses. However, much remains to be known about the effect of stimulus-specific adaptation on the spike-LFP relation. In this study, we approached this issue by investigating the spike-phase coupling (SPC) in control and adapting paradigms. For the control paradigm, pure tones were presented in a random unbiased sequence. In the adapting paradigm, the same stimuli were presented in a random pattern but it was biased to an adapter stimulus. In fact, the adapter occupied 80% of the adapting sequence. During the tasks, LFP and multi-unit activity were recorded simultaneously from the primary auditory cortex of 15 anesthetized rats. To clarify the effect of adaptation on the relation between spike and LFP responses, the SPC of the adapter stimulus in these two paradigms were evaluated. Here, we employed phase locking value (PLV) method for calculating the SPC. Our data shows a strong coupling of spikes to LFP phase most prominently in beta band. This coupling was observed to decrease in the adapting condition compared to the control one. Importantly, we found that adaptation reduces spikes dominantly from the preferred phase of LFP in which spikes are more likely to be present there. This highlights the crucial role of LFP phase and its relation to spikes in neural adaptation mechanism. This finding is important for interpretation of the underlying neural mechanism of adaptation and also can be used in the context of the network and related connectivity models.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2019.00299</link>
	<content:encoded>Mast cells and their mediators play a role in the control of homeostasis and in the pathogenesis of several disorders. The concept of rodent mast cell heterogeneity, initially established in the mid-1960s has been extended in humans. Human mast cells isolated and purified from different anatomic sites can be activated via aggregation of cell surface high affinity IgE receptors (FcRI) by antigens, superantigens, anti-IgE, and anti-FcRI. MAS-related G protein-coupled receptor-X2 (MRGPRX2) is expressed at high level in human skin mast cells (MCs) (HSMCs), synovial MCs (HSyMCs), but not in lung MCs (HLMCs). MRGPX2 can be activated by neuropeptide substance P, several opioids, cationic drugs, and 48/80. Substance P (5 x 10-7 M - 5 x 10-6 M) induced histamine and tryptase release from HSMCs and to a lesser extent from HSyMCs, but not from HLMCs and human cardiac MCs (HHMCs). Morphine (10-5 M - 3 x 10-4 M) selectively induced histamine and tryptase release from HSMCs, but not from HLMCs and HHMCs. SP and morphine were incomplete secretagogues because they did not induce the de novo synthesis of arachidonic acid metabolites from human mast cells. In the same experiments anti-IgE (3 g/ml) induced the release of histamine and tryptase and the de novo synthesis of prostaglandin D2 (PGD2) from HLMCs, HHMCs, HSyMCs, and HSMCs. By contrast, anti-IgE induced the production of leukotriene C4 (LTC4) from HLMCs, HHMCs, HSyMCs, but not from HSMCs. These results are compatible with the heterogeneous expression and function of MRGPRX2 receptor on primary human mast cells isolated from different anatomic sites.</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: MeCP2 Deficiency Disrupts Kainate-Induced Presynaptic Plasticity in the Mossy Fiber Projections in the Hippocampus</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2019.00286</link>
	<content:encoded>Methyl Cytosine Binding Protein 2 (MeCP2) is a structural chromosomal protein involved in the regulation of gene expression. Mutations in the gene encoding MeCP2 result in Rett Syndrome, (RTT) a pervasive neurodevelopmental disorder. RTT is one of few Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASDs) whose cause was identified as a single gene mutation. Remarkably, abnormal levels of MeCP2 have been associated to other neurodevelopmental disorders, as well as neuropsychiatric disorders. Therefore, many studies have been oriented to investigate the role of MeCP2 in the nervous system.
In the present work, we explore cellular and molecular mechanisms affecting synaptic plasticity events in vivo in the hippocampus of MeCP2 mutant mice. While most studies addressed postsynaptic defects in the absence of MeCP2, we took advantage of an in vivo activity-paradigm (seizures), two models of MeCP2 deficiency, and neurobiological assays to reveal novel defects in presynaptic structural plasticity in the hippocampus in RTT rodent models. These approaches allowed us to determine that: MeCP2 mutations alter presynaptic components, i. e., disrupts the plastic response of mossy fibers to synaptic activityand results in reduced axonal growth which is correlated with imbalanced trophic and guidance support, associated with aberrant expression of BDNF and Sema3F. Our results also revealed that adult-born granule cells recapitulate maturational defects that have been only shown at early postnatal ages. As these cells do not mature timely, they may not integrate properly into the adult hippocampal circuitry. Finally, we performed a hippocampal-dependent test that revealed defective spatial memory in these mice. 
Altogether, our studies establish a model that allows us to evaluate the effect of the manipulation of specific pathways involved in axonal guidance, synaptogenesis, or maturation in specific circuits and correlate it with changes in behavior. Understanding the mechanisms underlying the neuronal compromise caused by mutations in MeCP2 will provide information on the pathogenic mechanism of autistic spectrum disorders and improve our understanding of brain development and molecular basis of behavior.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnana.2019.00068</link>
	<content:encoded>Iron levels in the brain can be estimated using newly developed specific magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) sequences. This technique has several applications, especially in neurodegenerative disorders like Alzheimer’s disease or Parkinson’s disease. Coupling ex vivo MRI with histology allows neuroscientists to better understand what they see in the images. Iron is one of the most extensively studied elements, both by MRI and using histological or physical techniques. Researchers were initially only able to make visual comparisons between MRI images and different types of iron staining, but the emergence of specific MRI sequences like R2* or quantitative susceptibility mapping meant that quantification became possible, requiring correlations with physical techniques. Today, with advances in MRI and image post-processing, it is possible to look for MRI/histology correlations by matching the two sorts of images. For the result to be acceptable, the choice of methodology is crucial, as there are hidden pitfalls every step of the way. In order to review the advantages and limitations of ex vivo MRI correlation with iron-based histology, we reviewed all the relevant articles dealing with the topic in humans. We provide separate assessments of qualitative and quantitative studies, and after summarizing the significant results, we emphasize all the pitfalls that may be encountered.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/46113</link>
	<content:encoded>Ecdysis (moulting) is the defining character of Ecdysoza (arthropods, nematodes and related phyla). Despite superficial similarities, the signalling cascade underlying moulting differs between Panarthropoda and the remaining ecdysozoans. Here, we reconstruct evolution of major components of the ecdysis pathway. Its key elements evolved much earlier than previously thought and are present in non-moulting lophotrochozoans and deuterostomes. Eclosion hormone (EH) and bursicon originated prior to the cnidarian-bilaterian split, whereas ecdysis-triggering hormone (ETH) and crustacean cardioactive peptide (CCAP) evolved in the bilaterian last common ancestor (LCA). Identification of EH, CCAP and bursicon in Onychophora and EH, ETH and CCAP in Tardigrada suggests that the pathway was present in the panarthropod LCA. Trunk, an ancient extracellular signalling molecule and a well-established paralog of the insect peptide prothoracicotropic hormone (PTTH), is present in the non-bilaterian ctenophore &lt;i&gt;Mnemiopsis leidyi&lt;/i&gt;. This constitutes the first case of a ctenophore signalling peptide with homology to a neuropeptide.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: latest articles: The hippocampus supports deliberation during value based decisions</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/46080</link>
	<content:encoded>Choosing between two items involves deliberation and comparison of the features of each item and its value. Such decisions take more time when choosing between options of similar value, possibly because these decisions require more evidence, but the mechanisms involved are not clear. We propose that the hippocampus supports deliberation about value, given its well-known role in prospection and relational cognition. We assessed the role of the hippocampus in deliberation in two experiments. First, using fMRI in healthy participants, we found that BOLD activity in the hippocampus increased as a function of deliberation time. Second, we found that patients with hippocampal damage exhibited more stochastic choices and longer reaction times than controls, possibly due to their failure to construct value based on internal evidence during deliberation. Both sets of results were stronger in value-based decisions compared to perceptual decisions.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: latest articles: Agrin-Lrp4-Ror2 signaling regulates adult hippocampal neurogenesis in mice</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/45303</link>
	<content:encoded>Adult neurogenesis in the hippocampus may represent a form of plasticity in brain functions including mood, learning and memory. However, mechanisms underlying neural stem/progenitor cells (NSPCs) proliferation are not well understood. We found that Agrin, a factor critical for neuromuscular junction formation, is elevated in the hippocampus of mice that are stimulated by enriched environment (EE). Genetic deletion of the &lt;i&gt;Agrn&lt;/i&gt; gene in excitatory neurons decreases NSPCs proliferation and increases depressing-like behavior. Low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 4 (Lrp4), a receptor for Agrin, is expressed in hippocampal NSPCs and its mutation blocked basal as well as EE-induced NSPCs proliferation and maturation of newborn neurons. Finally, we show that Lrp4 interacts with and activates receptor tyrosine kinase-like orphan receptor 2 (Ror2); and &lt;i&gt;Ror&lt;/i&gt;2 mutation impairs NSPCs proliferation. Together, these observations identify a role of Agrin-Lrp4-Ror2 signaling for adult neurogenesis, uncovering previously unexpected functions of Agrin and Lrp4 in the brain.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: latest articles: A composition-dependent molecular clutch between T cell signaling condensates and actin</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/42695</link>
	<content:encoded>During T cell activation, biomolecular condensates form at the immunological synapse (IS) through multivalency-driven phase separation of LAT, Grb2, Sos1, SLP-76, Nck, and WASP. These condensates move radially at the IS, traversing successive radially-oriented and concentric actin networks. To understand this movement, we biochemically reconstituted LAT condensates with actomyosin filaments. We found that basic regions of Nck and N-WASP/WASP promote association and co-movement of LAT condensates with actin, indicating conversion of weak individual affinities to high collective affinity upon phase separation. Condensates lacking these components were propelled differently, without strong actin adhesion. In cells, LAT condensates lost Nck as radial actin transitioned to the concentric network, and engineered condensates constitutively binding actin moved aberrantly. Our data show that Nck and WASP form a clutch between LAT condensates and actin in vitro and suggest that compositional changes may enable condensate movement by distinct actin networks in different regions of the IS.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Pyramidal neurons are the most common cell type and are considered the main output neuron in most mammalian forebrain structures. In terms of function, differences in the structure of the dendrites of these neurons appear to be crucial in determining how neurons integrate information. To further shed light on the structure of the human pyramidal neurons we investigated the geometry of pyramidal cells in the human and mouse CA1 region—one of the most evolutionary conserved archicortical regions, which is critically involved in the formation, consolidation, and retrieval of memory. We aimed to assess to what extent neurons corresponding to a homologous region in different species have parallel morphologies. Over 100 intracellularly injected and 3D-reconstructed cells across both species revealed that dendritic and axonal morphologies of human cells are not only larger but also have structural differences, when compared to mouse. The results show that human CA1 pyramidal cells are not a stretched version of mouse CA1 cells. These results indicate that there are some morphological parameters of the pyramidal cells that are conserved, whereas others are species-specific.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

Mathematical models have been used successfully at diverse scales of biological organization, ranging from ecology and population dynamics to stochastic reaction events occurring between individual molecules in single cells. Generally, many biological processes unfold across multiple scales, with mutations being the best studied example of how stochasticity at the molecular scale can influence outcomes at the population scale. In many other contexts, however, an analogous link between micro- and macro-scale remains elusive, primarily due to the challenges involved in setting up and analyzing multi-scale models. Here, we employ such a model to investigate how stochasticity propagates from individual biochemical reaction events in the bacterial innate immune system to the ecology of bacteria and bacterial viruses. We show analytically how the dynamics of bacterial populations are shaped by the activities of immunity-conferring enzymes in single cells and how the ecological consequences imply optimal bacterial defense strategies against viruses. Our results suggest that bacterial populations in the presence of viruses can either optimize their initial growth rate or their population size, with the first strategy favoring simple immunity featuring a single restriction modification system and the second strategy favoring complex bacterial innate immunity featuring several simultaneously active restriction modification systems.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/4oVil-jENIA&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25517?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cytochrome &lt;i&gt;c&lt;/i&gt; oxidase (COX) deficiency is a major mitochondrial respiratory chain defect that has vast genetic and phenotypic heterogeneity. This study aims to identify novel causative genes of COX deficiency with only striated muscle–specific symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whole exome sequencing was performed in 2 unrelated individuals who were diagnosed with congenital myopathy and presented COX deficiency in muscle pathology. We assessed the &lt;i&gt;COX6A2&lt;/i&gt; variants using measurements of enzymatic activities and assembly of mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes in the samples from the patients and knockout mice.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both patients presented muscle weakness and hypotonia in 4 limbs along with facial muscle weakness. One patient had cardiomyopathy. Neither patient exhibited involvement from other organs. Whole exome sequencing identified biallelic missense variants in &lt;i&gt;COX6A2&lt;/i&gt;, which is expressed only in the skeletal muscle and heart. The variants detected were homozygous c.117C &amp;gt; A (p.Ser39Arg) and compound heterozygous c.117C &amp;gt; A (p.Ser39Arg) and c.127T &amp;gt; C (p.Cys43Arg). We found specific reductions in complex IV activities in the skeletal muscle of both individuals. Assembly of complex IV and its supercomplex formation were impaired in the muscle.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study indicates that biallelic variants in &lt;i&gt;COX6A2&lt;/i&gt; cause a striated muscle–specific form of COX deficiency. ANN NEUROL 2019&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Selection starts in the primary visual cortex (V1), which creates a bottom-up saliency map to guide the fovea to selected visual locations via gaze shifts. This motivates a new framework that views vision as consisting of encoding, selection, and decoding stages, placing selection on center stage. It suggests a massive loss of non-selected information from V1 downstream along the visual pathway. Hence, feedback from downstream visual cortical areas to V1 for better decoding (recognition), through analysis-by-synthesis, should query for additional information and be mainly directed at the foveal region. Accordingly, non-foveal vision is not only poorer in spatial resolution, but also more susceptible to many illusions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/q-bio/0402002</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;An idea is not a replicator because it does not consist of coded
self-assembly instructions. It may retain structure as it passes from one
individual to another, but does not replicate it. The cultural replicator is
not an idea but an associatively-structured network of them that together form
an internal model of the world, or worldview. A worldview is a primitive,
uncoded replicator, like the autocatalytic sets of polymers widely believed to
be the earliest form of life. Primitive replicators generate self-similar
structure, but because the process happens in a piecemeal manner, through
bottom-up interactions rather than a top-down code, they replicate with low
fidelity, and acquired characteristics are inherited. Just as polymers catalyze
reactions that generate other polymers, the retrieval of an item from memory
can in turn trigger other items, thus cross-linking memories, ideas, and
concepts into an integrated conceptual structure. Worldviews evolve idea by
idea, largely through social exchange. An idea participates in the evolution of
culture by revealing certain aspects of the worldview that generated it,
thereby affecting the worldviews of those exposed to it. If an idea influences
seemingly unrelated fields this does not mean that separate cultural lineages
are contaminating one another, because it is worldviews, not ideas, that are
the basic unit of cultural evolution.

	<content:encoded>The application of super-resolution optical microscopy to investigating synaptic structures has revealed a highly heterogeneous and variable intra-synaptic organization. Dense subsynaptic protein assemblies named subsynaptic domains or SSDs have been proposed as structural units that regulate the efficacy of neuronal transmission. However, an in-depth characterization of subsynaptic domains has been hampered by technical limitations of super-resolution microscopy of synapses, namely the stochasticity of the signals during the imaging procedures and the variability of the synaptic structures. Here, we synthetize the available evidence for the existence of subsynaptic domains at central synapses, as well as the possible functional relevance of SSDs. In particular, we discuss the possible regulation of co-transmission at mixed inhibitory synapses as a consequence of the subsynaptic distribution of glycine receptors (GlyRs) and GABAA receptors (GABAARs).</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Methamphetamine abuse has become a serious public health problem. However, effective treatment for methamphetamine addiction still remains elusive, especially considering its high rate of relapse after treatment. A conditioned stimulus (CS) memory retrieval-extinction procedure has been demonstrated to decrease reinstatement of cocaine, heroin and alcohol seeking in rats, and to reduce cue-induced craving in heroin and nicotine addicts. The goal of the present study was to explore the effect of CS memory retrieval-extinction procedure on methamphetamine seeking in rats and the underlying mechanisms. We found that daily presenting extinction training within reconsolidation time window attenuated subsequent drug priming-induced reinstatement, spontaneous recovery, and renewal of methamphetamine seeking. We also found retrieval of methamphetamine-associated memories induced neuronal activation in basolateral amygdala (BLA), while presenting extinction within the time window of reconsolidation abolished the neuronal activation in BLA. These results indicated that the CS memory retrieval-extinction procedure could prevent reconsolidation of methamphetamine memory traces in BLA and subsequent methamphetamine craving and relapse.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00698</link>
	<content:encoded>Extracellular vesicles (EVs), like exosomes, play a critical role in physiological processes, including synaptic transmission and nerve regeneration. However, exosomes in particular can also contribute to the development of neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Parkinson’s disease, and prion diseases. All of these disorders are characterized by protein aggregation and deposition in specific regions of the brain. Several lines of evidence indicate that protein in exosomes is released from affected neurons and propagated along neuroanatomically connected regions of the brain, thus spreading the neurodegenerative disease. Also, different cell types contribute to the progression of tauopathy, such as microglia.  Several groups have reported tau release via exosomes by cultured neurons or cells overexpressing human tau. Although the exact mechanisms underlying the propagation of protein aggregates are not fully understood, recent findings have implicated EVs in this process. The AD brain has two hallmarks, namely the presence of amyloid--containing plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, the latter formed by hyperphosphorylated tau protein. Both amyloid peptide and tau protein are present in specific exosomes. This review summarizes recent advances in our understanding of exosomes in the pathology of AD, with a special focus on tau protein.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fninf.2019.00048</link>
	<content:encoded>Computer aided diagnosis systems based on brain imaging are an important tool to assist in the diagnosis of Parkinson's disease, whose ultimate goal is the detection by automatic recognizing of patterns that characterize the disease. In recent times Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) have proved to be amazingly useful for that task. The drawback, however, is that 3D brain images contain a huge amount of information that leads to complex CNN architectures. When these architectures become too complex, classification performances often degrades because the limitations of the training algorithm and overfitting. Thus, this paper proposes the use of isosurfaces as a way to reduce such amount of data while keeping the most relevant information. These isosurfaces are then used to implement a classification system which uses two of the most well-known CNN architectures, LeNet and AlexNet, to classify DaTScan images with an average accuracy of 95.1% and AUC=97%, obtaining comparable (slightly better) values to those obtained for most of the recently proposed systems. It can be concluded therefore that the computation of isosurfaces reduces the complexity of the inputs significantly, resulting in high classification accuracies with reduced computational burden.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Introduction: Striatal dopamine depletion disrupts basal ganglia function and causes Parkinson´s disease (PD). The pathophysiology of the dopamine-dependent relationship between basal ganglia signalling and motor control, however, is not fully understood. We obtained simultaneous recordings of local field potentials (LFP) from the subthalamic nucleus (STN) and electromyograms (EMG) in patients with PD to investigate the impact of dopaminergic state and movement on long-range beta functional connectivity between basal ganglia and lower motor neurons. 
Methods: 8 PD patients were investigated three months after implantation of a DBS-system capable of recording LFPs via chronically-implanted leads (Medtronic, ACTIVA PC + S®). We analysed STN spectral power and its coherence with EMG in the context of two different movement paradigms (tonic wrist extension versus alternating wrist extension and flexion) and the effect of L-Dopa intake using an unbiased data-driven approach to determine regions of interest (ROI). 
Results Two ROIs capturing prominent coherence within a grand average coherogram were identified. A trend of a dopamine effect was observed for the first ROI (50–150 ms after movement start) with higher STN-EMG coherence in medicated patients. Concerning the second ROI (300–500 ms after movement start), an interaction effect of L-Dopa medication and movement task was observed with higher coherence in the isometric contraction task compared to alternating movements in the medication ON state, a pattern which was reversed in L-Dopa OFF.
Discussion: L-Dopa medication may normalize functional connectivity between remote structures of the motor system with increased upper beta coherence reflecting a physiological restriction of the amount of information conveyed between remote structures. This may be necessary to maintain simple movements like isometric contraction. Our study adds dynamic properties to the complex interplay between STN spectral beta power and the nucleus’ functional connectivity to remote structures of the motor system as a function of movement and dopaminergic state. This may help to identify markers of neuronal activity relevant for more individualised programming of DBS therapy.</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Role of Corticotropin Releasing Factor in the Neuroimmune Mechanisms of Depression: Examination of Current Pharmaceutical and Herbal Therapies</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2019.00290</link>
	<content:encoded>Approximately 3% of the world population suffers from depression, which is one of the most common form of mental disorder. Recent findings suggest that an interaction between the nervous system and immune system might be behind the pathophysiology of various neurological and psychiatric disorders, including depression. Neuropeptides have been shown to play a major role in mediating response to stress and inducing immune activation or suppression. Corticotropin releasing factor (CRF) is a major regulator of the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis response. CRF is a stress-related neuropeptide whose dysregulation has been associated with depression. In this review, we summarized the role of CRF in the neuroimmune mechanisms of depression, and the potential therapeutic effects of Chinese herbal medicines as well as other agents. Studying the network of CRF and immune responses will help to enhance our understanding of the pathogenesis of depression. Additionally, targeting this important network may aid in developing novel treatments for this debilitating psychiatric disorder.</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Tissue Transglutaminase Promotes Early Differentiation of Oligodendrocyte Progenitor Cells</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2019.00281</link>
	<content:encoded>Demyelinated lesions of the central nervous system are characteristic for multiple sclerosis (MS). Remyelination is not very effective, particular at later stages of the disease, which results in a chronic neurodegenerative character with worsening of symptoms. Previously, we have shown that the enzyme Tissue Transglutaminase (TG2) is downregulated upon differentiation of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) into myelin-forming oligodendrocytes and that TG2 knock-out mice lag behind in remyelination after cuprizone-induced demyelination. Here, we examined whether astrocytic or oligodendroglial TG2 affects OPCs in a cell-specific manner to modulate their differentiation, and therefore myelination. Our findings indicate that human TG2-expressing astrocytes did not modulate OPC differentiation and myelination. In contrast, persistent TG2 expression upon OPC maturation or exogenously added recombinant TG2 accelerated OPC differentiation and myelin membrane formation. Continuous exposure of recombinant TG2 to OPCs at different consecutive developmental stages, however, decreased OPC differentiation and myelin membrane formation, while it enhanced myelination in dorsal root ganglion neuron-OPC co-cultures. In MS lesions, TG2 is absent in OPCs, while human OPCs show TG2 immunoreactivity during brain development. Exposure to the MS-relevant pro-inflammatory cytokine IFN-γ increased TG2 expression in OPCs and prolonged expression of endogenous TG2 upon differentiation. However, despite the increased TG2 levels, OPC maturation was not accelerated, indicating that TG2-mediated OPC differentiation may be counteracted by other pathways. Together, our data show that TG2, either endogenously expressed, or exogenously supplied to OPCs, accelerates early OPC differentiation. A better understanding of the role of TG2 in the OPC differentiation process during MS is of therapeutic interest to overcome remyelination failure.</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Early Post-stroke Activation of Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor 2 Hinders the Receptor 1-Dependent Neuroprotection Afforded by the Endogenous Ligand</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2019.00270</link>
	<content:encoded>Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) has long been connected to the development of tissue lesion following ischemic stroke. Contradictory findings either situate VEGF as a promoter of large infarct volumes or as a potential attenuator of damage due to its well documented neuroprotective capability. The core of this discrepancy mostly lies on the substantial number of pleiotropic functions driven by VEGF. Mechanistically, these effects are activated through several VEGF receptors for which various closely related ligands exist. Here, we tested in an experimental model of stroke how the differential activation of VEGF receptors 1 and 2 would modify functional and histological outcomes in the acute phase post-ischemia. We also assessed whether VEGF-mediated responses would involve the modulation of inflammatory mechanisms and how this trophic factor acted specifically on neuronal receptors. We produced ischemic infarcts in adult rats by transiently occluding the middle cerebral artery and induced the pharmacological inhibition of VEGF receptors by i.c.v. administration of the specific VEGFR2 inhibitor SU1498 and the pan-VEGFR blocker Axitinib. We evaluated the neurological performance of animals at 24 h following stroke and the occurrence of brain infarctions analyzed at the gross metabolic and neuronal viability levels. We also assessed the induction of peripheral pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines in the cerebrospinal fluid and blood and assessed the polarization of activated microglia. Finally, we studied the direct involvement of cortical neuronal receptors for VEGF with in vitro assays of excitotoxic damage. Preferential VEGFR1 activation by the endogenous ligand promotes neuronal protection and prevents the presentation of large volume infarcts that highly correlate with neurological performance, while the concomitant activation of VEGFR2 reduces this effect, even in the presence of exogenous ligand. This process partially involves the polarization of microglia to the state M2. At the cellular level, neurons also responded better to the preferential activation of VEGFR1 when challenged to N-methyl-D-aspartate-induced excitotoxicity. Endogenous activation of VEGFR2 hinders the neuroprotective mechanisms mediated by the activation of VEGFR1. The selective modulation of these concurrent processes might enable the development of therapeutic approaches that target specific VEGFR1-mediated signaling during the acute phase post-stroke.</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroanatomy | New and Recent Articles: Post-mortem 11.7 Tesla Magnetic Resonance Imaging vs. Polarized Light Imaging Microscopy to Measure the Angle and Orientation of Dorsal Root Afferents in the Human Cervical Dorsal Root Entry Zone</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnana.2019.00066</link>
	<content:encoded>BACKGROUND: Destruction of the afferents by dorsal root entry zone (DREZ) surgery may be an effective treatment of intractable neuropathic pain, though it remains a high risk surgical intervention. Potential complications due to the lesioning of structures within the cervical spinal cord other than the DREZ can be minimized by accurate knowledge of the optimal insertion angle (i.e., the angle between the DREZ and the posterior median sulcus). The employed insertion angle has based on measurements between the DREZ and the posterior median sulcus on post-mortem transverse slices. However, new, more sophisticated imaging techniques are currently available and are thought to yield higher spatial resolution and more accurate images. 
OBEJCTIVE: This paper measures the angle between the DREZ and the posterior median sulcus on 11.7T post-mortem magnetic resonance images and compares these findings with polarized light imaging (PLI) microscopy images of the same specimens in order to quantify fiber orientation within the DREZ. 
METHODS: To visualize the anatomy of the cervical DREZ, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), diffusion-weighted MRI (dMRI), probabilistic tractography, and polarized light imaging (PLI)) were performed on 3 post-mortem human cervical spinal cords at level C5-C6. The MR data was used to measure the angle between the DREZ and the posterior median sulcus. MR images were complemented by probabilistic tractography results. Then, the orientation of fibers within the DREZ was quantified by use of PLI microscopy. 
RESULTS: Median angle between the DREZ and the posterior median sulcus, as measured on MR-images, was found to be 40.1° (ranging from 34.2-49.1°) and 39.8°  (ranging from 31.1-47.8°) in the left and right hemicord, respectively. Median fiber orientation within the DREZ, as quantified by PLI, was 28.5° (ranging from 12.0-44.3°) and 27.7° (ranging from 8.5-38.1°) in the left and right hemicord, respectively. 
CONCLUSION: Our study, which provides an improved understanding of the anatomy of the DREZ, the angle between the DREZ and the posterior median sulcus and the median fiber orientation within the DREZ, could contribute to safer DREZ-lesioning surgery to treat chronic neuropathic pain in the future.</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Cerebral Blood Flow in Community-Based Older Twins Is Moderately Heritable: An Arterial Spin Labeling Perfusion Imaging Study</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2019.00169</link>
	<content:encoded>Adequate cerebral blood flow (CBF) is necessary to maintain brain metabolism and function. Arterial spin labelling (ASL) is an emerging MRI technique offering a non-invasive and reliable quantification of CBF. The genetic basis of CBF has not been well documented, and one approach to investigate this is to examine its heritability. The current study aimed to examine the heritability of CBF using ASL data from a cohort of community-dwelling older twins (41 monozygotic and 25 dizygotic twin pairs; age range, 65-93 years; 56.4% female). Results showed that the cortex had higher CBF than subcortical grey matter (GM) regions, and CBF in the GM regions of the anterior cerebral artery (ACA) territory was lower than that of the middle (MCA) and posterior (PCA) cerebral arteries. After accounting for the effects of age, sex and scanner, moderate heritability was identified for global CBF (h2 = 0.611; 95% CI = 0.380-0.761), as well as for cortical and subcortical GM and the GM in the major arterial territories (h2 = 0.500-0.612). Strong genetic correlations were found between CBF in subcortical and cortical GM regions, as well as among the three arterial territories (ACA, MCA, PCA), suggesting a largely convergent genetic control for the CBF in brain GM. The moderate heritability of CBF warrants future investigations to uncover the genetic variants and genes that regulate CBF.</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Differential Associations Between Distinct Components of Cognitive Function and Mobility: Implications for Understanding Aging, Turning and Dual-Task Walking</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2019.00166</link>
	<content:encoded>Objective: Cognition and mobility are interrelated. However, this association can be impacted by the specific facets of cognition and mobility that are measured, and further by the different task conditions, single- versus dual-task walking, under which these associations are evaluated. Systematically studying the multiple facets of cognitive-mobility associations under both the task conditions is critical because both cognition and mobility change with age and pose significant risks associated with falls, morbidity, and disability. Methods: Using a cross-sectional, prospective study design, data from 124 healthy adults (mean age (SD) = 61.51 (11.90); mean education (SD) = 15.94 (2.18)) was collected. A comprehensive battery of cognitive tests was administered, and gait was assessed using a small, lightweight, three-axis accelerometer with a gyroscope. Analytical Plan: Data was transformed, and only relatively strong relationships survived after strict statistical criteria adjusting for multiple comparisons was applied. Spearman rho correlation coefficients were used to examine the matrix of correlations between the cognitive-motor variables while adjusting for age and gender. Results: Executive functions, processing speed, and language were associated with distinct facets of variability, pace, asymmetry, especially under the dual-task walking condition. Both turns and transitions were also associated with cognition during the Timed Up and Go task. Conclusion: Our results extend converging evidence for the involvement of executive functions and processing speed in specific aspects of mobility, along with the role of language. The study has important implications for aging in terms of both assessment and rehabilitation of cognition and gait as well as for the emerging dual-tasking theories and the role of the neural pathways involved in mobility.</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Prefrontal Cortex Activation During Dual Task With Increasing Cognitive Load in Subacute Stroke Patients: A Pilot Study</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2019.00160</link>
	<content:encoded>Stroke patients often exhibit difficulties performing a cognitive task while walking, defined as a dual task (DT). Their prefrontal cortex (PFC) activity is higher in DT than in single task (ST). The effects of an increasing load on PFC activity during DT in subacute stroke patients remains unexplored. Our objective was to assess the effects of N-back tasks (low/high load) on cerebral activity, gait parameters and cognitive performances. Eleven subacute stroke patients (days post-stroke 45.8±31.6) participated in this study (71.4±10 yrs, BMI 26.7±4.8 kg.m-2, Barthel index 81.8±11.0). Patients completed a STwalk, and 4 conditions with 1-back (low load) and 2-back (high load): STlow, SThigh, DTlow and DThigh. Overground walking was performed at a comfortable pace and -N-back conditions were carried out verbally. Both gait (speed, stride variability) and cognitive (rate of correct answers) performances were recorded. Changes in PFC oxyhemoglobin (∆O2Hb) and deoxyhemoglobin (∆HHb) were measured by functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). Results showed an increase of ∆O2Hb while walking, which was not augmented by cognitive loads in DT. Walking speed was reduced by low and high cognitive loads in DT compared to STwalk (P&amp;lt;0.05), but was not different between DTlow and DThigh. Cognitive performances were negatively impacted by both walking (P&amp;lt;0.05) and cognitive load (between ‘low’ and ‘high’, P&amp;lt;0.001). These data highlight a “ceiling” effect in ∆O2Hb levels while walking, leaving no available resources for simultaneous cognitive tasks, during the early recovery period following stroke. In these patients, cognitive, but not motor, performances declined with a higher cognitive load.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2019.00158</link>
	<content:encoded>Large-scale brain networks exhibit changes in functional connectivity during the aging process. Recent literature data suggests that Yoga and other contemplative practices may revert, at least in part, some of the aging effects in brain functional connectivity, including of the Default Mode Network (DMN). The aim of this cross-sectional investigation was to compare resting-state functional connectivity of the medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) and posterior cingulate cortex - precuneus (PCC-Precuneus) in long-term elderly Yoga practitioners and healthy paired Yoga-naïve controls. Two paired groups: yoga (Y-20 women, Hatha Yoga practitioners; minimum twice a week of practice frequency for at least 8 years) and control group (C-20 women, Yoga-naïve, matched by age, years of formal education, and physical activity) were evaluated for: Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL), and open-eyes resting-state fMRI - seed to voxel connectivity analysis (CONN toolbox 17.f) with pre-processing - realignment and unwarping, slice-timing correction, segmentation, normalization, outlier detection, and spatial filtering. Analysis included a priori regions of interest (ROI) of DMN main nodes – MPFC and PCC-Precuneus. There was no difference between groups for: age, years of formal education, MMSE, BDI and IADL. Yoga group had higher correlation between MPFC and right angular gyrus, compared to controls. Elderly women with at least 8 years of yoga practice presented greater intra-network anteroposterior brain functional connectivity of the default mode network. This finding may contribute for the understanding of the influences of Yoga practice for a healthier cognitive aging process.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2019.00151</link>
	<content:encoded>Platelets are anucleate cells that circulate in blood and are essential components of the hemostatic system. During aging, platelet numbers decrease and their aggregation capacity is reduced. Platelet dysfunctions associated with aging can be linked to molecular alterations affecting several cellular systems that include cytoskeleton rearrangements, signal transduction, vesicular trafficking and protein degradation. Age platelets may adopt a phenotype characterized by robust secretion of extracellular vesicles that could in turn account for about 70-90% of blood circulating vesicles. Interestingly these extracellular vesicles are loaded with messenger RNAs and microRNAs that may have a profound impact on protein physiology at the systems level. Age platelet dysfunction is also associated with accumulation of reactive oxygen species. Thereby understanding the mechanisms of aging in platelets as well as their age-dependent dysfunctions may be of interest when evaluating the contribution of aging to the onset of age-dependent pathologies, such as those affecting the nervous system. In this review we summarize the findings that link platelet dysfunctions to neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer’s Disease, Parkinson’s Disease, Multiple Sclerosis, Huntington’s Disease and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis. We discuss the role of platelets as drivers of protein dysfunctions observed in these pathologies, their association with aging and the potential clinical significance of platelets, and related miRNAs, as peripheral biomarkers for diagnosis and prognosis of neurodegenerative diseases.</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Subjective Cognitive Decline and Nighttime Sleep Alterations, a Longitudinal Analysis</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2019.00142</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract

Objective: the purpose of this study was to analyze quantitative sleep changes and their implication in subjective cognitive decline (SCD). Objective sleep pattern was investigated through actigraphy recorded at the baseline and at the follow-up after two years. The aim of the study was to examine specific sleep alterations in SCD. 

Background: sleep disorders are very common among average elderly adults and an altered sleep pattern is known to be a risk factor for future development of Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and dementia. Recent studies have shown how sleep is objectively altered in average senior adults with Subjective Cognitive Decline (SCD), without any other significant change in cognition and behavior or brain structure. Considering that both SCD and disrupted sleep are risk factors for future MCI and dementia, with sleep only as a modifiable risk factor, further research is required to deeply investigate the interaction between sleep and SCD.

Methods:  among seventy community-dwelling elderly individuals who had been enrolled at baseline, thirty-five (64.6 5.6 y, 15M/20F) underwent a complete neuropsychological battery and one-week wrist actigraphy recording two years later during the follow-up stage.  Individuals were divided into two groups according to their Subjective Cognitive Decline Questionnaire (SCD-Q) score. Sleep hours, sleep efficiency and onset latency, napping and time awake after sleep onset (WASO) were collected. All individuals underwent structural Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) examination to exclude brain disorders. Data collection was performed at baseline and after two years at the follow-up phase.

Results:  a significantly different night sleep time between the two groups was observed: SCD showed a lower total sleep time (TST) than non-SCD subjects. Moreover, a total time spent in bed (TIB) was significantly lower in SCD subjects over two years of observation.

Conclusions:  objective changes over time of the sleep pattern, specifically total time spent in bed and total sleep time, are present in SCD individuals. The results of the study show that sleep alterations are common in SCD and underline the clinical importance of screening in order to assess sleep alterations as well as improve sleep in average adults with SCD complaints.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/47145</link>
	<content:encoded>Dyneins are motor proteins responsible for transport in the cytoplasm and the beating of axonemes in cilia and flagella. They bind and release microtubules via a compact microtubule-binding domain (MTBD) at the end of a coiled-coil stalk. We address how cytoplasmic and axonemal dynein MTBDs bind microtubules at near atomic resolution. We decorated microtubules with MTBDs of cytoplasmic dynein-1 and axonemal dynein DNAH7 and determined their cryo-EM structures using helical Relion. The majority of the MTBD is rigid upon binding, with the transition to the high affinity state controlled by the movement of a single helix at the MTBD interface. DNAH7 contains an 18-residue insertion, found in many axonemal dyneins, that contacts the adjacent protofilament. Unexpectedly we observe that DNAH7, but not dynein-1, induces large distortions in the microtubule cross-sectional curvature. This raises the possibility that dynein coordination in axonemes is mediated via conformational changes in the microtubule.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/46902</link>
	<content:encoded>To ensure proper segregation during mitosis, chromosomes must be efficiently captured by spindle microtubules and subsequently aligned on the mitotic spindle. The efficacy of chromosome interaction with the spindle can be influenced by how widely chromosomes are scattered in space. Here, we quantify chromosome-scattering volume (CSV) and find that it is reduced soon after nuclear envelope breakdown (NEBD) in human cells. The CSV reduction occurs primarily independently of microtubules and is therefore not an outcome of interactions between chromosomes and the spindle. We find that, prior to NEBD, an acto-myosin network is assembled in a LINC complex-dependent manner on the cytoplasmic surface of the nuclear envelope. This acto-myosin network remains on nuclear envelope remnants soon after NEBD, and its myosin-II-mediated contraction reduces CSV and facilitates timely chromosome congression and correct segregation. Thus we find a novel mechanism that positions chromosomes in early mitosis to ensure efficient and correct chromosome-spindle interactions.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/46883</link>
	<content:encoded>Intrinsically disordered regions make up a large part of the proteome, but the sequence-to-function relationship in these regions is poorly understood, in part because the primary amino acid sequences of these regions are poorly conserved in alignments. Here we use an evolutionary approach to detect molecular features that are preserved in the amino acid sequences of orthologous intrinsically disordered regions. We find that most disordered regions contain multiple molecular features that are preserved, and we define these as 'evolutionary signatures' of disordered regions. We demonstrate that intrinsically disordered regions with similar evolutionary signatures can rescue function &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;, and that groups of intrinsically disordered regions with similar evolutionary signatures are strongly enriched for functional annotations and phenotypes. We propose that evolutionary signatures can be used to predict function for many disordered regions from their amino acid sequences.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/46839</link>
	<content:encoded>Serotonin plays different roles across networks within the same sensory modality. Previously, we used whole-cell electrophysiology in &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; to show that serotonergic neurons innervating the first olfactory relay are inhibited by odorants (Zhang and Gaudry, 2016). Here we show that network-spanning serotonergic neurons segregate information about stimulus features, odor intensity and identity, by using opposing coding schemes in different olfactory neuropil. A pair of serotonergic neurons (the CSDns) innervate the antennal lobe and lateral horn, which are first and second order neuropils. CSDn processes in the antennal lobe are inhibited by odors in an identity independent manner. In the lateral horn, CSDn processes are excited in an odor identity dependent manner. Using functional imaging, modeling, and EM reconstruction, we demonstrate that antennal lobe derived inhibition arises from local GABAergic inputs and acts as a means of gain control on branch specific inputs that the CSDns receive within the lateral horn.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: latest articles: Choice history biases subsequent evidence accumulation</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/46331</link>
	<content:encoded>Perceptual choices depend not only on the current sensory input but also on the behavioral context, such as the history of one’s own choices. Yet, it remains unknown how such history signals shape the dynamics of later decision formation. In models of decision formation, it is commonly assumed that choice history shifts the starting point of accumulation toward the bound reflecting the previous choice. We here present results that challenge this idea. We fit bounded-accumulation decision models to human perceptual choice data, and estimated bias parameters that depended on observers’ previous choices. Across multiple task protocols and sensory modalities, individual history biases in overt behavior were consistently explained by a history-dependent change in the evidence accumulation, rather than in its starting point. Choice history signals thus seem to bias the interpretation of current sensory input, akin to shifting endogenous attention toward (or away from) the previously selected interpretation.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: latest articles: Positive and negative incentive contrasts lead to relative value perception in ants</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/45450</link>
	<content:encoded>Humans usually assess things not according to their absolute value, but relative to reference points – a main tenant of Prospect Theory. For example, people rate a new salary relative to previous salaries and salaries of their peers, rather than absolute income. We demonstrate a similar effect in an insect: ants expecting to find low-quality food showed higher acceptance of medium-quality food than ants expecting medium quality, and vice versa for high expectations. Further experiments demonstrate that these contrast effects arise from cognitive rather than mere sensory or pre-cognitive perceptual causes. Social information gained inside the nest can also serve as a reference point: the quality of food received from other ants affected the perceived value of food found later. Value judgement is a key element in decision making, and thus relative value perception strongly influences which option is chosen and ultimately how all animals make decisions.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: latest articles: Functional cross-talk between allosteric effects of activating and inhibiting ligands underlies PKM2 regulation</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/45068</link>
	<content:encoded>Several enzymes can simultaneously interact with multiple intracellular metabolites, however, how the allosteric effects of distinct ligands are integrated to coordinately control enzymatic activity remains poorly understood. We addressed this question using, as a model system, the glycolytic enzyme pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2). We show that the PKM2 activator fructose 1,6-bisphosphate (FBP) alone promotes tetramerisation and increases PKM2 activity, but addition of the inhibitor L-phenylalanine (Phe) prevents maximal activation of FBP-bound PKM2 tetramers. We developed a method, AlloHubMat, that uses eigenvalue decomposition of mutual information derived from molecular dynamics trajectories to identify residues that mediate FBP-induced allostery. Experimental mutagenesis of these residues identified PKM2 variants in which activation by FBP remains intact but cannot be attenuated by Phe. Our findings reveal residues involved in FBP-induced allostery that enable the integration of allosteric input from Phe and provide a paradigm for the coordinate regulation of enzymatic activity by simultaneous allosteric inputs.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Adolescence is a common time for initiation of alcohol use and development of alcohol use disorders. The present study investigates neuroanatomical predictors for trajectories of future alcohol use based on a novel voxel-wise whole-brain structural equation modeling framework. In 1814 healthy adolescents of the IMAGEN sample, the Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test (AUDIT) was acquired at three measurement occasions across five years. Based on a two-part latent growth curve model, we conducted whole-brain analyses on structural MRI data at age 14, predicting change in alcohol use score over time. Higher grey-matter volumes in the caudate nucleus and the left cerebellum at age 14 years were predictive of stronger increase in alcohol use score over 5 years. The study is the first to demonstrate the feasibility of running separate voxel-wise structural equation models thereby opening new avenues for data analysis in brain imaging.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/43660</link>
	<content:encoded>Sexual maturation must occur on a controlled developmental schedule. In mammals, Makorin3 (&lt;i&gt;MKRN3&lt;/i&gt;) and the miRNA regulators &lt;i&gt;LIN28A/B&lt;/i&gt; are key regulators of this process, but how they act is unclear. In &lt;i&gt;C. elegans&lt;/i&gt;, sexual maturation of the nervous system includes the functional remodeling of postmitotic neurons and the onset of adult-specific behaviors. Here, we find that the &lt;i&gt;lin-28–let-7&lt;/i&gt; axis (the ‘heterochronic pathway’) determines the timing of these events. Upstream of &lt;i&gt;lin-28&lt;/i&gt;, the Makorin &lt;i&gt;lep-2&lt;/i&gt; and the lncRNA &lt;i&gt;lep-5&lt;/i&gt; regulate maturation cell-autonomously, indicating that distributed clocks, not a central timer, coordinate sexual differentiation of the &lt;i&gt;C. elegans&lt;/i&gt; nervous system. Overexpression of human &lt;i&gt;MKRN3&lt;/i&gt; delays aspects of &lt;i&gt;C. elegans&lt;/i&gt; sexual maturation, suggesting the conservation of Makorin function. These studies reveal roles for a Makorin and a lncRNA in timing of sexual differentiation; moreover, they demonstrate deep conservation of the &lt;i&gt;lin-28–let-7&lt;/i&gt; system in controlling the functional maturation of the nervous system.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Neuroimaging studies show that ventral face-selective regions, including the fusiform face area (FFA) and occipital face area (OFA), preferentially respond to faces presented in the contralateral visual field (VF). In the current study we measured the VF response of the face-selective posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS). Across 3 functional magnetic resonance imaging experiments, participants viewed face videos presented in different parts of the VF. Consistent with prior results, we observed a contralateral VF bias in bilateral FFA, right OFA (rOFA), and bilateral human motion-selective area MT+. Intriguingly, this contralateral VF bias was absent in the bilateral pSTS. We then delivered transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) over right pSTS (rpSTS) and rOFA, while participants matched facial expressions in both hemifields. TMS delivered over the rpSTS disrupted performance in both hemifields, but TMS delivered over the rOFA disrupted performance in the contralateral hemifield only. These converging results demonstrate that the contralateral bias for faces observed in ventral face-selective areas is absent in the pSTS. This difference in VF response is consistent with face processing models proposing 2 functionally distinct pathways. It further suggests that these models should account for differences in interhemispheric connections between the face-selective areas across these 2 pathways.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Down syndrome (DS) is the most common liveborn autosomal chromosomal anomaly and is a major cause of developmental disability. Atypical brain development and the resulting intellectual disability originate during the fetal period. Perinatal interventions to correct such aberrant development are on the horizon in preclinical studies. However, we lack tools to sensitively measure aberrant structural brain development in living human fetuses with DS. In this study, we aimed to develop safe and precise neuroimaging measures to monitor fetal brain development in DS. We measured growth patterns of regional brain structures in 10 fetal brains with DS (29.1 ± 4.2, weeks of gestation, mean ± SD, range 21.7~35.1) and 12 control fetuses (25.2 ± 5.0, range 18.6~33.3) using regional volumetric analysis of fetal brain MRI. All cases with DS had confirmed karyotypes. We performed non-linear regression models to compare fitted regional growth curves between DS and controls. We found decreased growth trajectories of the cortical plate (&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;P&lt;/span&gt; = 0.033), the subcortical parenchyma (&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;P&lt;/span&gt; = 0.010), and the cerebellar hemispheres (&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;P&lt;/span&gt; &amp;lt; 0.0001) in DS compared to controls. This study provides proof of principle that regional volumetric analysis of fetal brain MRI facilitates successful evaluation of brain development in living fetuses with DS.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Da Zhou, Yue Luo, David Dingli, Arne Traulsen&lt;/p&gt;

Many fast renewing tissues are characterized by a hierarchical cellular architecture, with tissue specific stem cells at the root of the cellular hierarchy, differentiating into a whole range of specialized cells. There is increasing evidence that tumors are structured in a very similar way, mirroring the hierarchical structure of the host tissue. In some tissues, differentiated cells can also revert to the stem cell phenotype, which increases the risk that mutant cells lead to long lasting clones in the tissue. However, it is unclear under which circumstances de-differentiating cells will invade a tissue. To address this, we developed mathematical models to investigate how de-differentiation is selected as an adaptive mechanism in the context of cellular hierarchies. We derive thresholds for which de-differentiation is expected to emerge, and it is shown that the selection of de-differentiation is a result of the combination of the properties of cellular hierarchy and de-differentiation patterns. Our results suggest that de-differentiation is most likely to be favored provided stem cells having the largest effective self-renewal rate. Moreover, jumpwise de-differentiation provides a wider range of favorable conditions than stepwise de-differentiation. Finally, the effect of de-differentiation on the redistribution of self-renewal and differentiation probabilities also greatly influences the selection for de-differentiation.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/L8i-4SZ3AJQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Analysis by liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) can identify and quantify thousands of proteins in microgram-level samples, such as those comprised of thousands of cells. This process, however, remains challenging for smaller samples, such as the proteomes of single mammalian cells, because reduced protein levels reduce the number of confidently sequenced peptides. To alleviate this reduction, we developed Data-driven Alignment of Retention Times for IDentification (DART-ID). DART-ID implements principled Bayesian frameworks for global retention time (RT) alignment and for incorporating RT estimates towards improved confidence estimates of peptide-spectrum-matches. When applied to bulk or to single-cell samples, DART-ID increased the number of data points by 30–50% at 1% FDR, and thus decreased missing data. Benchmarks indicate excellent quantification of peptides upgraded by DART-ID and support their utility for quantitative analysis, such as identifying cell types and cell-type specific proteins. The additional datapoints provided by DART-ID boost the statistical power and double the number of proteins identified as differentially abundant in monocytes and T-cells. DART-ID can be applied to diverse experimental designs and is freely available at http://dart-id.slavovlab.net.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/pO3US3FVnoc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aging is the highest risk factor for Parkinson disease (PD). Under physiological conditions, spermidine and spermine experimentally enhance longevity via autophagy induction. Accordingly, we evaluated the ability of each polyamine metabolite to act as an age‐related, diagnostic, and severity‐associated PD biomarker.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Comprehensive metabolome analysis of plasma was performed in Cohort A (controls, n = 45; PD, n = 145), followed by analysis of 7 polyamine metabolites in Cohort B (controls, n = 49; PD, n = 186; progressive supranuclear palsy, n = 19; Alzheimer disease, n = 23). Furthermore, 20 patients with PD who were successively examined within Cohort B were studied using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). Association of each polyamine metabolite with disease severity was assessed according to Hoehn and Yahr stage (H&amp;amp;Y) and Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale motor section (UPDRS‐III). Additionally, the autophagy induction ability of each polyamine metabolite was examined in vitro in various cell lines.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Cohort A, &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;8‐acetylspermidine and &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;‐acetylputrescine levels were significantly and mildly elevated in PD, respectively. In Cohort B, spermine levels and spermine/spermidine ratio were significantly reduced in PD, concomitant with hyperacetylation. Furthermore, &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;1,&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;8‐diacetylspermidine levels had the highest diagnostic value, and correlated with H&amp;amp;Y, UPDRS‐III, and axonal degeneration quantified by DTI. The spermine/spermidine ratio in controls declined with age, but was consistently suppressed in PD. Among polyamine metabolites, spermine was the strongest autophagy inducer, especially in SH‐SY5Y cells. No significant genetic variations in 5 genes encoding enzymes associated with spermine/spermidine metabolism were detected compared with controls.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spermine synthesis and &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;1,&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;8‐diacetylspermidine may respectively be useful diagnostic and severity‐associated biomarkers for PD. ANN NEUROL 2019&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>RSS PAP: Sex differences in cognitive flexibility and resting brain networks in middle-aged marmosets</title>
	<link>http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0154-19.2019v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>ABSTRACT&lt;p&gt;Sex differences in human cognitive performance are well characterized. However, the neural correlates of these differences remain elusive. This issue may be clarified using nonhuman primates, for which sociocultural influences are minimized. We used the marmoset (&lt;i&gt;Callithrix jacchus&lt;/i&gt;) to investigate sex differences in two aspects of executive function: Reversal Learning and Intradimensional/Extradimensional (ID/ED) set shifting. Stress reactivity and motor function were also assessed. In agreement with human literature, females needed more trials than males to acquire the reversals. No sex differences in ED set shifting or motivational measures were observed. The findings suggest enhanced habit formation in females, perhaps due to striatal estrogenic effects. Both sexes showed increased urinary cortisol during social separation stressor, but females showed an earlier increase in cortisol and a greater increase in agitated locomotion, possibly indicating enhanced stress reactivity. Independent of sex, basal cortisol predicted cognitive performance. No sex differences were found in motor performance. Associations between brain networks and reversal learning performance were investigated using resting state fMRI. Resting state functional connectivity analyses revealed sex differences in cognitive networks, with differences in overall neural network metrics and specific regions, including the prefrontal cortex, caudate, putamen, and nucleus accumbens. Correlations between cognitive flexibility and neural connectivity indicate that sex differences in cognitive flexibility are related to sex-dependent patterns of resting brain networks. Overall, our findings reveal sex differences in reversal learning, brain networks, and their relationship in the marmoset, positioning this species as an excellent model to investigate the biological basis of cognitive sex differences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; We examined sex differences in multiple outcomes (cognition, motor function, stress reactivity and resting state functional connectivity) in middle-aged marmosets. We found that female marmosets had poorer reversal learning relative to males. Resting state functional connectivity analyses revealed substantial sex differences in cognitive networks, with differences in both overall neural network metrics and specific regions, including the prefrontal cortex, caudate, putamen, and nucleus accumbens. Sex-dependent correlations between reversal learning and neural connectivity measures indicate that the sex difference in cognitive performance is related to sex-dependent patterns of resting brain networks. Although these data are correlational and cannot determine causal effects, they are consistent with human resting state data, supporting the idea that cognitive sex differences have identifiable intrinsic neural correlates.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia and is responsible for a huge and growing health care burden in the developed and developing world. The polygenic risk score (PRS) approach has shown 75 to 84% prediction accuracy of identifying individuals with AD risk.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this study, we tested the prediction accuracy of AD, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and amyloid deposition risks with PRS, including and excluding &lt;i&gt;APOE&lt;/i&gt; genotypes in a large publicly available dataset with extensive phenotypic data, the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative cohort. Among MCI individuals with amyloid‐positive status, we examined PRS prediction accuracy in those who converted to AD. In addition, we divided polygenic risk score by biological pathways and tested them independently for distinguishing between AD, MCI, and amyloid deposition.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We found that AD and MCI are predicted by both &lt;i&gt;APOE&lt;/i&gt; genotype and PRS (area under the curve [AUC] = 0.82% and 68%, respectively). Amyloid deposition is predicted by &lt;i&gt;APOE&lt;/i&gt; only (AUC = 79%). Further progression to AD of individuals with MCI and amyloid‐positive status is predicted by PRS over and above &lt;i&gt;APOE&lt;/i&gt; (AUC = 67%). In pathway‐specific PRS analyses, the protein–lipid complex has the strongest association with AD and amyloid deposition even when genes in the &lt;i&gt;APOE&lt;/i&gt; region were removed (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.0055 and &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.0079, respectively).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results showed different pattern of &lt;i&gt;APOE&lt;/i&gt; contribution in PRS risk predictions of AD/MCI and amyloid deposition. Our study suggests that &lt;i&gt;APOE&lt;/i&gt; mostly contributes to amyloid accumulation and the PRS affects risk of further conversion to AD. ANN NEUROL 2019&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To identify disease‐causing variants in autosomal recessive axonal polyneuropathy with optic atrophy and provide targeted replacement therapy.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We performed genome‐wide sequencing, homozygosity mapping, and segregation analysis for novel disease‐causing gene discovery. We used circular dichroism to show secondary structure changes and isothermal titration calorimetry to investigate the impact of variants on adenosine triphosphate (ATP) binding. Pathogenicity was further supported by enzymatic assays and mass spectroscopy on recombinant protein, patient‐derived fibroblasts, plasma, and erythrocytes. Response to supplementation was measured with clinical validated rating scales, electrophysiology, and biochemical quantification.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We identified biallelic mutations in &lt;i&gt;PDXK&lt;/i&gt; in 5 individuals from 2 unrelated families with primary axonal polyneuropathy and optic atrophy. The natural history of this disorder suggests that untreated, affected individuals become wheelchair‐bound and blind. We identified conformational rearrangement in the mutant enzyme around the ATP‐binding pocket. Low PDXK ATP binding resulted in decreased erythrocyte PDXK activity and low pyridoxal 5′‐phosphate (PLP) concentrations. We rescued the clinical and biochemical profile with PLP supplementation in 1 family, improvement in power, pain, and fatigue contributing to patients regaining their ability to walk independently during the first year of PLP normalization.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We show that mutations in &lt;i&gt;PDXK&lt;/i&gt; cause autosomal recessive axonal peripheral polyneuropathy leading to disease via reduced PDXK enzymatic activity and low PLP. We show that the biochemical profile can be rescued with PLP supplementation associated with clinical improvement. As B&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; is a cofactor in diverse essential biological pathways, our findings may have direct implications for neuropathies of unknown etiology characterized by reduced PLP levels.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Distinct clinical syndromes have been associated with pathogenic &lt;i&gt;MT‐ATP6&lt;/i&gt; variants. In this cohort study, we identified 125 individuals (60 families) including 88 clinically affected individuals and 37 asymptomatic carriers. Thirty‐one individuals presented with Leigh syndrome and 7 with neuropathy ataxia retinitis pigmentosa. The remaining 50 patients presented with variable nonsyndromic features including ataxia, neuropathy, and learning disability. We confirmed maternal inheritance in 39 families and demonstrated that tissue segregation patterns and phenotypic threshold are variant dependent. Our findings suggest that &lt;i&gt;MT‐ATP6&lt;/i&gt;–related mitochondrial DNA disease is best conceptualized as a mitochondrial disease spectrum disorder and should be routinely included in genetic ataxia and neuropathy gene panels.

Paul Greengard, co-recipient of the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 2000, Vincent Astor Professor and head of the Laboratory of Molecular and Cellular Neuroscience at the Rockefeller University in New York City, died of an apparent heart attack at age 93. Paul will be remembered for his seminal contributions to neuroscience, for pioneering the field of neuronal signal transduction and for training hundreds of neuroscientists. For anyone who knew Paul it will come as no surprise that up until a few hours before his death, Paul was doing what he liked the best: working on a scientific manuscript.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/neuro/rss/current/~4/lVMMcSN8IDQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Neurodegeneration section | New and Recent Articles: Nerve Growth Factor Pathobiology During the Progression of Alzheimer’s Disease</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00533</link>
	<content:encoded>The current review summarizes the pathobiology of nerve growth factor and its cognate receptors during the progression of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Both protein and transcript data indicate that cholinotrophic neuronal dysfunction is related to an imbalance between TrkA-mediated survival signaling and proNGF/p75NTR-mediated pro-apoptotic signaling, which may be related to alteration in the metabolism of NGF. Data indicate a spatiotemporal pattern of degeneration related to the evolution of tau pathology within cholinotrophic neuronal subgroups located within the nucleus basalis of Meynert (nbM). Despite these degenerative events the cholinotrophic system is capable of cellular resilience and/or plasticity during the prodromal (and later stages of the disease. In addition to neurotrophin dysfunction, studies indicate alterations nuclear epigenetic proteins occur within cholinotrophic nbM neurons during the progression of AD, suggesting a mechanism that may underlie changes in transcript expression. Findings suggest that postmortem intraventricular or premortem CSF levels of proNGF mark the onset of MCI and the transition to AD suggesting this proneurotrophin to be a potential biomarker for the progression of MCI. Novel therapeutics to treat NGF dysfunction included NGF gene therapy and the development of small molecule agonists for the high affinity TrkA survival receptor and antagonists against the low affinity p75NTR death receptor for the treatment of AD.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>As a neurodevelopmental disorder with serious lifelong consequences, autism has received considerable attention from neuroscientists and geneticists. We present a hypothesis of mechanisms plausibly affected during brain development in autism, based on neural pathways that are associated with social behavior and connect the prefrontal cortex (PFC) to the basal ganglia (BG). We consider failure of social approach in autism as a special case of imbalance in the fundamental dichotomy between behavioral approach and avoidance.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>The blood–brain barrier (BBB) is an evolutionarily conserved, structural, and functional separation between circulating blood and the central nervous system (CNS). By controlling permeability into and out of the nervous system, the BBB has a critical role in the precise regulation of neural processes. Here, we review recent studies demonstrating that permeability at the BBB is dynamically controlled by circadian rhythms and sleep. An endogenous circadian rhythm in the BBB controls transporter function, regulating permeability across the BBB.</content:encoded>

	<title>RSS PAP: Postnatal Increases in Axonal Conduction Velocity of an Identified Drosophila Interneuron Require Fast Sodium, L-Type Calcium and Shaker Potassium Channels</title>
	<link>http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0181-19.2019v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;During early postnatal life, speed up of signal propagation through many central and peripheral neurons has been associated with an increase in axon diameter or/and myelination. Especially in unmyelinated axons postnatal adjustments of axonal membrane conductances is potentially a third mechanism but solid evidence is lacking. Here we show that axonal action potential conduction velocity in the &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; giant fiber interneuron (GF), that is required for fast long distance signal conduction through the escape circuit, is increased by 80% during the first day of adult life. Genetic manipulations indicate that this postnatal increase in action potential conduction velocity in the unmyelinated GF axon is likely owed to adjustments of ion channel expression or properties rather than axon diameter increases. Specifically, targeted RNAi knockdown of either Para fast voltage-gated sodium, Shaker potassium (&lt;i&gt;Kv1&lt;/i&gt; homologue), or surprisingly, L-type like calcium channels counteracts postnatal increases in GF axonal conduction velocity. By contrast, the calcium-dependent potassium channel Slowpoke (BK) is not essential for postnatal speeding, though it also significantly increases conduction velocity. Therefore, we identified multiple ion channels that function to support fast axonal action potential conduction velocity, but only a subset of these are regulated during early postnatal life to maximize conduction velocity. Despite its large diameter (~ 7µm) and postnatal regulation of multiple ionic conductances, mature GF axonal conduction velocity is still 20-60 times slower than that of vertebrate Aβ sensory axons and α motoneurons, thus unraveling the limits of long range information transfer speed through invertebrate circuits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance statement&lt;/b&gt; An effective mechanism to increase information processing speed through neural circuits is enhancing plasma membrane insulation through optimizing myelination, a means that cannot be capitalized on un-myelinated invertebrate axons. We identify postnatal adjustments of the expression levels of fast sodium, Shaker potassium, and L-type calcium channels as a mechanism to almost double axonal conduction velocity in the &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; giant fiber axon, the core component for long range information transfer through a neural circuit optimized for fast escape responses. However, despite the regulation of multiple ion channels, mature giant fiber axonal conduction velocity still lacks magnitudes of order behind that of myelinated vertebrate fibers, thus hinting to long distance information transfer as a size-constrain in the evolution of invertebrate circuits.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Role of Long Noncoding RNAs and Circular RNAs in Nerve Regeneration</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2019.00165</link>
	<content:encoded>Nerve injuries are a common clinical problem and cause inconvenience in daily life. It is of great importance to get a full understanding of the biological processes and molecular mechanisms underlying nerve injury to find and target specific molecules in nerve regeneration. Numerous studies have shown that noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) participate in diverse biological processes and diseases. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) and circular RNAs (circRNAs) are two major groups of ncRNAs, which attract growing attention. The expression of lncRNAs and circRNAs are altered following nerve injury and are associated with nerve regeneration. This review will give a brief introduction of the origins, characteristics and classifications of lncRNAs and circRNAs. We then summarize the current studies on lncRNAs and circRNAs following peripheral nerve injury and spinal cord injury. Typical lncRNAs and circRNAs are introduced to illustrate the diverse molecular mechanisms. In addition, we also discuss some issues to be addressed in future investigations on lncRNAs and circRNAs.</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Recruitment, Retainment, and Biomarkers of Response; A Pilot Trial of Lithium in Humans With Mild Cognitive Impairment</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2019.00163</link>
	<content:encoded>Lithium has been used for decades to treat Bipolar Disorder. Some of its therapeutic benefits may be through inhibition of Glycogen Synthase Kinase (GSK)-3. Enhanced GSK3 activity associates with development of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), therefore lithium is a currently used therapeutic with potential to be repurposed for prevention of Dementia. An important step towards a clinical trial for AD prevention using lithium is to establish the dose of lithium that blocks GSK3 in Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), a high-risk condition for progression to AD. We investigated volunteer recruitment, retention and tolerance in this population, and assessed biomarkers of GSK3 in MCI compared to control and after lithium treatment.
Recruitment was close to target, with higher than anticipated interest. Drop out was not related to lithium blood concentration. Indeed, 33% of the withdrawals were in the first week of very low dose lithium. Most made it through to the highest dose of lithium with no adverse events. We analysed 18 potential biomarkers of GSK3 biology in rat PBMCs, but only 4 of these gave a robust reproducible baseline signal. The only biomarker that was modified by acute lithium injection in the rat was the inhibitory phosphorylation of Ser9 of GSK3beta (enhanced in PBMCs) and this associated with reduced activity of GSK3beta. In contrast to the rat PBMC preparations the protein quality of the human PBMC preparations was extremely variable. There was no difference between GSK3 biomarkers in MCI and control PBMC preparations and no significant effect of chronic lithium on the robust GSK3 biomarkers, indicating that the dose reached may not be sufficient to modify these markers. 
In summary, the high interest from the MCI population, and the lack of any adverse events, suggest that it would be relatively straightforward and safe to recruit to a larger clinical trial within this dosing regimen. However, it is clear that we will need an improved PBMC isolation process along with more robust, sensitive and validated biomarkers of GSK3 function, in order to use GSK3 pathway regulation in human PBMC preparations as a biomarker of GSK3 inhibitor efficacy, within a clinical trial setting.</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Integrative Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Can Brain Waves Really Tell If a Product Will Be Purchased? Inferring Consumer Preferences From Single-Item Brain Potentials</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnint.2019.00019</link>
	<content:encoded>Recent research has shown that event-related brain potentials (ERPs) recorded while participants view lists of different consumer goods can be modulated by their preferences towards these products. However, it remains largely unknown whether ERP activity specific to a single consumer item can be informative about whether or not this item will be preferred in a shopping context. In this study, we examined whether single-item ERPs could reliably predict consumer preferences towards specific consumer goods. We recorded scalp EEG from 40 participants while they were viewing pictures of consumer goods and we subsequently asked them to indicate their preferences for each of these items. Replicating previous results, we found that ERP activity averaged over the six most preferred products was significantly differentiated from ERP activity averaged across the six least preferred products for three ERP components: The N200, the late positive potential (LPP) and positive slow waves (PSW). We also found that using single-item ERPs to infer behavioural preferences about specific consumer goods led to an overall accuracy of 71%, although this figure varied according to which ERPs were targeted. Later positivities such as the late posterior positivity (LPP) and positive slow waves (PSW) yielded relatively higher predictive accuracy rates than the frontal N200.  Our results suggest that ERPs related to single consumer items can be relatively accurate predictors of behavioural preferences depending on which type of ERP effects are chosen by the researcher, and ultimately on the level of prediction errors that users choose to tolerate.</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Neural Technology section | New and Recent Articles: Group-Level Neural Responses to Service-to-Service Brand Extension</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00676</link>
	<content:encoded>Brand extension is a marketing strategy leveraging well-established brand to promote new offerings provided as goods or service. The previous neurophysiological studies on goods-to-goods brand extension have proposed that categorization and semantic memory processes are involved in brand extension evaluation. However, it is unknown whether these same processes also underlie service-to-service brand extension. The present study, therefore, aims to investigate neural processes in consumers underlying their judgement of service-to-service brand extension. Specifically, we investigated human electroencephalographic responses to extended services that were commonly considered to fit well or badly with parent brand among consumers. For this purpose, we proposed a new stimulus grouping method to find commonly acceptable or unacceptable service extensions. In the experiment, participants reported the acceptability of fifty-six brand extension pairs, consisting of parent brand name (S1) and extended service name (S2). From individual acceptability responses, we assigned each pair to one of the three fit levels: high- (i.e. highly acceptable), low-, and mid-fit. Next, we selected stimuli that received high/low-fit evaluations from a majority of participants (i.e. &amp;gt; 85%) and assigned them to a high/low population-fit group. A comparison of event-related potentials (ERPs) between population-fit groups through a paired t-test showed significant differences in the fronto-central N2 and fronto-parietal P300 amplitudes. We further evaluated inter-subject variability of these ERP components by a decoding analysis that classified N2 and/or P300 amplitudes into a high, or low population-fit class using a support vector machine. Leave-one-subject-out validation revealed classification accuracy of 60.35% with N2 amplitudes, 78.95 % with P300 and 73.68% with both, indicating a relatively high inter-subject variability of N2 but low for P300. This validation showed that fronto-parietal P300 reflected neural processes more consistent across subjects in service-to-service brand extension. We further observed that the left frontal P300 amplitude was increased as fit-level increased across stimuli, indicating a semantic retrieval process to evaluate a semantic link between S1 and S2. Parietal P300 showed a higher amplitude in the high population-fit group, reflecting a similarity-based categorization process. In sum, our results suggest that service-to-service brand extension evaluation may share similar neural processes with goods-to-goods brand extension.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00669</link>
	<content:encoded>In Huntington’s disease (HD), while the ubiquitously expressed mutant Huntingtin (mtHTT) protein primarily compromises striatal and cortical neurons, glia also undergo disease-contributing alterations. Existing HD models using human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) have not extensively characterized the role of mtHTT in patient-derived astrocytes. Here physiologically mature astrocytes are generated from HD patient iPSCs. These human astrocytes exhibit hallmark HD phenotypes that occur in mouse models, including impaired inwards rectifying K+ currents, lengthened spontaneous Ca2+ waves and reduced cell membrane capacitance. HD astrocytes in co-culture provided reduced support for the maturation of iPSC-derived neurons. In addition, neurons exposed to chronic glutamate stimulation are not protected by HD astrocytes. This iPSC-based HD model demonstrates the critical effects of mtHTT on human astrocytes, which not only broadens the understanding of disease susceptibility beyond cortical and striatal neurons but also increases potential drug targets.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00626</link>
	<content:encoded>Animal behavior is the final and integrated output of brain activity. Thus, recording and analyzing behavior is critical to understand the underlying brain function. While recording animal behavior has become easier than ever with the development of compact and inexpensive devices, detailed behavioral data analysis requires sufficient previous knowledge and/or high content data such as video images of animal postures, which makes it difficult for most of the animal behavioral data to be efficiently analyzed to understand brain function. Here, we report a versatile method using a hybrid supervised/unsupervised machine learning approach to efficiently estimate behavioral states and to extract important behavioral features only from low-content animal trajectory data. As proof of principle experiments, we analyzed trajectory data of worms, fruit flies, rats, and bats in the laboratories, and penguins and flying seabirds in the wild, which were recorded with various methods and span a wide range of spatiotemporal scales—from mm to 1000 km in space and from sub-seconds to days in time. We estimated several states during behavior and comprehensively extracted characteristic features from a behavioral state and/or a specific experimental condition. Physiological and genetic experiments in worms revealed that the extracted behavioral features reflected specific neural or gene activities. Thus, our method provides a versatile and unbiased way to extract behavioral features from simple trajectory data to understand brain function.</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroinformatics | New and Recent Articles: Detection of EEG K-Complexes Using Fractal Dimension of Time Frequency Images Technique Coupled With Undirected Graph Features</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fninf.2019.00045</link>
	<content:encoded>K-complexes identification is a challenging task in sleep research. The detection of k-complexes in electroencephalogram (EEG) signals based on visual inspection is time-consuming, prone to errors, and requires well-trained knowledge. Many existing methods for k-complexes detection rely mainly on analysing EEG signals in time and frequency domains. In this study, an efficient method is proposed to detect k-complexes from EEG signals based on the fractal dimension (FD) of time-frequency (T-F) images coupled with undirected graph features. Firstly, the EEG signal is partitioned into smaller segments using a sliding window technique. Each EEG segment is passed through a spectrogram of short time Fourier transform (STFT) to obtain T-F images. Secondly, the box-counting method is applied to each T-F image to estimate and discover the FDs in EEG signals. A vector of FD features are extracted from each T-F image and then mapped into an undirected graph.  The structural properties of the graphs are used as the representative features of the original EEG signals for the input of a least square support vector machine (LS-SVM) classifier. Key graphic features are extracted from the undirected graphs. The extracted graph features are forwarded to the LS-SVM for classification. To investigate the classification ability of the proposed feature extraction combined with the LS-SVM classifier, the extracted features are also forwarded to a k-means classifier for comparison. The proposed method is compared with several existing k-complexes detection methods in which the same datasets were used. The findings of this study shows that the proposed method yields better classification results than other existing methods in the literature. An average accuracy of 97% for the detection of the k-complexes is obtained using the proposed method. The proposed method could lead to an efficient tool for the scoring of automatic sleep stages which could be useful for doctors and neurologists in the diagnosis and treatment of sleep disorders and for sleep research</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fninf.2019.00044</link>
	<content:encoded>Indentifying lateralization of bilateral temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is a challenging issue, scalp electroencephalography (EEG) and routine band electrocorticography (ECoG) fail to reveal the epileptogenic focus for further temporal lobectomy treatment. HFOs can be utilized as a biomarker for lateralizing the onset zone in suspected bitemporal epilepsy. Except subjective vision detect the HFOs, objective verification should be performed to raising the accuracy. In present research, we prospectively studied 10 patients with refractory temporal seizures and underwent electrocorticography (ECoG) with wide-band frequency amplifiers (2048Hz), all patients had a Class I outcome after temporal resection. Pre- and ictal HFOs will be analyzed by wavelet transform (WT) and Granger causality (GC) for objectively verifying lateralization of seizure onset zone (SOZ). WT analysis showed ictal HFOs in 10 patients mainly covered from 80Hz to 115 Hz (average, 92.59 ± 10.23Hz ), and there was distinct band-pass boundary between pre-ictal HFOs and ictal HFOs. GC analysis showed 5 patients (2, 4, 5, 6, 7), no matter pre-ictal or ictal state, had highest GC degree in SOZ itself. The remaining patients (1, 3, 8, 9, 10) had highest GC degree in SOZ with its adjacent regions in pre-ictal and ictal stage. GC analysis further confirmed the result of WT, and suggested HFOs is initiated and propagated in local brain region mainly, afterwards, transmitting to adjacent brain regions. These results indicated that combination of WT and GC analysis significantly contribute to accurate lateralizing patients with suspected bitemporal epilepsy.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2019.00041</link>
	<content:encoded>Time is a continuous, homogeneous, one-way and independent signal that cannot be modified by human will. Nearly 2,500 ago, Aristotle contended that, “time is the most unknown of all unknown things.” However, both humans and other animals have the ability to perceive time, and it is extremely easy to reproduce the time interval between two consecutive events. This ability to sense time is the basis of many normal cognitive activities, such as listening, speaking, and motion control. Although we constantly use our ability to perceive time, we do not know how our brain processes it. At present, time processing is generally divided into three categories: millisecond scale processing, second scale processing, and circadian rhythms. Different time processing scales correspond to different time processing mechanisms. The millisecond-scale processing range we have studied has a great effect on human perception and motion processing. This paper presents a model that uses spike neuron to construct a complete circuit for temporal processing. By combining the time-adaptive drift-diffusion model (TDDMs) with the transmission of impulse information between neurons, this new model is able to successfully reproduce the synchronization-continuation tapping task (SCT) experiments results. We also discovered that the neurons we used exhibited some of the firing properties of the time-related neurons detected by electrophysiological experiments. Therefore we believe that our model is closer to the neural circuit in the biological brain and can explain some of the phenomena in the temporal perception process.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2019.00288</link>
	<content:encoded>The successful introduction of innovative treatment strategies into clinical practice strongly depends on the availability of effective experimental models and their reliable pre-clinical assessment. Considering pre-clinical research for peripheral nerve repair and reconstruction, the far most used nerve regeneration model in the last decades is the sciatic nerve injury and repair model. More recently, the use of the median nerve injury and repair model has gained increasing attention due to some significant advantages it provides compared to sciatic nerve injury. Outstanding advantages are the availability of reliable behavioural tests for assessing posttraumatic voluntary motor recovery and a much lower impact on the animal wellbeing. In this article, the potential application of the median nerve injury and repair model in pre-clinical research is reviewed. In addition, we provide a synthetic overview of a variety of methods that can be applied in this model for nerve regeneration assessment. This article is aimed at helping researchers in adequately adopting this in vivo model for pre-clinical evaluation of peripheral nerve reconstruction as well as for interpreting the results in a translational perspective.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2019.00287</link>
	<content:encoded>Opioids play a major role at descending pain modulation but the effects of neuropathic pain on the brain opioidergic system remain understudied. Since descending facilitation is enhanced during neuropathic pain, we studied the opioidergic modulation of the dorsal reticular nucleus (DRt), a medullary pain facilitatory area, in the spared nerve injury (SNI) model of neuropathic pain. We first performed a series of behavioral experiments in naïve-animals to establish the role of MOR in the effects of endogenous and exogenous opioids at the DRt. Specifically, we showed that lentiviral-mediated MOR-knockdown at the DRt increased sensitivity to thermal and mechanical stimuli while the MOR agonist DAMGO induced the opposite effects. Additionally, we showed that MOR-knock down and the pharmacological blockade of MOR by CATP at the DRt decreased and inhibited, respectively, the analgesic effects of systemic morphine. Then, we performed in vivo microdialysis to measure enkephalin peptides in the DRt and evaluated mu-opioid receptor (MOR) expression in the DRt at mRNA, protein and phosphorylated form levels by quantitative real-time PCR and immunohistochemistry, respectively. SNI-animals, compared to sham control, showed higher levels of enkephalin peptides, lower MOR-labelled cells without alterations in MOR mRNA levels, and higher phosphorylated MOR-labeled cells. Finally, we performed behavioral studies in SNI animals to determine the potency of systemic morphine and the effects of the pharmacologic and genetic manipulation of MOR at the DRt. We showed a reduced potency of the antiallodynic effects of systemic morphine in SNI-animals compared to the antinociceptive effects in sham animals. Increasing MOR-cells at the DRt of SNI-animals by lentiviral-mediated MOR-overexpression produced no effects on mechanical allodynia. DAMGO induced antiallodynia only after MOR-overexpression. These results show that MOR inhibits DRt pain facilitatory actions and that this action contributes to the analgesic effects of systemic opioids. We further show that the inhibitory function of MOR is impaired during neuropathic pain. This is likely due to desensitization and degradation of MOR which are adaptations of the receptor that can be triggered by MOR phosphorylation. Skipping counter-regulatory pathways involved in MOR adaptations might restore the opioidergic inhibition at pain facilitatory areas.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2019.00282</link>
	<content:encoded>Pericytes are multi-functional cells embedded within the walls of capillaries throughout the body, including the brain. Pericytes were first identified in the 1870s, but little attention was paid to them during the following century. More recently, numerous vascular functions of pericytes have been identified including regulation of cerebral blood flow, maintenance of the blood-brain barrier, and control of vascular development and angiogenesis. Pericytes can also facilitate neuroinflammatory processes and possess stem cell-like properties. Pericytes form part of the neurovascular unit, a collection of cells that control interactions between neurons and the cerebral vasculature to meet the energy demands of the brain. Pericyte structure, expression profile, and function in the brain differ depending on their location along the vascular bed. Until recently, it has been difficult to accurately define the sub-types of pericytes, or to specifically target pericytes with pharmaceutical agents, but emerging techniques both in vitro and in vivo will improve investigation of pericytes and allow for the identification of their possible roles in diseases. Pericyte dysfunction is increasingly recognized as a contributor to the progression of vascular diseases such as stroke and neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease. The therapeutic potential of pericytes to repair cerebral blood vessels and promote angiogenesis due to their ability to behave like stem cells has recently been brought to light. Here, we review the history of pericyte research, the present techniques used to study pericytes in the brain, and current research advancements to characterize and therapeutically target pericytes in the future.</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: A Novel Experimental Model to Determine the Axon-Promoting Effects of Grafted Cells After Peripheral Nerve Injury</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2019.00280</link>
	<content:encoded>Although peripheral nerves can regenerate, clinical outcomes after peripheral nerve injuries are not always satisfactory, especially in cases of severe or proximal injuries. Further, autologous nerve grafting remains the gold standard for the reconstruction of peripheral nerves, although this method is still accompanied by issues of donor-site morbidity and limited supply. Cell therapy is a potential approach to overcome these issues. However, the optimal cell type for promoting axon regeneration remains unknown. Here, we report a novel experimental model dedicated to elucidation of the axon-promoting effects of candidate cell types using simple and standardized techniques. This model uses rat sciatic nerves and consists of a 25 mm-long acellular region and a crush site at each end. The acellular region was made by repeated freeze/thaw procedures with liquid nitrogen. Importantly, the new model does not require microsurgical procedures, which are technically demanding and greatly affect axon regeneration. To test the actual utility of this model, red fluorescent protein-expressing syngeneic Schwann cells (SCs), marrow stromal cells, or fibroblasts were grafted into the acellular area, followed by perfusion of the rat 2 weeks later. All types of grafted cells survived well. Quantification of regenerating axons demonstrated that SCs, but not the other cell types, promoted axon regeneration with minimum variability. Thus, this model is useful for differentiating the effects of various grafted cell types in axon regeneration. Interestingly, regardless of the grafted cell type, host SCs migrated into the acellular area, and the extent of axon regeneration was strongly correlated with the number of SCs. Moreover, all regenerating axons were closely associated with SCs. These findings suggest a critical role for SCs in peripheral nerve axon regeneration. Collectively, this novel experimental model is useful for elucidating the axon-promoting effects of grafted cells and for analyzing the biology of peripheral nerve axon regeneration.</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Glutaminase C Regulates Microglial Activation and Pro-inflammatory Exosome Release: Relevance to the Pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s Disease</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2019.00264</link>
	<content:encoded>Microglia activation is a key pathogenic process at the onset of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Identifying regulators of microglia activation bears great potential in elucidating causes and mechanisms of AD and determining candidates for early intervention. Previous studies demonstrate abnormal elevation of glutaminase C (GAC) in HIV-infected or immune-activated microglia. However, whether GAC elevation causes microglia activation remains unknown. In this study, we found heightened expression levels of GAC in early AD mouse brain tissues compared with those in control littermates. Investigations on cell types involved revealed that GAC is increased in primary mouse microglia following pro-inflammatory stimulation. To model GAC elevation we overexpressed GAC by plasmid transfection and observed that GAC-overexpression shift the microglial phenotype to a pro-inflammatory state. Treatment with BPTES, a glutaminase inhibitor, reversed LPS-induced microglia activation and inflammation. Furthermore, we discovered that GAC overexpression in mouse microglia increased exosome release and changed exosome content, which includes specific packaging of pro-inflammatory miRNAs that activate microglia. Together, our results demonstrate a causal effect of GAC elevation on microglia activation and exosome release, which promote the establishment of pro-inflammatory environment. Therefore, GAC may serve as a promising candidate for early diagnosis and intervention of AD.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2019.00170</link>
	<content:encoded>The aim of this review is to summarize the effect of human intestinal microbiome on cognitive impairments and to focus primarily on the impact of diet and eating habits on learning processes. Better understanding of the microbiome could revolutionize the possibilities of therapy for many diseases. The authors performed a literature review of available studies on the research topic describing influence of human microbiome and diet on cognitive impairment or learning processes found in the world’s acknowledged databases Web of Science, PubMed, Springer, and Scopus. The digestive tube is populated by billions of living microorganisms including viruses, bacteria, protozoa, helminths, and microscopic fungi. In adulthood, under physiological conditions, the intestinal microbiome appears to be relatively steady. However, it is not true that it would not be influenced, both in the positive sense of the word and in the negative one. The basic pillars that maintain a steady microbiome are genetics, lifestyle, diet and eating habits, geography, and age. It is reported that the gastrointestinal tract and the brain communicate with each other through several pathways and one can speak about gut-brain axis. New evidence is published every year about the association of intestinal dysbiosis and neurological/psychiatric diseases. On the other hand, specific diets and eating habits can have positive effect on a balanced microbiota composition and thus contribute to the enhancement of cognitive functions, which are important for any learning process.</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Markers of Novelty Processing in Older Adults Are Stable and Reliable</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2019.00165</link>
	<content:encoded>Exploratory behavior and responsiveness to novelty play an important role in maintaining cognitive function in older adults. Inferences about age- or disease-related differences in neural and behavioral responses to novelty are most often based on results from single experimental testing sessions. There has been very limited research on whether such findings represent stable characteristics of populations studied, which is essential if investigators are to determine the result of interventions aimed at promoting exploratory behaviors or draw appropriate conclusions about differences in the processing of novelty across diverse clinical groups. The goal of the current study was to investigate the short-term test-retest reliability of event-related potential (ERP) and behavioral responses to novel stimuli in cognitively normal older adults. ERPs and viewing durations were recorded in 70 healthy older adults participating in a subject-controlled visual novelty oddball task during two sessions occurring seven weeks apart. Mean midline P3 amplitude and latency, mean midline amplitude during successive 50ms intervals, temporospatial factors derived from principal component analysis, and viewing duration in response to novel stimuli were measured during each session.  ANOVAs revealed no reliable differences in the value of any measurements between time 1 and 2. Intraclass correlations (ICCs) between time 1 and 2 were excellent for mean P3 amplitude (ICC = .86), the temporospatial factors consistent with the P3 components (ICC of .88 and .76 respectively) and viewing duration of novel stimuli (ICC=.81). Reliability was only fair for P3 peak latency (ICC=.56). Successive 50ms mean amplitude measures from 100-1000ms yielded fair to excellent reliabilities, and all but one of the 12 temporospatial factors identified demonstrated ICCs in the good to excellent range. We conclude that older adults demonstrate substantial stability in ERP and behavioral responses to novel visual stimuli over a seven-week period. These results suggest that older adults may have a characteristic way of processing novelty that appears resistant to transient changes in their environment or internal states, which can be indexed during a single testing session. The establishment of reliable measures of novelty processing will allow investigators to determine whether proposed interventions have an impact on this important aspect of behavior.</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Long Term Cosmetic Application Improves Tactile Discrimination in the Elderly; a New Psychophysical Approach</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2019.00164</link>
	<content:encoded>Introduction: Tactile sensitivity is impaired in older adults, which contributes to the loss of manual dexterity and mobility function. The reliability of classical psychophysical tests, such as two-point gap discrimination, has been questioned. Here we tested a new method to determine tactile acuity during dynamic touch, which is more functional than static touch. The aim was to validate a method providing a high level of discrimination of tactile acuity in the elderly.
Methods: We tested the ability of subjects to evaluating the distance between bands printed on poly-methyl-methacrylate sheets. Pairs of sheets were compared in two groups of participants aged from 60 to 74 years; the test group was required to apply a cosmetic foam with an active ingredient on both their hands twice a day for one month, the control group had an identical task, but used the same cosmetic foam without any active ingredient. The tests were run in a double-blind, placebo-controlled study. 
Results: The tactile discrimination threshold decreased by 83 µm after one month of cosmetic application in the group using the active ingredient while it was unchanged in the control group. 
Discussion: The test presented here provided highly accurate results and should be useful to determine tactile performance. It allows the monitoring of tactile rehabilitation and/or skin treatments used to restore tactile acuity in the elderly.</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Gray Matter Densities in Limbic Areas and APOE4 Independently Predict Cognitive Decline in Normal Brain Aging</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2019.00157</link>
	<content:encoded>Cross-sectional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies reported significant associations between gray matter (GM) density changes in various limbic and neocortical areas and worst cognitive performances in elderly controls. Longitudinal studies in this field remain scarce and led to conflicting data. We report a clinico-radiological investigation of 380 cognitively preserved individuals who undergo neuropsychological assessment at baseline and after 18 months. All cases were assessed using a continuous cognitive score taking into account the global evolution of neuropsychological performances. The vast majority of Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) 29 and 30 cases showed equal or worst performance at follow-up due to a ceiling effect. GM densities, white matter hyperintensities and arterial spin labeling (ASL) values were assessed in the hippocampus, amygdala, mesial temporal and parietal cortex at inclusion using 3 Tesla MRI Scans. Florbetapir positron emission tomography (PET) amyloid was available in a representative subsample of 64 cases. Regional amyloid uptake ratios (SUVr), mean cortical SUVr values (mcSUVr) and corresponding z-scores were calculated. Linear regression models were built to explore the association between the continuous cognitive score and imaging variables. The presence of an APOE-ε4 allele was negatively related to the continuous cognitive score. Among the areas studied, significant associations were found between GM densities in the hippocampus and amygdala but not mesial temporal and parietal areas and continuous cognitive score. Neither ASL values, Fazekas score nor mean and regional PET amyloid load were related to the cognitive score. In multivariate models, the presence of APOE-ε4 allele and GM densities in the hippocampus and amygdala were independently associated with worst cognitive evolution at follow-up. Our data support the idea that early GM damage in the hippocampus and amygdala occur long before the emergence of the very first signs of cognitive failure in brain aging.</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Executive Functioning, Muscle Power and Reactive Balance Are Major Contributors to Gait Adaptability in People With Parkinson’s Disease</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2019.00154</link>
	<content:encoded>BACKGROUND AND AIM: The ability to adapt gait when negotiating unexpected hazards is crucial to maintain stability and avoid falling. This study investigated cognitive, physical and psychological factors associated with gait adaptability required for obstacle and stepping target negotiation in people with Parkinson’s disease (PD).
METHODS: Fifty-four people with PD were instructed to either (a) avoid an obstacle at usual step distance or (b) step onto a target at either a short or long step distance projected on a walkway two heel strikes ahead and then continue walking. Participants also completed clinical (Hoehn and Yahr rating scale; Movement Disorders Society version of the Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale motor section [MDS-UPDRS-III]), cognitive (simple reaction time, Trail Making and Stroop stepping [difference between incongruent and standard choice stepping reaction time] tests), physical (hip abductor muscle power and reactive balance [pull test from the MDS-UPDRS-III]) and psychological (Fall Efficacy Scale–International) assessments.
RESULTS: Discriminant function analysis revealed Stroop stepping test (inhibitory control) performance was the best predictor of stepping errors across the gait adaptability test conditions. Poorer executive function (Trail Making test) and reactive balance predicted poorer stepping accuracy in the short target condition; poorer reactive balance predicted increased number of steps taken to approach the obstacle and the long target; and poorer executive function predicted obstacle avoidance. Weaker hip abductor muscle power, poorer reactive balance, slower reaction time, poorer executive function and higher concern about falling were significant predictors of shorter step length while negotiating the obstacle/targets.
CONCLUSIONS: Superior executive function, effective reactive balance and good muscle power were associated with successful gait adaptability. Executive function and reactive balance appear particularly important for precise foot placements; and cognitive capacity for step length adjustments for avoiding obstacles. These findings suggest that impaired inhibitory control contributes to stepping errors and may increase fall risk in people with PD. These findings help elucidate mechanisms for why people with PD fall and may facilitate fall risk assessments and fall prevention strategies for this group.</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Altered Static and Temporal Dynamic Amplitude of Low-Frequency Fluctuations in the Background Network During Working Memory States in Mild Cognitive Impairment</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2019.00152</link>
	<content:encoded>Previous studies investigating working memory performance in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) have mainly focused on the neural mechanisms of alterations in activation. To date, very few studies have investigated background network alterations in the working memory state. Therefore, the present study investigated the static and temporal dynamic changes in the background network in MCI patients during a working memory task.
A hybrid delayed-match-to-sample task was used to examine working memory performance in MCI patients. Functional magnetic resonance imaging data were collected and the marker of amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFF) was used to investigate alterations in the background network.
The present study demonstrated static and dynamic alterations of ALFF in MCI patients during working memory tasks, relative to the resting state. Traditional static analysis revealed that ALFF decreased in the right ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC), right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), and left supplementary motor area for normal controls (NCs) in the working memory state. However, the same regions showed increased ALFF in MCI patients. Furthermore, relative to NCs, MCI patients demonstrated altered performance-related functional connectivity (FC) patterns, with the right VLPFC and right DLPFC as ROIs. In terms of temporal dynamic analysis, the present study found that in the working memory state dynamic ALFF of bilateral thalamus regions was increased in NCs but decreased in MCI patients. Additionally, MCI patients demonstrated altered performance-related coefficient of variation patterns; the regions in MCI patients were larger, and more widely distributed in the parietal and temporal lobes, relative to NCs.
This is the first study to examine static and temporal dynamic alterations of ALFF in the background network of MCI patients in working memory states. The results extend previous studies by providing a new perspective on the neural mechanisms of working memory deficits in MCI patients.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;A large amount of brain imaging research has focused on group studies delineating differences between males and females with respect to both cognitive performance as well as structural and functional brain organization. To supplement existing findings, the present study employed a machine learning approach to assess how accurately participants’ sex can be classified based on spatially specific resting state (RS) brain connectivity, using 2 samples from the Human Connectome Project (&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;n&lt;/span&gt;1 = 434, &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;n&lt;/span&gt;2 = 310) and 1 fully independent sample from the 1000BRAINS study (&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;n&lt;/span&gt; = 941). The classifier, which was trained on 1 sample and tested on the other 2, was able to reliably classify sex, both within sample and across independent samples, differing both with respect to imaging parameters and sample characteristics. Brain regions displaying highest sex classification accuracies were mainly located along the cingulate cortex, medial and lateral frontal cortex, temporoparietal regions, insula, and precuneus. These areas were stable across samples and match well with previously described sex differences in functional brain organization. While our data show a clear link between sex and regionally specific brain connectivity, they do not support a clear-cut dimorphism in functional brain organization that is driven by sex alone.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

To make good judgments people gather information. An important problem an agent needs to solve is when to continue sampling data and when to stop gathering evidence. We examine whether and how the desire to hold a certain belief influences the amount of information participants require to form that belief. Participants completed a sequential sampling task in which they were incentivized to accurately judge whether they were in a desirable state, which was associated with greater rewards than losses, or an undesirable state, which was associated with greater losses than rewards. While one state was better than the other, participants had no control over which they were in, and to maximize rewards they had to maximize accuracy. Results show that participants’ judgments were biased towards believing they were in the desirable state. They required a smaller proportion of supporting evidence to reach that conclusion and ceased gathering samples earlier when reaching the desirable conclusion. The findings were replicated in an additional sample of participants. To examine how this behavior was generated we modeled the data using a drift-diffusion model. This enabled us to assess two potential mechanisms which could be underlying the behavior: (i) a valence-dependent response bias and/or (ii) a valence-dependent process bias. We found that a valence-dependent model, with both a response bias and a process bias, fit the data better than a range of other alternatives, including valence-independent models and models with only a response or process bias. Moreover, the valence-dependent model provided better out-of-sample prediction accuracy than the valence-independent model. Our results provide an account for how the motivation to hold a certain belief decreases the need for supporting evidence. The findings also highlight the advantage of incorporating valence into evidence accumulation models to better explain and predict behavior.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Cl8U-dis_gE&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Ecologists have been compiling ecological networks for over a century, detailing the interactions between species in a variety of ecosystems. To this end, they have built networks for mutualistic (e.g., pollination, seed dispersal) as well as antagonistic (e.g., herbivory, parasitism) interactions. The type of interaction being represented is believed to be reflected in the structure of the network, which would differ substantially between mutualistic and antagonistic networks. Here, we put this notion to the test by attempting to determine the type of interaction represented in a network based solely on its structure. We find that, although it is easy to separate different kinds of nonecological networks, ecological networks display much structural variation, making it difficult to distinguish between mutualistic and antagonistic interactions. We therefore frame the problem as a challenge for the community of scientists interested in computational biology and machine learning. We discuss the features a good solution to this problem should possess and the obstacles that need to be overcome to achieve this goal.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/jFX_1UQ6w0A&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Emerging RNA-based approaches to disease detection and gene therapy require RNA sequences that fold into specific base-pairing patterns, but computational algorithms generally remain inadequate for these secondary structure design tasks. The Eterna project has crowdsourced RNA design to human video game players in the form of puzzles that reach extraordinary difficulty. Here, we demonstrate that Eterna participants’ moves and strategies can be leveraged to improve automated computational RNA design. We present an eternamoves-large repository consisting of 1.8 million of player moves on 12 of the most-played Eterna puzzles as well as an eternamoves-select repository of 30,477 moves from the top 72 players on a select set of more advanced puzzles. On eternamoves-select, we present a multilayer convolutional neural network (CNN) EternaBrain that achieves test accuracies of 51% and 34% in base prediction and location prediction, respectively, suggesting that top players’ moves are partially stereotyped. Pipelining this CNN’s move predictions with single-action-playout (SAP) of six strategies compiled by human players solves 61 out of 100 independent puzzles in the Eterna100 benchmark. EternaBrain-SAP outperforms previously published RNA design algorithms and achieves similar or better performance than a newer generation of deep learning methods, while being largely orthogonal to these other methods. Our study provides useful lessons for future efforts to achieve human-competitive performance with automated RNA design algorithms.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/eVwsgg3j8ts&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Given the highly dynamic and complex nature of the human gut microbial community, the ability to identify and predict time-dependent compositional patterns of microbes is crucial to our understanding of the structure and functions of this ecosystem. One factor that could affect such time-dependent patterns is microbial interactions, wherein community composition at a given time point affects the microbial composition at a later time point. However, the field has not yet settled on the degree of this effect. Specifically, it has been recently suggested that only a minority of taxa depend on the microbial composition in earlier times. To address the issue of identifying and predicting temporal microbial patterns we developed a new model, &lt;i&gt;MTV-LMM&lt;/i&gt; (Microbial Temporal Variability Linear Mixed Model), a linear mixed model for the prediction of microbial community temporal dynamics. &lt;i&gt;MTV-LMM&lt;/i&gt; can identify time-dependent microbes (i.e., microbes whose abundance can be predicted based on the previous microbial composition) in longitudinal studies, which can then be used to analyze the trajectory of the microbiome over time. We evaluated the performance of &lt;i&gt;MTV-LMM&lt;/i&gt; on real and synthetic time series datasets, and found that &lt;i&gt;MTV-LMM&lt;/i&gt; outperforms commonly used methods for microbiome time series modeling. Particularly, we demonstrate that the effect of the microbial composition in previous time points on the abundance of taxa at later time points is underestimated by a factor of at least 10 when applying previous approaches. Using &lt;i&gt;MTV-LMM&lt;/i&gt;, we demonstrate that a considerable portion of the human gut microbiome, both in infants and adults, has a significant time-dependent component that can be predicted based on microbiome composition in earlier time points. This suggests that microbiome composition at a given time point is a major factor in defining future microbiome composition and that this phenomenon is considerably more common than previously reported for the human gut microbiome.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/bUNHI71-cmM&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: From trainees to trainers to instructors: Sustainably building a national capacity in bioinformatics training</title>

Demand for training life scientists in bioinformatics skills led to the development of a train-the-trainer collaboration between the European Molecular Biology Laboratory–European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI) and 2 Australian organisations, Bioplatforms Australia and Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) in 2012. The goal of the collaboration was to establish a group of trained instructors who could develop and deliver short bioinformatics courses nationally. A train-the-trainer course introduces instructors to aspects of andragogy and evidence-based learning principles to help them better design, develop, and deliver high-quality training. Since then, both the number of trainers in the network and the course portfolio have grown. Best practises have been developed and shared between the Australian cohort and EMBL-EBI to address common challenges in bioinformatics training. The Australian trainer cohort undertook a train-the-trainer instructor course, again with EMBL-EBI, and subsequently successfully delivered train-the-trainer courses to interested bioinformatics trainers within Australia. We conclude that a train-the-trainer approach can help build national capacity and maintain a critical mass of trained instructors.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/0orNwXygMTY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Supported by recent computational studies, there is increasing evidence that a wide range of neuronal responses can be understood as an emergent property of nonnegative sparse coding (NSC), an efficient population coding scheme based on dimensionality reduction and sparsity constraints. We review evidence that NSC might be employed by sensory areas to efficiently encode external stimulus spaces, by some associative areas to conjunctively represent multiple behaviorally relevant variables, and possibly by the basal ganglia to coordinate movement. In addition, NSC might provide a useful theoretical framework under which to understand the often complex and nonintuitive response properties of neurons in other brain areas. Although NSC might not apply to all brain areas (for example, motor or executive function areas) the success of NSC-based models, especially in sensory areas, warrants further investigation for neural correlates in other regions.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Ju3LoE2aLno&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Augmenting subnetwork inference with information extracted from the scientific literature</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/Xw51dbK6bek/article</link>

Many biological studies involve either (i) manipulating some aspect of a cell or its environment and then simultaneously measuring the effect on thousands of genes, or (ii) systematically manipulating each gene and then measuring the effect on some response of interest. A common challenge that arises in these studies is to explain how genes identified as relevant in the given experiment are organized into a subnetwork that accounts for the response of interest. The task of inferring a subnetwork is typically dependent on the information available in publicly available, structured databases, which suffer from incompleteness. However, a wealth of potentially relevant information resides in the scientific literature, such as information about genes associated with certain concepts of interest, as well as interactions that occur among various biological entities. We contend that by exploiting this information, we can improve the explanatory power and accuracy of subnetwork inference in multiple applications. Here we propose and investigate several ways in which information extracted from the scientific literature can be used to augment subnetwork inference. We show that we can use literature-extracted information to (i) augment the set of entities identified as being relevant in a subnetwork inference task, (ii) augment the set of interactions used in the process, and (iii) support targeted browsing of a large inferred subnetwork by identifying entities and interactions that are closely related to concepts of interest. We use this approach to uncover the pathways involved in interactions between a virus and a host cell, and the pathways that are regulated by a transcription factor associated with breast cancer. Our experimental results demonstrate that these approaches can provide more accurate and more interpretable subnetworks. Integer program code, background network data, and pathfinding code are available at https://github.com/Craven-Biostat-Lab/subnetwork_inference&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Xw51dbK6bek&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

We have now reached the genomics era within medicine; genomics is being used to personalise treatment, make diagnoses, prognoses, and predict adverse outcomes resulting from treatment with certain drugs. Genomic data is now abundant in healthcare, and the newly created profession of clinical bioinformaticians are responsible for its analysis. In the United Kingdom, clinical bioinformaticians are trained within a 3-year programme, integrating a work-based placement with a part-time Master’s degree. As this profession is still developing, trainees can feel isolated from their peers whom are located in other hospitals and can find it difficult to gain the mentorship that they require to complete their training. Building strong networks or communities of practice (CoPs) and allowing sharing of knowledge and experiences is one solution to addressing this isolation. Within the Master’s delivered at the University of Manchester, we have integrated group-centred problem-based learning (PBL) using real clinical case studies worked on during each course unit. This approach is combined with a flipped style of teaching providing access to online content in our Virtual Learning Environment before the course. The face-to-face teaching is used to focus on the application of the students’ knowledge to clinical case studies. In this study, we conducted semistructured interviews with 8 students, spanning 3 cohorts of students. We evaluated the effectiveness of this style of teaching and whether it had contributed to the formation of CoPs between our students. Our findings demonstrated that this style of teaching was preferred by our students to a more traditional lecture-based format and that the problem-based learning approach enabled the formation of CoPs within these cohorts. These CoPs are valuable in the development of this new profession and assist with the production of new guidelines and policies that are helping to professionalise this new group of healthcare scientists.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/hsFq88ds5HU&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: Presymptomatic spinal cord pathology in c9orf72 mutation carriers: A longitudinal neuroimaging study</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25520?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;C9orf72&lt;/i&gt; hexanucleotide repeats expansions account for almost half of familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) cases. Recent imaging studies in asymptomatic &lt;i&gt;C9orf72&lt;/i&gt; carriers have demonstrated cerebral white (WM) and gray matter (GM) degeneration before the age of 40 years. The objective of this study was to characterize cervical spinal cord (SC) changes in asymptomatic &lt;i&gt;C9orf72&lt;/i&gt; hexanucleotide carriers.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seventy‐two asymptomatic individuals were enrolled in a prospective study of first‐degree relatives of ALS and FTD patients carrying the &lt;i&gt;c9orf72&lt;/i&gt; hexanucleotide expansion. Forty of them carried the pathogenic mutation (C9&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;). Each subject underwent quantitative cervical cord imaging. Structural GM and WM metrics and diffusivity parameters were evaluated at baseline and 18 months later. Data were analyzed in C9&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and C9&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; subgroups, and C9&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; subjects were further stratified by age.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At baseline, significant WM atrophy was detected at each cervical vertebral level in C9&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; subjects older than 40 years without associated changes in GM and diffusion tensor imaging parameters. At 18‐month follow‐up, WM atrophy was accompanied by significant corticospinal tract (CST) fractional anisotropy (FA) reductions. Intriguingly, asymptomatic C9&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; subjects older than 40 years with family history of ALS (as opposed to FTD) also exhibited significant CST FA reduction at baseline.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cervical SC imaging detects WM atrophy exclusively in C9&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; subjects older than 40 years, and progressive CST FA reductions can be identified on 18‐month follow‐up. Cervical SC magnetic resonance imaging readily captures presymptomatic pathological changes and disease propagation in &lt;i&gt;c9orf72&lt;/i&gt;‐associated conditions.

These drug-induced epigenetic adaptations mediate enduring changes in brain function which contribute to life-long, drug-related behavioral abnormalities that define addiction. Targeting these epigenetic alterations will enhance our understanding of the biological basis of addiction and might even yield more effective anti-addiction therapies. However, the complexity of the neuroepigenetic landscape makes it difficult to determine which drug-induced epigenetic changes causally contribute to the pathogenic mechanisms of drug addiction. In this review, we highlight the evidence that epigenetic modifications, specifically histone modifications, within key brain reward regions are correlated with addiction. We then discuss the emerging field of locus-specific neuroepigenetic editing, which is a promising method for determining the causal epigenetic molecular mechanisms that drive an addicted state. Such approaches will substantially increase the field’s ability to establish the precise epigenetic mechanisms underlying drug addiction, and could lead to novel treatments for addictive disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded>

Here, we review recent genome-scale chromosome conformation mappings (‘Hi-C’) in developing and adult human and mouse brain. Neural differentiation is associated with widespread remodeling of the chromosomal contact map, reflecting dynamic changes in cell-type-specific gene expression programs, with a massive (estimated 20–50%) net loss of chromosomal contacts that is specific for the neuronal lineage. Hi-C datasets provided an unexpected link between locus-specific abnormal expansion of repeat sequences positioned at the boundaries of self-associating topological chromatin domains, and monogenic neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disease. Furthermore, integrative cell-type-specific Hi-C and transcriptomic analysis uncovered an expanded genomic risk space for sequences conferring liability for schizophrenia and other cognitive disease. We predict that spatial genome exploration will deliver radically new insights into the brain nucleome in health and disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded>

This neurogenesis process requires intricate genetic regulation involving a combination of cell intrinsic transcription factors and extrinsic signaling molecules, and many critical factors have been identified that influence the timing and composition of the developing retina. Adding complexity to the process, over the past decade, a variety of epigenetic regulatory mechanisms have been shown to influence neurogenesis, and these include changes in histone modifications and the chromatin landscape and changes in DNA methylation and hydroxymethylation patterns. This review summarizes recent findings in the genetic and epigenetic regulation of retinal development, with an emphasis on the zebrafish model system, and it outlines future areas of investigation that will continue to push the field forward into the epigenomics era.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2019.00159</link>
	<content:encoded>Spinocerebellar ataxia 3, also known as Machado-Joseph disease (SCA3/MJD), is a rare autosomal-dominant neurodegenerative disease caused by an abnormal expansion of CAG repeats in the ATXN3 gene. In the present study, we performed a global metabolomic analysis to identity pathogenic biochemical pathways and novel biomarkers implicated in SCA3 patients. Metabolic profiling of serum samples from 13 preclinical SCA3 patients, 13 symptomatic SCA3 patients, and 15 healthy controls were mapped using ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry techniques. The symptomatic SCA3 patients showed a metabolic profile significantly distinct from those of the preclinical SCA3 patients and healthy controls. The principal differential metabolites were involved in the amino acid metabolism and fatty acid metabolism pathways. In addition, four candidate serum biomarkers, FFA 16:1 (palmitoleic acid), FFA 18:3 (linolenic acid), L-Proline and L-Tryptophan, were selected to discriminate between symptomatic SCA3 patients and healthy controls by receiver operator curve analysis with area under the curve of 0.979. Our study demonstrates that symptomatic SCA3 patients present distinct metabolic profiles with perturbed amino acid metabolism and fatty acid metabolism, and FFA 16:1, FFA 18:3, L-Proline and L-Tryptophan are identified as potential disease biomarkers.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00673</link>
	<content:encoded>PARK20, an early onset autosomal recessive parkinsonism is due to mutations in the phosphatidylinositol-phosphatase Synaptojanin 1 (Synj1).
We have recently shown that the early endosomal compartments are profoundly altered in PARK20 fibroblasts as well as the endosomal trafficking. Here, we report that PARK20 fibroblasts also display a drastic alteration of the architecture and function of the early secretory compartments. Our results show that the exit machinery from the Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER) and the ER-to-Golgi trafficking are markedly compromised in patient cells. As a consequence, PARK20 fibroblasts accumulate large amounts of cargo proteins within the ER, leading to the induction of ER stress. Interestingly, this stressful state is coupled to the activation of the PERK/eIF2α/ATF4/CHOP pathway of the Unfolded Protein Response (UPR). In addition, PARK20 fibroblasts reveal upregulation of oxidative stress markers and total ROS production with concomitant alteration of the morphology of the mitochondrial network. Interestingly, treatment of PARK20 cells with GSK2606414 (GSK), a specific inhibitor of PERK activity, restores the level of ROS, signalling a direct correlation between ER stress and the induction of oxidative stress in the PARK20 cells. 
All together, these findings suggest that dysfunction of early secretory pathway might contribute to the pathogenesis of the disease.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00648</link>
	<content:encoded>With the increasing use of functional brain network properties as markers of brain disorders, efficient visualisation and evaluation methods have become essential. Eigenvector centrality mapping (ECM) of functional MRI (fMRI) data enables the representation of per-node graph theoretical measures as brain maps. This paper studies the use of centrality dynamics for measuring group differences in imaging studies.

Imaging data were used from a publicly available imaging study, which included resting fMRI data.  After warping the images to a standard space and masking cortical regions, ECM were computed in a sliding window. The dual regression method was used to identify dynamic centrality differences inside well-known resting state networks between gender and age groups.

Gender-related differences were found in the medial and lateral visual, motor, default mode, and executive control RSN, where male subjects had more consistent centrality variations within the network. Age-related differences between the youngest and oldest subjects, based on a median split, were found in the medial visual, executive control and left frontoparietal networks, where younger subjects had more consistent centrality variations within the network.

Our findings show that centrality dynamics can be used to identify between-group functional brain network centrality differences, and that age and gender distributions studies need to be taken into account in functional imaging studies.</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Brain Imaging Methods section | New and Recent Articles: Characterizing Whole Brain Temporal Variation of Functional Connectivity via Zero and First Order Derivatives of Sliding Window Correlations</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00634</link>
	<content:encoded>Brain functional connectivity has been shown to change over time during resting state fMRI experiments. Close examination of temporal changes have revealed a small set of whole-brain connectivity patterns called dynamic states. Dynamic functional network connectivity (dFNC) studies have demonstrated that it is possible to replicate the dynamic states across several resting state experiments. However, estimation of states and their temporal dynamicity still suffers from noisy and imperfect estimations. In regular dFNC implementations, states are estimated by comparing connectivity patterns through the data without considering time, in other words only zero order changes are examined. In this work we propose a method that includes first order variations of dFNC in the searching scheme of dynamic connectivity patterns. Our approach, referred to as temporal variation of functional network connectivity (tvFNC), estimates the derivative of dFNC, and then searches for reoccurring patterns of concurrent dFNC states and their derivatives. The tvFNC method is first validated using a simulated dataset and then applied to a resting-state fMRI sample including healthy controls (HC) and schizophrenia (SZ) patients and compared to the standard dFNC approach. Our dynamic approach reveals extra patterns in the connectivity derivatives complementing the already reported state patterns. State derivatives consist of additional information about increment and decrement of connectivity among brain networks not observed by the original dFNC method. The tvFNC shows more sensitivity than regular dFNC by uncovering additional FNC differences between the HC and SZ groups in each state. In summary, the tvFNC method provides a new and enhanced approach to examine time-varying functional connectivity.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00532</link>
	<content:encoded>Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by the death of both upper and lower motor neurons (MNs) in the brain, brainstem and spinal cord. The neurodegenerative mechanisms leading to MN loss in ALS are not fully understood. Importantly, the reasons why MNs are specifically targeted in this disorder are unclear, when the proteins associated genetically or pathologically with ALS are expressed ubiquitously. Furthermore, MNs themselves are not affected equally; specific MNs subpopulations are more susceptible than others in both animal models and human patient tissues. Corticospinal MNs and lower somatic MNs, which innervate voluntary muscles, degenerate more readily than specific subgroups of lower MNs, which remain resistant to degeneration, reflecting the clinical manifestations of ALS. In this review, we discuss the possible factors intrinsic to MNs that render them uniquely susceptible to neurodegeneration in ALS. We also speculate why some MN subpopulations are more vulnerable than others, focussing on both their molecular and physiological properties. Finally, we review the anatomical network and neuronal microenvironment as determinants of MN subtype vulnerability and hence the progression of ALS.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>This study examined mood enhancement effects from four-week focusing attention (FA) meditation and four-week open monitoring (OM) meditation in an eight-week mindfulness training program designed ¬for ordinary individuals. 40 participants were randomly assigned to a training  or a control group. All participants were asked to perform cognitive tasks and subjective scale tests at three-time points (pre-, mid, and post-tests). Compared with the participants in the control group,  the meditation training group showed significantly decreased anxiety, depression and emotional  rumination scores, significantly increased mindfulness scores, and significantly reduced reaction times for the Stroop task in the incongruent condition. The present study demonstrated that eight-week mindfulness meditation training could effectively enhance the level of mindfulness and improve emotional states. Moreover, FA meditation could partially improve individual levels of mindfulness and effectively improve mood, while OM meditation could further improve individual levels of mindfulness and maintain a positive mood.</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Background Music Dependent Reduction of Aversive Perception and Its Relation to P3 Amplitude Reduction and Increased Heart Rate</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2019.00184</link>
	<content:encoded>Music is commonly used to modify mood and has attracted attention as a potential therapeutic intervention. Despite the well-recognized effects of music on mood, changes in affective perception due to music remain majorly unknown. Here, we examined if the perception of aversive stimuli could be altered by mood-changing background music. Using subjective scoring data from 17 healthy volunteers, we assessed the effect of relaxing background music, busy background music, or no background music conditions on response to aversive white noise stimulation. Interestingly, affective response to the white noise was selectively alleviated, and white noise-related P3 component amplitude was reduced in busy background music. However, affective responses as well as P3 amplitude to reference pure tone stimuli were similar regardless of background music conditions. Interestingly, heart rate increased in busy background music, whereas no increase in heart rate was found in similar distress, no background music condition. These findings suggest that increase in heart rate, which happens during busy background music exposure, can be a reflecting feature of music that ameliorate the affective response to aversive stimuli, possibly through selective reduction in neurophysiological responses.</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: The Stability of Glutamatergic Synapses Is Independent of Activity Level, but Predicted by Synapse Size</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2019.00291</link>
	<content:encoded>Neuronal activity is thought to drive the remodeling of circuits in the mammalian cerebral cortex. However, its precise function in the underlying formation and elimination of glutamatergic synapses has remained controversial. To clarify the role of activity in synapse turnover, we have assessed the effects of inhibition of glutamate release from a sparse subset of cultured hippocampal neurons on synapse turnover. Sustained chemogenetic attenuation of release through presynaptic expression of a designer receptor exclusively activated by designer drugs (DREADD) had no effect on the formation or elimination of glutamatergic synapses. Sparse expression of tetanus neurotoxin light chain (TeNT-LC), a synaptobrevin-cleaving protease that completely abolishes neurotransmitter release, likewise did not lead to changes in the rate of synapse elimination, although it reduced the rate of synapse formation. The stability of active and silenced synapses correlated with measures of synapse size. While not excluding a modulatory role in synapse elimination, our findings show that synaptic activity is neither required for the removal nor the maintenance of glutamatergic synapses between hippocampal neurons. Our results also demonstrate that the stability of glutamatergic synapses scales with their size irrespective of their activity.</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: A Nitric Oxide-Dependent Presynaptic LTP at Glutamatergic Synapses of the PVN Magnocellular Neurosecretory Cells in vitro in Rats</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2019.00283</link>
	<content:encoded>The magnocellular neurosecretory cells (MNCs) of the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN) integrate incoming signals to secrete oxytocin (OT) and vasopressin (VP) from their nerve terminals in the posterior pituitary gland. In the absence of gama-aminobutyric acid A (GABAA) and cannabinoids 1 (CB1) receptor activity, we used whole-cell patch-clamp recording, single-cell reverse transcription-multiplex polymerase chain reaction (SC-RT-mPCR), biocytin histochemistry and pharmacological methods to examine the mechanism of high frequency stimulus (HFS, 100 Hz)-induced long-term potentiation (LTP) at glutamatergic synapses in the  PVN MNCs of juvenile male rats. Our results showed that HFS-induced LTP at glutamatergic synapses was accompanied by a decrease in the paired-pulse ratio (PPR) of the PVN MNCs. In these MNCs, HFS-induced LTP persisted in the presence of a group 1 metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR1) antagonist; however, it was abolished by an N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) receptor blocker. Notably, HFS-induced LTP in the PVN MNCs was completely prevented by a nitric oxide synthase (NOS) inhibitor. The application of an NO donor not only induced the LTP of excitatory glutamatergic inputs in the PVN MNCs, but also occluded the HFS-induced LTP in these MNCs. Moreover, HFS-induced LTP in the PVN MNCs was also abolished by a specific protein kinase A (PKA) inhibitor, KT5720. SC-RT-m-PCR analysis revealed that 64.5% (62/96) of MNCs expressed OT mRNA. Our results indicate that a HFS can induce an NMDA receptor and NO cascades dependent on presynaptic glutamatergic LTP in the PVN MNCs via a PKA signaling pathway.</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Dilated Saliency U-Net for White Matter Hyperintensities Segmentation Using Irregularity Age Map</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2019.00150</link>
	<content:encoded>White matter hyperintensities (WMH) appear as regions of abnormally high signal intensity on T2-weighted magnetic resonance image (MRI) sequences. In particular, WMH have been noteworthy in age-related neuroscience for being a crucial biomarker for all types of dementia and brain aging processes. The automatic WMH segmentation is challenging because of their variable intensity range, size and shape. U-Net tackles this problem through the dense prediction and has shown competitive performances not only on WMH segmentation/detection but also on varied image segmentation tasks. However, its network architecture is highly complex. In this study we propose the use of Saliency U-Net and irregularity age map (IAM) to decrease the U-Net architectural complexity without performance loss. We trained Saliency U-Net using both: a T2-FLAIR MRI sequence and its correspondent IAM. Since IAM guides locating image intensity irregularities, in which WMH are possibly included, in the MRI slice, Saliency U-Net performs better than the original U-Net trained only using T2-FLAIR. The best performance was achieved with fewer parameters and shorter training time. Moreover, the application of dilated convolution enhanced Saliency U-Net by recognising the shape of large WMH more accurately through multi-scale context learning. This network named Dilated Saliency U-Net improved Dice coefficient score to 0.5588 which was the best score among our experimental models, and recorded a relatively good sensitivity of 0.4747 with the shortest training time and the least number of parameters. In conclusion, based on our experimental results, incorporating IAM through Dilated Saliency U-Net resulted an appropriate approach for WMH segmentation.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Subclinical cerebrovascular disease is frequently identified in neuroimaging studies and is thought to play a role in the pathogenesis of cognitive disorders. However, the role of these neuroimaging findings in the context of normal cognitive aging is poorly understood. Identifying the etiologies of different types of lesions may help investigators differentiate between age-related and pathological cerebrovascular damage in cognitive aging. In this review, we aim to describe the epidemiology and etiology of various brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measures of vascular damage in cognitively normal, older adult populations. We focus here on population-based prospective cohort studies of cognitively unimpaired older adults, as well as discuss the heterogeneity of MRI findings and their relationships with cognition. This review emphasizes the need for a better understanding of subclinical cerebrovascular disease in cognitively normal populations, in order to more effectively identify and prevent cognitive decline in our rapidly aging population.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Joshua M. Mueller, Primoz Ravbar, Julie H. Simpson, Jean M. Carlson&lt;/p&gt;

Mathematical modeling of behavioral sequences yields insight into the rules and mechanisms underlying sequence generation. Grooming in &lt;i&gt;Drosophila melanogaster&lt;/i&gt; is characterized by repeated execution of distinct, stereotyped actions in variable order. Experiments demonstrate that, following stimulation by an irritant, grooming progresses gradually from an early phase dominated by anterior cleaning to a later phase with increased walking and posterior cleaning. We also observe that, at an intermediate temporal scale, there is a strong relationship between the amount of time spent performing body-directed grooming actions and leg-directed actions. We then develop a series of data-driven Markov models that isolate and identify the behavioral features governing transitions between individual grooming bouts. We identify action order as the primary driver of probabilistic, but non-random, syntax structure, as has previously been identified. Subsequent models incorporate grooming bout duration, which also contributes significantly to sequence structure. Our results show that, surprisingly, the syntactic rules underlying probabilistic grooming transitions possess action duration-dependent structure, suggesting that sensory input-independent mechanisms guide grooming behavior at short time scales. Finally, the inclusion of a simple rule that modifies grooming transition probabilities over time yields a generative model that recapitulates the key features of observed grooming sequences at several time scales. These discoveries suggest that sensory input guides action selection by modulating internally generated dynamics. Additionally, the discovery of these principles governing grooming in &lt;i&gt;D. melanogaster&lt;/i&gt; demonstrates the utility of incorporating temporal information when characterizing the syntax of behavioral sequences.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/fwAAXXVTVxw&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25522?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recent reports have described single individuals with neurodevelopmental disability (NDD) harboring heterozygous &lt;i&gt;KCNQ3&lt;/i&gt; de novo variants (DNVs). We sought to assess whether pathogenic variants in &lt;i&gt;KCNQ3&lt;/i&gt; cause NDD and to elucidate the associated phenotype and molecular mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patients with NDD and &lt;i&gt;KCNQ3&lt;/i&gt; DNVs were identified through an international collaboration. Phenotypes were characterized by clinical assessment, review of charts, electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings, and parental interview. Functional consequences of variants were analyzed in vitro by patch‐clamp recording.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eleven patients were assessed. They had recurrent heterozygous DNVs in &lt;i&gt;KCNQ3&lt;/i&gt; affecting residues R230 (R230C, R230H, R230S) and R227 (R227Q). All patients exhibited global developmental delay within the first 2 years of life. Most (8/11, 73%) were nonverbal or had a few words only. All patients had autistic features, and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) was diagnosed in 5 of 11 (45%). EEGs performed before 10 years of age revealed frequent sleep‐activated multifocal epileptiform discharges in 8 of 11 (73%). For 6 of 9 (67%) recorded between 1.5 and 6 years of age, spikes became near‐continuous during sleep. Interestingly, most patients (9/11, 82%) did not have seizures, and no patient had seizures in the neonatal period. Voltage‐clamp recordings of the mutant KCNQ3 channels revealed gain‐of‐function (GoF) effects.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Specific GoF variants in &lt;i&gt;KCNQ3&lt;/i&gt; cause NDD, ASD, and abundant sleep‐activated spikes. This new phenotype contrasts both with self‐limited neonatal epilepsy due to &lt;i&gt;KCNQ3&lt;/i&gt; partial loss of function, and with the neonatal or infantile onset epileptic encephalopathies due to &lt;i&gt;KCNQ2&lt;/i&gt; GoF.

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Cholinergic Neurons of the Medial Septum Are Crucial for Sensorimotor Gating</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/26/5234?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Hypofunction of NMDA receptors has been considered a possible cause for the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. More recently, indirect ways to regulate NMDA that would be less disruptive have been proposed and metabotropic glutamate receptor subtype 5 (mGluR5) represents one such candidate. To characterize the cell populations involved, we demonstrated here that knock-out (KO) of mGluR5 in cholinergic, but not glutamatergic or parvalbumin (PV)-positive GABAergic, neurons reduced prepulse inhibition of the startle response (PPI) and enhanced sensitivity to MK801-induced locomotor activity. Inhibition of cholinergic neurons in the medial septum by DREADD (designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs) resulted in reduced PPI further demonstrating the importance of these neurons in sensorimotor gating. Volume imaging and quantification were used to compare PV and cholinergic cell distribution, density, and total cell counts in the different cell-type-specific KO lines. Electrophysiological studies showed reduced NMDA receptor-mediated currents in cholinergic neurons of the medial septum in mGluR5 KO mice. These results obtained from male and female mice indicate that cholinergic neurons in the medial septum represent a key cell type involved in sensorimotor gating and are relevant to pathologies associated with disrupted sensorimotor gating such as schizophrenia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The mechanistic complexity underlying psychiatric disorders remains a major challenge that is hindering the drug discovery process. Here, we generated genetically modified mouse lines to better characterize the involvement of the receptor mGluR5 in the fine-tuning of NMDA receptors, specifically in the context of sensorimotor gating. We evaluated the importance of knocking-out mGluR5 in three different cell types in two brain regions and performed different sets of experiments including behavioral testing and electrophysiological recordings. We demonstrated that cholinergic neurons in the medial septum represent a key cell-type involved in sensorimotor gating. We are proposing that pathologies associated with disrupted sensorimotor gating, such as with schizophrenia, could benefit from further evaluating strategies to modulate specifically cholinergic neurons in the medial septum.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Transcriptional Regulation of Voltage-Gated Sodium Channels Contributes to GM-CSF-Induced Pain</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/26/5222?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) induces the production of granulocyte and macrophage populations from the hematopoietic progenitor cells; it is one of the most common growth factors in the blood. GM-CSF is also involved in bone cancer pain development by regulating tumor–nerve interactions, remodeling of peripheral nerves, and sensitization of damage-sensing (nociceptive) nerves. However, the precise mechanism for GM-CSF-dependent pain is unclear. In this study, we found that GM-CSF is highly expressed in human malignant osteosarcoma. Female Sprague Dawley rats implanted with bone cancer cells develop mechanical and thermal hyperalgesia, but antagonizing GM-CSF in these animals significantly reduced such hypersensitivity. The voltage-gated Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channels Nav1.7, Nav1.8, and Nav1.9 were found to be selectively upregulated in rat DRG neurons treated with GM-CSF, which resulted in enhanced excitability. GM-CSF activated the Janus kinase 2 (Jak2)–signal transducer and activator of transcription protein 3 (Stat3) signaling pathway, which promoted the transcription of Nav1.7–1.9 in DRG neurons. Accordingly, targeted knocking down of either Nav1.7–1.9 or Jak2/Stat3 in DRG neurons &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; alleviated the hyperalgesia in male Sprague Dawley rats. Our findings describe a novel bone cancer pain mechanism and provide a new insight into the physiological and pathological functions of GM-CSF.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; It has been reported that granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) plays a key role in bone cancer pain, yet the underlying mechanisms involved in the GM-CSF-mediated signaling pathway in nociceptors is not fully understood. Here, we showed that GM-CSF promotes bone cancer-associated pain by enhancing the excitability of DRG neurons via the Janus kinase 2 (Jak2)-signal transducer and activator of transcription protein 3 (Stat3)-mediated upregulation of expression of nociceptor-specific voltage-gated sodium channels. Our study provides a detailed understanding of the roles that sodium channels and the Jak2/Stat3 pathway play in the GM-CSF-mediated bone cancer pain; our data also highlight the therapeutic potential of targeting GM-CSF.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Targeting GABAAR-Associated Proteins: New Modulators, Labels and Concepts</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2019.00162</link>
	<content:encoded>γ-aminobutyric acid type A receptors (GABAARs) are the major mediators of synaptic inhibition in the brain. Aberrant GABAAR activity or regulation is observed in various neurodevelopmental disorders, neurodegenerative diseases and mental illnesses, including epilepsy, Alzheimer’s and schizophrenia. Benzodiazepines, anesthetics and other pharmaceutics targeting these receptors find broad clinical use, but their inherent lack of receptor subtype specificity causes unavoidable side effects, raising a need for new or adjuvant medications. In this review we introduce a new strategy to modulate GABAeric signaling: Targeting the intracellular protein interactors of GABAARs. Of special interest are scaffolding, anchoring and supporting proteins that display high GABAAR subtype specificity. Recent efforts to target gephyrin, the major intracellular integrator of GABAergic signaling, confirm that GABAAR-associated proteins can be successfully targeted through diverse molecules, including recombinant proteins, intrabodies, peptide-based probes and small molecules. Small-molecule artemisinins and peptides derived from endogenous interactors, that specifically target the universal receptor binding site of gephyrin, acutely affect synaptic GABAAR numbers and clustering, modifying neuronal transmission. Interference with GABAAR trafficking provides another way to modulate inhibitory signaling. Peptides blocking the binding site of GABAAR to AP2 increase the surface concentration of GABAAR clusters and enhance GABAergic signaling. Engineering of gephyrin binding peptides delivered superior means to interrogate neuronal structure and function. Fluorescent peptides, designed from gephyrin binders, enable live neuronal staining and visualization of gephyrin in the post synaptic sites with nanometer resolution. We anticipate that in the future, novel fluorescent probes, with improved size and binding efficiency, may find wide application in super resolution microscopy studies, enlightening the nanoscale architecture of the inhibitory synapse. Broader studies on GABAAR accessory proteins and the identification of the exact molecular binding interfaces and affinities will advance the development of novel GABAAR modulators and following in-vivo studies will reveal their clinical potential as adjuvant or stand-alone drugs.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2019.00154</link>
	<content:encoded>The diversity of inhibitory interneurons allows for the coordination and modulation of excitatory principal cell firing. Interneurons that release GABA (γ-aminobutyric acid) onto the soma and axon exert powerful control by virtue of proximity to the site of action potential generation at the axon initial segment (AIS). Here we review and examine the cellular and molecular regulation of soma and axon targeting GABAergic synapses in the cortex and hippocampus. We also describe their role in controlling network activity in normal and pathological states. Recent studies have demonstrated a specific role for postsynaptic dystroglycan in the formation and maintenance of cholecystokinin positive basket cell terminals contacting the soma, and postsynaptic collybistin in parvalbumin positive chandelier cell contacts onto the AIS. Unique presynaptic molecular contributors, LGI2 and FGF13, expressed in parvalbumin positive basket cells and chandelier cells respectively, have also recently been identified. Mutations in the genes encoding proteins critical for somatic and AIS inhibitory synapses have been associated with human disorders of the nervous system. Dystroglycan dysfunction in some congenital muscular dystrophies is associated with developmental brain malformations, intellectual disability, and rare epilepsy. Collybistin dysfunction has been linked to hyperekplexia, epilepsy, intellectual disability, and developmental disorders. Both LGI2 and FGF13 mutations are implicated in syndromes with epilepsy as a component. Advancing our understanding of the powerful roles of somatic and axonic GABAergic contacts in controlling activity patterns in the cortex and hippocampus will provide insight into the pathogenesis of neurodevelopmental disorders and epilepsy.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00664</link>
	<content:encoded>Neurogenesis in developing and adult mammalian brain is a tightly regulated process that relies on neural stem cell activity. There is increasing evidence that mitochondrial metabolism affects neural stem cell homeostasis and differentiation but the precise role of mitochondrial function in the neurogenic process requires further investigation. Here, we have analyzed how mitochondrial complex I (MCI) dysfunction affects neural stem cell viability, proliferation and differentiation, as well as survival of the neural progeny. We have generated a conditional knockout model (hGFAP-NDUFS2 mice) in which expression of the NDUFS2 protein, essential for MCI function, is suppressed in cells expressing the Cre recombinase under the human glial fibrillary acidic protein promoter, active in mouse radial glial cells and in neural stem cells that reside in adult neurogenic niches. In this model we observed that survival of central neural stem cell population does not appear to be severely affected by MCI dysfunction. However, perinatal brain development was markedly inhibited and Ndufs2 knockout mice died before the tenth postnatal day. In addition, in vitro studies of subventricular zone neural stem cells showed that active neural progenitors require a functional MCI to produce ATP and to proliferate. In vitro differentiation of neural precursors into neurons and oligodendrocytes was also profoundly affected. These data indicate the need of a correct MCI function and oxidative phosphorylation for glia-like neural stem cell proliferation, differentiation and subsequent oligodendrocyte or neuronal maturation.</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Neurogenesis section | New and Recent Articles: Comparison of Hypnotic Suggestion and Transcranial Direct-Current Stimulation Effects on Pain Perception and the Descending Pain Modulating System: A Crossover Randomized Clinical Trial</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00662</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract 
Objectives: This paper aims to determine if hypnotic suggestion analgesia and transcranial direct-current stimulation (tDCS) have a differential effect on pain perception. We hypothesized that tDCS would be more effective than hypnotic suggestion at changing the descending pain modulating system (DPMS), whereas the hypnotic suggestion would have a greater effect in quantitative sensory testing (QST). 
Design: This research was conducted as a randomized, blind and crossover trial. 
Settings: All the stages of this clinical trial were performed at the Laboratory of Pain and Neuromodulation of the Hospital de Clínicas de Porto Alegre.
Subjects: Were included 24 healthy females aged from 18 to 45 years old, with a high susceptibility to hypnosis, according to the Waterloo-Stanford Group Scale of Hypnotic Susceptibility, Form C (15). 
Methods: The subjects received a random and crossover tDCS over the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) (2mA for 20min) and hypnotic analgesia (20min). 
Results: Only hypnotic suggestion produced changes that are statistically significant from pre- to post-intervention in the following outcomes measures: heat pain threshold (HPT), heat pain tolerance (HPTo), cold pressure test (CPT) and serum brain-derivate-neurotrophic-factor (BDNF). The analysis showed a significant main effect for treatment (F=4.32; P=0.04) when we compared the delta-(Δ) of CPM task between the tDCS and hypnotic suggestion groups. Also, the change in the Δ-BDNF was positively correlated with the CPM task. 
Conclusions: The results confirm a differential effect between hypnotic suggestion and tDCS on the pain measures. They suggest that the impact of the interventions has differential neural mechanisms, since the hypnotic suggestion improved pain perception, whereas the tDCS increased inhibition in the DPMS.

Registration information clinicaltrials.gov: NCT03744897.

Perspective: These findings highlight the effect of hypnotic suggestion on contra-regulating mechanisms involved in pain perception, while the tDCS increased inhibition in the DPMS. They could help clinicians comprehend the mechanisms involved in hypnotic analgesia and tDCS and thus may contribute to pain and disability management.

Keywords: Hypnotic analgesia, tDCS, Pain threshold, CPM, BDNF, Pain.</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Neurodegeneration section | New and Recent Articles: Manganese-Induced Neurotoxicity: New Insights Into the Triad of Protein Misfolding, Mitochondrial Impairment, and Neuroinflammation</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00654</link>
	<content:encoded>Occupational or environmental exposure to manganese (Mn) can lead to the development of “Manganism”, a neurological condition showing certain motor symptoms similar to Parkinson’s disease (PD). Like PD, Mn toxicity is seen in the central nervous system mainly affecting nigrostriatal neuronal circuitry and subsequent behavioral and motor impairments. Since the first report of Mn-induced toxicity in 1837, various experimental and epidemiological studies have been conducted to understand this disorder. While early investigations focused on the impact of high concentrations of Mn on the mitochondria and subsequent oxidative stress, current studies have attempted to elucidate the cellular and molecular pathways involved in Mn toxicity. In fact, recent reports suggest the involvement of Mn in the misfolding of proteins such as α-synuclein and amyloid, thus providing credence to the theory that environmental exposure to toxicants can either initiate or propagate neurodegenerative processes by interfering with disease-specific proteins.  Besides manganism and PD, Mn has also been implicated in other neurological diseases such as Huntington’s and Prion diseases. While many reviews have focused on Mn homeostasis, the aim of this review is to concisely synthesize what we know about its effect primarily on the nervous system with respect to its role in protein misfolding, mitochondrial dysfunction, and consequently, neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration. Based on the current evidence, we propose a ‘Mn Mechanistic Neurotoxic Triad’ comprising 1) mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress, 2) protein trafficking and misfolding, and 3) neuroinflammation.</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Neurodegeneration section | New and Recent Articles: Tau Secretion: Good and Bad for Neurons</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00649</link>
	<content:encoded>In Alzheimer’s disease (AD), neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), lesions composed of hyperphosphorylated and aggregated tau, spread from the transentorhinal cortex to the hippocampal formation and neocortex. Growing evidence indicates that tau pathology propagates trans-synaptically, implying that pathological tau released by pre-synaptic neurons is taken up by post-synaptic neurons where it accumulates and aggregates. Observations such as the presence of tau in the cerebro-spinal fluid (CSF) from control individuals and intyryh the CSF of transgenic mice overexpressing human tau before the detection of neuronal death indicate that tau can be secreted by neurons. The increase of tau in the CSF in pathological conditions such as AD suggests that tau secretion is enhanced and/or other secretory pathways take place when neuronal function is compromised. In physiological conditions, extracellular tau could exert beneficial effects as observed for other cytosolic proteins also released in the extracellular space. In such a case, blocking tau secretion could have negative effects on neurons unless the mechanism of tau secretion are different in physiological and pathological conditions allowing the prevention of pathological tau secretion without affecting the secretion of physiological tau. Furthermore, distinct extracellular tau species could be secreted in physiological and pathological conditions, species having the capacity to induce tau pathology being only secreted in the latter condition. In the present review, we will focus on the mechanisms and function of tau secretion in both physiological and pathological conditions and how this information can help elaborate an efficient therapeutic strategy to prevent tau pathology and its propagation.</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Contribution of the Cerebellum to Predictive Motor Control and Its Evaluation in Ataxic Patients</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2019.00216</link>
	<content:encoded>Goal-directed movements are predictive and multimodal in nature, especially for moving targets. For instance, during a reaching movement for a moving target, humans need to predict both motion of the target and movement of the limb. Recent computational studies show that the cerebellum predicts current and future states of the body and its environment using internal forward models. Sensory feedback signals from the periphery have delays in reaching the central nervous system, ranging between tens to hundreds of milliseconds. It is well known in engineering that feedback control based on time-delayed inputs can result in oscillatory and often unstable movements. In contrast, the brain predicts a current state from a previous state using forward models. This predictive mechanism most likely underpins stable and dexterous control of reaching movements. Although the cerebro-cerebellum has long been suggested as loci of various forward models, few methods are available to evaluate accuracy of the forward models in patients with cerebellar ataxia. Recently, we developed a non-invasive method to analyze receipt of motor commands in terms of movement kinematics for the wrist joint (Br/Kr ratio). In the present study, we have identified two components (F1 and F2) of the smooth pursuit movement. We found that the two components were in different control modes with different Br/Kr ratios. The major F1 component in a lower frequency range encodes both velocity and position of the moving target (higher Br/Kr ratio) to synchronize movement of the wrist joint with motion of the target in a predictive manner. The minor F2 component in a higher frequency range is biased to position control in order to generate intermittent small step-wise movements. In cerebellar patients, the F1 component shows a selective decrease in the Br/Kr ratio, which is correlated with decrease in accuracy of the pursuit movement. We conclude that the Br/Kr ratio of the F1 component provides a unique parameter to evaluate accuracy of the predictive control. We also discuss the pathophysiological and clinical implications for clinical ataxiology.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2019.00186</link>
	<content:encoded>Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a neuropsychiatric illness characterized by obsessions and/or compulsions. Its pathophysiology is still not well understood but it's known that the cortico-striatal-thalamic-cortical (CSTC) circuitry plays an important role. Here we used a multi-method MRI approach combining proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (H1-MRS) and Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) techniques to investigate both the metabolic and the microstructural white matter changes of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) in OCD patients as compared to healthy controls. Twenty-three OCD patients and 21 age, sex, and education matched healthy volunteers participated in the study. Our 1H-MRS findings shows increased levels of Glx in ACC in OCD. Further, significantly lower FA values were observed in OCD patients left cingulate bundle (CB) as compared to healthy controls. Finally, there was a negative correlation between FA in the left CB and level of obsessions, as well as the duration of the illness. Our findings reinforce the involvement of CSTC bundles in pathophysiology of OCD, pointing to a specific role of glutamate (glutamine) and white matter integrity.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2019.00039</link>
	<content:encoded>Sparse coding models of natural images and sounds have been able to predict several response properties of neurons in the visual and auditory systems. While the success of these models suggests that the structure they capture is universal across domains to some degree, it is not yet clear which aspects of this structure are universal and which vary across sensory modalities. To address this, we fit complete and highly overcomplete sparse coding models to natural images and spectrograms of speech and report on differences in the statistics learned by these models. We find several types of sparse features in natural images, which all appear in similar, approximately Laplacian distributions, whereas the many types of sparse features in speech exhibit a broad range of sparse distributions, many of which are highly asymmetric. Moreover, individual sparse coding units tend to exhibit higher lifetime sparseness for overcomplete models trained on images compared to those trained on speech. Conversely, population sparseness tends to be greater for these networks trained on speech compared with sparse coding models of natural images. To illustrate the relevance of these findings to neural coding, we studied how they impact a biologically plausible sparse coding network's representations in each sensory modality. In particular, a sparse coding network with synaptically local plasticity rules learns different sparse features from speech data than are found by more conventional sparse coding algorithms, but the learned features are qualitatively the same for these models when trained on natural images.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2019.00285</link>
	<content:encoded>Noise induces a broad spectrum of pathological injuries to the cochlea, reflecting both mechanical damage to the delicate architecture of the structures of the organ of Corti and metabolic damage within the organ of Corti and lateral wall tissues.  Unlike ototoxic medications, the blood-labyrinth barrier does not offer protection against noise injury.  The blood-labyrinth barrier is a target of noise injury, and can be weakened as part of the metabolic pathologies in the cochlea.  However, it also offers a potential for therapeutic intervention with oto-protective compounds.  Because the blood-labyrinth barrier is weakened by noise, penetration of blood-borne oto-protective compounds could be higher. However, systemic dosing for cochlear protection from noise offers other significant challenges.  An alternative option to systemic dosing is local administration to the cochlea through the round window membrane using a variety of drug delivery techniques.  The review will discuss noise-induced cochlear pathology, including alterations to the blood-labyrinth barrier, and then transition into discussing approaches for delivery of oto-protective compounds to reduce cochlear injury from noise.</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: P2X2 Receptor Expression and Function Is Upregulated in the Rat Supraoptic Nucleus Stimulated Through Refeeding After Fasting</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2019.00284</link>
	<content:encoded>Magnocellular neurons in the supraoptic nucleus (SON), which synthesize and release arginine vasopressin (AVP) and oxytocin (OT), express several subtypes of ATP-stimulated purinergic P2X receptors (P2XR) that modulate neuronal activity as well as neurotransmitter and hormone release. However, the physiological impact of this modulation is not well understood. Here, we tested a hypothesis that P2XRs play a role in the sustained release of hormones from SON neurons stimulated through fasting/refeeding. We studied the effect of 2 h of refeeding after 48 h of fasting on P2XR and P2YR mRNA expression and ATP-induced presynaptic and postsynaptic responses in the SON of 30-day-old rats. Quantitative real-time PCR revealed that the expression of P2X2R and AVP mRNA was upregulated, whereas P2X4R, P2X7R, P2Y2R and OT mRNA levels were not significantly changed and P2Y1R mRNA expression was decreased. Whole-cell patch clamp recordings performed on isolated rat brain slices showed that the amplitude of the ATP-stimulated somatic current and the ATP-induced increases in the frequency of spontaneous GABAergic inhibitory postsynaptic currents were significantly higher in SON neurons from fasted/refed rats than in SON neurons from normally fed rats. No evidence was found for changes in the presynaptic effect of ATP in SON neurons not expressing somatic P2XRs. These results suggest that the increased activity of SON neurons synthesizing AVP is associated with enhanced expression of P2X2Rs on neuronal cell bodies and their GABAergic presynaptic nerve terminals.</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Effect of Autophagy Modulators on Vascular, Glial, and Neuronal Alterations in the Oxygen-Induced Retinopathy Mouse Model</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2019.00279</link>
	<content:encoded>Hypoxia is one of the main insults in proliferative retinopathies, leading to neovascularization and neurodegeneration. To maintain homeostasis, neurons require efficient degradation and recycling systems. Autophagy participates in retinal cell death, but it is also a cell survival mechanism. Here, we analysed the role of autophagy at the three characteristic time periods in the oxygen-induced retinopathy (OIR) mouse model and determined if its modulation can improve vascular and non-vascular alterations. Experiments were performed with chloroquine (CQ) in order to monitor autophagosome accumulation by lysosomal blockade. Postnatal day (P)17 OIR mouse retinas showed a significant increase in autophagy flux. In particular, an intense LC3B and p62 staining was observed in inner layers of the retina, mainly proliferating endothelial cells. After a single intraocular injection of Rapamycin at P12 OIR, a decreased neovascular area and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) protein expression were observed at P17 OIR. In addition, whereas the increased expression of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) was reversed at P26 OIR, the functional alterations persisted. Using a similar therapeutic schedule, we analyzed the effect of anti-VEGF therapy on autophagy flux. Like Rapamycin, VEGF inhibitor treatment not only reduced the amount of neovascular tufts, but also activated autophagy flux at P17 OIR, mainly in ganglion cell layer (GCL) and inner nuclear layer (INL). Finally, the effects of the disruption of autophagy by Spautin-1, were evaluated at vascular, glial and neuronal levels. After a single dose of Spautin-1, Western blot analysis showed a significant decrease in LC3B II and p62 protein expression at P13 OIR, returning both autophagy markers to OIR control levels at P17. In addition, neither gliosis nor functional alterations were attenuated. In line with these results, TUNEL staining showed a slight increase in the number of positive cells in the outer nuclear layer (ONL) at P17 OIR. Overall, our results demonstrate that all treatments of induction or inhibition of the autophagic flux reduced neovascular area but were unable to completely reverse the neuronal damage. Besides, compared to current treatments, rapamycin provides a more promising therapeutic strategy as it reduces both neovascular tufts and persistent gliosis.</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Deletion of the Ca2+ Channel Subunit α2δ3 Differentially Affects Cav2.1 and Cav2.2 Currents in Cultured Spiral Ganglion Neurons Before and After the Onset of Hearing</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2019.00278</link>
	<content:encoded>Voltage-gated Ca2+ channels are composed of a pore-forming α1 subunit and auxiliary β and α2δ subunits, which modulate Ca2+ current properties and channel trafficking. So far, the partial redundancy and specificity of α1 for α2δ subunits in the CNS have remained largely elusive. Mature spiral ganglion (SG) neurons express α2δ subunit isoforms 1, 2, and 3 and multiple Ca2+ channel subtypes. Differentiation and in-vivo functions of their endbulb of Held synapses, which rely on presynaptic P/Q channels (Lin et al., 2011), require the α2δ3 subunit (Pirone et al., 2014). This led us to hypothesize that P/Q channels may preferentially co-assemble with α2δ3. Using a dissociated primary culture, we analyzed the effects of α2δ3 deletion on somatic Ca2+ currents (ICa) of SG neurons isolated at postnatal day 20 (P20), when the cochlea is regarded to be mature. P/Q currents were the dominating steady-state Ca2+ currents (54 % of total) followed by T-type, L-type, N-type, and R-type currents. Deletion of α2δ3 reduced P/Q and R-type currents by 60 % and 38 %, respectively, whereas L-type, N-type and T-type currents were not altered. A subset of ICa types was also analyzed in SG neurons isolated at P5, i.e. before the onset of hearing (P12). Both L-type and N-type current amplitudes of wildtype SG neurons were larger at P5 compared with P20. Deletion of α2δ3 reduced L-type and N-type currents by 23 % and 44 %, respectively. In contrast, small P/Q currents, which were just being up-regulated at P5, were unaffected by the lack of α2δ3. In summary, α2δ3 regulates amplitudes of L- and N-type currents of immature cultured SG neurons, whereas it regulates P/Q- and R-type currents at P20. Our data indicate a developmental switch from dominating somatic N- to P/Q-type currents in cultured SG neurons. A switch from N- to P/Q-type channels, which has been observed at several central synapses, may also occur at developing endbulbs of Held. In this case, reduction of both neonatal N- (P5) and more mature P/Q-type currents (around/after hearing onset) may contribute to the impaired morphology and function of endbulb synapses in α2δ3-deficient mice.</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroanatomy | New and Recent Articles: A Method to Measure Myeloarchitecture of the Murine Cerebral Cortex in vivo and ex vivo by Intrinsic Third-Harmonic Generation</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnana.2019.00065</link>
	<content:encoded>A new label-free method is presented for measuring myeloarchitecture of the murine cerebral cortex in vivo and ex vivo. Growing evidence suggests that cortical myelination plays significant roles in neuronal plasticity and pathologies, such as multiple sclerosis (MS), but illuminating the mechanism requires longitudinal imaging of the same brains. Here we demonstrate imaging unlabeled myelinated fibers in a live mouse brain by third-harmonic generation (THG). Contrary to other label-free microscopies based on reflectance, fibers of all orientations could be visualized, i.e., radial and tangential to the pia, which is suitable for revealing the three-dimensional connectivity. The depth of THG imaging in an intact brain was approximately 200 µm, so the network of myelinated fibers could be captured into layers 2/3 in vivo. THG provides a novel base for reconstruction of morphology. Semi-automatic tracing of THG-positive axons unraveled the depth-dependent distribution of myelin lattice. Finally, a unique light property of THG was exploited for the estimation of the g-ratio. The demonstrated THG morphometry of the length density, orientation, and sheath thickness of cortical myelin could be useful for elucidating the function and how it is modulated during learning and diseases.</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Synaptopathy as a Mechanism for Age-Related Vestibular Dysfunction in Mice</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2019.00156</link>
	<content:encoded>Aged related decline of inner ear function contributes to both hearing loss and balance disorders, which lead to impaired quality of life and falls that can result in injury and even death. The cellular mechanisms responsible for the ear’s functional decline have been controversial, but hair cell loss has been considered the key cause for a long time. However, recent studies showed that in the cochlea, loss of inner hair cell synapses precedes hair cell or neuronal loss, and this synaptopathy is an early step in the functional decline. Whether a similar process occurs in the vestibular organ, its timing and its relationship to organ dysfunction remained unknown. We compared the time course of age-related deterioration in vestibular and cochlear functions in mice as well as characterized the age-associated changes in their utricles at the histological level. We found that in the mouse, as in humans, age-related decline in vestibular evoked potentials (VsEPs) occurs later than hearing loss. As in the cochlea, deterioration of VsEPs correlates with the loss of utricular ribbon synapses but not hair cells or neuronal cell bodies. Furthermore, the age-related synaptic loss is restricted to calyceal innervations in the utricular extrastriolar region. Hence, our findings suggest that loss of extrastriolar calyceal synapses has a key role in age-related vestibular dysfunction.</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Flavonoids as Prospective Neuroprotectants and Their Therapeutic Propensity in Aging Associated Neurological Disorders</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2019.00155</link>
	<content:encoded>Modern research revealed that dietary consumption of flavonoids and flavonoids-rich foods significantly improves cognitive capabilities, inhibits or delays the senescence process and related neurological disorders including Alzheimer's disease (AD). The flavonoids rich foods such as green tea, cocoa, blue berry and other foods appear to improve states of cognitive hypofunction, AD and dementia-like pathological symptoms in different animal models. The mechanism of flavonoids are principally mediated via inhibition of cholinesterases (AChE, BChE), beta secretase (BACE1), free radicals and modulation of signaling pathways implicated in cognitive and neuroprotective performance. Flavonoids interact with several signaling protein pathways like ERK and PI3-kinase/Akt and modulate their actions, leading to their neuroprotective effects. Moreover, they enhance vascular blood flow and instigate neurogenesis particularly in the hippocampus area of the brain in animal models investigated so for. Flavonoids also hamper the progression of pathological symptoms of neuro-degenerative disorders via inhibition of neuronal apoptosis induced byneurotoxic substances including free radicals and beta amyloid proteins (Aβ). All these functions contribute to the maintenance of number, quality of neurons and their synaptic connectivity in the brain. Thus flavonoids can thwart the progression of age related disorders and can be a potential source for the development of new drugs effective in cognitive disabilities disorders.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2019.00143</link>
	<content:encoded>Amyloid hypothesis, the assumption that beta-amyloid toxicity is the primary cause of neuronal and synaptic loss, has been the mainstream research concept in Alzheimer’s disease for the past two decades. Currently, this model is quietly being replaced by a more holistic, “systemic disease” paradigm which, like the aging process, affects multiple body tissues and organs, including the gut microbiota.
It is well-established that inflammation is a hallmark of cellular senescence, however the infection-senescence link has been less explored.  Microbiota-induced senescence is a gradually emerging concept promoted by the discovery of pathogens and their products in Alzheimer’s disease brains associated with senescent neurons, glia and endothelial cells.
Infectious agents have previously been associated with Alzheimer’s disease, but the cause vs. effect issue could not be established.  A recent study may have settled this debate as it shows that gingipain, a Porphyromonas gingivalis toxin, can be detected not only in Alzheimer’s disease but also in the brains of older individuals deceased prior to developing the illness.
In this review we take the position that gut microbes and their molecules reach the brain by triggering intestinal and blood brain barrier senescence and disruption.  We also surmise that novel Alzheimer’s disease findings, including neuronal somatic mosaicism, iron dyshomeostasis, aggressive glial phenotypes and loss of aerobic glycolysis can be explained by the infection-senescence model. In addition, we discuss potential cellular senescence targets and therapeutic strategies, including iron chelators, inflammasome inhibitors, senolytic antibiotics, mitophagy and epigenetic metabolic reprograming.</content:encoded>

Epigenetic modifications are poised at the interface between genes and environment and are predicted to reveal insight into NDD etiology. Whole-genome bisulfite sequencing was used to examine DNA cytosine methylation in 49 human cortex samples from 3 different NDDs (autism spectrum disorder, Rett syndrome, and Dup15q syndrome) and matched controls. Integration of methylation changes across NDDs with relevant genomic and genetic datasets revealed differentially methylated regions (DMRs) unique to each type of NDD but with shared regulatory functions in neurons and microglia. NDD DMRs were enriched within promoter regions and for transcription factor binding sites with identified methylation sensitivity. DMRs from all 3 disorders were enriched for ontologies related to nervous system development and genes with disrupted expression in brain from neurodevelopmental or neuropsychiatric disorders. Genes associated with NDD DMRs showed expression patterns indicating an important role for altered microglial function during brain development. These findings demonstrate an NDD epigenomic signature in human cortex that will aid in defining therapeutic targets and early biomarkers at the interface of genetic and environmental NDD risk factors.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Speech perception involves mapping from a continuous and variable acoustic speech signal to discrete, linguistically meaningful units. However, it is unclear where in the auditory processing stream speech sound representations cease to be veridical (faithfully encoding precise acoustic properties) and become categorical (encoding sounds as linguistic categories). In this study, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging and multivariate pattern analysis to determine whether tonotopic primary auditory cortex (PAC), defined as tonotopic voxels falling within Heschl’s gyrus, represents one class of speech sounds—vowels—veridically or categorically. For each of 15 participants, 4 individualized synthetic vowel stimuli were generated such that the vowels were equidistant in acoustic space, yet straddled a categorical boundary (with the first 2 vowels perceived as [i] and the last 2 perceived as [&lt;span style=&quot;font-variant: small-caps;&quot;&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;]). Each participant’s 4 vowels were then presented in a block design with an irrelevant but attention-demanding level change detection task. We found that in PAC bilaterally, neural discrimination between pairs of vowels that crossed the categorical boundary was more accurate than neural discrimination between equivalently spaced vowel pairs that fell within a category. These findings suggest that PAC does not represent vowel sounds veridically, but that encoding of vowels is shaped by linguistically relevant phonemic categories.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Exposures to life stressors accumulate across the lifespan, with possible impact on brain health. Little is known, however, about the mechanisms mediating age-related changes in brain structure. We use a lifespan sample of participants (&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;n&lt;/span&gt; = 21 251; 4–97 years) to investigate the relationship between the thickness of cerebral cortex and the expression of the glucocorticoid- and the mineralocorticoid-receptor genes (&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;NR3C1&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;NR3C2&lt;/span&gt;, respectively), obtained from the Allen Human Brain Atlas. In all participants, cortical thickness correlated negatively with the expression of both &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;NR3C1&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;NR3C2&lt;/span&gt; across 34 cortical regions. The magnitude of this correlation varied across the lifespan. From childhood through early adulthood, the profile similarity (between &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;NR3C1&lt;/span&gt;/&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;NR3C2&lt;/span&gt; expression and thickness) increased with age. Conversely, both profile similarities decreased with age in late life. These variations do not reflect age-related changes in &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;NR3C1&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;NR3C2&lt;/span&gt; expression, as observed in 5 databases of gene expression in the human cerebral cortex (502 donors). Based on the co-expression of &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;NR3C1&lt;/span&gt; (and &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;NR3C2&lt;/span&gt;) with genes specific to neural cell types, we determine the potential involvement of microglia, astrocytes, and CA1 pyramidal cells in mediating the relationship between corticosteroid exposure and cortical thickness. Therefore, corticosteroids may influence brain structure to a variable degree throughout life.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: PTEN Activity Defines an Axis for Plasticity at Cortico-Amygdala Synapses and Influences Social Behavior</title>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhz103/5521615?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Phosphatase and tensin homolog on chromosome 10 (PTEN) is a tumor suppressor and autism-associated gene that exerts an important influence over neuronal structure and function during development. In addition, it participates in synaptic plasticity processes in adulthood. As an attempt to assess synaptic and developmental mechanisms by which PTEN can modulate cognitive function, we studied the consequences of 2 different genetic manipulations in mice: presence of additional genomic copies of the &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Pten&lt;/span&gt; gene (Pten&lt;sup&gt;tg&lt;/sup&gt;) and knock-in of a truncated &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Pten&lt;/span&gt; gene lacking its PDZ motif (Pten-ΔPDZ), which is required for interaction with synaptic proteins. Pten&lt;sup&gt;tg&lt;/sup&gt; mice exhibit substantial microcephaly, structural hypoconnectivity, enhanced synaptic depression at cortico-amygdala synapses, reduced anxiety, and intensified social interactions. In contrast, Pten-ΔPDZ mice have a much more restricted phenotype, with normal synaptic connectivity, but impaired synaptic depression at cortico-amygdala synapses and virtually abolished social interactions. These results suggest that synaptic actions of PTEN in the amygdala contribute to specific behavioral traits, such as sociability. Also, PTEN appears to function as a bidirectional rheostat in the amygdala: reduction in PTEN activity at synapses is associated with less sociability, whereas enhanced PTEN activity accompanies hypersocial behavior.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dual antiplatelet therapy (DAT) with clopidogrel plus aspirin has been suggested by AHA/ASA guidelines for minor stroke (MS) and transient ischemic attack (TIA) patients. The purpose of this study was to find the potential subgroups that benefit from the DAT. We aimed to compare the efficacy of clopidogrel‐aspirin therapy with aspirin therapy in MS/TIA patients stratified by CYP2C19 genotype and risk profiles.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CYP2C19 loss‐of‐function allele (LoFA) carriers were defined as patients with either LoFA of *2 or *3. Low and high risk profile was defined as Essen stroke risk score (ESRS)&amp;lt;3 and ≥3, respectively. Stroke recurrence at one year was defined as primary outcome.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In total 2933 MS/TIA patients, there were 1726 (58.8%) LoFA carriers and 1068 (36.4%) patients at high risk (ESRS≥3). No significant difference for stroke recurrence between clopidogrel‐aspirin group and aspirin alone group was found in LoFA carriers (11.2% vs 13.3%, HR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.64~1.09). In Stratified analyses by CYP2C19 genotype and ESRS, HRs (95% CIs) of the clopidogrel‐aspirin therapy for stroke recurrence were 1.00 (0.70~1.42), 0.63 (0.41~0.97), 0.62 (0.40~0.96) and 0.52 (0.31~0.88) among subgroups of LoFA carriers at low risk, LoFA carriers at high risk, LoFA non‐carriers at low risk and LoFA non‐carriers at high risk, respectively, with &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;=0.021 for interaction.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall LoFA carriers do not benefit from DAT, but there is significant benefit for LoFA carriers who are at high risk. The benefit of clopidogrel in Chinese MS/TIA patients depends on CYP2C19 genotype and risk profile.&lt;/p&gt;

Locus-specific epigenetic editing allows direct epigenetic regulation of specific genes to elucidate the direct causal relationship between epigenetic modifications and transcription. This review discusses some of the latest innovations in the efficacy and flexibility in this approach that hold promise for neurobiological application.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded>

Neuroligins are highly conserved across evolution with important roles in the formation, maturation and function of synaptic structures. Mutations in the genes that encode for neuroligins have been linked to a number of neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism and schizophrenia, which stem from synaptic pathologies. Owing to their essential functions in regulating synaptic connectivity and their link to synaptic dysfunction in disease, previous studies on neuroligins have focused on neurons. Yet a recent work reveals that neuroligins are also expressed in the central nervous system by glial cells, such as astrocytes and oligodendrocytes, and perform important roles in controlling synaptic connectivity in a non-cell autonomous manner. In this review, we will highlight these recent findings demonstrating the important roles of glial neuroligins in regulating the development and connectivity of healthy and diseased brains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded>

Known exceptions include canonical imprinted genes, random X-chromosome inactivation, olfactory receptors and clustered protocadherins. Here, we highlight recent studies showing that allele-specific expression is frequent in the genome and involves subtypes of epigenetic allelic effects that differ in terms of heritability, clonality and stability over time. Different forms of epigenetic allele regulation could have different roles in brain development, function, and disease. An emerging area involves understanding allelic effects in a cell-type and developmental stage-specific manner and determining how these effects influence the impact of genetic variants and mutations on the brain. A deeper understanding of epigenetics at the allele and cellular level in the brain could help clarify the mechanisms underlying phenotypic variance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded>

While much effort has been devoted to understanding the capacity and role for local protein synthesis in dendrites and spines, local mRNA translation in mature axons, projecting over distances up to a meter, has received much less attention. Also, little is known about the spatio-temporal dynamics of axonal and dendritic gene expression as function of mRNA abundance, protein synthesis and degradation. Here, we summarize key recent findings that have shaped our knowledge of the precise location of local protein production and discuss unique strategies used by neurons to shape presynaptic and postsynaptic proteomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded>

This region is densely packed with thousands of proteins that are involved in extensive interactions. During synaptic plasticity, the PSD undergoes changes in size and composition along with changes in synaptic strength that lead to long term potentiation (LTP) or depression (LTD). It is therefore essential to understand the organization principles underlying PSD assembly and rearrangement. Here, we review exciting new findings from recent &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt; reconstitution studies and propose a hypothesis that liquid–liquid phase separation mediates PSD formation and regulation. We also discuss how the properties of PSD formed via phase separation might contribute to the biological functions observed from decades of researches. Finally, we highlight unanswered questions regarding PSD organization and how &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt; reconstitution systems may help to answer these questions in the coming years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded>

These processes rely on a subtle interplay between the set of genes inherited from the parents, the surrounding environment and epigenetic regulation. Methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MeCP2) has been shown to recognize epigenetic states and regulate gene expression by reading methylated DNA. Here, we will review the recent findings revealing the role of MeCP2 during postnatal CPs of development using mouse models of Rett (RTT) syndrome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded>

How these processes are initiated and coordinated are open questions. Synapse specificity, or synaptic partner selection, is widely understood to be determined by the trans-synaptic binding of cell adhesion molecules. However, &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt; evidence that cell adhesion molecules subsequently function to initiate synapse assembly, as initially proposed, is lacking. Here, we present a summary of our current understanding of synaptogenic pathways that mediate presynaptic and postsynaptic assembly and the coordination of these processes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded>

In the last several years, technological advances improving our ability to identify mRNA modifications, coupled with the discovery of proteins that add and remove these marks, have substantially expanded our knowledge of how the epitranscriptome shapes gene expression. Efforts to uncover functional roles for mRNA modifications have begun to reveal important roles for some marks within the nervous system, and animal models have emerged which demonstrate severe neurodevelopmental and neurocognitive abnormalities resulting from the loss of mRNA modification machinery. Here, we review the recent advances in the field of neuroepitranscriptomics, with a particular emphasis on how modifications to mRNAs within the brain contribute to synaptic activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded>

Autophagosomes and endosomes sequester cellular cargo through different mechanisms, but these pathways converge upon fusion with lysosomes. Both pathways are spatially regulated, with distinct features evident in the soma, axons, and dendrites, possibly as an adaptation to the unique morphology of neurons and the specific demands of each compartment. Relatively little is known about how autophagy and endo-lysosomal degradation interact and how their activities may be coordinated. We review our current understanding of autophagy and endo-lysosomal degradation in neurons, highlighting common features and differences as well as the intersection of these two essential cellular pathways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded>

These include gains or losses of activity-responsiveness of certain genes and differences in gene induction profiles. Here, we discuss a possible origin of dissimilarities in activity-regulated transcription between species. We highlight that while synapse-to-nucleus signalling pathways are evolutionarily conserved, &lt;em&gt;cis&lt;/em&gt;-regulatory plasticity has been driving species-specific remodelling of the activity-controlled enhancer landscape, thereby affecting gene regulation. In particular, evolutionary rearrangements of transcription factor binding site placements together with potential species-dependent developmental stage- and/or cell type-specific epigenetic and other &lt;em&gt;trans&lt;/em&gt;-acting mechanisms are most likely at least in part accountable for between-species diversity in activity-regulated transcription. It is conceivable that &lt;em&gt;cis&lt;/em&gt;-regulatory plasticity may have equipped the synaptic activity-driven adaptive gene program in human neurons with unique, species-specific qualities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded>

The BBB regulates molecular flux to maintain an optimal environment for neuronal function and protects the brain from toxins and pathogens. Endothelial cells forming the walls of CNS blood vessels constitute the BBB. CNS endothelial cells exhibit two features that underlie the restrictive properties of the BBB: specialized tight junctions that prevent paracellular passage between the blood and the brain, and unusually low levels of vesicle trafficking that limit transcellular transport or transcytosis. While the prevailing view in the field was that specialized tight junctions contributed to CNS barrier properties, recent findings have revealed the importance of maintaining low rates of transcytosis at the BBB. It is now clear that suppression of transcytosis at the BBB is an active process and CNS-specific genetic programs inhibit this pathway to maintain a functional barrier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Characterization of Inflammation in Delayed Cortical Transplantation</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2019.00160</link>
	<content:encoded>We previously reported that embryonic motor cortical neurons transplanted one-week after lesions in the adult mouse motor cortex significantly enhances graft vascularization, survival, and proliferation of grafted cells, the density of projections developed by grafted neurons and improves functional repair and recovery. The purpose of the present study is to understand the extent to which post-traumatic inflammation following cortical lesion could influence the survival of grafted neurons and the development of their projections to target brain regions and conversely how transplanted cells can modulate host inflammation. For this, embryonic motor cortical tissue was grafted either immediately or with a one-week delay into the lesioned motor cortex of adult mice. Immunohistochemistry analysis was performed to determine the density and cell morphology of resident and peripheral infiltrating immune cells. Then, in-situ hybridization was performed to analyze the distribution and temporal mRNA expression pattern of pro-inflammatory or anti-inflammatory cytokines following cortical lesion. In parallel, we analyzed the protein expression of both M1- and M2-associated markers to study the M1/M2 balance switch. We have shown that one-week after the lesion, the number of astrocytes, microglia, oligodendrocytes, and CD45+ cells was significantly increased along with characteristics of M2 microglia phenotype. Interestingly, the majority of microglia co-expressed TGF-β1, an anti-inflammatory cytokine, supporting the hypothesis that microglial activation is also neuroprotective. Our results suggest that the modulation of post-traumatic inflammation one-week after cortical lesion might be implicated in the improvement of graft vascularization, survival, and density of projections developed by grafted neurons.</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Posttranscriptional Gene Regulation of the GABA Receptor to Control Neuronal Inhibition</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2019.00152</link>
	<content:encoded>Behavior and higher cognition rely on the transfer of information between neurons through specialized contact sites termed synapses. Plasticity of neuronal circuits, a prerequisite to respond to environmental changes, is inseparably coupled with the nerve cell’s ability to form, structurally modulate or remove synapses. Consequently, the synaptic proteome undergoes dynamic alteration on demand in a spatiotemporally restricted manner. Therefore, proper protein localization at synapses is essential for synaptic function. This process is regulated by (i) protein transport and recruitment, (ii) local protein synthesis and (iii) synaptic protein degradation. These processes shape the transmission efficiency of excitatory synapses. Whether and how these processes influence synaptic inhibition is, however, widely unknown. Here, we summarize findings on fundamental regulatory processes that can be extrapolated to inhibitory synapses. We therefore focus on known aspects of posttranscriptional regulation and protein dynamics of the GABA receptor. We propose that local (co)-translational control mechanism might control transmission of inhibitory synapses.</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Integrative Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Modulation of Functional Connectivity Between Dopamine Neurons of the Rat Ventral Tegmental Area in vitro</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnint.2019.00020</link>
	<content:encoded>Micro Electrode Arrays were used to simultaneously record spontaneous extracellular action potentials from 10-30 dopamine neurons in acute brain slices from the lateral Ventral Tegmental Area (VTA) of the rat. The spike train of an individual neuron was used to characterize the firing pattern: firing rate, firing irregularity and oscillation frequency. Functional connectivity between a pair of neurons was quantified by the Paired Phase Consistency (PPC), taking the oscillation frequency as reference. Under baseline conditions the PPC was significantly different from zero and 42 of the 386 pairs of VTA neurons showed significant coupling. 50%of the recorded dopamine neurons were part of the coupled VTA network. Raising extracellular potassium from 3.5 mM to 5 mM increased the mean firing rate of the dopamine neurons by 45%. The same increase could be induced by bath application of 300 uM glutamate. High potassium reduced the PPC, but it did not change during the glutamate application. Our findings imply that manipulating excitability has distinct and specific consequences for functional connectivity in the VTA network that cannot be directly predicted from the changes in neuronal firing rates. Functional connectivity reflects the spatial organization and synchronization of the VTA output and thus represents a unique element of the message that is sent to the mesolimbic projection area. It adds a dimension to pharmacological manipulation of the VTA micro circuit that might help to understand the pharmacological (side) effects of e.g. anti-psychotic drugs.</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Neurodegeneration section | New and Recent Articles: Quercetin Enhances Inhibitory Synaptic Inputs and Reduces Excitatory Synaptic Inputs to OFF- and ON-Type Retinal Ganglion Cells in a Chronic Glaucoma Rat Model</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00672</link>
	<content:encoded>Background: Glaucoma is a neurodegenerative disease caused by excitotoxic injury of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs). It has been proved that an important natural dietary flavonoid compound (quercetin) can improve RGC function in our previous high intraocular pressure model prepared by magnetic bead injection into anterior chamber. However, it is unclear whether quercetin can improve the function of RGCs and how quercetin regulates synaptic transmission in chronic glaucoma rat models. 
Methods: Rat model of chronic glaucoma was prepared by electrocoagulation of superior scleral vein. Electrophysiological electroretinogram was used to detect the photopic negative response (PhNR). Whole-cell patch clamp was used to clamp ON- and OFF-type RGC in normal and 4 weeks retinal sections of glaucoma. 
Results: Quercetin can restore the decrease of PhNR amplitude caused by chronic glaucoma. The basic miniature GABAergic inhibitory postsynaptic currents (mIPSCs) in RGCs frequency of glaucomatous retinal slices was lower than that of the control group. The frequencies of miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs) were not significantly different between control and glaucomatous RGCs. The baseline frequencies of GABAergic mIPSCs and mEPSCs in OFF-type glaucomatous RGCs were greater than those in ON-type glaucomatous RGCs. Quercetin increased miniature GABAergic inhibitory neurotransmission to RGCs and decreased miniature glutamatergic excitatory neurotransmission, reduced the excitability of the RGC itself, thus alleviating the excitability of RGCs in glaucomatous slices. 
Conclusions: Quercetin may be a promising therapeutic agent for improving RGC survival and function in glaucomatous neurodegeneration. Quercetin exerted direct protective effects on RGCs by increasing inhibitory neurotransmission and decreasing excitatory neurotransmission to RGCs, thus reducing excitotoxic damage to those cells in glaucoma.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00645</link>
	<content:encoded>Previous studies have reported that long non-coding RNA SNHG12 (lncRNA SNHG12) plays critical role in regulating biofunction of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), but the effect of lncRNA SNHG12 in MSCs in brain injury is still rarely reported. Hence, the protective effect and mechanism of a lncRNA SNHG12 modified mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) was explored in treating brain injury under an ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) condition in this study. I/R rat brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMECs) were cocultured with MSCs or I/R pretreated MSCs. Then, proliferation of BMECs was detected using CCK-8 and EdU assays and apoptosis of cells was determined using flow cytometry and Hoechst. Autophagy of BMECs was determined using immunofluorescence and associated pathway was measured using western blotting. Moreover, proliferation, apoptosis, and autophagy of BMECs was also determined after co-culturing with shSNHG12-MSCs. In addition, a middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model rat model treated with MSCs injection was also used to confirm the findings in cells. I/R treatment significantly decreased the proliferation, but increase SNHG12 expression as well as the apoptosis and autophagy of BMECs. However, co-culturing with MSCs markedly alleviated the reduction of proliferation and increase of apoptosis and autophagy, as well as the phosphorylation of PI3K, AKT, and mTOR, in BMECs induced by I/R and shSNHG12 remarkably enhanced the effect of MSCs. In addition, MSCs injection also alleviated the infarct area and apoptosis of MACO rats, as well as the phosphorylation of PI3K, AKT, and mTOR. Moreover, shSNHG12 enhanced the ameliorative effect of MSCs in treating brain injury in MACO model.In conclusions, silencing SNHG12 enhanced the effect of MSCs in ameliorating apoptosis and autophagy of BMECs induced by PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway.</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Neural Technology section | New and Recent Articles: High-Density Electrical Recording and Impedance Imaging With a Multi-Modal CMOS Multi-Electrode Array Chip</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00641</link>
	<content:encoded>Multi-electrode arrays, both active or passive, emerged as ideal technologies to unveil intricated electrophysiological dynamics of cells and tissues. Active MEAs, designed using complementary metal oxide semiconductor technology (CMOS), stand over passive devices thanks to the possibility of achieving single-cell resolution, the reduced electrode size, the reduced crosstalk and the higher functionality and portability. Nevertheless, most of the reported CMOS MEA systems mainly rely on a single operational modality, which strongly hampers the applicability range of a single device. This can be a limiting factor considering that most biological and electrophysiological dynamics are often based on the synergy of multiple and complex mechanisms acting from different angles on the same phenomena. Here, we designed a CMOS MEA chip with 16,384 titanium nitride electrodes, 6 independent operational modalities and 1,024 parallel recording channels for neuro-electrophysiological studies. Sixteen independent active areas are patterned on the chip surface forming a 4x4 matrix, each one including 1,024 electrodes. Electrodes of four different sizes are present on the chip surface, ranging from 2.5x3.5 µm^2 up to 10.5x11.0 µm^2, with 15 µm pitch. In this paper, we exploited the impedance monitoring and voltage recording modalities not only to monitor the growth and development of primary rat hippocampal neurons, but also to assess their electrophysiological activity over time showing a mean spike amplitude of 144.8 ± 84.6 µV. Fixed frequency (1 kHz) and high sampling rate (30 kHz) impedance measurements were used to evaluate the cellular adhesion and growth on the chip surface. Thanks to the high-density configuration of the electrodes, as well as their dimension and pitch, the chip can appreciate the evolutions of the cell culture morphology starting from the moment of the seeding up to mature culture conditions. The measurements were confirmed by fluorescent staining. The effect of the different electrode sizes on the spike amplitudes and noise were also discussed. The multi-modality of the presented CMOS MEA allows for the simultaneous assessment of different physiological properties of the cultured neurons. Therefore, it can pave the way both to answer complex fundamental neuroscience questions as well as to aid the current drug -development paradigm.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00601</link>
	<content:encoded>ABSTRACT
Although amyotrophic lateral sclerosis has been considered as a disorder of the motor neuron cell body, recent evidences show the non-cell-autonomous pathogenic nature of the disease. Axonal degeneration, loss of peripheral axons and destruction of nerve terminals are early events in the disease pathogenic cascade, anticipating motor neuron degeneration and the onset of clinical symptoms. Therefore, although Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and peripheral axonal neuropathies should be differentiated in clinical practice, they also share damage to common molecular pathways, including axonal transport, RNA metabolism and proteostasis. Thus, an extensive evaluation of the molecular events occurring in the peripheral nervous system could be fundamental to understand the pathogenic mechanisms of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, favouring the discovery of potential disease biomarkers and new therapeutic targets.</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroinformatics | New and Recent Articles: Systematic Differences Between Perceptually Relevant Image Statistics of Brain MRI and Natural Images</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fninf.2019.00046</link>
	<content:encoded>It is well-known that the human visual system is adapted to the statistical structure of natural scenes. Yet there are important classes of images – for example, medical images -- that are not natural scenes, and therefore, that are expected to have statistical properties that deviate from the class of images that shaped the evolution and development of human vision. Here, focusing on structural brain MRI images, we quantify and characterize these deviations in terms of a set of local image statistics to which human visual sensitivity has been well-characterized, and that has previously been used for natural image analysis. We analyzed MRI images in multiple databases including T1-weighted and FLAIR sequence types, and simulated MRI images based on a published image simulation procedure for T1 images, which we also modified to generate FLAIR images. We first computed the power spectra of MRI images; spectral slopes were in the range -2.6 to -3.1 for T1 sequences, and -2.2 to -2.7 for FLAIR sequences. Analysis of local image statistics was then carried out on whitened images. For all of the databases as well as for the simulated images, we found that the three-point correlations contributed substantially to the differences between the “texture” of randomly-selected ROIs. The informative nature of three-point correlations for brain MRI was greater than for natural images, and also disproportionate to human visual sensitivity. As this finding was consistent across databases, it is likely to result from brain geometry at the scale of brain MRI resolution, rather than characteristics of specific imaging and reconstruction methods.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2019.00177</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
The orbitofrontal cortex is known for being involved in distinctive cognitive and behavioural operations. Damage to the orbitofrontal and ventromedial prefrontal cortices often occurs following traumatic brain injury and can lead to disorders of personality, affect, motivation, impulsive behaviour, and social cognition. Here we focus on cognitive systems specifically for social behaviour following mild to moderate traumatic brain injury.  We performed a music-supported intervention on patients with impairment in social interaction and cognitive deficits following mild to moderate traumatic brain injury. The patients were in a stable phase of acquired brain injury two years post injury. Additional two control groups of healthy participants were included in the study. We assessed the participants with neuropsychological tests, fMRI pre-post intervention, and semi-structured interviews to obtain subjective behavioural data.  We present significant evidence for a qualitative increase of social interaction in the patient group and normalization of activation in orbitofrontal cortex after intervention. We propose a causal relationship between the training of piano playing and neuroplastic changes in orbitofrontal cortex followed by improved social functioning and enhanced cognitive performance.</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: The Embodied Brain of SOVEREIGN2: From Space-Variant Conscious Percepts During Visual Search and Navigation to Learning Invariant Object Categories and Cognitive-Emotional Plans for Acquiring Valued Goals</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2019.00036</link>
	<content:encoded>This article further develops a model of how reactive and planned behaviors interact in real time. Controllers for both animals and mobile robots, or animats, need reactive mechanisms for exploration, and learned plans to reach goal objects once an environment becomes familiar. Sequences of such behaviors need to be released at appropriate times during autonomous navigation to realize valued goals. The SOVEREIGN model of Gnadt and Grossberg (2008) embodied these capabilities, and was tested in a 3D virtual reality environment. Some SOVEREIGN processes were realized algorithmically. Other processes needed to achieve a more comprehensive adaptive intelligence in an embodied mobile system were not included at all. This article describes recent neural models of important missing capabilities with enough detail to define a research program that that can consistently incorporate them into an enhanced model called SOVEREIGN2. SOVEREIGN2 includes several interacting systems that model computationally complementary properties of the cortical What and Where processing streams, and homologous mechanisms for spatial navigation and arm movement control. Visual inputs are processed by networks that are sensitive to visual form and motion. View-, position-, and size-invariant recognition categories are learned in the What stream. Estimates of target and present position are computed in the Where stream, and can activate approach movements toward the target. Motion cues can elicit orienting movements to bring a new target into view. Approach and orienting movements are alternately performed. Cumulative estimates of each movement are derived from visual and vestibular cues. Sequences of experienced visual objects are stored in a cognitive working memory, whereas movement sequences are stored in a spatial/motor working memory. Stored sequences trigger learning of cognitive and spatial/motor list chunk categories, or plans, which together control planned movements towards valued goal objects. Predictively effective chunk combinations are selectively enhanced or suppressed via reinforcement and motivational learning by rewards and punishments, respectively. Expected vs. unexpected non-occurrences, or disconfirmations, of rewards or punishments also regulate these enhancement and suppressive processes. These several kinds of learning effect a gradual transition from variable reactive exploratory movements to efficient goal-oriented planned movement sequences.</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Pin1 Is Regulated by CaMKII Activation in Glutamate-Induced Retinal Neuronal Regulated Necrosis</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2019.00276</link>
	<content:encoded>In our previous study, we reported that peptidyl-prolyl isomerase 1 (Pin1)-modulated regulated necrosis (RN) occurred in cultured retinal neurons after glutamate injury. In the current study, we investigated the role of calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) in Pin1-modulated RN in cultured rat retinal neurons, and in an animal in vivo model. We first demonstrated that glutamate might lead to calcium overloading mainly through ionotropic glutamate receptors activation. Furthermore, CaMKII activation induced by overloaded calcium leads to Pin1 activation and subsequent RN. Inactivation of CaMKII by KN-93 (KN, i.e., a specific CaMKII inhibitor) application can decrease the glutamate-induced retinal neuronal RN. Finally, by using an animal in vivo model, we also demonstrated the important role of CaMKII in glutamate-induced RN in rat retina. In addition, flash electroretinogram results provided evidence that the impaired visual function induced by glutamate can recover after CaMKII inhibition. In conclusion, CaMKII is an up-regulator of Pin1 and responsible for the RN induced by glutamate. This study provides further understanding of the regulatory pathway of RN and is a complementary mechanism for Pin1 activation mediated necrosis. This finding will provide a potential target to protect neurons from necrosis in neurodegenerative diseases, such as glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy, and even central nervous system diseases.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2019.00153</link>
	<content:encoded>Most studies targeting age-association of memory functions report a decline in recognition hits and an increase in false alarms. The goal of the present study was to assess these findings in tasks with day-to-day relevance. We investigated healthy young (YA; age 26.90 ± 3.55 years) and old (OA; age 69.80 ± 5.85 years) adults. Participants were asked to watch six news and six commercials and complete a recognition task relating to the information presented in the videos. OA had a lower hit rate in both news and commercials compared to YA. However, the number of false alarms was the same in both age groups. Applying signal detection theory, we found age differences in discriminability for both news and commercials paradigm. The groups showed no differences in bias and both chose a liberal answering tendency. We interpret our finding as a result of complex recognition items in an ecologically valid task. Multi-feature items offer an advantage in correct rejection – it is enough to know that at least one feature of an item is false. This benefit does not extend to hits, where all features of an item need to be recognised. This indicates that recognition memory of naturalistic stimuli in OA is porous, but not distorted.</content:encoded>

	<title>RSS PAP: Rodent Activity Detector (RAD) - an open source device for measuring activity in rodent home cages</title>
	<link>http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0160-19.2019v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Physical activity is a critical behavioral variable in many research studies, and is therefore important to quantify. However, existing methods for measuring physical activity have limitations which include high expense, specialized caging or equipment, and high computational overhead. To address these limitations, we present an open-source, cost-effective, device for measuring rodent activity. Our device is battery powered and designed to be placed in vivarium home cages to enable high-throughput, long-term operation with minimal investigator intervention. The primary aim of this study was to assess the feasibility of using passive infrared (PIR) sensors and microcontroller-based dataloggers in a rodent home cages to collect physical activity records. To this end, we developed an open-source PIR based data-logging device called the Rodent Activity Detector (RAD). We publish the design files and code so others can readily build the RAD in their own labs. To demonstrate its utility, we used the RAD to collect physical activity data from 40 individually housed mice for up to 10 weeks. This dataset demonstrates the ability of the RAD to 1) operate in a high-throughput installation, 2) detect high-fat diet induced changes in physical activity, and 3) quantify circadian rhythms in individual animals. We further validated the data output of the RAD with simultaneous video-tracking of mice in multiple caging configurations, to determine the features of physical activity that it detects. The RAD is easy to build, economical, and fits in vivarium caging. The scalability of such devices will enable high-throughput studies of physical activity in research studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Physical activity is an important determinant of human health, which reduces the risk of cardiovascular, metabolic and neurological disorders. Better methods for tracking physical activity in research studies may lead to insights that improve physical activity levels in people. To this end, we designed and built an inexpensive device to continuously track home cage activity levels in rodents. Our device, RAD, allows for high-throughput activity monitoring with minimal investigator intervention, presenting an economical and efficient option for investigating physical activity levels in research studies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>RSS PAP: Differential changes in the lateralized activity of identified projection neurons of motor cortex in hemiparkinsonian rats</title>
	<link>http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0110-19.2019v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;In the parkinsonian state, the motor cortex and basal ganglia undergo dynamic remodeling of movement representation. One such change is the loss of the normal contralateral lateralized activity pattern. The increase in the number of movement-related neurons responding to ipsilateral or bilateral limb movements may cause motor problems, including impaired balance, reduced bimanual coordination, and abnormal mirror movements. However, it remains unknown how individual types of motor cortical neurons organize this reconstruction. To explore the effect of dopamine depletion on lateralized activity in the parkinsonian state, we used a partial hemiparkinsonian model (6-hydroxydopamine lesion) in Long-Evans rats performing unilateral movements in a right–left pedal task, while recording from primary (M1) and secondary motor cortex (M2). The lesion decreased contralateral preferred activity in both M1 and M2. In addition, this change differed among identified intratelencephalic (IT) and pyramidal tract (PT) cortical projection neurons, depending on the cortical area. We detected a decrease in lateralized activity only in PT neurons in M1, whereas in M2, this change was observed in IT neurons, with no change in the PT population. Our results suggest a differential effect of dopamine depletion in the lateralized activity of the motor cortex, and suggest possible compensatory changes in the contralateral hemisphere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance statement&lt;/b&gt; The motor cortex normally exhibits preferred activation during contralateral, but not ipsilateral, movements. In the parkinsonian state, this contralateral preference may be affected, resulting in impaired bimanual coordination or abnormal mirror movements. However, it remains unknown how individual types of motor cortical neurons are reorganized in the parkinsonian state. Using multiunit recording in hemiparkinsonian rats during unilateral forelimb movements, we observed a reduction in contralateral preference in both primary and secondary motor cortices in the lesioned hemisphere. Moreover, using a light-induced spike collision test, we demonstrated that these decreases in lateralized activity were present in PT neurons exclusively in the primary motor cortex, but only in IT neurons in the secondary motor cortex.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>RSS PAP: The basolateral nucleus of the amygdala executes the parallel processes of avoidance and palatability in the retrieval of conditioned taste aversion in male rats</title>
	<link>http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0004-19.2019v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Conditioned taste aversion (CTA) is an essential behavior for animal survival. Conditioned animals show avoidance and decreased palatability to a conditioned stimulus (CS) on CTA retrieval. In this study, we aimed to determine whether the basolateral nucleus of the amygdala (BLA) is involved in CTA retrieval and whether avoidance and palatability in CTA retrieval are processed in the BLA. We developed an experimental chamber for time-course analysis of the behavior to approach a spout and lick a CS. In this experimental chamber, we analyzed the behavior of male rats following microinjections of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;) receptor agonist muscimol or saline into the BLA. The rats showed two types of approach behavior: they either (1) approached and licked the spout or (2) approached but did not lick the spout. Muscimol injection into the BLA decreased the frequency of the latter type of approach behavior, indicating that BLA inactivation reduced avoidance to the CS. The muscimol injection into the BLA also significantly increased the consumption of the CS. Lick microstructure analysis demonstrated that intra-BLA muscimol significantly increased licking burst number and size, indicating that BLA inactivation attenuated aversion to the CS as large burst licking is an indicator of high palatability. These results suggest that the increase in CS consumption with intra-BLA muscimol injection was due to alterations in approach and aversive responses to the CS. Therefore, we conclude that the BLA plays an essential role in CTA retrieval by parallel processing of avoidance and palatability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significant statements&lt;/b&gt; To understand the role of the basolateral nucleus of the amygdala (BLA) in the retrieval of conditioned taste aversion (CTA), we developed a new behavioral paradigm that overcomes the limitations of traditional behavioral procedures in CTA studies. In male rats, we measured time stamps of the approach behavior to a conditioned stimulus (CS) and licking of a spout. BLA inactivation not only increased CS consumption but also decreased avoidance and aversion to the CS. These results reveal that the BLA is essential for CTA retrieval by processing two distinct behavioral responses in parallel: avoidance and palatability. We further demonstrate that multi-dimensional analysis of animal behavior is an important factor for elucidating brain function.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Creativity is the ability to generate original and useful products, and it is considered central to the progression of human civilization. As a noninherited emerging process, creativity may stem from temporally dynamic brain activity, which, however, has not been well studied. The purpose of this study was to measure brain dynamics using entropy and to examine the associations between brain entropy (BEN) and divergent thinking in a large healthy sample. The results showed that divergent thinking was consistently positively correlated with regional BEN in the left dorsal anterior cingulate cortex/pre-supplementary motor area and left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, suggesting that creativity is closely related to the functional dynamics of the control networks involved in cognitive flexibility and inhibitory control. Importantly, our main results were cross-validated in two independent cohorts from two different cultures. Additionally, three dimensions of divergent thinking (fluency, flexibility, and originality) were positively correlated with regional BEN in the left inferior frontal gyrus and left middle temporal gyrus, suggesting that more highly creative individuals possess more flexible semantic associative networks. Taken together, our findings provide the first evidence of the associations of regional BEN with individual variations in divergent thinking and show that BEN is sensitive to detecting variations in important cognitive abilities in healthy subjects.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Induction of Neural Crest Stem Cells From Bardet–Biedl Syndrome Patient Derived hiPSCs</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2019.00139</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract: Neural crest cells arise in the embryo from the neural plate border and migrate throughout the body, giving rise to many different tissue types such as bones and cartilage of the face, smooth muscles, neurons and melanocytes. While studied extensively in animal models, neural crest development and disease have been poorly described in human due to the challenges in accessing embryonic tissues. In recent years, patient-derived human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) have become easier to generate, and several streamlined protocols have enabled robust differentiation of hiPSCs to the neural crest lineage. Thus, a unique opportunity is offered for modelling neurocristopathies using patient specific stem cell lines. In this work, we make use of hiPSCs derived from patients affected by the Bardet-Biedl Syndrome (BBS) ciliopathy. BBS patients often exhibit subclinical craniofacial dysmorphisms that are likely to be associated with the neural crest-derived facial skeleton. We focus on hiPSCs carrying variants in the BBS10 gene, which encodes a protein forming part of a chaperonin-like complex associated with the cilium. Here, we establish a pipeline for profiling hiPSCs during differentiation toward the neural crest stem cell fate. This can be used to characterise the differentiation properties of the neural crest-like cells. Two different BBS10 mutant lines showed a reduction in expression of the characteristic neural crest gene expression profile. Further analysis of both BBS10 mutant lines highlighted the inability of these mutant lines to differentiate towards a neural crest fate, which was also characterised by a decreased WNT and BMP response. Altogether, our study suggests a requirement for wild-type BBS10 in human neural crest development. In the long term, approaches such as the one we describe will allow direct comparison of disease-specific cell lines. This will provide valuable insights into the relationships between genetic background and heterogeneity in cellular models. The possibility of integrating laboratory data with clinical phenotypes will move us towards precision medicine approaches.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Alzheimer disease (AD) represents an oncoming epidemic that without an effective treatment promises to exact extraordinary human and financial burdens. Studies of pathogenesis are essential for defining targets for discovering disease-modifying treatments. Past studies of AD neuropathology provided valuable, albeit limited, insights. Nevertheless, building on these findings, recent studies have provided an increasingly rich harvest of genetic, molecular and cellular data that are creating unprecedented opportunities to both understand and treat AD. Among the most significant are those documenting the presence within the AD brain of toxic oligomeric species of Aβ and tau. Existing data support the view that such species can propagate and spread within neural circuits. To place these findings in context we first review the genetics and neuropathology of AD, including AD in Down syndrome. We detail studies that support the existence of toxic oligomeric species while noting the significant unanswered questions concerning their precise structures, the means by which they spread and undergo amplification and how they induce neuronal dysfunction and degeneration. We conclude by offering a speculative synthesis for how oligomers of Aβ and tau initiate and drive pathogenesis. While 100 years after Alzheimer’s first report there is much still to learn about pathogenesis and the discovery of disease-modifying treatments, the application of new concepts and sophisticated new tools are poised to deliver important advances for combatting AD.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00658</link>
	<content:encoded>Despite the current diagnostic criteria, early diagnostics of behavioral variant of frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD) has remained challenging. Patients with bvFTD often present with misleading psychiatric phenotype, and, on the other hand, impairment in memory functions have increasingly been reported. However, impaired episodic memory is currently considered as an exclusion criterion for bvFTD. Single biofluid-based or imaging biomarkers do not currently provide sufficient sensitivity or specificity for early bvFTD diagnosis at single-subject level, although studies have suggested improved accuracy with different biomarker combinations. In this mini-review, we evaluate the core clinical features of early bvFTD and summarize the most potential imaging and fluid biomarkers for bvFTD diagnostics.</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Brain Imaging Methods section | New and Recent Articles: Semiparametric Estimation of Task-Based Dynamic Functional Connectivity on the Population Level</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00583</link>
	<content:encoded>Dynamic functional connectivity (dFC) estimates time-dependent associations between pairs of brain region time series as typically acquired during functional MRI.  dFC changes are most commonly quantified by pairwise correlation coefficients between the time series within a sliding window.  Here, we applied a recently developed bootstrap-based technique (Kudela et al. 2017) to robustly estimate subject-level dFC and its confidence intervals in a task-based fMRI study (24 subjects who tasted their most frequently consumed beer and Gatorade as an appetitive control).  We then combined information across subjects and scans utilizing semiparametric mixed models to obtain a group-level dFC estimate for each pair of brain regions, flavor, and the difference between flavors.  The proposed approach relies on the estimated group-level dFC accounting for complex correlation structures of the fMRI data, multiple repeated observations per subject, experimental design, and subject-specific variability.  It also provides condition-specific dFC and confidence intervals for the whole brain at the group level. As a summary dFC metric, we used the proportion of time when the estimated associations were either significantly positive or negative.  For both flavors, our fully-data driven approach yielded regional associations that reflected known, biologically meaningful brain organization as shown in prior work, as well as closely resembled resting state networks (RSNs).  Specifically, beer flavor-potentiated associations were detected between several reward-related regions, including the right ventral striatum (VST), lateral orbitofrontal cortex, and ventral anterior insular cortex (vAIC).  The enhancement of right VST-vAIC association by a taste of beer independently validated the main activation-based finding (Oberlin et al. 2016).  Most notably, our novel dFC methodology uncovered numerous associations undetected by the traditional static FC analysis. The data-driven, novel dFC methodology presented here can be used for a wide range of task-based fMRI designs to estimate the dFC at multiple levels – group-, individual- and task-specific, utilizing a combination of well-established statistical methods.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00582</link>
	<content:encoded>The complex development of the human nervous system has been traditionally studied using a combination of animal models, human post-mortem brain tissue, and human genetics studies.  However, there has been a lack of experimental human cellular models that would allow for a more precise elucidation of the intricate dynamics of early human brain development. The development of stem cell technologies, both embryonic and induced pluripotent stem cells, has given neuroscientists access to the previously inaccessible early stages of human brain development.  In particular, the recent development of three-dimensional culturing methodologies provides a platform to study the differentiation of stem cells in both normal development and disease states in a more in-vivo like context.  Three-dimensional neural models or cerebral organoids possess an innate advantage over two-dimensional neural cultures as they can recapitulate tissue organization and cell type diversity that resemble the developing brain.  Brain organoids also provide the exciting opportunity to model the integration of different brain regions in vitro.  Furthermore, recent advances in the differentiation of non-neuronal tissue from stem cells provides the opportunity to study the interaction between the developing nervous system and other non-neuronal systems that impact neuronal function.  In this review, we discuss the potential and limitations of the organoid system to study in vitro neurological diseases that arise in the neuroendocrine and the enteric nervous system or from interactions with the immune system.</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: The Neural Correlate Difference Between Positive and Negative Awe</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2019.00206</link>
	<content:encoded>Awe is an emotional response to perceptually vast stimuli that transcend current frames of reference. Narrative and experimental work has characterized two distinct variants of awe: positive and negative; however, little is known about the structural neural basis associated with the differences of these two variants of awe. In this study, we investigated the structural neural basis of positive and negative awe underlying individual differences among 62 young healthy adults. Specifically, we assessed the association between regional gray matter volume (rGMV) and the two different variants of awe using the voxel-based morphometry (VBM). A partial correlation analysis was conducted to examine the relationship between rGMV and behavioral positive and negative awe, while controlling for sex, age and total GMV. VBM indicated that positive awe was positively correlated with GMV in the precuneus, and negatively correlated with GMV in the left fusiform and the right calcarine. Negative awe was negatively correlated with GMV in the left and right insula, and the left superior temporal gyrus. These results provide a neural explanation for the differences of these two variants of awe.</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neural Circuits | New and Recent Articles: Pattern Motion Processing by MT Neurons</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncir.2019.00043</link>
	<content:encoded>Based on stimulation with plaid patterns, neurons in the Middle Temporal (MT) area of primate visual cortex are divided into two types: pattern and component cells. The prevailing theory suggests that pattern selectivity results from the summation of the outputs of component cells as part of a hierarchical visual pathway. We present a computational model of the visual pathway from primary visual cortex (V1) to MT that suggests an alternate model where the progression from component to pattern selectivity is not required. Using standard orientation-selective V1 cells, end-stopped V1 cells, and V1 cells with extra-classical receptive fields (RFs) as inputs to MT, the model shows that the degree of pattern or component preference in MT could arise from the relative strengths of the three V1 input types. Dominance of end-stopped V1 neurons in the model leads to pattern selectivity in MT, while dominance of V1 cells with extra-classical RFs result in component selectivity. This model may assist in designing experiments to further understand motion processing mechanisms in primate MT.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Mapping the neural circuit facilitates understanding the brain’s working mechanism. Pseudorabies virus (Bartha stain) as a tracer can infect neurons and retrogradely transport in neural circuits. To illuminate the network, tracers express reporter genes at high level are needed. In this study, we optimized the expression level of reporter gene, and constructed two new retrograde trans-multisynaptic tracers PRV531 and PRV724，which separately expresses more robust green and red fluorescent proteins than the existing retrograde tracers PRV152 and PRV614. The PRV531 and PRV724 can be used for mapping the neural circuit of central nervous system and peripheral nervous system. Overall, our work adds two valuable tracers into the toolbox for mapping neural circuit.</content:encoded>

	<title>RSS PAP: Prodromes and Preclinical Detection of Brain Diseases: Surveying the Ethical Landscape of Predicting Brain Health</title>
	<link>http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0439-18.2019v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;The future of medicine lies in disease modification and prevention. The science of preclinical detection is young, but moving rapidly. Preclinical interventions offer the hope to decrease the severity of a disease or delay the development of a disorder substantially. With such promise, the research and practice of detecting brain disorders at a preclinical stage present unique ethical challenges, challenges that must be addressed to ensure the benefit of these technologies. Direct brain interventions have potential to impact not just what a patient has but who they are and who they could become. Further receiving an assessment for a preclinical or prodromal state has potential to impact perceptions about capacity, autonomy and personhood and could become entangled with stigma and discrimination. Discussion of the risks and benefits of the emerging technology will focus on how to ensure beneficence by presenting the limitations of preclinical detection and by contextualizing the risk associated with preclinical status. Exploring ethical issues alongside and integrated into the experimental design and research of these technologies is critical. This review will highlight ethical issues attendant to the current and near future states of preclinical detection across the life span, specifically as it relates to autism spectrum disorder (ASD), schizophrenia, and Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Preclinical interventions in developing brain disorders offer the strongest promise of delaying, modifying, or preventing the development of clinical disorders. Although promising, intervening at early stages in disorders inherently linked to identity and personhood presents unique ethical challenges. These challenges must be addressed before the practices are implemented. Both the treatment and the diagnosis itself have the potential to profoundly impact patients. We contextualize the risk of diagnosing preclinical states and present the limitations of preclinical interventions to guide research and policy as the field of preclinical detection rapidly expands.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Spinal Interleukin-1β Inhibits Astrocyte Cytochrome P450c17 Expression Which Controls the Development of Mechanical Allodynia in a Mouse Model of Neuropathic Pain</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2019.00153</link>
	<content:encoded>We have recently demonstrated that sciatic nerve injury increases the expression of spinal cytochrome P450c17, a key neurosteroidogenic enzyme, which plays a critical role in the development of peripheral neuropathic pain. However, the modulatory mechanisms responsible for the expression of spinal P450c17 have yet to be examined. Here we investigated the possible involvement of interleukin-1β (IL-1β) in altering P450c17 expression during the induction phase of neuropathic pain. Neuropathic pain was produced by chronic constriction injury (CCI) of the right sciatic nerve in mice and mechanical allodynia was evaluated in the hind paws using a von-Frey filament (0.16 g). Western blotting and immunohistochemistry were performed to assess the expression of spinal IL-1β, interleukin-1 receptor type 1 (IL-1R1), P450c17, and GFAP. Spinal IL-1β was significantly increased on day 1 post-surgery and its receptor, IL-1R1 was expressed in GFAP-positive astrocytes. Intrathecal administration of the recombinant interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra, 20 ng) on days 0 and 1 post-surgery enhanced GFAP expression on day 1 post-surgery and induced an early increase in P450c17 expression in astrocytes, but not in neurons. Administration of IL-1β (10 ng) on days 0 and 1 post-surgery blocked the enhancement of both spinal P450c17 and GFAP expression induced by IL-1ra (20 ng) administration. Intrathecal administration of IL-1ra (20 ng) on days 0 to 3 post-surgery also facilitated the CCI-induced development of mechanical allodynia, and this early developed pain was dose-dependently attenuated by the administration of the P450c17 inhibitor, ketoconazole (1, 3 or 10 nmol) or the astrocyte metabolic inhibitor, fluorocitrate (0.01, 0.03 or 0.1 nmol). These results demonstrate that early increases in spinal IL-1β temporally inhibit astrocyte P450c17 expression and astrocyte activation ultimately controlling the development of mechanical allodynia induced by peripheral nerve injury. These findings imply that spinal IL-1β plays an important role as an early, but transient, control mechanism in the development of peripheral neuropathic pain via the inhibition of astrocyte P450c17 expression and astrocyte activation.</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Brain Imaging Methods section | New and Recent Articles: Resting State Dynamic Functional Connectivity in Neurodegenerative Conditions: A Review of Magnetic Resonance Imaging Findings</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00657</link>
	<content:encoded>In the last few decades, brain functional connectivity (FC) has been extensively assessed using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (RS-fMRI), which is able to identify temporally correlated brain regions known as RS functional networks. Fundamental insights into the pathophysiology of several neurodegenerative conditions have been provided by studies in this field. However, most of these studies are based on the assumption of temporal stationarity of RS functional networks, despite recent evidence suggests that the spatial patterns of RS networks may change periodically over the time of an fMRI scan acquisition. For this reason, dynamic functional connectivity (dFC) analysis has been recently implemented and proposed in order to consider the temporal fluctuations of FC. These approaches hold promise to provide fundamental information for the identification of pathophysiological and diagnostic markers in the vast field of neurodegenerative diseases. This review summarizes the main currently available approaches for dFC analysis and reports their recent applications for the assessment of the most common neurodegenerative conditions, including Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, dementia with Lewy bodies, and frontotemporal dementia. Critical state-of-the-art findings, limitations, and future perspectives regarding the analysis of dFC in these diseases are provided from both a clinical and a technical point of view.</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Neurodegeneration section | New and Recent Articles: Distribution and Relative Abundance of S100 Proteins in the Brain of the APP23 Alzheimer’s Disease Model Mice</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00640</link>
	<content:encoded>Increasing evidence links proteins of the S100 family to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). S100 proteins are EF-hand calcium-binding proteins with intra- and extracellular functions related to regulation of proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, and trace metal homeostasis, and are important modulators of inflammatory responses. For example, S100A6, S100A8 and S100B expression levels were found increased in inflammatory diseases, but also neurodegenerative disorders, and S100A8/A9 complexes may provide a mechanistic link between amyloid-beta (Aβ) plaque formation and neuroinflammation. On the other hand, S100B, a proinflammatory protein that is chronically up-regulated in AD and whose elevation precedes plaque formation, was recently shown to suppress Aβ aggregation. Here, we report expression of S100A6 and S100B in astrocytes and less so in neurons, and low level of expression of S100A8 in both neurons and glial cells in vitro. In vivo, S100A8 expression is almost absent in the brain of aged wildtype mice, while S100A6 and S100B are expressed in all brain regions and most prominently in the cortex and cerebellum. S100B seems to be enriched in Purkinje cells of the cerebellum. In contrast, in the brain of APP23 mice, a mouse model for Alzheimer’s disease, S100B, S100A6 and S100A8 show co-localization with Aβ plaques, compatible with astrocyte activation, and the expression level of S100A8 is increased in neural cells. While S100A6 and S100B are enriched in the periphery of plaques where less fibrillar Aβ is found, S100A8 is more intense within the center of the inclusion. In vitro assays show that, similarly to S100B, S100A6 and S100A8 also delay Aβ aggregation suggesting a regulatory action over protein aggregation. We posit that elevated expression levels and overlapping spatial distribution of brain S100 proteins and plaques translates functional relationships between these inflammatory mediators and AD pathophysiology processes that uncover important molecular mechanisms linking the aggregation and neuroinflammation cascades.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) has indicated disruptions in functional connectivity in older adults (OA) relative to young adults (YA). While age differences in cortical networks are well studied, differences in subcortical networks are poorly understood. Both the cerebellum and the basal ganglia are of particular interest given their role in cognitive and motor functions, and work in nonhuman primates has demonstrated direct reciprocal connections between these regions. Here, our goal was twofold. First, we were interested in delineating connectivity patterns between distinct regions of the cerebellum and basal ganglia, known to have topologically distinct connectivity patterns with cortex. Our second goal was to quantify age differences in these cerebellar–striatal circuits. We performed a targeted rs-fMRI analysis of the cerebellum and basal ganglia in 33 YA and 31 OA individuals. In the YA, we found significant connectivity both within and between the cerebellum and basal ganglia, in patterns supporting semi-discrete circuits that may differentially subserve motor and cognitive performance. We found a shift in connectivity, from one of synchrony in YA, to asynchrony in OA, resulting in substantial age differences. Connectivity was also associated with behavior. These findings significantly advance our understanding of cerebellar–basal ganglia interactions in the human brain.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

A good TD/BU balance is essential to be both task-efficient and aware of our environment, yet it is rarely investigated. Oscillatory activity is a novel method to probe the attentional dynamics with evidence that gamma activity (&amp;gt;30 Hz) could signal BU processing and thus would be a good candidate to support the activation of the ventral BU attention network. Magnetoencephalography data were collected from 21 young adults performing the competitive attention task, which enables simultaneous investigation of BU and TD attentional mechanisms. Distracting sounds elicited an increase in gamma activity in regions of the BU ventral network. TD attention modulated these gamma responses in regions of the inhibitory cognitive control system: the medial prefrontal and anterior cingulate cortices. Finally, distracting-sound-induced gamma activity was synchronous between the auditory cortices and several distant brain regions, notably the lPFC. We provide novel insight into the role of gamma activity 1) in supporting the activation of the ventral BU attention network and 2) in subtending the TD/BU attention balance in the PFC.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

fear-learning models posit that amygdala–infralimbic connections facilitate extinction while amygdala–prelimbic prefrontal connections mediate fear expression. Analogous amygdala–prefrontal circuitry between rodents and primates is not established. Using paired small volumes of neural tracers injected into the perigenual anterior cingulate cortex (pgACC; areas 24b and 32; a potential homologue to rodent prelimbic cortex) and subgenual anterior cingulate cortex (sgACC, areas 25 and 14c; a potential homologue to rodent infralimbic cortex) in a single hemisphere, we mapped amygdala projections to the pgACC and sgACC within single subjects. All injections resulted in dense retrograde labeling specifically within the intermediate division of the basal nucleus (Bi) and the magnocellular division of the accessory basal nucleus (ABmc). Areal analysis revealed a bias for connectivity with the sgACC, with the ABmc showing a greater bias than the Bi. Double fluorescence analysis revealed that sgACC and pgACC projections were intermingled within the Bi and ABmc, where a proportion were double labeled. We conclude that amygdala inputs to the ACC largely originate from the Bi and ABmc, preferentially connect to the sgACC, and that a subset collaterally project to both sgACC and pgACC. These findings advance our understanding of fear extinction and fear expression circuitry across species. &lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>RSS PAP: Vasopressin cells in the rodent olfactory bulb resemble non-bursting superficial tufted cells and are primarily inhibited upon olfactory nerve stimulation</title>
	<link>http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0431-18.2019v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;The intrinsic vasopressin system of the olfactory bulb is involved in social odor processing and consists of glutamatergic vasopressin cells (VPCs) located at the medial border of the glomerular layer. To characterize VPCs in detail, we combined various electrophysiological, neuroanatomical and two-photon Ca2+ imaging techniques in acute bulb slices from juvenile transgenic rats with eGFP-labelled VPCs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;VPCs showed regular non-bursting firing patterns, and displayed slower membrane time constants and higher input resistances versus other glutamatergic tufted cell types. VPC axons spread deeply into the external plexiform and superficial granule cell layer. Axonal projections fell into two subclasses, with either denser local columnar collaterals or longer-ranging single projections running laterally within the internal plexiform layer and deeper within the granule cell layer. VPCs always featured lateral dendrites and a tortuous apical dendrite that innervated a single glomerulus with a homogenously branching tuft. These tufts lacked Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; transients in response to single somatically-evoked action potentials and showed a moderate Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; increase upon prolonged action potential trains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Notably, electrical olfactory nerve stimulation did not result in synaptic excitation of VPCs, but triggered substantial GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptor-mediated IPSPs that masked excitatory barrages with yet longer latency. Exogenous vasopressin application reduced those IPSPs, as well as olfactory-nerve evoked EPSPs recorded from external tufted cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In summary, VPCs can be classified as non-bursting, vertical superficial tufted cells. Moreover, our findings imply that sensory input alone cannot trigger excitation of VPCs, arguing for specific additional pathways for excitation or disinhibition in social contexts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance statement&lt;/b&gt; Efficient sensing of conspecific odor signatures is essential for most rodent social behavior. Although olfactory bulb vasopressin was shown to be a potent facilitator of social odor processing, little is known on the cellular substrate of the intrinsic vasopressin system. Here we provide a detailed characterization of the anatomical and electrophysiological properties of the bulbar vasopressin cells. While we also identify several targets of vasopressin action, we find that stimulation of the sensory inputs to the bulb results primarily in vasopressin cell inhibition, implying that excitation of the bulbar vasopressin system requires additional still unknown excitatory or dis-inhibitory inputs which might confer social specificity. These insights may complement the knowledge on vasopressinergic modulation of social stimuli in limbic brain structures.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>RSS PAP: 3D Electron Microscopy study of synaptic organization of the normal human transentorhinal cortex and its possible alterations in Alzheimers disease</title>
	<link>http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0140-19.2019v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;The transentorhinal cortex (TEC) is an obliquely oriented cortex located in the medial temporal lobe and, together with the entorhinal cortex, is one of the first affected areas in Alzheimer’s disease (AD). One of the most widely accepted hypothesis is that synaptopathy (synaptic alterations and loss) represents the major structural correlate of the cognitive decline observed in AD. However, very few electron microscope studies are available; the most common method to estimate synaptic density indirectly is by counting —at the light microscopic level— immunoreactive puncta using synaptic markers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To investigate synaptic morphology and possible alterations related to AD, a detailed three-dimensional (3D) ultrastructural analysis using focused ion beam/scanning electron microscopy (FIB/SEM) was performed in the neuropil of layer II of the TEC in human brain samples from non-demented subjects and AD patients. Evaluation of the proportion and shape of asymmetric and symmetric synapses (AS and SS, respectively) targeting spines or dendritic shafts was performed using 3D reconstructions of every synapse. The 3D analysis of 4722 synapses revealed that the preferable targets were spine heads for AS and dendritic shafts for SS, both in control and AD cases. However, in AD patients, we observed a reduction in the percentage of synapses targeting spine heads. Regarding the shape of synapses, in both control cases and AD samples, the vast majority of synapses had a macular shape, followed by perforated or horseshoe-shaped synapses, with fragmented synapses being the least frequent type. Moreover, comparisons showed an increased number of fragmented AS in AD patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Determination of postsynaptic targets, shape and size of the synaptic junctions provide critical data on synaptic functionality. However, as far as we know, detailed 3D synaptic morphology and identification of postsynaptic targets in serial sections have not been performed before in the human brain. The present study represents the first attempt to unveil the synaptic organization of the neuropil of the human brain at the ultrastructural level using 3D electron microscopy. Our present results provide a new, large, quantitative ultrastructure dataset of the synaptic organization of the normal human cortex and of the synaptic alterations that occur in AD. Thus, these results may help to understand the relationship between alterations of the synaptic circuits and the cognitive deterioration in AD.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>RSS PAP: In-vivo quantitative image analysis of age-related morphological changes of C. elegans neurons reveals a correlation between neurite bending and novel neurite outgrowths</title>
	<link>http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0014-19.2019v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;The aging of the human brain in the absence of diseases is accompanied by subtle changes of neuronal morphology, such as dendrite restructuring, neuronal sprouting, and synaptic deteriorations, rather than neurodegeneration or gross deterioration. Similarly, the nervous system of &lt;i&gt;C. elegans&lt;/i&gt; does not show neurodegeneration or gross deterioration during normal aging, but displays subtle alterations in neuronal morphology. The occurrence of these age-dependent abnormalities is stochastic and dynamic, which poses a major challenge to fully capture them for quantitative comparison. Here, we developed a semi-automated pipeline for quantitative image analysis of these features during aging. We employed and evaluated this pipeline herein to reproduce findings from previous studies using visual inspection of neuronal morphology. Importantly, our approach can also quantify additional features, such as soma volume, the length of neurite outgrowths, and their location along the aged neuron. We found that, during aging, the soma of neurons decreases in volume, whereas the number and length of neurite outgrowths from the soma both increase. Long-lived animals showed less decrease in soma volume, fewer and shorter neurite outgrowths, and protection against abnormal sharp bends preferentially localized at the distal part of the dendrites during aging. We found a correlation of sharp bends with neurite outgrowth, suggesting the hypothesis that sharp bends might proceed neurite outgrowths. Thus, our semi-automated pipeline can help researchers to obtain and analyze quantitative datasets of this stochastic process for comparison across genotypes and to identify correlations to facilitate the generation of novel hypothesis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; The etiology of age-dependent morphological changes in neurons remains elusive. The heterogeneity of these refinements requires an unbiased quantitative acquisition and analysis to pin-point the molecular underpinning of these structural changes. Here, we developed a work-flow and adopted algorithms to allow researchers to capture and analyse these age-dependent changes of &lt;i&gt;C. elegans&lt;/i&gt; touch receptor neurons &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. Increasing the traceability and quantification of these stochastic changes will aid researchers to gain mechanistic insights into the underlying biology of these age-dependent morphological changes in aging neurons.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding molecules that regulate a large number of genes for post-transcriptional repression by recognizing semi-complementary target sequences that are usually located in the 3′ UTR sequence of the mRNA. Altered miRNA expression has been associated with several pathological processes, including polyglutamine (Poly Q) diseases. Specific expression patterns in the brain parenchyma and circulating fluids have been highlighted as potential biomarkers for Poly Q disease diagnosis and prognosis. Several miRNAs have been consistently identified in various diseases, including Huntington’s disease (HD) and spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA). In this review, we describe the emerging role of miRNAs in Poly Q diseases and provide an overview on general miRNA biology, implications in pathophysiology, and their potential roles as future biomarkers and applications for therapy.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00637</link>
	<content:encoded>Cerebral ischemia is a complex pathology involving a cascade of cellular mechanisms, which deregulate proteostasis and lead to neuronal death. Proteostasis refers to the equilibrium between protein synthesis, folding and transport; and protein degradation. Within the brain proteostasis plays key roles in learning and memory by controlling protein synthesis and degradation. Two important pathways are implicated in proteostasis’ regulation: the unfolded protein response (UPR) and macroautophagy (called hereafter autophagy). Both are necessary for cell survival, however their overactivation in time or intensity often leads to cell death. Moreover, UPR and autophagy can activate and potentiate each other to worsen the issue of cerebral ischemia. Better comprehension of autophagy and ER stress will allow therapeutic strategies for stroke both at the acute phase and during recovery.
The interest of this review is to summarize the latest therapeutic advances implicating ER stress or autophagy in cerebral ischemia. In addition, we discuss the interest to study proteostasis as a single pathway rather than studying either ER stress or autophagy in stroke.</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Brain Imaging Methods section | New and Recent Articles: An Integrative Way for Studying Neural Basis of Basic Emotions With fMRI</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00628</link>
	<content:encoded>A central, unresolved problem in affective neuroscience is to understand how emotions are represented in activities of the nervous system. Many studies are striving to find the localization of basic emotions in the brain but failed. Thus many psychologists suspect the specific neural loci for basic emotions, instead, some proposed that there are specific neural structures for the core affects, such as arousal and hedonic value. The reason for this widespread difference might be that basic emotions used previously can be further divided into more “basic” emotions. Here we review brain imaging data and neuropsychological data, and try to address this question with an integrative model. In this model, we argue that basic emotions are not contrary to the dimensional studies of emotions (core affects). We propose that basic emotion should locate on the axis in the dimensions of emotion, and only represent one typical core affect (arousal or valence). Therefore, we propose four basic emotions: joy-on positive axis of hedonic dimension, sadness-on negative axis of hedonic dimension, fear and anger are twin emotions and locate on the top of vertical dimensions. This new model about basic emotions and construction model of emotions is promising  to improve and reformulate neurobiological models of basic emotions.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00627</link>
	<content:encoded>Deep learning has great potential for imaging classification by extracting low to high-level features. Our aim was to train a convolution neural network (CNN) with single T2-weighted FLAIR sequence to classify different cognitive performances in patients with subcortical ischemic vascular disease (SIVD). 
Totally 217 patients with SIVD (including 52 vascular dementia (VaD), 82 vascular mild cognitive impairment (VaMCI), 83 non-cognitive impairment (NCI)) and 46 matched healthy controls (HCs) underwent MRI scans and neuropsychological assessment. 2D and 3D CNNs were trained to classify VaD, VaMCI, NCI and HCs based on FLAIR data.
For 3D-based model, loss curves of training set approached 0.017 after about 20 epochs, while the curves of testing set maintained at about 0.114. The accuracy of training set and testing set reached 99.7% and 96.9% after about 30 and 35 epochs, respectively. However, the accuracy of 2D-based model was only around 70%, which performed significantly worse than 3D-based model.
This experiment suggests us that deep learning, is a powerful and convenient method to classify different cognitive performances in SIVD by extracting the shift and scale invariant features of neuroimaging data with single FLAIR sequence. 3D-CNN is superior to 2D-CNN which proposes clinical evaluation with MRI multiplanar reformation or volume scanning.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00622</link>
	<content:encoded>Hundreds of millions of general anesthesia are performed each year on patients all over the world. Among these patients, 0.1-0.2 % are victims of Accidental Awareness during General Anesthesia (AAGA), i.e. an unexpected awakening during a surgical procedure under general anesthesia. Although anesthesiologists try to closely monitor patients using various techniques to prevent this terrifying phenomenon, there is currently no efficient solution to accurately detect its occurrence. We propose the conception of an innovative passive brain-computer interface (BCI) based on an intention of movement to prevent AAGA. Indeed, patients typically try to move to alert the medical  staff during an AAGA, only to discover that they are unable to. First, we examine the challenges of such a BCI, i.e. the lack of a trigger to facilitate when to look for an intention to move, as well as the necessity for a high classification accuracy. Then, we present a solution that incorporates Median Nerve Stimulation (MNS). We investigate the specific modulations that MNS causes in the motor cortex and confirm that they can be altered by an intention of movement. Finally, we perform experiments on 16 healthy participants to assess whether an MI-based BCI using MNS is able to generate high classification accuracies. Our results show that MNS may provide a foundation for an innovative BCI that would allow the detection of AAGA.</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Brain Imaging Methods section | New and Recent Articles: Impaired Motor Skill Acquisition Using Mirror Visual Feedback Improved by Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) in Patients With Parkinson’s Disease</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00602</link>
	<content:encoded>Recent non-invasive brain stimulation techniques in combination with motor training can enhance neuroplasticity and learning. It is reasonable to assume that such neuroplasticity-based interventions constitute a useful rehabilitative tool for patients with Parkinson’s Disease (PD). Regarding motor skill training, many kinds of tasks that do not involve real motor movements have been applied to PD patients. The purpose of this study is to elucidate whether motor skill training using mirror visual feedback (MVF) is useful to patients with PD in order to improve untrained hand performance dependent on the time course of training; and whether MVF combined with anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) over primary motor cortex (M1) causes an additional effect based on increased motor cortical excitability. Eighteen right-handed patients with PD in the off-medication state and 10 age-matched healthy subjects (HS) performed four sessions of right-hand ball rotation using MVF (intervention) on two separate days, one week apart (Day1 and Day2). HS subjects received only sham stimulation. The intervention included four sessions of motor-skill training using MVF for 20 minutes comprised of four sets of training for 30 seconds each. PD patients were randomly divided into two intervention groups without or with anodal tDCS over the right M1 contralateral to the untrained hand. As the behavior evaluation, the number of ball rotations of the left hand was counted before (pre) and immediately after (post) intervention on both days (pre Day1, post Day1, pre Day2, and post Day2). Motor evoked potential (MEP), input-output function, and cortical silent period were recorded to evaluate the motor cortical excitatory and inhibitory system in M1 pre Day1 and post Day2. The number of ball rotations of the left hand and the facilitation of MEP by intervention were significantly impaired in patients with PD compared to HS. In contrast, if anodal tDCS was applied to right M1 of patients with PD, the number of ball rotations in accordance with I-O function at 150% intensity was significantly increased after Day1 and retained until Day2. This finding may help provide a new strategy for neurorehabilitation improving task-specific motor memory without real motor movements in PD.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00561</link>
	<content:encoded>Despite the high prevalence and devastating outcome, only a few treatment options for cerebral ischemic stroke exist. Based on the nitric oxide (NO)-stimulating capacity of Non-Pulsed Sinusoidal Electromagnetic Field (NP-SEMF) and the possible neuroprotective role of NO in ischemic stroke, we hypothesized that NP-SEMF is able to enhance survival and neurological outcome in a rat model of cerebral ischemia. The animals in which ischemic injury was induced by occlusion of both common carotid arteries, received daily 20 minutes NP-SEMF of either 10 or 60 Hz for 4 days. NP-SEMF dramatically increased survival, reduced the size of the infarcted brain area and significantly improved the neurological score of the surviving rats. Corresponding to previous reports, NP-SEMF was able to induce NO production in vitro. The importance of NO as a key signaling molecule was highlighted by inhibition of the NP-SEMF beneficial effects in the rat stroke model after blocking NO synthase (NOS). Our results indicate for the first time that NP-SEMF exposure (13.5mT at 60 Hz and 10 Hz) improves the survival and neurological outcome of rats subjected to cerebral ischemia and that this effect is mediated by NO, underlining the great therapeutic potential of NP-SEMF as therapy for ischemic stroke.</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroanatomy | New and Recent Articles: A Role for the Claustrum in Salience Processing?</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnana.2019.00064</link>
	<content:encoded>The claustrum (CLA) is a subcortical structure, present only in mammals, whose function remains uncertain. Previously, using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) in awake head-fixed rats, we found evidence that the CLA is part of the rodent homolog of the default mode network (Smith et al., 2017). This network emerged as strong functional connections between the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), mediodorsal (MD) thalamus, and CLA in the awake state, which were not present following administration of isoflurane anesthesia. In the present report, we review evidence indicating that the rodent CLA also has connections with structures identified in the rodent homolog of the salience network, a circuit that directs attention towards the most relevant stimuli among a multitude of sensory inputs (Seeley et al., 2007; Menon and Uddin, 2010). In humans, this circuit consists of functional connections between the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and a region that encompasses both the CLA and insular cortex. We further go on to review the similarities and differences between the functional and anatomical connections of the CLA and insula in rodents using both rs-fMRI and neuroanatomical tracing, respectively. We analyze in detail the connectivity of the CLA with the cingulate cortex, which is a major node in the salience network and has been shown to modulate attention. When considered with other recent behavior and physiology studies, the data reveal a role for the CLA in salience-guided orienting. More specifically, we hypothesize that limbic information from mPFC, MD thalamus, and the basolateral amygdala are integrated by the CLA to guide modality-related regions of motor and sensory cortex in directing attention towards relevant (i.e. salient) sensory events.</content:encoded>

In the present study, we described a protocol of Golgi-Cox Staining for Cryosection, with the modified cryosection protection solution based on the Golgi –Cox method, which makes cryosection easily applied  in the section of the Golgi-Cox impregnated tissue. Our methods provide a low-cost and simple option for Golgi staining, and it will facilitate researchers to get fine Golgi staining results for neuronal architecture studies.</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroanatomy | New and Recent Articles: Patterned Vascularization of Embryonic Mouse Forebrain, and Neuromeric Topology of Major Human Subarachnoidal Arterial Branches: A Prosomeric Mapping</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnana.2019.00059</link>
	<content:encoded>The prosomeric brain model contemplates progressive regionalization of the central nervous system from a molecular and morphological ontogenetic perspective. It defines the forebrain axis relative to the notochord, and contemplates intersecting longitudinal (zonal, columnar) and transversal (neuromeric) patterning mechanisms. A checkboard pattern of histogenetic units of the neural wall results, where each unit is differentially fated by an unique profile of active genes. These natural neural units later expand their radial dimension during neurogenesis, histogenesis, and correlative differential morphogenesis. This fundamental topologic framework is shared by all vertebrates, as a Bauplan, each lineage varying in some subtle aspects. So far the prosomeric model has been applied only to neural structures, but we attempt here a prosomeric analysis of the hypothesis that major vessels invade the brain wall in patterns that are congruent with its intrinsic natural developmental units, as postulated in the prosomeric model. Anatomic and embryologic studies of brain blood vessels have classically recorded a conserved pattern of branches (thus the conventional terminology), and clinical experience has discovered a standard topography of many brain arterial terminal fields. Such results were described under assumptions of the columnar forebrain model, prevalent during the last century, but this is found insufficient in depth and explanatory power in the modern molecular scenario. We have thus explored the possibility that brain vascularization in rodents and humans may relate systematically to genoarchitectonic forebrain subdivisions contemplated in the prosomeric model. Specifically, we examined first whether early vascular invasion of some molecularly characterized prosomeric domains shows heterochrony. We indeed found a heterochronic pattern of vascular invasion that distinguishes between adjacent brain areas with differential molecular profiles. We next mapped topologically on the prosomeric model the major arterial branches serving the human brain. The results of this approach bear on the possibility of a developmentally-based modern arterial terminology.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Shank3, a postsynaptic scaffolding protein involved in regulating excitatory synapse assembly and function, has been implicated in several brain disorders, including autism spectrum disorders (ASD), Phelan-McDermid syndrome, schizophrenia, intellectual disability, and mania. Here we generated and characterized a Shank3 knock-in mouse line carrying the Q321R mutation (Shank3Q321R mice) identified in a human individual with ASD that affects the ankyrin repeat region (ARR) domain of the Shank3 protein. Homozygous Shank3Q321R/Q321R mice show a selective decrease in the level of Shank3a, an ARR-containing protein variant, but not other variants. CA1 pyramidal neurons in the Shank3Q321R/Q321R hippocampus show decreased neuronal excitability but normal excitatory and inhibitory synaptic transmission. Behaviorally, Shank3Q321R/Q321R mice show moderately enhanced self-grooming and anxiolytic-like behavior, but normal locomotion, social interaction, and object recognition and contextual fear memory. In addition, these mice show abnormal electroencephalogram (EEG) patterns and decreased susceptibility to induced seizures. These results indicate that the Q321R mutation alters Shank3 protein stability, neuronal excitability, repetitive and anxiety-like behavior, EEG patterns, and seizure susceptibility in mice.</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Neurogenesis section | New and Recent Articles: A Critical Period for the Development of Schizophrenia-Like Pathology by Aberrant Postnatal Neurogenesis</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00635</link>
	<content:encoded>Schizophrenia is a complex and serious mental disorder, and patients with schizophrenia are characterized by psychological hallucinations, deregulated emotionality, and cognitive impairment. Evidence indicated that postnatal neurogenesis in the hippocampus is profoundly impaired in schizophrenic individuals but the role of such dysregulated neurodevelopmental processing in the pathophysiological progress of schizophrenia has not been well investigated. Here in this study, by using the rodent model of schizophrenia through maternal immune activation of poly (I:C) injection, we aimed to examine whether the postnatal neurogenesis might be involved in the development of schizophrenia-like pathology. Through the comprehensive behavioral analyses of multiple core symptoms of schizophrenia at different developmental stages (six-, nine-, and twelve-weeks after birth) of the affected offspring, we found a delayed onset of schizophrenia-like behaviors in poly (I:C) animals through the development. Meanwhile, there is an age-dependent alteration of postnatal neurogenesis in the poly (I:C) animals along different development stages by which the aberrant dendritic elaboration functionally correlated with the schizophrenia-like symptoms in nine-week old of age for the animals. Interestingly, increase in the neurogenesis during a critical period of neurodevelopment exacerbates the schizophrenia-like pathology. Conversely, temporal suppression of aberrant postnatal neurogenesis during the same period of neurodevelopment ameliorates the occurrence of schizophrenia-like symptoms. Together, these findings strongly suggested the aberrant dendritic growth of postnatal neurogenesis during the critical time window of development is essential for controlling the pathophysiological progression of schizophrenia-like symptoms. And pharmacological treatments that adjust these abnormalities may provide potential therapeutic benefits toward patients with schizophrenia in clinic.</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Neurodegeneration section | New and Recent Articles: Altered Insulin Signaling in Alzheimer’s Disease Brain – Special Emphasis on PI3K-Akt Pathway</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00629</link>
	<content:encoded>Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and type 2 diabetes (T2D) are both diseases with increasing prevalence in aging populations. T2D, characterized by insulin resistance and defective insulin signaling, is a common co-morbidity and a risk factor for AD, increasing the risk approximately two- to four-fold. Insulin exerts a wide variety of effects as a growth factor as well as by regulating glucose, fatty acid and protein metabolism. Certain lifestyle factors, physical inactivity and typical Western diet (TWD) containing high fat and high sugar are strongly associated with insulin resistance and T2D. The PI3K-Akt signaling pathway is a major mediator of effects of insulin and plays a crucial role in T2D pathogenesis. Decreased levels of phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase (PI3K) subunits as well as blunted Akt kinase phosphorylation have been observed in the AD brain, characterized by amyloid-β and tau pathologies. Furthermore, AD mouse models fed with TWD have shown to display altered levels of PI3K subunits. How impaired insulin-PI3K-Akt signaling in peripheral tissues or in the central nervous system (CNS) affects the development or progression of AD is currently poorly understood. Interestingly, enhancement of PI3K-Akt signaling in the CNS by intranasal insulin (IN) treatment has been shown to improve memory in vivo in mice and in human trials. Insulin is known to augment neuronal growth and synapse formation through the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway. However, PI3K-Akt pathway mediates signaling related to different functions also in other cell types, like microglia and astrocytes. In this review, we will discuss the most prominent molecular mechanisms related to the PI3K-Akt pathway in AD and how T2D and altered insulin signaling may affect the pathogenesis of AD.</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Brain Imaging Methods section | New and Recent Articles: Objective and Automated Detection of Diffuse White Matter Abnormality in Preterm Infants Using Deep Convolutional Neural Networks</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00610</link>
	<content:encoded>Diffuse white matter abnormality (DWMA), or diffuse excessive high signal intensity is observed in 50-80% of very preterm infants at term-equivalent age. It is subjectively defined as higher than normal signal intensity in periventricular and subcortical white matter in comparison to normal unmyelinated white matter on T2-weighted MRI images. Despite the well-documented presence of DWMA, it remains debatable whether DWMA represents pathological tissue injury or a transient developmental phenomenon. Manual tracing of DWMA exhibits poor reliability and reproducibility and unduly increases image processing time. Thus, objective and ideally automatic assessment is critical to accurately elucidate the biologic nature of DWMA. We propose a deep learning approach to automatically identify DWMA regions on T2-weighted MRI images. Specifically, we formulated DWMA detection as an image voxel classification task; that is, the voxels on T2-weighted images are treated as samples and exclusively assigned as DWMA or normal white matter voxel classes. To utilize the spatial information of individual voxels, small image patches centered on the given voxels are retrieved. A deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) model was developed to differentiate DWMA and normal voxels. We tested our deep CNN in multiple validation experiments. First, we examined DWMA detection accuracy of our CNN model using computer simulations. This was followed by in vivo assessments in a cohort of very preterm infants (N=95) using cross-validation and holdout validation. Finally, we tested our approach on an independent preterm cohort (N=28) to externally validate our model. Our deep CNN model achieved Dice similarity index values ranging from 0.85 to 0.99 for DWMA detection in the aforementioned validation experiments. Our proposed deep CNN model exhibited significantly better performance than other popular machine learning models. We present an objective and automated approach for accurately identifying DWMA that may facilitate the clinical diagnosis of DWMA in very preterm infants.</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Neurogenesis section | New and Recent Articles: New Neurons in the Post-ischemic and Injured Brain: Migrating or Resident?</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00588</link>
	<content:encoded>The endogenous potential of adult neurogenesis is of particular interest for the development of new strategies for recovery after stroke and traumatic brain injury. These pathological conditions affect endogenous neurogenesis in two aspects. On the one hand, injury usually initiates the migration of neuronal precursors (NPCs) to the lesion area from the already existing, in physiological conditions, neurogenic niche – the ventricular-subventricular zone (V-SVZ) near the lateral ventricles. On the other hand, recent studies have convincingly demonstrated the local generation of new neurons near lesion areas in different brain locations. The striatum, cortex, and hippocampal CA1 region are considered to be locations of such new neurogenic zones in the damaged brain. This review focuses on the relative contribution of two types of NPCs of different origin, resident population in new neurogenic zones and cells migrating from the lateral ventricles, to post-stroke or post-traumatic enhancement of neurogenesis. The migratory pathways of NPCs have also been considered. In addition, the review highlights the advantages and limitations of different methodological approaches to the definition of NPC location and tracking of new neurons. In general, we suggest that despite the considerable number of studies, we still lack a comprehensive understanding of neurogenesis in the damaged brain. We believe that the advancement of methods for in vivo visualization and longitudinal observation of neurogenesis in the brain could fundamentally change the current situation in this field.</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neural Circuits | New and Recent Articles: Abnormal Interactions of the Salience Network, Central Executive Network, and Default-Mode Network in Patients With Different Cognitive Impairment Loads Caused by Leukoaraiosis</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncir.2019.00042</link>
	<content:encoded>Leukoaraiosis (LA) is considered to be associated with cognitive impairment in the older people. This alteration can be reflected in functional connectivity (FC) based on resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI). In this study, we used the triple brain network model to investigate altered changes in FC for LA with different cognitive impairment loads determined by the Mini Mental State Exam (MMSE) and Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR). Eighty-three subjects were divided into four groups based on their clinical diagnosis: the LA-normal cognition group (LA-NC) (n=14, 6 males), LA with mild cognitive impairment (LA-MCI) group (n=27, 13 males), LA with vascular dementia (LA-VD) group (n=12, 6 males) and matched healthy controls (HC) (n=30, 11 males). The triple brain network model includes the default-mode network (DMN), salience networks (SN) and the central executive network (CEN), which were extracted with independent components analysis (ICA) and region of interest (ROI)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    based analysis using the REST toolbox. LA group presented decreased FC for all these three brain networks, compared with matched healthy controls. For inter-brain network analysis, there were decreased negative FC between the SN and DMN in LA group. While there were enhanced inter-brain network FC between the SN and CEN as well as within the SN. The decrease of FC between SN and DMN may reflect the damage mechanism of cognitive impairment of LA, which can compensate with the enhanced inter-brain network between SN and CEN and intra-brain network FC within the SN.</content:encoded>
