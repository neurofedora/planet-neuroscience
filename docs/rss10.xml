	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: A functional substitution in the L‐aromatic amino acid decarboxylase enzyme worsens somatic symptoms via a serotonergic pathway</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25521?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heightened somatic symptoms are reported by a wide range of patients with chronic pain and have been associated with emotional distress and physical dysfunction. Despite their clinical significance, molecular mechanisms leading to their manifestation are not understood.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We used an association study design based on a curated list of 3,295 single nucleotide polymorphisms mapped to 358 genes to test somatic symptoms reporting using the Pennebaker Inventory of Limbic Languidness questionnaire from a case–control cohort of orofacial pain (n = 1,607). A replication meta‐analysis of 3 independent cohorts (n = 3,189) was followed by functional validation, including in silico molecular dynamics, in vitro enzyme assays, and measures of serotonin (5‐HT) plasma concentration.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An association with the T allele of rs11575542 coding for an arginine to glutamine substitution in the L‐aromatic amino acid decarboxylase (AADC) enzyme was replicated in a meta‐analysis of 3 independent cohorts. In a combined meta‐analysis of all cohorts, this association reached &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 6.43 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−8&lt;/sup&gt;. In silico studies demonstrated that this substitution dramatically reduces the conformational dynamics of AADC, potentially lowering its binding capacity to a cofactor. in vitro enzymatic assays showed that this substitution reduces the maximum kinetic velocity of AADC, hence lowering 5‐HT levels. Finally, plasma samples from 90 subjects showed correlation between low 5‐HT levels and heightened somatic symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using functional genomics approaches, we identified a polymorphism in the AADC enzyme that contributes to somatic symptoms through reduced levels of 5‐HT. Our findings suggest a molecular mechanism underlying the pathophysiology of somatic symptoms and opens up new treatment options targeting the serotonergic system.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Multitaper Spectral Analysis of Neuronal Spiking Activity Driven by Latent Stationary Processes. (arXiv:1906.08451v1 [eess.SP])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1906.08451</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Investigating the spectral properties of the neural covariates that underlie
spiking activity is an important problem in systems neuroscience, as it allows
to study the role of brain rhythms in cognitive functions. While the spectral
estimation of continuous time-series is a well-established domain, computing
the spectral representation of these neural covariates from spiking data sets
forth various challenges due to the intrinsic non-linearities involved. In this
paper, we address this problem by proposing a variant of the multitaper method
specifically tailored for point process data. To this end, we construct
auxiliary spiking statistics from which the eigen-spectra of the underlying
latent process can be directly inferred using maximum likelihood estimation,
and thereby the multitaper estimate can be efficiently computed. Comparison of
our proposed technique to existing methods using simulated data reveals
significant gains in terms of the bias-variance trade-off.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Extraction of hierarchical functional connectivity components in human brain using resting-state fMRI. (arXiv:1906.08365v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1906.08365</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The study of hierarchy in networks of the human brain has been of significant
interest among the researchers as numerous studies have pointed out towards a
functional hierarchical organization of the human brain. This paper provides a
novel method for the extraction of hierarchical connectivity components in the
human brain using resting-state fMRI. The method builds upon prior work of
Sparse Connectivity Patterns (SCPs) by introducing a hierarchy of sparse
overlapping patterns. The components are estimated by deep factorization of
correlation matrices generated from fMRI. The goal of the paper is to extract
interpretable hierarchical patterns using correlation matrices where a low rank
decomposition is formed by a linear combination of a high rank decomposition.
We formulate the decomposition as a non-convex optimization problem and solve
it using gradient descent algorithms with adaptive step size. We also provide a
method for the warm start of the gradient descent using singular value
decomposition. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the developed method on two
different real-world datasets by showing that multi-scale hierarchical SCPs are
reproducible between sub-samples and are more reproducible as compared to
single scale patterns. We also compare our method with existing hierarchical
community detection approaches. Our method also provides novel insight into the
functional organization of the human brain.

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: The Neural Correlate Difference Between Positive and Negative Awe</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2019.00206</link>
	<content:encoded>Awe is an emotional response to perceptually vast stimuli that transcend current frames of reference. Narrative and experimental work has characterized two distinct variants of awe: positive and negative; however, little is known about the structural neural basis associated with the differences of these two variants of awe. In this study, we investigated the structural neural basis of positive and negative awe underlying individual differences among 62 young healthy adults. Specifically, we assessed the association between regional gray matter volume (rGMV) and the two different variants of awe using the voxel-based morphometry (VBM). A partial correlation analysis was conducted to examine the relationship between rGMV and behavioral positive and negative awe, while controlling for sex, age and total GMV. VBM indicated that positive awe was positively correlated with GMV in the precuneus, and negatively correlated with GMV in the left fusiform and the right calcarine. Negative awe was negatively correlated with GMV in the left and right insula, and the left superior temporal gyrus. These results provide a neural explanation for the differences of these two variants of awe.</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: The Modulation of Gamma Oscillations by Methamphetamine in Rat Hippocampal Slices</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2019.00277</link>
	<content:encoded>Gamma frequency oscillations (γ, 30–100 Hz) have been suggested to underlie various cognitive and motor functions. Methamphetamine (MA), a commonly used recreational drug, enhances brain γ oscillations associated with changes in psychomotor state. Little is known about the cellular mechanism of MA modulation on γ oscillations. We explored the effects of multiple intracellular kinases on MA modulation of γ oscillations in rat hippocampal CA3 area induced by kainate. We found that dopamine receptor 2 (DR2) and N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) antagonists prevented the enhancing effect of MA on γ oscillation, whereas none of them affected baseline γ oscillation strength. Dopamine receptor 1 (DR1) antagonist and the serine/threonine kinase PKB/Akt inhibitor alone increased γ oscillations but prevented MA enhancement of γ. Protein kinase A, phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and extracellular signal-related kinases (ERK) inhibitors had no effect on MA. We propose that the DR1/DR2-Akt-NMDAR pathway play a critical role for the MA enhancement of γ oscillations. Our study provides an insight into the mechanism of acute MA on brain function and a clue for the intervention of MA addiction.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Mapping the neural circuit facilitates understanding the brain’s working mechanism. Pseudorabies virus (Bartha stain) as a tracer can infect neurons and retrogradely transport in neural circuits. To illuminate the network, tracers express reporter genes at high level are needed. In this study, we optimized the expression level of reporter gene, and constructed two new retrograde trans-multisynaptic tracers PRV531 and PRV724，which separately expresses more robust green and red fluorescent proteins than the existing retrograde tracers PRV152 and PRV614. The PRV531 and PRV724 can be used for mapping the neural circuit of central nervous system and peripheral nervous system. Overall, our work adds two valuable tracers into the toolbox for mapping neural circuit.</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Taking Advantage of the Selectivity of Histone Deacetylases and Phosphodiesterase Inhibitors to Design Better Therapeutic Strategies to Treat Alzheimer’s Disease</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2019.00149</link>
	<content:encoded>The discouraging results with therapies for Alzheimer´s disease (AD) in clinical trials, highlights the urgent need to adopt new approaches. Like other complex diseases, it is becoming clear that AD therapies should focus on the simultaneous modulation of several targets implicated in the disease. Recently, using reference compounds and the first-in class CM-414, we demonstrated that the simultaneous inhibition of histone deacetylases (class I HDACs and HDAC6) and phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE5) has a synergistic therapeutic effect in AD models. To identify the best inhibitory balance of HDAC isoforms and PDEs that provides a safe and efficient therapy to combat AD, we tested the compound CM-695 in the Tg2576 mouse model of this disease. CM-695 selectively inhibits HDAC6 over class I HDAC isoforms, which largely overcomes the toxicity associated with HDAC class 1 inhibition. Furthermore, CM-695 inhibits PDE9, which is expressed strongly in the brain and has been proposed as a therapeutic target for AD. Chronic treatment of aged Tg2576 mice with CM-695 ameliorates memory impairment and diminishes brain Aβ, although its therapeutic effect was no longer apparent 4 weeks after the treatment was interrupted. An increase in the presence of GRP78 and Hsp70 chaperones may underlie the therapeutic effect of CM-695. In summary, chronic treatment with CM-695 appears to reverse the AD phenotype in a safe and effective manner. Taking into account that AD is a multifactorial disorder, the multimodal action of these compounds and the different events they affect may open new avenues to combat AD.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: latest articles: Dissecting the sharp response of a canonical developmental enhancer reveals multiple sources of cooperativity</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/41266</link>
	<content:encoded>Developmental enhancers integrate graded concentrations of transcription factors (TFs) to create sharp gene expression boundaries. Here we examine the hunchback P2 (HbP2) enhancer which drives a sharp expression pattern in the Drosophila blastoderm embryo in response to the transcriptional activator Bicoid (Bcd). We systematically interrogate cis and trans factors that influence the shape and position of expression driven by HbP2, and find that the prevailing model, based on pairwise cooperative binding of Bcd to HbP2 is not adequate. We demonstrate that other proteins, such as pioneer factors, Mediator and histone modifiers influence the shape and position of the HbP2 expression pattern. Comparing our results to theory reveals how higher-order cooperativity and energy expenditure impact boundary location and sharpness. Our results emphasize that the bacterial view of transcription regulation, where pairwise interactions between regulatory proteins dominate, must be reexamined in animals, where multiple molecular mechanisms collaborate to shape the gene regulatory function.</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Coupling water fluxes with cell wall mechanics in a multicellular model of plant development</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/hpu-hF3vo6U/article</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Ibrahim Cheddadi, Michel Génard, Nadia Bertin, Christophe Godin&lt;/p&gt;

The growth of plant organs is a complex process powered by osmosis that attracts water inside the cells; this influx induces simultaneously an elastic extension of the walls and pressure in the cells, called turgor pressure; above a threshold, the walls yield and the cells grow. Based on Lockhart’s seminal work, various models of plant morphogenesis have been proposed, either for single cells, or focusing on the wall mechanical properties. However, the synergistic coupling of fluxes and wall mechanics has not yet been fully addressed in a multicellular model. This work lays the foundations of such a model, by simplifying as much as possible each process and putting emphasis on the coupling itself. Its emergent properties are rich and can help to understand plant morphogenesis. In particular, we show that the model can display a new type of lateral inhibitory mechanism that amplifies growth heterogeneities due &lt;i&gt;e.g&lt;/i&gt; to cell wall loosening.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/hpu-hF3vo6U&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Ruth Nussinov, Chung-Jung Tsai, Hyunbum Jang&lt;/p&gt;

Classically, phenotype is what is observed, and genotype is the genetic makeup. Statistical studies aim to project phenotypic likelihoods of genotypic patterns. The traditional genotype-to-phenotype theory embraces the view that the encoded protein shape together with gene expression level largely determines the resulting phenotypic trait. Here, we point out that the molecular biology revolution at the turn of the century explained that the gene encodes not one but ensembles of conformations, which in turn spell all possible gene-associated phenotypes. The significance of a dynamic ensemble view is in understanding the linkage between genetic change and the gained observable physical or biochemical characteristics. Thus, despite the transformative shift in our understanding of the basis of protein structure and function, the literature still commonly relates to the classical genotype–phenotype paradigm. This is important because an ensemble view clarifies how even seemingly small genetic alterations can lead to pleiotropic traits in adaptive evolution and in disease, why cellular pathways can be modified in monogenic and polygenic traits, and how the environment may tweak protein function.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/lMqu8pt7LN8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>RSS PAP: Temporal dynamics of inhalation-linked activity across defined subpopulations of mouse olfactory bulb neurons imaged in vivo</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0189-19.2019v2?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>ABSTRACT&lt;p&gt;In mammalian olfaction, inhalation drives the temporal patterning of neural activity that underlies early olfactory processing. It remains poorly understood how the neural circuits that process incoming olfactory information are engaged in the context of inhalation-linked dynamics. Here, we used artificial inhalation and two-photon calcium imaging to compare the dynamics of activity evoked by odorant inhalation across major cell types of the mouse olfactory bulb (OB). We expressed GCaMP6f or jRGECO1a in mitral and tufted cell subpopulations, olfactory sensory neurons, and two major juxtaglomerular interneuron classes, and imaged responses to a single inhalation of odorant. Activity in all cell types was strongly linked to inhalation, and all cell types showed some variance in the latency, rise-times, and durations of their inhalation-linked response. Juxtaglomerular interneuron dynamics closely matched that of sensory inputs, while mitral and tufted cells showed the highest diversity in responses, with a range of latencies and durations that could not be accounted for by heterogeneity in sensory input dynamics. Diversity was apparent even among 'sister' tufted cells innervating the same glomerulus. Surprisingly, inhalation-linked responses of mitral and tufted cells were highly overlapping and could not be distinguished on the basis of their inhalation-linked dynamics, with the exception of a subpopulation of superficial tufted cells expressing cholecystokinin. Our results are consistent with a model in which diversity in inhalation-linked patterning of OB output arises first at the level of sensory input and is enhanced by feedforward inhibition from juxtaglomerular interneurons which differentially impact different subpopulations of OB output neurons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Inhalation drives the temporal patterning of neural activity that underlies olfactory processing and rapid odor perception, yet the dynamics of the neural circuit elements mediating this processing are poorly understood. By comparing inhalation-linked dynamics of major olfactory bulb subpopulations, we find that diversity in the timing of neural activation arises at the level of sensory input, which is then mirrored by inhibitory interneurons in the glomerular layer. Temporal diversity is higher among olfactory bulb output neurons, with different subpopulations showing distinct but nonetheless highly overlapping ranges of inhalation-linked dynamics. These results implicate feedforward inhibition by glomerular-layer interneurons in diversifying temporal responses among output neurons, which may be important for generating and shaping timing-based odor representations during natural odor sampling.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0439-18.2019v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;The future of medicine lies in disease modification and prevention. The science of preclinical detection is young, but moving rapidly. Preclinical interventions offer the hope to decrease the severity of a disease or delay the development of a disorder substantially. With such promise, the research and practice of detecting brain disorders at a preclinical stage present unique ethical challenges, challenges that must be addressed to ensure the benefit of these technologies. Direct brain interventions have potential to impact not just what a patient has but who they are and who they could become. Further receiving an assessment for a preclinical or prodromal state has potential to impact perceptions about capacity, autonomy and personhood and could become entangled with stigma and discrimination. Discussion of the risks and benefits of the emerging technology will focus on how to ensure beneficence by presenting the limitations of preclinical detection and by contextualizing the risk associated with preclinical status. Exploring ethical issues alongside and integrated into the experimental design and research of these technologies is critical. This review will highlight ethical issues attendant to the current and near future states of preclinical detection across the life span, specifically as it relates to autism spectrum disorder (ASD), schizophrenia, and Alzheimer’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Preclinical interventions in developing brain disorders offer the strongest promise of delaying, modifying, or preventing the development of clinical disorders. Although promising, intervening at early stages in disorders inherently linked to identity and personhood presents unique ethical challenges. These challenges must be addressed before the practices are implemented. Both the treatment and the diagnosis itself have the potential to profoundly impact patients. We contextualize the risk of diagnosing preclinical states and present the limitations of preclinical interventions to guide research and policy as the field of preclinical detection rapidly expands.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>RSS PAP: Subthreshold fear conditioning produces a rapidly developing neural mechanism that primes subsequent learning</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0113-19.2019v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Learning results in various forms of neuronal plasticity that provide a lasting representation of past events, and understanding the mechanisms supporting lasting memories has been a primary pursuit of the neurobiological study of memory. However, learning also alters the capacity for future learning, an observation that likely reflects its adaptive significance. In the laboratory we can study this essential property of memory by assessing how prior experience alters the capacity for subsequent learning. Previous studies have indicated that while a single weak fear conditioning trial is insufficient to support long-term memory, it can facilitate future learning such that another trial delivered within a protracted time window results in a robust memory. Here, we sought to determine whether or not manipulating neural activity in the basolateral amygdala (BLA) using designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs (DREADDs) during or after the initial learning trial would affect the ability of the initial trial to facilitate subsequent learning. Our results show that inhibiting the BLA in rats prior to the first trial prevented the ability of that trial to facilitate learning when a second trial was presented the next day. Inhibition of the BLA immediately after the first trial using DREADDs was not effective, nor was pharmacological inhibition of protein kinase A or the mitogen activated protein kinase. These findings indicate that the neural mechanisms that permit an initial subthreshold fear conditioning trial to alter later learning develop rapidly and do not appear to require a typical post-learning consolidation period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Laboratory studies of memory are typically designed to identify mechanisms that allow the brain to represent past experience. The purpose of this ability is likely so that prior learning can direct future behavior, however studies are most often focused on the storage aspects of memory and less on how later experience is altered. We used a fear conditioning paradigm in which a single trial, subthreshold for producing long-term behavioral change, primes future learning when a second trial is later encountered. Neural activity in the amygdala was required for long-term memory priming, however post-training disruption of neural activity or cell signaling events had no effect. These results provide insight into the mechanisms that allow prior aversive experience to modify new learning.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Divisive Normalization from Wilson-Cowan Dynamics. (arXiv:1906.08246v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1906.08246</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Divisive Normalization and the Wilson-Cowan equations are influential models
of neural interaction and saturation [Carandini and Heeger Nat.Rev.Neurosci.
2012; Wilson and Cowan Kybernetik 1973]. However, they have not been
analytically related yet. In this work we show that Divisive Normalization can
be obtained from the Wilson-Cowan model. Specifically, assuming that Divisive
Normalization is the steady state solution of the Wilson-Cowan differential
equation, we find that the kernel that controls neural interactions in Divisive
Normalization depends on the Wilson-Cowan kernel but also has a
signal-dependent contribution. A standard stability analysis of a Wilson-Cowan
model with the parameters obtained from our relation shows that the Divisive
Normalization solution is a stable node. This stability demonstrates the
consistency of our steady state assumption, and is in line with the
straightforward use of Divisive Normalization with time-varying stimuli.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The proposed theory provides a physiological foundation (a relation to a
dynamical network with fixed wiring among neurons) for the functional
suggestions that have been done on the need of signal-dependent Divisive
Normalization [e.g. in Coen-Cagli et al., PLoS Comp.Biol. 2012]. Moreover, this
theory explains the modifications that had to be introduced ad-hoc in Gaussian
kernels of Divisive Normalization in [Martinez et al. Front. Neurosci. 2019] to
reproduce contrast responses. The proposed relation implies that the
Wilson-Cowan dynamics also reproduces visual masking and subjective image
distortion metrics, which up to now had been mainly explained via Divisive
Normalization. Finally, this relation allows to apply to Divisive Normalization
the methods which up to now had been developed for dynamical systems such as
Wilson-Cowan networks.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Dementia in the elderly has recently become the most usual cause of cognitive
decline. The proliferation of dementia cases in aging societies creates a
remarkable economic as well as medical problems in many communities worldwide.
A recently published report by The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates
that about 47 million people are suffering from dementia-related neurocognitive
declines worldwide. The number of dementia cases is predicted by 2050 to
triple, which requires the creation of an AI-based technology application to
support interventions with early screening for subsequent mental wellbeing
checking as well as preservation with digital-pharma (the so-called beyond a
pill) therapeutical approaches. We present an attempt and exploratory results
of brain signal (EEG) classification to establish digital biomarkers for
dementia stage elucidation. We discuss a comparison of various machine learning
approaches for automatic event-related potentials (ERPs) classification of a
high and low task-load sound stimulus recognition. These ERPs are similar to
those in dementia. The proposed winning method using tensor-based machine
learning in a deep fully connected neural network setting is a step forward to
develop AI-based approaches for a subsequent application for subjective- and
mild-cognitive impairment (SCI and MCI) diagnostics.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1906.07777</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Metastable brain dynamics are characterized by abrupt, jump-like modulations
so that the neural activity in single trials appears to unfold as a sequence of
discrete, quasi-stationary states. Evidence that cortical neural activity
unfolds as a sequence of metastable states is accumulating at fast pace.
Metastable activity occurs both in response to an external stimulus and during
ongoing, self-generated activity. These spontaneous metastable states are
increasingly found to subserve internal representations that are not locked to
external triggers, including states of deliberations, attention and
expectation. Moreover, decoding stimuli or decisions via metastable states can
be carried out trial-by-trial. Focusing on metastability will allow us to shift
our perspective on neural coding from traditional concepts based on
trial-averaging to models based on dynamic ensemble representations. Recent
theoretical work has started to characterize the mechanistic origin and
potential roles of metastable representations. In this article we review recent
findings on metastable activity, how it may arise in biologically realistic
models, and its potential role for representing internal states as well as
relevant task variables.

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Spinal Interleukin-1β Inhibits Astrocyte Cytochrome P450c17 Expression Which Controls the Development of Mechanical Allodynia in a Mouse Model of Neuropathic Pain</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2019.00153</link>
	<content:encoded>We have recently demonstrated that sciatic nerve injury increases the expression of spinal cytochrome P450c17, a key neurosteroidogenic enzyme, which plays a critical role in the development of peripheral neuropathic pain. However, the modulatory mechanisms responsible for the expression of spinal P450c17 have yet to be examined. Here we investigated the possible involvement of interleukin-1β (IL-1β) in altering P450c17 expression during the induction phase of neuropathic pain. Neuropathic pain was produced by chronic constriction injury (CCI) of the right sciatic nerve in mice and mechanical allodynia was evaluated in the hind paws using a von-Frey filament (0.16 g). Western blotting and immunohistochemistry were performed to assess the expression of spinal IL-1β, interleukin-1 receptor type 1 (IL-1R1), P450c17, and GFAP. Spinal IL-1β was significantly increased on day 1 post-surgery and its receptor, IL-1R1 was expressed in GFAP-positive astrocytes. Intrathecal administration of the recombinant interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra, 20 ng) on days 0 and 1 post-surgery enhanced GFAP expression on day 1 post-surgery and induced an early increase in P450c17 expression in astrocytes, but not in neurons. Administration of IL-1β (10 ng) on days 0 and 1 post-surgery blocked the enhancement of both spinal P450c17 and GFAP expression induced by IL-1ra (20 ng) administration. Intrathecal administration of IL-1ra (20 ng) on days 0 to 3 post-surgery also facilitated the CCI-induced development of mechanical allodynia, and this early developed pain was dose-dependently attenuated by the administration of the P450c17 inhibitor, ketoconazole (1, 3 or 10 nmol) or the astrocyte metabolic inhibitor, fluorocitrate (0.01, 0.03 or 0.1 nmol). These results demonstrate that early increases in spinal IL-1β temporally inhibit astrocyte P450c17 expression and astrocyte activation ultimately controlling the development of mechanical allodynia induced by peripheral nerve injury. These findings imply that spinal IL-1β plays an important role as an early, but transient, control mechanism in the development of peripheral neuropathic pain via the inhibition of astrocyte P450c17 expression and astrocyte activation.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00657</link>
	<content:encoded>In the last few decades, brain functional connectivity (FC) has been extensively assessed using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (RS-fMRI), which is able to identify temporally correlated brain regions known as RS functional networks. Fundamental insights into the pathophysiology of several neurodegenerative conditions have been provided by studies in this field. However, most of these studies are based on the assumption of temporal stationarity of RS functional networks, despite recent evidence suggests that the spatial patterns of RS networks may change periodically over the time of an fMRI scan acquisition. For this reason, dynamic functional connectivity (dFC) analysis has been recently implemented and proposed in order to consider the temporal fluctuations of FC. These approaches hold promise to provide fundamental information for the identification of pathophysiological and diagnostic markers in the vast field of neurodegenerative diseases. This review summarizes the main currently available approaches for dFC analysis and reports their recent applications for the assessment of the most common neurodegenerative conditions, including Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, dementia with Lewy bodies, and frontotemporal dementia. Critical state-of-the-art findings, limitations, and future perspectives regarding the analysis of dFC in these diseases are provided from both a clinical and a technical point of view.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00640</link>
	<content:encoded>Increasing evidence links proteins of the S100 family to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). S100 proteins are EF-hand calcium-binding proteins with intra- and extracellular functions related to regulation of proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, and trace metal homeostasis, and are important modulators of inflammatory responses. For example, S100A6, S100A8 and S100B expression levels were found increased in inflammatory diseases, but also neurodegenerative disorders, and S100A8/A9 complexes may provide a mechanistic link between amyloid-beta (Aβ) plaque formation and neuroinflammation. On the other hand, S100B, a proinflammatory protein that is chronically up-regulated in AD and whose elevation precedes plaque formation, was recently shown to suppress Aβ aggregation. Here, we report expression of S100A6 and S100B in astrocytes and less so in neurons, and low level of expression of S100A8 in both neurons and glial cells in vitro. In vivo, S100A8 expression is almost absent in the brain of aged wildtype mice, while S100A6 and S100B are expressed in all brain regions and most prominently in the cortex and cerebellum. S100B seems to be enriched in Purkinje cells of the cerebellum. In contrast, in the brain of APP23 mice, a mouse model for Alzheimer’s disease, S100B, S100A6 and S100A8 show co-localization with Aβ plaques, compatible with astrocyte activation, and the expression level of S100A8 is increased in neural cells. While S100A6 and S100B are enriched in the periphery of plaques where less fibrillar Aβ is found, S100A8 is more intense within the center of the inclusion. In vitro assays show that, similarly to S100B, S100A6 and S100A8 also delay Aβ aggregation suggesting a regulatory action over protein aggregation. We posit that elevated expression levels and overlapping spatial distribution of brain S100 proteins and plaques translates functional relationships between these inflammatory mediators and AD pathophysiology processes that uncover important molecular mechanisms linking the aggregation and neuroinflammation cascades.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Cultural attachment (CA) refers to processes that allow culture and its symbols to provide psychological security when facing threat. Epistemologically, although we currently have an adequate predictivist model of CA, it is necessary to prepare for a mechanistic approach that will not only predict, but also explain CA phenomena. Towards that direction, we first examine the concepts and mechanisms that are the building blocks of both prototypical maternal attachment and CA. Based on existing robust neuroscience models we associate these concepts and mechanisms with bona fide neurobiological functions to advance an integrative neurobiological model of CA. We end by discussing the unresolved relationship of CA to other similar socio-cognitive concepts. The aim of the paper is to highlight the importance of integrating CA theory into computational approaches to culture and evolution (such as predictive processing computations explaining niche construction) as this will allow a dynamic interpretation of cultural processes.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2019.00272</link>
	<content:encoded>Age-related changes in visual function and retina structure are very common in aged animals, but the underlying mechanisms of these changes remain unclear. Here we report that the expression of interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3), a critical immune regulatory factor, is dramatically down-regulated in mouse retinas during aging. To address the role of IRF3 in the retina, we examined the structure and function of retinas in young (3-4 months) and old (22-24 months) Irf3-/- mice in comparison to age-matched wildtype (WT) mice. We found that IRF3 deletion resulted in impaired electroretinogram (ERG) responses and decreased retinal thickness in both young and old mice. In addition, numerous synapses of the outer plexiform layer (OPL) were found obviously extending into outer nuclear layer (ONL) in Irf3-/- mice, along with a reduction of the average synapse density in the OPL. These changes suggest that IRF3 deletion may accelerate retinal senescence. In support of this hypothesis, a number of classic senescence-associated markers were found in remarkably elevated level in Irf3-/- retina, including p53, p16INK4a, inositol-requiring enzyme 1α (IREα), p-H2A.X and promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML). Overall, our results indicate that maintenance normal IRF3 levels is necessary for retinal structure and function and suggest that IRF3 is an important regulator of retinal senescence.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Despite subjective cognitive decline (SCD), a preclinical stage of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), being widely studied in recent years, studies on centrality frequency in individuals with SCD are lacking. This study aimed to investigate the differences in centrality frequency between individuals with SCD and normal controls (NCs). Forty individuals with SCD and fifty-three well-matched NCs underwent a resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging scan. We assessed individual dynamic functional connectivity using sliding window correlations. In each time window, brain regions with a high degree centrality were defined as hubs. Across the entire time window, the proportion of time that the hub appeared was characterized as centrality frequency. The centrality frequency correlated with cognitive performance differently in individuals with SCD and NCs. Our results revealed that in individuals with SCD, compared with NCs, correlations between centrality frequency of the anterior cortical regions and cognitive performance decreased (79.2% for NCs and 43.5% for individuals with SCD). In contrast, correlations between centrality frequency of the posterior cortical regions and cognitive performance increased in SCD individuals compared with NCs (20.8% for NCs and 56.5% for individuals with SCD). Moreover, the changes mainly focused on the anterior (93.3% for NCs and45.5% for individuals with SCD) and posterior (6.7% for NCs and 54.5% for individuals with SCD) regions associated with the default mode network (DMN). In addition, we used absolute thresholds (correlation efficient r = 0.2, 0.25) and proportional thresholds (sparsity = 0.2, 0.25) to verify the results. Dynamic results are relative stable at absolute thresholds while static results are relative stable at proportional thresholds. Converging findings provide a new framework for the detection of the changes occurring in individuals with SCD via centrality frequency of the DMN.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: latest articles: The endonuclease Cue2 cleaves mRNAs at stalled ribosomes during No Go Decay</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/49117</link>
	<content:encoded>Translation of problematic sequences in mRNAs leads to ribosome collisions that trigger a series of quality control events including ribosome rescue, degradation of the stalled nascent polypeptide via the Ribosome-mediated Quality control Complex (RQC), and targeting of the mRNA for decay (No Go Decay or NGD). Previous studies provide strong evidence for the existence of an endonuclease involved in the process of NGD, though the identity of the endonuclease and the extent to which it contributes to mRNA decay remain unknown. Using a reverse genetic screen in yeast, we identify Cue2 as the conserved endonuclease that is recruited to stalled ribosomes to promote NGD. Ribosome profiling and biochemistry provide strong evidence that Cue2 cleaves mRNA within the A site of the colliding ribosome. We demonstrate that NGD primarily proceeds via Xrn1-mediated exonucleolytic decay and Cue2-mediated endonucleolytic decay normally constitutes a secondary decay pathway. Finally, we show that the Cue2-dependent pathway becomes a major contributor to NGD in cells depleted of factors required for the resolution of stalled ribosome complexes (the RQT factors including Slh1). Together these results provide insights into how multiple decay processes converge to process problematic mRNAs in eukaryotic cells.​</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: latest articles: piRNA-guided co-transcriptional silencing coopts nuclear export factors</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/47999</link>
	<content:encoded>The PIWI-interacting RNA (piRNA) pathway is a small RNA-based immune system that controls the expression of transposons and maintains genome integrity in animal gonads. In &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt;, piRNA-guided silencing is achieved, in part, via co-transcriptional repression of transposons by Piwi. This depends on Panoramix (Panx); however, precisely how an RNA binding event silences transcription remains to be determined. Here we show that Nuclear Export Factor 2 (Nxf2) and its co-factor, Nxt1, form a complex with Panx and are required for co-transcriptional silencing of transposons in somatic and germline cells of the ovary. Tethering of Nxf2 or Nxt1 to RNA results in silencing of target loci and the concomitant accumulation of repressive chromatin marks. Nxf2 and Panx proteins are mutually required for proper localization and stability. We mapped the protein domains crucial for the Nxf2/Panx complex formation and show that the amino-terminal portion of Panx is sufficient to induce transcriptional silencing.</content:encoded>

Gapsys and de Groot have commented on this work but do not provide convincing evidence that the conclusions of El Hage et al., 2018 are incorrect.

	<content:encoded>A recent molecular dynamics investigation into the stability of hemoglobin concluded that the unliganded protein is only stable in the T state when a solvent box is used in the simulations that is ten times larger than what is usually employed (El Hage et al., 2018). Here, we express three main concerns about that study. In addition, we find that with an order of magnitude more statistics, the reported box size dependence is not reproducible. Overall, no significant effects on the kinetics or thermodynamics of conformational transitions were observed.</content:encoded>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Translating Fear Circuitry: Amygdala Projections to Subgenual and Perigenual Anterior Cingulate in the Macaque</title>

fear-learning models posit that amygdala–infralimbic connections facilitate extinction while amygdala–prelimbic prefrontal connections mediate fear expression. Analogous amygdala–prefrontal circuitry between rodents and primates is not established. Using paired small volumes of neural tracers injected into the perigenual anterior cingulate cortex (pgACC; areas 24b and 32; a potential homologue to rodent prelimbic cortex) and subgenual anterior cingulate cortex (sgACC, areas 25 and 14c; a potential homologue to rodent infralimbic cortex) in a single hemisphere, we mapped amygdala projections to the pgACC and sgACC within single subjects. All injections resulted in dense retrograde labeling specifically within the intermediate division of the basal nucleus (Bi) and the magnocellular division of the accessory basal nucleus (ABmc). Areal analysis revealed a bias for connectivity with the sgACC, with the ABmc showing a greater bias than the Bi. Double fluorescence analysis revealed that sgACC and pgACC projections were intermingled within the Bi and ABmc, where a proportion were double labeled. We conclude that amygdala inputs to the ACC largely originate from the Bi and ABmc, preferentially connect to the sgACC, and that a subset collaterally project to both sgACC and pgACC. These findings advance our understanding of fear extinction and fear expression circuitry across species. &lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Single-nuclei transcriptomic analysis of the subthalamic nucleus reveals different Pitx2-positive subpopulations</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/677724v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>The subthalamic nucleus is a compartmentalized structure formed during development with each division serving a different function. A few molecular markers such as transcription factors involved in the formation and maintenance of the STN have been identified, and whilst a few more genes have been reported to be expressed in the STN, the complete transcriptomic landscape of the mature STN remains elusive. So far genes associated with the adult STN have been expressed throughout the structure. It therefore remains to establish if the functional division of this structure is attributed to a molecular diversity comprising of subpopulations. In this study a single-nuclei RNA-sequencing of genetically labelled Pitx2-Cre was conducted to identify the molecular heterogeneity of the STN. The findings revealed two subpopulations of the STN marked by the expression of Baiap3/Fxyd6 or Fgf11. Moreover additional Pitx2+ subpopulations with distinct signature markers that characterize neighboring structures of the STN such as the parasubthalamic nucleus, the lateral hypothalamus, the zona incerta and the mammillary nucleus were also identified.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Atypical brain-to-brain synchronization during listening to continuous natural speech in dyslexia</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/677674v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Listening to speech elicits brain activity time-locked to the speech sounds. This so-called neural entrainment to speech was found to be atypical in dyslexia, a reading impairment associated with neural speech processing deficits. We hypothesized that the neural responses of dyslexic readers to real-life speech would be atypically synchronized compared to typical readers, and that the strength of brain-to-brain synchronization would be reflected in reading-related measures. We recorded magnetoencephalograms (MEG) of 23 dyslexic and 21 typically reading adults during listening to ~10 min of natural Finnish speech consisting of excerpts from radio news, a podcast, a self-recorded audiobook chapter and small talk. The amplitude envelopes of band-pass-filtered MEG source signals were correlated between subjects in the cortically-constrained source space in six frequency bands. The resulting inter-subject correlations (ISCs) of dyslexic and typical readers were compared with a permutation-based t-test. Neuropsychological measures of phonological processing, technical reading, and working memory were correlated with the ISCs utilizing the Mantel test. During listening to speech, ISCs were reduced in dyslexic compared to typical readers in delta (0.5-4 Hz), alpha (8-12 Hz), and high gamma (55-90 Hz) frequency bands. In theta (4-8 Hz), beta (12-25 Hz), and low gamma (25-45 Hz) frequency bands, dyslexics had mainly enhanced ISC to speech compared to controls. Furthermore, we found that ISCs across both groups were associated with phonological processing, technical reading, and working memory. The atypical brain-to-brain synchronization to natural speech in dyslexics supports the temporal sampling deficit theory of dyslexia. It also suggests over-synchronization to phoneme-rate information in speech, which could be the reason for less accurate sampling of phonemes from speech in dyslexia. These irregularities in parsing speech are likely part of the complex neural factors contributing to dyslexia. The associations between neural coupling and reading-related skills further support this notion.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Motor cortex can directly drive the globus pallidal neurons in a projection neuron type dependent manner in rat</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/677377v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>The basal ganglia (BG) are critical for the control of motor behaviors and for reinforcement learning. Here, we demonstrate in rats that primary and secondary motor areas (M1 and M2) make functional synaptic connections in the globus pallidus (GP), not usually thought of as an input site of the BG using optogenetics and morphological analysis. The cortical excitation in the GP was as strong as that in the STN. GP neurons projecting to the striatum were preferentially innervated by the motor cortex. Morphological observation revealed that the density of axonal boutons from motor cortices in the GP was approximately 30% of that in the striatum, but was comparable to that in the STN. M1 and M2 projected differentially to the BG in terms of topography and substructures. These results suggest that cortico-pallidal innervation is an additional excitatory input to the BG, and can affects behaviors via the cortex-basal ganglia-thalamus loop.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Abbreviated assessment of psychopathology in patients with suspected seizure disorders</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/677278v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Objectives: Psychopathology is common in patients undergoing investigation for seizure-related disorders. Psychometric examination using self-report instruments, such as the SCL-90-R, can assist diagnosis. The SCL-90-R, however, is a lengthy instrument and might not be tolerated by all patients. We assessed several abbreviated forms of the SCL-90-R in patients undergoing video encephalographic monitoring (VEM). Methods: 687 patients completed the SCL-90-R and scores were computed for the full SCL-90-R and five abbreviated forms. Correlations and mean differences were computed between different forms. Classification accuracy was assessed via receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, and measurements models were examined using confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). Results: All abbreviated forms were strongly correlated with the SCL-90-R for general psychopathology (r = .93 - .99), depression (r = .89 - .95), and anxiety (r = .97 - .98). Classification performance was similar across forms, showing high negative predictive values for depression and anxiety (.90 - .94), but lower positive predictive values (.34 - .38). Differences were observed between the full SCL-90-R and its abbreviated forms across most domains (d = 0.00 - 0.65). The published measurement model was most strongly validated for the SCL-27, SCL-14, and the SCL-K-9. Conclusions: These five SCL-90-R abbreviated forms show high convergent validity with the full version. In patients undergoing investigation for seizure-related disorders, the BSI or BSI- 18 are most appropriate where screening for both depression and anxiety is required. The SCL-K-9 is appropriate when only a single measure of global psychological distress is required. Caution should be exercised when making direct comparisons across the different forms.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Recurrent networks can recycle neural resources to flexibly trade speed for accuracy in visual recognition</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/677237v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Deep feedforward neural network models of vision dominate in both computational neuroscience and engineering. However, the primate visual system contains abundant recurrent connections. Recurrent signal flow enables recycling of limited computational resources over time, and so might boost the performance of a physically finite brain. In particular, recurrence could improve performance in vision tasks. Here we find that recurrent convolutional networks outperform feedforward convolutional networks matched in their number of parameters in large-scale visual recognition tasks. Moreover, recurrent networks can trade off accuracy for speed, balancing the cost of error against the cost of a delayed response (and the cost of greater energy consumption). We terminate recurrent computation once the output probability distribution has concentrated beyond a predefined entropy threshold. Trained by backpropagation through time, recurrent convolutional networks resemble the primate visual system in terms of their speed-accuracy trade-off behaviour. Moreover, their learned lateral connectivity patterns are consistent with those observed in primate early visual cortex. These results suggest that recurrent models are preferable to feedforward models of vision, both in terms of their performance at vision tasks and their ability to explain biological vision.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: A novel approach for combining task-dependent gamma with alpha and beta power modulation for enhanced identification of eloquent cortical areas using ECoG in patients with medical-refractory epilepsy</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/677195v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Electrical stimulation mapping (ESM) is the gold standard for identification of eloquent areas prior to resection of epileptogenic tissue, however, it is time consuming and may cause side effects, especially stimulation-induced seizures and after-discharges. Broadband gamma activity (55 to 200 Hz) recorded with subdural electrocorticography (ECoG) during cognitive tasks has been proposed as an attractive tool for mapping cortical areas with specific function but until now has not proven definitive clinical value. Fewer studies have addressed whether the alpha (8 to 12 Hz) and beta (15 to 25 Hz) band activity could also be used to improve eloquent cortex identification. We compared alpha, beta and broadband gamma activity, and their combination for the identification of eloquent cortical areas defined by ESM. Ten patients participated in a delayed-match-to-sample task, where syllable sounds were matched to visually presented letters and responses given by keyboard. We used a generalized linear model (GLM) approach to find the optimal weighting of low frequency bands and broadband gamma power to predict the ESM categories. Broadband gamma activity increased more in eloquent areas than in non-eloquent areas and this difference had a diagnostic ability (area under (AU) the receiving operating characteristic curve, AUROC) of ~70%. Both alpha and beta power decreased more in eloquent areas. Alpha power had lower AUROC than broadband gamma while beta had similar AUROC. AUROC was enhanced by the combination of alpha and broadband gamma (3% improvement) and by the combination of beta and broadband gamma (7% improvement) over the use of broadband gamma alone. Further analysis showed that the relative performance of broadband gamma and low frequency bands depended on multiple factors including the time period of the cognitive task, the location of the electrodes and of the patient attention to the stimulus. However, the combination of beta band and broadband gamma always gave the best performance. We show how ECoG power modulation from cognitive testing periods can be used to map the probability of eloquence by ESM and how this probability can be used as an aid for optimal ESM planning. We conclude that low frequency power during cognitive testing can contribute to the identification of eloquent areas in patients with focal refractory epilepsy improving its precision but does not replace the need of ESM.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Altered White Matter Microstructural Organization in Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder across 3,049 Adults: Results from the PGC-ENIGMA PTSD Consortium</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/677153v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>A growing number of studies have examined alterations in white matter organization in people with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) using diffusion MRI (dMRI), but the results have been mixed, which may be partially due to relatively small sample sizes among studies. Altered structural connectivity may be both a neurobiological vulnerability for, and a result of, PTSD. In an effort to find reliable effects, we present a multi-cohort analysis of dMRI metrics across 3,049 individuals from 28 cohorts currently participating in the PGC-ENIGMA PTSD working group (a joint partnership between the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium and the Enhancing NeuroImaging Genetics through Meta-Analysis consortium). Comparing regional white matter metrics across the full brain in 1,446 individuals with PTSD and 1,603 controls (2152 males/897 females) between ages 18-83, 92% of whom were trauma-exposed, we report associations between PTSD and disrupted white matter organization measured by lower fractional anisotropy (FA) in the tapetum region of the corpus callosum (Cohens d=-0.12, p=0.0021). The tapetum connects the left and right hippocampus, structures for which structure and function have been consistently implicated in PTSD. Results remained significant/similar after accounting for the effects of multiple potentially confounding variables: childhood trauma exposure, comorbid depression, history of traumatic brain injury, current alcohol abuse or dependence, and current use of psychotropic medications. Our results show that PTSD may be associated with alterations in the broader hippocampal network.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: A History of Chronic Repeated Predation Stress Reduces Aversion to Ethanol Adulteration in Male, but not Female, C57Bl/6J Mice</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/677146v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Background: Trauma related psychiatric disorders, such as posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and alcohol use disorder (AUD) are highly comorbid illnesses that separately present an opposing, sex-specific pattern, with increased prevalence of PTSD in females and increased prevalence of AUD diagnoses in males. Likewise, PTSD is a risk factor in the development of AUD, with conflicting data on the impact of sex in the comorbid development of both disorders. Because the likelihood of experiencing more than one traumatic event is high, we aim to utilize chronic exposure to adolescent and early adult predator stress to query the extent to which sex interacts with chronic stress to influence alcohol consumption, or cessation of consumption. Methods: Male (n=16) and female (n=15) C57BL/6J mice underwent chronic repeated predatory stress (CRPS) or daily handling for two weeks during adolescence (P35-P49) and two weeks during adulthood (P65-P79). All mice were subject to open field testing and marble burying analysis as metrics of anxiety-like behavior. Mice subsequently underwent a two-bottle choice intermittent ethanol access (IEA) phase (P90-131) with the options of 20% ethanol or water. After establishing drinking behavior, increasing concentrations of quinine were added to the ethanol to assess ethanol seeking behavior in the presence of an aversive stimuli, as a metric of compulsive-like drinking. Results: CRPS increased baseline corticosterone and anxiety-like behaviors in the open field in both male and female mice as compared to control mice that had not been exposed to CRPS. Consistent with previous reports, we observed a sex difference in alcohol consumption such that females consumed more ethanol per gram of body mass than males. In addition, CRPS increased both alcohol intake by weight and preference, suggesting compulsive-like drinking behavior in male mice during quinine adulteration. Conclusion: Collectively, we demonstrate that CRPS during late adolescence and early adulthood can induce anxiety-like behavior in both sexes but selectively influences ethanol intake in males. Male mice with a history of CRPS continue to engage in ethanol seeking behaviors despite being paired with an aversive gustatory stimulus, suggesting dependence-like drinking behavior. Our results suggest that stress may play a role in the development of anxiety-like behaviors and also drive a sex-specific alteration in drinking behavior.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Does the neuronal noise in cortex help generalization?</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/676999v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>One remarkable feature of neuronal activity in the mammalian cortex is the high level of variability in response to repeated stimuli. First, we used an open dataset, the Allen Brain Observatory, to quantify the distribution of responses to repeated presentations of natural movies. We find that even for their preferred moment in the movie clip, neurons have high variability which cannot be well captured by Gaussian or Poisson distributions. A large fraction of responses are better fit by log-normal or Gaussian mixture models with two components. These distributions are similar to activity distributions during training of deep neural networks using dropout. This poses the interesting hypothesis: is the role of cortical noise to help in generalization during learning? Second, to ensure the robustness of our results we analyzed electrophysiological recordings in the same areas of mouse visual cortex, again using repeated natural movie presentations and found similar response distributions. To make sure that the trial-by-trial variations we observe are not due exclusively to the result of changes in state, we constructed a population coupling model, where each neuron's activity is coupled to a low-dimension version of the activity of all other simultaneously recorded neurons. The population coupling model can capture global, brain-wide activity fluctuations that are state-dependent. The residuals from this model also show non-Gaussian noise distributions. Third, we ask a more specific question: is the noise in the cortex more likely to move the representation of the stimulus in-class versus out-of-class? To address this question, we analyzed the responses of neurons across trials from multiple sections of different movie clips. We observe that the noise in the cortex better aligns to in-class variations. We argue that a useful noise for learning generalizations is to move from representations of different exemplars in-class, similar to cortical noise.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Intertrial Variability in Human Corticospinal Activity during Grasp Force Planning</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/676833v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Neuronal firing rate variability during planning has been found to contribute to trial-to-trial variability in primate behavior. However, in humans, whether planning related mechanisms contribute to trial-to-trial behavioral variability remains unknown. We investigated the time-course of trial-to-trial variability in corticospinal excitability (CSE) using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) while subjects planned to perform a self-paced reach-to-grasp task. We hypothesized that CSE variability will be modulated during task planning and that such a modulation would explain trial-to-trial behavioral variability. Able-bodied individuals were visually cued to plan their grip force before exertion of either 30% or 5% of maximum force on an object. TMS was delivered at different time points following a cue that instructed the force level. We first modeled the relation between CSE magnitude and its variability at rest (n=12) to study the component of CSE variability during task planning that was not related to changes in CSE magnitude (n=12). We found an increase in CSE variability during task planning at 30% but not at 5% of force. This effect was temporally dissociated from the decrease in CSE magnitude. Importantly, the increase in CSE variability during planning explained 64% of inter-individual differences in time to peak force rate trial-to-trial variability. These results were found to be repeatable across studies and robust to different analysis methods. Our findings suggest that the planning-related mechanisms underlying modulation in CSE variability and CSE magnitude are distinct. Notably, the extent of modulation in planning-related variability in corticospinal system within individuals may explain their trial-to-trial behavioral variability.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Studies of changes in cerebral neocortical thickness often rely on small control samples for comparison with specific populations with abnormal visual systems. We present a normative dataset for FreeSurfer-derived cortical thickness across 25 human visual areas derived from 960 participants in the Human Connectome Project. Cortical thickness varies systematically across visual areas, in broad agreement with canonical visual system hierarchies in the dorsal and ventral pathways. In addition, cortical thickness estimates show consistent within-subject variability and reliability. Importantly, cortical thickness estimates in visual areas are well described by a normal distribution, making them amenable to direct statistical comparison.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/676643v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Successful episodic memory involves dynamic increases in the coordination of activity across distributed hippocampal networks, including the posterior-medial network (PMN) and the anterior-temporal network (ATN). We tested whether this up-regulation of functional connectivity during memory processing can be enhanced within hippocampal networks by noninvasive stimulation, and whether such task-dependent connectivity enhancement predicts episodic memory improvement. Participants received stimulation targeting either the PMN or an out-of-network control location. We compared the effects of stimulation on fMRI connectivity measured during an autobiographical memory retrieval task versus during rest within the PMN and the ATN. PMN-targeted stimulation significantly increased connectivity during memory retrieval versus rest within the PMN. This effect was not observed in the ATN, or in either network due to control out-of-network stimulation. Task-dependent increases in connectivity due to PMN-targeted stimulation within the medial temporal lobe predicted improved performance of a separate episodic memory test. It is therefore possible to enhance the task-dependent regulation of hippocampal network connectivity that supports memory processing using noninvasive stimulation.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/676593v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Trajectory-dependent splitter neurons in the hippocampus encode information about a rodent's prior trajectory during performance of a continuous alternation task. As such, they provide valuable information for supporting memory-guided behavior. Here, we employed single-photon calcium imaging in freely moving mice to investigate the emergence and fate of trajectory-dependent activity through learning and mastery of a continuous spatial alternation task. We found that the quality of trajectory-dependent information in hippocampal neurons correlated with task performance. We thus hypothesized that, due to their utility, splitter neurons would exhibit greater stability than would traditional place cells. We found that splitter neurons were more likely to remain active and retained more consistent spatial information across multiple days than did place cells. Furthermore, we found that both splitter neurons and place cells emerged rapidly and maintained stable trajectory-dependent/spatial activity thereafter. Our results suggest that a neuron's functional coding properties influence its long-term stability.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Basal forebrain volume selectively and reliably predicts the cortical spread of Alzheimer\'s degeneration</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/676544v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Alzheimer's disease neuropathology is thought to spread across anatomically and functionally connected brain regions. However, the precise sequence of spread remains ambiguous. The prevailing model posits that Alzheimer's neurodegeneration starts in the entorhinal cortices, before spreading to temporoparietal cortex. Challenging this model, we earlier provided evidence that degeneration within the nucleus basalis of Meynert (NbM), a subregion of the basal forebrain heavily populated by cortically projecting cholinergic neurons, precedes and predicts entorhinal degeneration (Schmitz and Spreng, 2016). There have been few systematic attempts at directly comparing staging models using in vivo longitudinal biomarker data, and determining if these comparisons generalize across independent samples. Here, we addressed the sequence of pathological staging in Alzheimer's disease using two independent samples of the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (N1 = 284; N2 = 553) with harmonized CSF assays of amyloid (AB) and hyperphosphorylated tau (pTau), and longitudinal structural MRI data over two years. We derived measures of gray matter degeneration in a priori NbM and the entorhinal regions of interest. To examine the spreading of degeneration, we used a predictive modelling strategy which tests whether baseline gray matter volume in a seed region accounts for longitudinal change in a target region. We demonstrated that predictive pathological spread favored the NbM-to-entorhinal over the entorhinal-to-NbM model. This evidence generalized across the independent samples (N1: r=0.20, p=0.03; N2: r=0.37, p&amp;lt;0.001). We also showed that CSF concentrations of pTau/AB moderated the observed predictive relationship, consistent with evidence in rodent models of an underlying trans-synaptic mechanism of pathophysiological spread (t826=2.55, p=0.01). The moderating effect of CSF was robust to additional factors, including clinical diagnosis (t826=1.65, p=0.49). We then applied our predictive modelling strategy to an exploratory whole-brain voxel-wise analysis to examine the spatial specificity of the NbM-to-entorhinal model. We found that smaller baseline NbM volumes predicted greater degeneration in localized regions of the entorhinal and perirhinal cortices. By contrast, smaller baseline entorhinal volumes predicted degeneration in the medial temporal cortex, recapitulating the prevailing staging model. Our findings suggest that degeneration of the basal forebrain cholinergic projection system is a robust and reliable upstream event of entorhinal and neocortical degeneration, calling into question the prevailing view of Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Multimodal fusion of structural and functional brain imaging in depression using linked independent component analysis</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/676536v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Background: Previous structural and functional neuroimaging studies have implicated distributed brain regions and networks in depression. However, there are no robust imaging biomarkers that are specific to depression, which may be due to clinical heterogeneity and neurobiological complexity. A dimensional approach and fusion of imaging modalities may yield a more coherent view of the neuronal correlates of depression. Methods: We used linked independent component analysis to fuse cortical macrostructure (thickness, area, gray matter density), white matter diffusion properties and resting-state fMRI default mode network amplitude in patients with a history of depression (n = 170) and controls (n = 71). We used univariate and machine learning approaches to assess the relationship between age, sex, case-control status, and symptom loads for depression and anxiety with the resulting brain components. Results: Univariate analyses revealed strong associations between age and sex with mainly global but also regional specific brain components, with varying degrees of multimodal involvement. In contrast, there were no significant associations with case-control status, nor symptom loads for depression and anxiety with the brain components, nor any interaction effects with age and sex. Machine learning revealed low model performance for classifying patients from controls and predicting symptom loads for depression and anxiety, but high age prediction accuracy. Conclusion: Multimodal fusion of brain imaging data alone may not be sufficient for dissecting the clinical and neurobiological heterogeneity of depression. Precise clinical stratification and methods for brain phenotyping at the individual level based on large training samples may be needed to parse the neuroanatomy of depression.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Specific connectivity with Operculum 3 (OP3) brain region in acoustic trauma tinnitus: a seed-based resting state fMRI study</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/676429v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Tinnitus mechanisms remain poorly understood. Our previous functional MRI (fMRI) studies demonstrated an abnormal hyperactivity in the right parietal operculum 3 (OP3) in acoustic trauma tinnitus and during provoked phantom sound perceptions without hearing loss, which lead us to propose a new model of tinnitus. This new model is not directly linked with hearing loss and primary auditory cortex abnormalities, but with a proprioceptive disturbance related to middle-ear muscles. In the present study, a seed-based resting-state functional MRI method was used to explore the potential abnormal connectivity of this opercular region between an acoustic trauma tinnitus group presenting slight to mild tinnitus and a control group. Primary auditory cortex seeds were also explored because they were thought to be directly involved in tinnitus in most current models. In such a model, hearing loss and tinnitus handicap were confounding factors and were therefore regressed in our analysis. Between-groups comparisons showed a significant specific connectivity between the right OP3 seeds and the potential human homologue of the premotor ear-eye field (H-PEEF) bilaterally and the inferior parietal lobule (IPL) in the tinnitus group. Our findings suggest the existence of a simultaneous premotor ear-eye disturbance in tinnitus that could lift the veil on unexplained subclinical abnormalities in oculomotor tests found in tinnitus patients with normal vestibular responses. The present work confirms the involvement of the OP3 subregion in acoustic trauma tinnitus and provides some new clues to explain its putative mechanisms.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/676312v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Resolving whole-brain images of neuronal gene expression or neuronal activity patterns to the level of single neuron types with defined identities represents a major challenge. We describe here the development and use of a multicolor Caenorhabditis elegans transgene, called NeuroPAL (a Neuronal Polychromatic Atlas of Landmarks), to resolve unique neural identities in whole-brain images. NeuroPAL worms share a stereotypical multicolor map, permitting complete, unambiguous and automated determination of individual neuron identities in conjunction with GCaMP-based neuronal activity reporters and GFP/YFP/CFP gene-expression reporters. To demonstrate the method and its potential, we use NeuroPAL and GFP-based reporters to map expression for the whole family of metabotropic acetylcholine, glutamate, and GABA neurotransmitter receptors encoded in the C. elegans genome, revealing a vast number of potential molecular connections that go far beyond the anatomically-defined connectome. We then expand the technique to whole-brain activity, employing NeuroPAL and a panneuronal neural-activity sensor (GCaMP6s) for functional analysis. Using this tool we delineate extensive nervous system activity patterns in response to several stimuli with single, identified neuron resolution. We find that attractive odors sensed by the same neuron class exhibit dissimilar activity patterns implying that, despite their shared valence and stimulus modality, these odors drive distinct neural circuitry. Our results also indicate that the connectome is a poor predictor of functional activity, emphasizing the need for comprehensive brain-activity recordings that delineate behavior-specific circuitry. Lastly, we illustrate the NeuroPAL as an unbiased analysis tool for investigating neuronal cell fate in specific mutant backgrounds. With these applications in mind, we establish a high-throughput software pipeline for automated and semi-automated cell identification using NeuroPAL. In conclusion, we demonstrate the power of the NeuroPAL as a tool for decoding whole-brain gene expression and maps of functional activity.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/676023v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>While multifocal electroretinography has become a standard ophthalmological technique, its use in cortical neuroimaging has been lesser. Vanni et al. (2005) presented the first exploration of the multifocal visual mapping methodology with fMRI. This commentary confirms the utility of this method, but also presents empirical results which suggest caveats for the use of the technique. In the current study rapid multifocal fMRI was established using m-sequence pseudo-random binary stimuli applied to visual field mapping in six young adults with normal vision. Nine contiguous regions of visual field with two rings of 4 patches and a central patch, areas scaled for cortical magnification, were pseudo-randomly stimulated, with patterned or grey images. The decorrelation of stimulus patches allowed all 256 volumes to be used for the analysis of each of the nine stimulus areas. Strong localized activation was observed for each of the four peripheral regions with the location of the activation conforming to the expected visual field retinotopy. The inner regions, including the foveal patch, did not significantly activate. We propose, on the basis of a simple correlational model of simulated eye movements, that the loss of signal is due to gaze instability. Thus, while the rapid multifocal method can be successfully applied to fMRI, the results appear quite sensitive to eye movements, the effects of which may have been overlooked by smoothing evoked responses to achieve a retinotopic map.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/675769v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Astrocytes contact thousands of synapses throughout the territory covered by its fine bushy processes. Astrocytes respond to neuronal activity with an increase in calcium concentration that is in turn linked to their capacity to modulate neuronal activity. It remains unclear whether astrocytes behave as a single functional unit that integrates all of these inputs, or if multiple functional subdomains reside within an individual astrocyte. We utilized the topographic organization of ferret visual cortex to test whether local neuronal activity can elicit spatially restricted events within an individual astrocyte. We monitored calcium activity throughout the extent of astrocytes in ferret visual cortex while presenting visual stimuli that elicit coordinated neuronal activity spatially restricted to functional columns. We found visually-driven calcium responses throughout the entire astrocyte that was largely independent in individual subdomains, often responding to different visual stimulus orientations. A model of the spatial interaction of astrocytes and neuronal orientation maps recapitulated these measurements, consistent with the hypothesis that astrocyte subdomains integrate local neuronal activity. Together, these results suggest that astrocyte responses to neural circuit activity are dominated by functional subdomains that respond locally and independently to neuronal activity.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/675728v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Despite dynamic inputs, neuronal circuits maintain relatively stable firing rates over long periods. This maintenance of firing rate, or firing rate homeostasis, is likely mediated by homeostatic mechanisms such as synaptic scaling and regulation of intrinsic excitability. Because some of these homeostatic mechanisms depend on transcription of activity-regulated genes, including Arc and Homer1a, we hypothesized that activity-regulated transcription would be required for firing rate homeostasis. Surprisingly, however, we found that cultured mouse cortical neurons grown on multi-electrode arrays homeostatically adapt their firing rates to persistent pharmacological stimulation even when activity-regulated transcription is disrupted. Specifically, we observed firing rate homeostasis Arc knock-out neurons, as well as knock-out neurons lacking activity-regulated transcription factors, AP1 and SRF. Firing rate homeostasis also occurred normally during acute pharmacological blockade of transcription. Thus, firing rate homeostasis in response to increased neuronal activity can occur in the absence of neuronal-activity-regulated transcription.</content:encoded>

Natural soil is characterized as a complex habitat with patchy hydrated islands and spatially variable nutrients that is in a constant state of change due to wetting-drying dynamics. Soil microbial activity is often concentrated in sparsely distributed hotspots that contribute disproportionally to macroscopic biogeochemical nutrient cycling and greenhouse gas emissions. The mechanistic representation of such dynamic hotspots requires new modeling approaches capable of representing the interplay between dynamic local conditions and the versatile microbial metabolic adaptations. We have developed IndiMeSH (Individual-based Metabolic network model for Soil Habitats) as a spatially explicit model for the physical and chemical microenvironments of soil, combined with an individual-based representation of bacterial motility and growth using adaptive metabolic networks. The model uses angular pore networks and a physically based description of the aqueous phase as a backbone for nutrient diffusion and bacterial dispersal combined with dynamic flux balance analysis to calculate growth rates depending on local nutrient conditions. To maximize computational efficiency, reduced scale metabolic networks are used for the simulation scenarios and evaluated strategically to the genome scale model. IndiMeSH was compared to a well-established population-based spatiotemporal metabolic network model (COMETS) and to experimental data of bacterial spatial organization in pore networks mimicking soil aggregates. IndiMeSH was then used to strategically study dynamic response of a bacterial community to abrupt environmental perturbations and the influence of habitat geometry and hydration conditions. Results illustrate that IndiMeSH is capable of representing trophic interactions among bacterial species, predicting the spatial organization and segregation of bacterial populations due to oxygen and carbon gradients, and provides insights into dynamic community responses as a consequence of environmental changes. The modular design of IndiMeSH and its implementation are adaptable, allowing it to represent a wide variety of experimental and &lt;i&gt;in silico&lt;/i&gt; microbial systems.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/OfVu8--GqEQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/6/3/ENEURO.0131-19.2019?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Reelin (Reln) and Disabled-1 (Dab1) participate in the Reln-signaling pathway and when either is deleted, mutant mice have the same spinally mediated behavioral abnormalities, increased sensitivity to noxious heat and a profound loss in mechanical sensitivity. Both Reln and Dab1 are highly expressed in dorsal horn areas that receive and convey nociceptive information, Laminae I–II, lateral Lamina V, and the lateral spinal nucleus (LSN). Lamina I contains both projection neurons and interneurons that express Neurokinin-1 receptors (NK1Rs) and they transmit information about noxious heat both within the dorsal horn and to the brain. Here, we ask whether the increased heat nociception in &lt;i&gt;Reln&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;dab1&lt;/i&gt; mutants is due to incorrectly positioned dorsal horn neurons that express NK1Rs. We found more NK1R-expressing neurons in &lt;i&gt;Reln&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;dab1&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt; Laminae I–II than in their respective wild-type mice, and some NK1R neurons co-expressed Dab1 and the transcription factor Lmx1b, confirming their excitatory phenotype. Importantly, heat stimulation in &lt;i&gt;dab1&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;/i&gt;mice induced Fos in incorrectly positioned NK1R neurons in Laminae I–II. Next, we asked whether these ectopically placed and noxious-heat responsive NK1R neurons participated in pain behavior. Ablation of the superficial NK1Rs with an intrathecal injection of a substance P analog conjugated to the toxin saporin (SSP-SAP) eliminated the thermal hypersensitivity of &lt;i&gt;dab1&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt; mice, without altering their mechanical insensitivity. These results suggest that ectopically positioned NK1R-expressing neurons underlie the heat hyperalgesia of Reelin-signaling pathway mutants, but do not contribute to their profound mechanical insensitivity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Intrinsic Insular-Frontal Networks Predict Future Nicotine Dependence Severity</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/25/5028?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Although 60% of the US population have tried smoking cigarettes, only 16% smoke regularly. Identifying this susceptible subset of the population before the onset of nicotine dependence may encourage targeted early interventions to prevent regular smoking and/or minimize severity. While prospective neuroimaging in human populations can be challenging, preclinical neuroimaging models before chronic nicotine administration can help to develop translational biomarkers of disease risk. Chronic, intermittent nicotine (0, 1.2, or 4.8 mg/kg/d; &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt; = 10–11/group) was administered to male Sprague Dawley rats for 14 d; dependence severity was quantified using precipitated withdrawal behaviors collected before, during, and following forced nicotine abstinence. Resting-state fMRI functional connectivity (FC) before drug administration was subjected to a graph theory analytical framework to form a predictive model of subsequent individual differences in nicotine dependence. Whole-brain modularity analysis identified five modules in the rat brain. A metric of intermodule connectivity, participation coefficient, of an identified insular–frontal cortical module predicted subsequent dependence severity, independent of nicotine dose. To better spatially isolate this effect, this module was subjected to a secondary exploratory modularity analysis, which segregated it into three submodules (frontal-motor, insular, and sensory). Higher FC among these three submodules and three of the five originally identified modules (striatal, frontal-executive, and sensory association) also predicted dependence severity. These data suggest that predispositional, intrinsic differences in circuit strength between insular-frontal-based brain networks before drug exposure may identify those at highest risk for the development of nicotine dependence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Developing biomarkers of individuals at high risk for addiction before the onset of this brain-based disease is essential for prevention, early intervention, and/or subsequent treatment decisions. Using a rodent model of nicotine dependence and a novel data-driven, network-based analysis of resting-state fMRI data collected before drug exposure, functional connections centered on an intrinsic insular-frontal module predicted the severity of nicotine dependence after drug exposure. The predictive capacity of baseline network measures was specific to inter-regional but not within-region connectivity. While insular and frontal regions have consistently been implicated in nicotine dependence, this is the first study to reveal that innate, individual differences in their circuit strength have the predictive capacity to identify those at greatest risk for and resilience to drug dependence.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;People show considerable variability in the degree of pleasure they experience from music.

However, it is unknown whether a neuroanatomical basis exists for this variability. We used diffusion tensor imaging and probabilistic tractography to study the relationship between music reward sensitivity and white matter microstructure connecting these two regions via the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) in 38 healthy human participants (24 females and 14 males). We found that right axial diffusivity (AD) in the STG–OFC connectivity inversely correlated with music reward sensitivity. Additionally, right mean diffusivity and left AD in the NAcc-OFC tract also showed an inverse correlation. Further, AD in this tract also correlated with previously acquired BOLD activity during music listening, but not for a control monetary reward task in the NAcc. Finally, we used mediation analysis to show that AD in the NAcc–OFC tract explains the influence of NAcc activation during a music task on music reward sensitivity. Overall, our results provide further support for the idea that the exchange of information among perceptual, integrative, and reward systems is important for musical pleasure, and that individual differences in the structure of the relevant anatomical connectivity influences the degree to which people are able to derive such pleasure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Music is one of the most important sources of pleasure for many people, but at the same time there are important individual differences in the sensitivity to musical reward. Previous studies have revealed the critical involvement of the functional connectivity between perceptual and subcortical brain areas in the enjoyment of music. However, it is unknown whether individual differences in music sensitivity might arise from variability in the structural connectivity among these areas. Here we show that structural connectivity between supratemporal and orbitofrontal cortices, and between orbitofrontal and nucleus accumbens, predict individual differences in sensibility to music reward. These results provide evidence for the critical involvement of the interaction between the subcortical reward system and higher-order cortical areas in music-induced pleasure.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Reward Prediction Error Modulates Saccade Vigor</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/25/5010?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Movement vigor, defined as the reciprocal of the latency from availability of reward to its acquisition, changes with reward magnitude: movements exhibit shorter reaction time and increased velocity when they are directed toward more rewarding stimuli. This invigoration may be due to release of dopamine before movement onset, which has been shown to be modulated by events that signal reward prediction error (RPE). Here, we generated an RPE event in the milliseconds before movement onset and tested whether there was a relationship between RPE and vigor. Human subjects (both sexes) made saccades toward an image. During execution of the primary saccade, we probabilistically changed the position and content of that image, encouraging a secondary saccade. On some trials, the content of the secondary image was more valuable than the first image, resulting in a positive RPE (+RPE) event that preceded the secondary saccade. On other trials, this content was less valuable (–RPE event). We found that reaction time of the secondary saccade was affected in an orderly fashion by the magnitude and direction of the preceding RPE event: the most vigorous saccades followed the largest +RPE, whereas the least vigorous saccades followed the largest –RPE. Presence of the secondary saccade indicated that the primary saccade had experienced a movement error, inducing trial-to-trial adaptation. However, this learning from movement error was not modulated by the RPE event. The data suggest that RPE events, which are thought to transiently alter the release of dopamine, modulate the vigor of the ensuing movement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Does dopamine release in response to a stimulus serve to invigorate the ensuing movement? To test this hypothesis, we relied on the fact that reward prediction error (RPE) is a strong modulator of dopamine. Our innovation was a task in which an RPE event occurred precisely before onset of a stimulus-driven movement. We probabilistically produced a combination of large or small, negative or positive RPE events and observed that saccade vigor carried a robust signature of the preceding RPE event: high vigor saccades followed +RPE events, whereas low vigor saccades followed –RPE events. This suggests that in humans, vigor is partly controlled through release of dopamine in the moments before onset of a movement.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: HDAC3-Mediated Repression of the Nr4a Family Contributes to Age-Related Impairments in Long-Term Memory</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/25/4999?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Aging is accompanied by cognitive deficits, including impairments in long-term memory formation. Understanding the molecular mechanisms that support preserved cognitive function in aged animals is a critical step toward identifying novel therapeutic targets that could improve memory in aging individuals. One potential mechanism is the &lt;i&gt;Nr4a&lt;/i&gt; family of genes, a group of CREB-dependent nuclear orphan receptors that have previously been shown to be important for hippocampal memory formation. Here, using a cross-species approach, we tested the role of &lt;i&gt;Nr4a1&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Nr4a2&lt;/i&gt; in age-related memory impairments. Using a rat model designed to identify individual differences in age-related memory impairments, we first identified &lt;i&gt;Nr4a2&lt;/i&gt; as a key gene that fails to be induced by learning in cognitively impaired male aged rats. Next, using a mouse model that allows for genetic manipulations, we determined that histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3) negatively regulates &lt;i&gt;Nr4a2&lt;/i&gt; in the aged male and female hippocampus. Finally, we show that overexpression of &lt;i&gt;Nr4a1&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Nr4a2&lt;/i&gt;, or both transcripts in the male mouse dorsal hippocampus can ameliorate age-related impairments in object location memory. Together, our results suggest that &lt;i&gt;Nr4a2&lt;/i&gt; may be a key mechanism that promotes preserved cognitive function in old age, with HDAC3-mediated repression of &lt;i&gt;Nr4a2&lt;/i&gt; contributing to age-related cognitive decline. More broadly, these results indicate that therapeutic strategies to promote &lt;i&gt;Nr4a&lt;/i&gt; gene expression or function may be an effective strategy to improve cognitive function in old age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Aging is accompanied by memory impairments, although there is a great deal of variability in the severity of these impairments. Identifying molecular mechanisms that promote preserved memory or participate in cognitive reserve in old age is important to develop strategies that promote healthy cognitive aging. Here, we show that learning-induced expression of the CREB-regulated nuclear receptor gene &lt;i&gt;Nr4a2&lt;/i&gt; is selectively impaired in aged rats with memory impairments. Further, we show that &lt;i&gt;Nr4a2&lt;/i&gt; is regulated by histone deacetylase HDAC3 in the aged mouse hippocampus. Finally, we demonstrate that hippocampal overexpression of either &lt;i&gt;Nr4a2&lt;/i&gt; or its family member, &lt;i&gt;Nr4a1&lt;/i&gt;, can ameliorate age-related memory impairments. This suggests that promoting &lt;i&gt;Nr4a&lt;/i&gt; expression may be a novel strategy to improve memory in aging individuals.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Dynamic Network Activation of Hypothalamic MCH Neurons in REM Sleep and Exploratory Behavior</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/25/4986?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Most brain neurons are active in waking, but hypothalamic neurons that synthesize the neuropeptide melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH) are claimed to be active only during sleep, particularly rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Here we use deep-brain imaging to identify changes in fluorescence of the genetically encoded calcium (Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;) indicator GCaMP6 in individual hypothalamic neurons that contain MCH. An &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; electrophysiology study determined a strong relationship between depolarization and Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; fluorescence in MCH neurons. In 10 freely behaving MCH-cre mice (male and female), the highest fluorescence occurred in all recorded neurons (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 106) in REM sleep relative to quiet waking or non-REM sleep. Unexpectedly, 70% of the MCH neurons had strong fluorescence activity when the mice explored novel objects. Spatial and temporal mapping of the change in fluorescence between pairs of MCH neurons revealed dynamic activation of MCH neurons during REM sleep and activation of a subset of the same neurons during exploratory behavior. Functional network activity maps will facilitate comparisons of not only single-neuron activity, but also network responses in different conditions and disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Functional activity maps identify brain circuits responding to specific behaviors, including rapid eye movement sleep (REM sleep), a sleep phase when the brain is as active as in waking. To provide the first activity map of individual neurons during REM sleep, we use deep-brain calcium imaging in unrestrained mice to map the activity of hypothalamic melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH) neurons. MCH neurons were found to be synchronously active during REM sleep, and also during the exploration of novel objects. Spatial mapping revealed dynamic network activation during REM sleep and activation of a subset of the neurons during exploratory behavior. Functional activity maps at the cellular level in specific behaviors, including sleep, are needed to establish a brain connectome.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Multifaceted Integration: Memory for Faces Is Subserved by Widespread Connections between Visual, Memory, Auditory, and Social Networks</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/25/4976?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Our ability to recognize others by their facial features is at the core of human social interaction, yet this ability varies widely within the general population, ranging from developmental prosopagnosia to &quot;super-recognizers&quot;. Previous work has focused mainly on the contribution of neural activity within the well described face network to this variance. However, given the nature of face memory in everyday life, and the social context in which it takes place, we were interested in exploring how the collaboration between different networks outside the face network in humans (measured through resting state connectivity) affects face memory performance. Fifty participants (men and women) were scanned with fMRI. Our data revealed that although the nodes of the face-processing network were tightly coupled at rest, the strength of these connections did not predict face memory performance. Instead, face recognition memory was dependent on multiple connections between these face patches and regions of the medial temporal lobe memory system (including the hippocampus), and the social processing system. Moreover, this network was selective for memory for faces, and did not predict memory for other visual objects (cars). These findings suggest that in the general population, variability in face memory is dependent on how well the face processing system interacts with other processing networks, with interaction among the face patches themselves accounting for little of the variance in memory ability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Our ability to recognize and remember faces is one of the pillars of human social interaction. Face recognition however is a very complex skill, requiring specialized neural resources in visual cortex, as well as memory, identity, and social processing, all of which are inherent in our real-world experience of faces. Yet in the general population, people vary greatly in their face memory abilities. Here we show that in the neural domain this variability is underpinned by the integration of visual, memory and social circuits, with the strength of the connections between these circuits directly linked to face recognition ability.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Conditional Deletion of CC2D1A Reduces Hippocampal Synaptic Plasticity and Impairs Cognitive Function through Rac1 Hyperactivation</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/25/4959?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Coiled-coil and C2 domain containing 1A (CC2D1A) is an evolutionarily conserved protein, originally identified as a nuclear factor-B activator through a large-scale screen of human genes. Mutations in the human &lt;i&gt;Cc2d1a&lt;/i&gt; gene result in autosomal recessive nonsyndromic intellectual disability. It remains unclear, however, how &lt;i&gt;Cc2d1a&lt;/i&gt; mutation leads to alterations in brain function. Here, we have taken advantage of Cre/loxP recombinase-based strategy to conditionally delete &lt;i&gt;Cc2d1a&lt;/i&gt; exclusively from excitatory neurons of male mouse forebrain to examine its role in hippocampal synaptic plasticity and cognitive function. We confirmed the expression of CC2D1A protein and mRNA in the mouse hippocampus. Double immunofluorescence staining showed that CC2D1A is expressed in both excitatory and inhibitory neurons of the adult hippocampus. Conditional deletion of &lt;i&gt;Cc2d1a&lt;/i&gt; (cKO) from excitatory neurons leads to impaired performance in object location memory test and altered anxiety-like behavior. Consistently, cKO mice displayed a deficit in the maintenance of LTP in the CA1 region of hippocampal slices. &lt;i&gt;Cc2d1a&lt;/i&gt; deletion also resulted in decreased complexity of apical and basal dendritic arbors of CA1 pyramidal neurons. An enhanced basal Rac1 activity was observed following &lt;i&gt;Cc2d1a&lt;/i&gt; deletion, and this enhancement was mediated by reduced SUMO-specific protease 1 (SENP1) and SENP3 expression, thus increasing the amount of Rac1 SUMOylation. Furthermore, partial blockade of Rac1 activity rescued impairments in LTP and object location memory performance in cKO mice. Together, our results implicate Rac1 hyperactivity in synaptic plasticity and cognitive deficits observed in &lt;i&gt;Cc2d1a&lt;/i&gt; cKO mice and reveal a novel role for CC2D1A in regulating hippocampal synaptic function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; CC2D1A is abundantly expressed in the brain, but there is little known about its physiological function. Taking advantage of &lt;i&gt;Cc2d1a&lt;/i&gt; cKO mice, the present study highlights the importance of CC2D1A in the maintenance of LTP at Schaffer collateral-CA1 synapses and the formation of hippocampus-dependent long-term object location memory. Our findings establish a critical link between elevated Rac1 activity, structural and synaptic plasticity alterations, and cognitive impairment caused by &lt;i&gt;Cc2d1a&lt;/i&gt; deletion. Moreover, partial blockade of Rac1 activity rescues synaptic plasticity and memory deficits in &lt;i&gt;Cc2d1a&lt;/i&gt; cKO mice. Such insights may have implications for the utility of Rac1 inhibitors in the treatment of intellectual disability caused by &lt;i&gt;Cc2d1a&lt;/i&gt; mutations in human patients.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Paraventricular Thalamus Controls Behavior during Motivational Conflict</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/25/4945?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Decision-making often involves motivational conflict because of the competing demands of approach and avoidance for a common resource: behavior. This conflict must be resolved as a necessary precursor for adaptive behavior. Here we show a role for the paraventricular thalamus (PVT) in behavioral control during motivational conflict. We used Pavlovian counterconditioning in male rats to establish a conditioned stimulus (CS) as a signal for reward (or danger) and then transformed the same CS into a signal for danger (or reward). After such training, the CS controls conflicting appetitive and aversive behaviors. To assess PVT involvement in conflict, we injected an adeno-associated virus (AAV) expressing the genetically encoded Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; indicator GCaMP and used fiber photometry to record population PVT Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; signals. We show distinct profiles of responsivity across the anterior–posterior axis of PVT during conflict, including an ordinal relationship between posterior PVT CS responses and behavior strength. To study the causal role of PVT in behavioral control during conflict, we injected AAV expressing the inhibitory hM4Di DREADD and determined the effects of chemogenetic PVT inhibition on behavior. We show that chemogenetic inhibition across the anterior–posterior axis of the PVT, but not anterior or posterior PVT alone, disrupts arbitration between appetitive and aversive behaviors when they are in conflict but has no effect when these behaviors are assessed in isolation. Together, our findings identify PVT as central to behavioral control during motivational conflict.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Animals, including humans, approach attractive stimuli and avoid aversive ones. However, they frequently face conflict when the demands of approach and avoidance are incompatible. Resolution of this conflict is fundamental to adaptive behavior. Here we show a role for the paraventricular thalamus, a nucleus of the dorsal midline thalamus, in the arbitration of appetitive and aversive behavior during motivational conflict.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Inhibitory Units: An Organizing Nidus for Feature-Selective SubNetworks in Area V1</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/25/4931?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Neuronal circuits often display small-world network architecture characterized by neuronal cliques of dense local connectivity communicating with each other through a limited number of cells that participate in multiple cliques. The principles by which such cliques organize to encode information remain poorly understood. Similarly tuned pyramidal cells that preferentially target each other may form multicellular encoding units performing distinct computational tasks. The existence of such units can reflect upon both spontaneous and stimulus-driven population events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We applied two-photon calcium imaging to study spontaneous population bursts in layer 2/3 of area V1 in male C57BL/6 mice. To identify potential small-world cliques, we searched for pyramidal cells whose calcium events had a consistent temporal relationship with the events of local inhibitory interneurons. This was guided by the intuition that groups of neurons whose synchronous firing represents a temporally coherent computational unit should be inhibited together. Pyramidal members of these interneuron-centered clusters on average displayed stronger functional connectivity between each other than with nonmember pyramidal neurons. The structure of the clusters evolved during postnatal development: cluster size and overlap between clusters decreased with developmental maturation. Pyramidal neurons in a cluster showed higher than chance tuning function similarity between each other and with the linked interneuron. Thus, spontaneous population events in V1 are shaped by small-world subnetworks of pyramidal neurons that share functional properties and work as a coherent unit with a local interneuron. These interneuron-pyramidal cell partnerships may represent a fundamental neocortical unit of computation at the population level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Neuronal circuit in layer 2/3 of mouse area V1 possesses small-world network architecture, where cliques of densely interconnected neurons (&quot;small worlds&quot;) communicate via restricted number of hub cells. We show that: (1) in mouse V1 individual small-world cliques preferably incorporate pyramidal neurons with similar visual feature tuning, and (2) ongoing population activity of such pyramidal neuron clique is temporally linked to the activity of the local interneuron sharing its feature tuning with the clique members. Functional grouping of similarly tuned interneurons and pyramidal cells into cliques may ensure that ensembles of functionally alike pyramidal cells recruited during perceptual tasks and spontaneous activity are also turned off together as a unit, with interneurons serving as organizers of linked pyramidal ensemble activity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: NPY2 Receptors Reduce Tonic Action Potential-Independent GABAB Currents in the Basolateral Amygdala</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/25/4909?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Although NPY has potent anxiolytic actions within the BLA, selective activation of BLA NPY Y&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; receptors (Y&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Rs) acutely increases anxiety by an unknown mechanism. Using &lt;i&gt;ex vivo&lt;/i&gt; male rat brain slice electrophysiology, we show that the selective Y&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;R agonist, [ahx&lt;sup&gt;5–24&lt;/sup&gt;]NPY, reduced the frequency of GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;-mediated mIPSCs in BLA principal neurons (PNs). [ahx&lt;sup&gt;5–24&lt;/sup&gt;]NPY also reduced tonic activation of GABA&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; receptors (GABA&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;R), which increased PN excitability through inhibition of a tonic, inwardly rectifying potassium current (&lt;i&gt;K&lt;sub&gt;IR&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/i&gt;). Surprisingly, Y&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;R-sensitive GABA&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;R currents were action potential-independent, persisting after treatment with TTX. Additionally, the Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-dependent, slow afterhyperpolarizing K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; current (&lt;i&gt;I&lt;sub&gt;sAHP&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/i&gt;) was enhanced in approximately half of the Y&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;R-sensitive PNs, possibly from enhanced Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; influx, permitted by reduced GABA&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;R tone. In male and female mice expressing tdTomato in Y&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;R-mRNA cells (tdT-Y&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;R mice), immunohistochemistry revealed that BLA somatostatin interneurons express Y&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Rs, as do a significant subset of BLA PNs. In tdT-Y&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;R mice, [ahx&lt;sup&gt;5–24&lt;/sup&gt;]NPY increased excitability and suppressed the &lt;i&gt;K&lt;sub&gt;IR&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/i&gt; in nearly all BLA PNs independent of tdT-Y&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;R fluorescence, consistent with presynaptic Y&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Rs on somatostatin interneurons mediating the above effects. However, only tdT-Y&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;R-expressing PNs responded to [ahx&lt;sup&gt;5–24&lt;/sup&gt;]NPY with an enhancement of the &lt;i&gt;I&lt;sub&gt;sAHP&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/i&gt;. Ultimately, increased PN excitability via acute Y&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;R activation likely correlates with enhanced BLA output, consistent with reported Y&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;R-mediated anxiogenesis. Furthermore, we demonstrate the following: (1) a novel mechanism whereby activity-independent GABA release can powerfully dampen BLA neuronal excitability via postsynaptic GABA&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;Rs; and (2) that this tonic inhibition can be interrupted by neuromodulation, here by NPY via Y&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Rs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Within the BLA, NPY is potently anxiolytic. However, selective activation of NPY&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; receptors (Y&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Rs) increases anxiety by an unknown mechanism. We show that activation of BLA Y&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Rs decreases tonic GABA release onto BLA principal neurons, probably from Y&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;R-expressing somatostatin interneurons, some of which coexpress NPY. This increases principal neuron excitability by reducing GABA&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; receptor (GABA&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;R)-mediated activation of G-protein-coupled, inwardly rectifying K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; currents. Tonic, Y&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;R-sensitive GABA&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;R currents unexpectedly persisted in the absence of action potential firing, revealing, to our knowledge, the first report of substantial, activity-independent GABA&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;R activation. Ultimately, we provide a plausible explanation for Y&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;R-mediated anxiogenesis &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; and describe a novel and modulatable means of damping neuronal excitability.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/25/4889?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Optical tools for simultaneous perturbation and measurement of neural activity open the possibility of mapping neural function over wide areas of brain tissue. However, spectral overlap of actuators and reporters presents a challenge for their simultaneous use, and optical scattering and out-of-focus fluorescence in tissue degrade resolution. To minimize optical crosstalk, we combined an optimized variant (eTsChR) of the most blue-shifted channelrhodopsin reported to-date with a nuclear-localized red-shifted Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; indicator, H2B-jRGECO1a. To perform wide-area optically sectioned imaging in tissue, we designed a structured illumination technique that uses Hadamard matrices to encode spatial information. By combining these molecular and optical approaches we made wide-area functional maps in acute brain slices from mice of both sexes. The maps spanned cortex and striatum and probed the effects of antiepileptic drugs on neural excitability and the effects of AMPA and NMDA receptor blockers on functional connectivity. Together, these tools provide a powerful capability for wide-area mapping of neuronal excitability and functional connectivity in acute brain slices.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Estrogen-Dependent Functional Spine Dynamics in Neocortical Pyramidal Neurons of the Mouse</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/25/4874?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Surgical ovariectomy has been shown to reduce spine density in hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells of rodents, and this reduction is reversed by 17β-estradiol (E2) treatment in a model of human estrogen replacement therapy. Here, we report reduction of spine density in apical dendrites of layer 5 pyramidal neurons of several neocortical regions that is reversed by subsequent E2 treatment in ovariectomized (OVX) female Thy1M-EGFP mice. We also found that OVX-associated reduction of spine density in somatosensory cortex was accompanied by a reduction in miniature EPSC (mEPSC) frequency (but not mIPSC frequency), indicating a change in functional synapses. OVX-associated spine loss in somatosensory cortex was also rescued by an agonist of the G-protein-linked estrogen receptor (GPER) but not by agonists of the classic estrogen receptors ERα/ERβ, whereas the opposite selectivity was found in area CA1. Acute treatment of neocortical slices with E2 also rescued the OVX-associated reduction in mEPSC frequency, which could be mimicked by a GPER agonist and abolished by a GPER antagonist. Time-lapse &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; two-photon imaging showed that OVX-associated reduction in spine density is achieved by both an increase in spine loss rate and a decrease in spine gain rate and that subsequent rescue by E2 reversed both of these processes. Crucially, the spines added after E2 rescue were no more likely to reappear at or nearby the sites of pre-OVX spines than those in control mice treated with vehicle. Thus, a model of estrogen replacement therapy, although restoring spine density and dynamics, does not entirely restore functional connectivity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Estrogen replacement therapy following menopause or surgical removal of the ovaries is a widespread medical practice, yet little is known about the consequences of such treatment for cells in the brain. Here, we show that estrogen replacement reverses some of the effects of surgical removal of the ovaries on the structure and function of brain cells in the mouse. Yet, importantly, the fine wiring of the brain is not returned to the presurgery state by estrogen treatment, suggesting lasting functional consequences.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: TRIM46 Organizes Microtubule Fasciculation in the Axon Initial Segment</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/25/4864?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Selective cargo transport into axons and dendrites over the microtubule network is essential for neuron polarization. The axon initial segment (AIS) separates the axon from the somatodendritic compartment and controls the microtubule-dependent transport into the axon. Interestingly, the AIS has a characteristic microtubule organization; it contains bundles of closely spaced microtubules with electron dense cross-bridges, referred to as microtubule fascicles. The microtubule binding protein TRIM46 localizes to the AIS and when overexpressed in non-neuronal cells forms microtubule arrays that closely resemble AIS fascicles in neurons. However, the precise role of TRIM46 in microtubule fasciculation in neurons has not been studied. Here we developed a novel correlative light and electron microscopy approach to study AIS microtubule organization. We show that in cultured rat hippocampal neurons of both sexes, TRIM46 levels steadily increase at the AIS during early neuronal differentiation and at the same time closely spaced microtubules form, whereas the fasciculated microtubules appear at later developmental stages. Moreover, we localized TRIM46 to the electron dense cross-bridges and show that depletion of TRIM46 causes loss of cross-bridges and increased microtubule spacing. These data indicate that TRIM46 has an essential role in organizing microtubule fascicles in the AIS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The axon initial segment (AIS) is a specialized region at the proximal axon where the action potential is initiated. In addition the AIS separates the axon from the somatodendritic compartment, where it controls protein transport to establish and maintain neuron polarity. Cargo vesicles destined for the axon recognize specialized microtubule tracks that enter the AIS. Interestingly the microtubules entering the AIS form crosslinked bundles, called microtubule fascicules. Recently we found that the microtubule-binding protein TRIM46 localizes to the AIS, where it may organize the AIS microtubules. In the present study we developed a novel correlative light and electron microscopy approach to study the AIS microtubules during neuron development and identified an essential role for TRIM46 in microtubule fasciculation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Deletion of Neuronal GLT-1 in Mice Reveals Its Role in Synaptic Glutamate Homeostasis and Mitochondrial Function</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/25/4847?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The glutamate transporter GLT-1 is highly expressed in astrocytes but also in neurons, primarily in axon terminals. We generated a conditional neuronal GLT-1 KO using synapsin 1-Cre (synGLT-1 KO) to elucidate the metabolic functions of GLT-1 expressed in neurons, here focusing on the cerebral cortex. Both synaptosomal uptake studies and electron microscopic immunocytochemistry demonstrated knockdown of GLT-1 in the cerebral cortex in the synGLT-1 KO mice. Aspartate content was significantly reduced in cerebral cortical extracts as well as synaptosomes from cerebral cortex of synGLT-1 KO compared with control littermates. &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C-Labeling of tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates originating from metabolism of [U-&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C]-glutamate was significantly reduced in synGLT-1 KO synaptosomes. The decreased aspartate content was due to diminished entry of glutamate into the tricarboxylic acid cycle. Pyruvate recycling, a pathway necessary for full glutamate oxidation, was also decreased. ATP production was significantly increased, despite unaltered oxygen consumption, in isolated mitochondria from the synGLT-1 KO. The density of mitochondria in axon terminals and perisynaptic astrocytes was increased in the synGLT-1 KO. Intramitochondrial cristae density of synGLT-1 KO mice was increased, suggesting increased mitochondrial efficiency, perhaps in compensation for reduced access to glutamate. SynGLT-1 KO synaptosomes exhibited an elevated oxygen consumption rate when stimulated with veratridine, despite a lower baseline oxygen consumption rate in the presence of glucose. GLT-1 expressed in neurons appears to be required to provide glutamate to synaptic mitochondria and is linked to neuronal energy metabolism and mitochondrial function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; All synaptic transmitters need to be cleared from the extracellular space after release, and transporters are used to clear glutamate released from excitatory synapses. GLT-1 is the major glutamate transporter, and most GLT-1 is expressed in astrocytes. Only 5%–10% is expressed in neurons, primarily in axon terminals. The function of GLT-1 in axon terminals remains unknown. Here, we used a conditional KO approach to investigate the significance of the expression of GLT-1 in neurons. We found multiple abnormalities of mitochondrial function, suggesting impairment of glutamate utilization by synaptic mitochondria in the neuronal GLT-1 KO. These data suggest that GLT-1 expressed in axon terminals may be important in maintaining energy metabolism and biosynthetic activities mediated by presynaptic mitochondria.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>RSS PAP: Vasopressin cells in the rodent olfactory bulb resemble non-bursting superficial tufted cells and are primarily inhibited upon olfactory nerve stimulation</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0431-18.2019v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;The intrinsic vasopressin system of the olfactory bulb is involved in social odor processing and consists of glutamatergic vasopressin cells (VPCs) located at the medial border of the glomerular layer. To characterize VPCs in detail, we combined various electrophysiological, neuroanatomical and two-photon Ca2+ imaging techniques in acute bulb slices from juvenile transgenic rats with eGFP-labelled VPCs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;VPCs showed regular non-bursting firing patterns, and displayed slower membrane time constants and higher input resistances versus other glutamatergic tufted cell types. VPC axons spread deeply into the external plexiform and superficial granule cell layer. Axonal projections fell into two subclasses, with either denser local columnar collaterals or longer-ranging single projections running laterally within the internal plexiform layer and deeper within the granule cell layer. VPCs always featured lateral dendrites and a tortuous apical dendrite that innervated a single glomerulus with a homogenously branching tuft. These tufts lacked Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; transients in response to single somatically-evoked action potentials and showed a moderate Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; increase upon prolonged action potential trains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Notably, electrical olfactory nerve stimulation did not result in synaptic excitation of VPCs, but triggered substantial GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptor-mediated IPSPs that masked excitatory barrages with yet longer latency. Exogenous vasopressin application reduced those IPSPs, as well as olfactory-nerve evoked EPSPs recorded from external tufted cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In summary, VPCs can be classified as non-bursting, vertical superficial tufted cells. Moreover, our findings imply that sensory input alone cannot trigger excitation of VPCs, arguing for specific additional pathways for excitation or disinhibition in social contexts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance statement&lt;/b&gt; Efficient sensing of conspecific odor signatures is essential for most rodent social behavior. Although olfactory bulb vasopressin was shown to be a potent facilitator of social odor processing, little is known on the cellular substrate of the intrinsic vasopressin system. Here we provide a detailed characterization of the anatomical and electrophysiological properties of the bulbar vasopressin cells. While we also identify several targets of vasopressin action, we find that stimulation of the sensory inputs to the bulb results primarily in vasopressin cell inhibition, implying that excitation of the bulbar vasopressin system requires additional still unknown excitatory or dis-inhibitory inputs which might confer social specificity. These insights may complement the knowledge on vasopressinergic modulation of social stimuli in limbic brain structures.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>RSS PAP: 3D Electron Microscopy study of synaptic organization of the normal human transentorhinal cortex and its possible alterations in Alzheimers disease</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0140-19.2019v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;The transentorhinal cortex (TEC) is an obliquely oriented cortex located in the medial temporal lobe and, together with the entorhinal cortex, is one of the first affected areas in Alzheimer’s disease (AD). One of the most widely accepted hypothesis is that synaptopathy (synaptic alterations and loss) represents the major structural correlate of the cognitive decline observed in AD. However, very few electron microscope studies are available; the most common method to estimate synaptic density indirectly is by counting —at the light microscopic level— immunoreactive puncta using synaptic markers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To investigate synaptic morphology and possible alterations related to AD, a detailed three-dimensional (3D) ultrastructural analysis using focused ion beam/scanning electron microscopy (FIB/SEM) was performed in the neuropil of layer II of the TEC in human brain samples from non-demented subjects and AD patients. Evaluation of the proportion and shape of asymmetric and symmetric synapses (AS and SS, respectively) targeting spines or dendritic shafts was performed using 3D reconstructions of every synapse. The 3D analysis of 4722 synapses revealed that the preferable targets were spine heads for AS and dendritic shafts for SS, both in control and AD cases. However, in AD patients, we observed a reduction in the percentage of synapses targeting spine heads. Regarding the shape of synapses, in both control cases and AD samples, the vast majority of synapses had a macular shape, followed by perforated or horseshoe-shaped synapses, with fragmented synapses being the least frequent type. Moreover, comparisons showed an increased number of fragmented AS in AD patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Determination of postsynaptic targets, shape and size of the synaptic junctions provide critical data on synaptic functionality. However, as far as we know, detailed 3D synaptic morphology and identification of postsynaptic targets in serial sections have not been performed before in the human brain. The present study represents the first attempt to unveil the synaptic organization of the neuropil of the human brain at the ultrastructural level using 3D electron microscopy. Our present results provide a new, large, quantitative ultrastructure dataset of the synaptic organization of the normal human cortex and of the synaptic alterations that occur in AD. Thus, these results may help to understand the relationship between alterations of the synaptic circuits and the cognitive deterioration in AD.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>RSS PAP: In-vivo quantitative image analysis of age-related morphological changes of C. elegans neurons reveals a correlation between neurite bending and novel neurite outgrowths</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0014-19.2019v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;The aging of the human brain in the absence of diseases is accompanied by subtle changes of neuronal morphology, such as dendrite restructuring, neuronal sprouting, and synaptic deteriorations, rather than neurodegeneration or gross deterioration. Similarly, the nervous system of &lt;i&gt;C. elegans&lt;/i&gt; does not show neurodegeneration or gross deterioration during normal aging, but displays subtle alterations in neuronal morphology. The occurrence of these age-dependent abnormalities is stochastic and dynamic, which poses a major challenge to fully capture them for quantitative comparison. Here, we developed a semi-automated pipeline for quantitative image analysis of these features during aging. We employed and evaluated this pipeline herein to reproduce findings from previous studies using visual inspection of neuronal morphology. Importantly, our approach can also quantify additional features, such as soma volume, the length of neurite outgrowths, and their location along the aged neuron. We found that, during aging, the soma of neurons decreases in volume, whereas the number and length of neurite outgrowths from the soma both increase. Long-lived animals showed less decrease in soma volume, fewer and shorter neurite outgrowths, and protection against abnormal sharp bends preferentially localized at the distal part of the dendrites during aging. We found a correlation of sharp bends with neurite outgrowth, suggesting the hypothesis that sharp bends might proceed neurite outgrowths. Thus, our semi-automated pipeline can help researchers to obtain and analyze quantitative datasets of this stochastic process for comparison across genotypes and to identify correlations to facilitate the generation of novel hypothesis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; The etiology of age-dependent morphological changes in neurons remains elusive. The heterogeneity of these refinements requires an unbiased quantitative acquisition and analysis to pin-point the molecular underpinning of these structural changes. Here, we developed a work-flow and adopted algorithms to allow researchers to capture and analyse these age-dependent changes of &lt;i&gt;C. elegans&lt;/i&gt; touch receptor neurons &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. Increasing the traceability and quantification of these stochastic changes will aid researchers to gain mechanistic insights into the underlying biology of these age-dependent morphological changes in aging neurons.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To examine the association between sleep‐disordered breathing and stroke outcomes, and determine the contribution of sleep‐disordered breathing to outcome disparities in Mexican Americans.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ischemic stroke patients (n = 995), identified from the population‐based Brain Attack Surveillance in Corpus Christi Project (2010–2015), were offered participation in a sleep‐disordered breathing study including a home sleep apnea test (ApneaLink Plus). Sleep‐disordered breathing (respiratory event index ≥10) was determined soon after stroke. Neurologic, functional, cognitive, and quality of life outcomes were assessed at 90 days poststroke. Regression models were used to assess associations between sleep‐disordered breathing and outcomes, adjusted for sociodemographics, prestroke function and cognition, health‐risk behaviors, stroke severity, and vascular risk factors.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Median age was 67 years (interquartile range [IQR] = 59–78); 62.1% were Mexican American. Median respiratory event index was 14 (IQR = 6–25); 62.8% had sleep‐disordered breathing. Sleep‐disordered breathing was associated with worse functional outcome (mean difference in activities of daily living/instrumental activities of daily living score = 0.15, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.01–0.28) and cognitive outcome (mean difference in modified Mini‐Mental State Examination = −2.66, 95% CI = −4.85 to −0.47) but not neurologic or quality of life outcomes. Sleep‐disordered breathing accounted for 9 to 10% of ethnic differences in functional and cognitive outcome and was associated with cognitive outcome more strongly for Mexican Americans (β = −3.97, 95% CI = −6.63 to −1.31) than non‐Hispanic whites (β = −0.40, 95% CI = −4.18 to 3.39, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;‐interaction = 0.15).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sleep‐disordered breathing is associated with worse functional and cognitive function at 90 days poststroke. These outcomes are reasonable endpoints for future trials of sleep‐disordered breathing treatment in stroke. If effective, sleep‐disordered breathing treatment may somewhat lessen ethnic stroke outcome disparities. ANN NEUROL 2019&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: Induction of brain‐infiltrating T‐bet–expressing B cells in multiple sclerosis</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25508?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Results from anti‐CD20 therapies demonstrate that B‐ and T‐cell interaction is a major driver of multiple sclerosis (MS). The local presence of B‐cell follicle‐like structures and oligoclonal bands in MS patients indicates that certain B cells infiltrate the central nervous system (CNS) to mediate pathology. Which peripheral triggers underlie the development of CNS‐infiltrating B cells is not fully understood.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ex vivo flow cytometry was used to assess chemokine receptor profiles of B cells in blood, cerebrospinal fluid, meningeal, and brain tissues of MS patients (n = 10). Similar analyses were performed for distinct memory subsets in the blood of untreated and natalizumab‐treated MS patients (n = 38). To assess T‐bet(CXCR3)&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; B‐cell differentiation, we cultured B cells from MS patients (n = 21) and healthy individuals (n = 34) under  T helper 1‐ and TLR9‐inducing conditions. Their CNS transmigration capacity was confirmed using brain endothelial monolayers.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CXC chemokine receptor 3 (CXCR3)‐expressing B cells were enriched in different CNS compartments of MS patients. Treatment with the clinically effective drug natalizumab prevented the recruitment of CXCR3&lt;sup&gt;high&lt;/sup&gt; IgG1&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; subsets, corresponding to their increased ability to cross CNS barriers in vitro. Blocking of interferon‐γ (IFNγ) reduced the transmigration potential and antigen‐presenting function of these cells. IFNγ‐induced B cells from MS patients showed increased T‐bet expression and plasmablast development. Additional TLR9 triggering further upregulated T‐bet and CXCR3, and was essential for IgG1 switching.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study demonstrates that T‐bet&lt;sup&gt;high&lt;/sup&gt; IgG1&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; B cells are triggered by IFNγ and TLR9 signals, likely contributing to enhanced CXCR3‐mediated recruitment and local reactivity in the CNS of MS patients. ANN NEUROL 2019&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1906.07663</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Humans and animals show remarkable flexibility in adjusting their behaviour
when their goals, or rewards in the environment change. While such flexibility
is a hallmark of intelligent behaviour, these multi-task scenarios remain an
important challenge for machine learning algorithms and neurobiological models
alike. Factored representations can enable flexible behaviour by abstracting
away general aspects of a task from those prone to change, while nonparametric
methods provide a principled way of using similarity to past experiences to
guide current behaviour. Here we combine the successor representation (SR),
that factors the value of actions into expected outcomes and corresponding
rewards, with evaluating task similarity through nonparametric inference and
clustering the space of rewards. The proposed algorithm improves SR's transfer
capabilities by inverting a generative model over tasks, while also explaining
important neurobiological signatures of place cell representation in the
hippocampus. It dynamically samples from a flexible number of distinct SR maps
while accumulating evidence about the current reward context, and outperforms
competing algorithms in settings with both known and unsignalled rewards
changes. It reproduces the &quot;flickering&quot; behaviour of hippocampal maps seen when
rodents navigate to changing reward locations, and gives a quantitative account
of trajectory-dependent hippocampal representations (so-called splitter cells)
and their dynamics. We thus provide a novel algorithmic approach for multi-task
learning, as well as a common normative framework that links together these
different characteristics of the brain's spatial representation.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1906.07570</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The Hodgkin-Huxley model describes the conduction of the nervous impulse
through the axon, whose membrane's electric response can be described employing
multiple connected electric circuits containing capacitors, voltage sources,
and conductances. These conductances depend on previous depolarizing membrane
voltages, which can be identified with a memory resistive element called
memristor. Inspired by the recent quantization of the memristor, a simplified
Hodgkin-Huxley model including a single ion channel has been studied in the
quantum regime. Here, we study the quantization of the complete Hodgkin-Huxley
model, accounting for all three ion channels, and introduce a quantum source,
together with an output waveguide as the connection to a subsequent neuron. Our
system consists of two memristors and one resistor, describing potassium,
sodium, and chloride ion channel conductances, respectively, and a capacitor to
account for the axon's membrane capacitance. We study the behavior of both ion
channel conductivities and the circuit voltage, and we compare the results with
those of the single channel, for a given quantum state of the source. It is
remarkable that, in opposition to the single-channel model, we are able to
reproduce the voltage spike in an adiabatic regime. Arguing that the circuit
voltage is a quantum variable, we find a purely quantum-mechanical contribution
in the system voltage's second moment. This work represents a complete study of
the Hodgkin-Huxley model in the quantum regime, establishing a recipe for

way for advances in hardware-based neuromorphic quantum computing, as well as

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1906.07546</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is widely used in clinical
applications to highlight brain areas involved in specific cognitive processes.
Brain impairments, such as tumors, suppress the fMRI activation of the
anatomical areas they invade and, thus, brain-damaged functional networks
present missing links/areas of activation. The identification of the missing
circuitry components is of crucial importance to estimate the damage extent.
The study of functional networks associated to clinical tasks but performed by
healthy individuals becomes, therefore, of paramount concern. These `healthy'
networks can, indeed, be used as control networks for clinical studies.In this
work we investigate the functional architecture of 20 healthy individuals
performing a language task designed for clinical purposes. We unveil a common
architecture persistent across all subjects under study, which involves Broca's
area, Wernicke's area, the Premotor area, and the pre-Supplementary motor area.
We study the connectivity weight of this circuitry by using the k-core
centrality measure and we find that three of these areas belong to the most
robust structure of the functional language network for the specific task under
study. Our results provide useful insight for clinical applications on
primarily important functional connections which, thus, should be preserved
through brain surgery.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1906.07511</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Although several ADAMs (A disintegrin-like and metalloproteases) have been
shown to contribute to the amy-loid precursor protein (APP) metabolism, the
full spectrum of metalloproteases involved in this metabolism remains to be
established. Transcriptomic analyses centred on metalloprotease genes unraveled
a 50% decrease in ADAM30 expression that inversely correlates with amyloid load
in Alzheimer's disease brains. Accordingly, in vitro down-or up-regulation of
ADAM30 expression triggered an increase/decrease in A$\beta$ peptides levels
whereas expression of a biologically inactive ADAM30 (ADAM30 mut) did not
affect A$\beta$ secretion. Proteomics/cell-based experiments showed that
ADAM30-dependent regulation of APP metabolism required both cathepsin D (CTSD)
activation and APP sorting to lysosomes. Accordingly, in Alzheimer-like
transgenic mice, neuronal ADAM30 over-expression lowered A$\beta$42 secretion
in neuron primary cultures, soluble A$\beta$42 and amyloid plaque load levels
in the brain and concomitantly enhanced CTSD activity and finally rescued long
term potentiation.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Bayesian fusion and multimodal DCM for EEG and fMRI. (arXiv:1906.07354v1 [q-bio.QM])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1906.07354</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;This paper asks whether integrating multimodal EEG and fMRI data offers a
better characterisation of functional brain architectures than either modality
alone. This evaluation rests upon a dynamic causal model that generates both
EEG and fMRI data from the same neuronal dynamics. We introduce the use of
Bayesian fusion to provide informative (empirical) neuronal priors - derived
from dynamic causal modelling (DCM) of EEG data - for subsequent DCM of fMRI
data. To illustrate this procedure, we generated synthetic EEG and fMRI
timeseries for a mismatch negativity (or auditory oddball) paradigm, using
biologically plausible model parameters (i.e., posterior expectations from a
DCM of empirical, open access, EEG data). Using model inversion, we found that
Bayesian fusion provided a substantial improvement in marginal likelihood or
model evidence, indicating a more efficient estimation of model parameters, in
relation to inverting fMRI data alone. We quantified the benefits of multimodal
fusion with the information gain pertaining to neuronal and haemodynamic
parameters - as measured by the Kullback-Leibler divergence between their prior
and posterior densities. Remarkably, this analysis suggested that EEG data can
improve estimates of haemodynamic parameters; thereby furnishing
proof-of-principle that Bayesian fusion of EEG and fMRI is necessary to resolve
conditional dependencies between neuronal and haemodynamic estimators. These
results suggest that Bayesian fusion may offer a useful approach that exploits
the complementary temporal (EEG) and spatial (fMRI) precision of different data
modalities. We envisage the procedure could be applied to any multimodal
dataset that can be explained by a DCM with a common neuronal parameterisation.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Brain Maturation Study during Adolescence Using Graph Laplacian Learning Based Fourier Transform. (arXiv:1906.07211v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1906.07211</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Objective: Longitudinal neuroimaging studies have demonstrated that
adolescence is the crucial developmental epoch of continued brain growth and
change. A large number of researchers dedicate to uncovering the mechanisms
about brain maturity during adolescence. Motivated by both achievement in graph
signal processing and recent evidence that some brain areas act as hubs
connecting functionally specialized systems, we proposed an approach to detect
these regions from spectral analysis perspective. In particular, as human brain
undergoes substantial development throughout adolescence, we addressed the
challenge by evaluating the functional network difference among age groups from
functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) observations. Methods: We treated
these observations as graph signals defined on the parcellated functional brain
regions and applied graph Laplacian learning based Fourier Transform (GLFT) to
transform the original graph signals into frequency domain. Eigen-analysis was
conducted afterwards to study the behavior of the corresponding brain regions,
which enables the characterization of brain maturation. Result: We first
evaluated our method on the synthetic data and further applied the method to
resting and task state fMRI imaging data from Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental
Cohort (PNC) dataset, comprised of normally developing adolescents from 8 to
22. The model provided a highest accuracy of 95.69% in distinguishing different
adolescence stages. Conclusion: We detected 13 hubs from resting state fMRI and
16 hubs from task state fMRI that are highly related to brain maturation
process. Significance: The proposed GLFT method is powerful in extracting the
brain connectivity patterns and identifying hub regions with a high prediction
power

	<content:encoded>MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding molecules that regulate a large number of genes for post-transcriptional repression by recognizing semi-complementary target sequences that are usually located in the 3′ UTR sequence of the mRNA. Altered miRNA expression has been associated with several pathological processes, including polyglutamine (Poly Q) diseases. Specific expression patterns in the brain parenchyma and circulating fluids have been highlighted as potential biomarkers for Poly Q disease diagnosis and prognosis. Several miRNAs have been consistently identified in various diseases, including Huntington’s disease (HD) and spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA). In this review, we describe the emerging role of miRNAs in Poly Q diseases and provide an overview on general miRNA biology, implications in pathophysiology, and their potential roles as future biomarkers and applications for therapy.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00637</link>
	<content:encoded>Cerebral ischemia is a complex pathology involving a cascade of cellular mechanisms, which deregulate proteostasis and lead to neuronal death. Proteostasis refers to the equilibrium between protein synthesis, folding and transport; and protein degradation. Within the brain proteostasis plays key roles in learning and memory by controlling protein synthesis and degradation. Two important pathways are implicated in proteostasis’ regulation: the unfolded protein response (UPR) and macroautophagy (called hereafter autophagy). Both are necessary for cell survival, however their overactivation in time or intensity often leads to cell death. Moreover, UPR and autophagy can activate and potentiate each other to worsen the issue of cerebral ischemia. Better comprehension of autophagy and ER stress will allow therapeutic strategies for stroke both at the acute phase and during recovery.
The interest of this review is to summarize the latest therapeutic advances implicating ER stress or autophagy in cerebral ischemia. In addition, we discuss the interest to study proteostasis as a single pathway rather than studying either ER stress or autophagy in stroke.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00628</link>
	<content:encoded>A central, unresolved problem in affective neuroscience is to understand how emotions are represented in activities of the nervous system. Many studies are striving to find the localization of basic emotions in the brain but failed. Thus many psychologists suspect the specific neural loci for basic emotions, instead, some proposed that there are specific neural structures for the core affects, such as arousal and hedonic value. The reason for this widespread difference might be that basic emotions used previously can be further divided into more “basic” emotions. Here we review brain imaging data and neuropsychological data, and try to address this question with an integrative model. In this model, we argue that basic emotions are not contrary to the dimensional studies of emotions (core affects). We propose that basic emotion should locate on the axis in the dimensions of emotion, and only represent one typical core affect (arousal or valence). Therefore, we propose four basic emotions: joy-on positive axis of hedonic dimension, sadness-on negative axis of hedonic dimension, fear and anger are twin emotions and locate on the top of vertical dimensions. This new model about basic emotions and construction model of emotions is promising  to improve and reformulate neurobiological models of basic emotions.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Deep learning has great potential for imaging classification by extracting low to high-level features. Our aim was to train a convolution neural network (CNN) with single T2-weighted FLAIR sequence to classify different cognitive performances in patients with subcortical ischemic vascular disease (SIVD). 
Totally 217 patients with SIVD (including 52 vascular dementia (VaD), 82 vascular mild cognitive impairment (VaMCI), 83 non-cognitive impairment (NCI)) and 46 matched healthy controls (HCs) underwent MRI scans and neuropsychological assessment. 2D and 3D CNNs were trained to classify VaD, VaMCI, NCI and HCs based on FLAIR data.
For 3D-based model, loss curves of training set approached 0.017 after about 20 epochs, while the curves of testing set maintained at about 0.114. The accuracy of training set and testing set reached 99.7% and 96.9% after about 30 and 35 epochs, respectively. However, the accuracy of 2D-based model was only around 70%, which performed significantly worse than 3D-based model.
This experiment suggests us that deep learning, is a powerful and convenient method to classify different cognitive performances in SIVD by extracting the shift and scale invariant features of neuroimaging data with single FLAIR sequence. 3D-CNN is superior to 2D-CNN which proposes clinical evaluation with MRI multiplanar reformation or volume scanning.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00622</link>
	<content:encoded>Hundreds of millions of general anesthesia are performed each year on patients all over the world. Among these patients, 0.1-0.2 % are victims of Accidental Awareness during General Anesthesia (AAGA), i.e. an unexpected awakening during a surgical procedure under general anesthesia. Although anesthesiologists try to closely monitor patients using various techniques to prevent this terrifying phenomenon, there is currently no efficient solution to accurately detect its occurrence. We propose the conception of an innovative passive brain-computer interface (BCI) based on an intention of movement to prevent AAGA. Indeed, patients typically try to move to alert the medical  staff during an AAGA, only to discover that they are unable to. First, we examine the challenges of such a BCI, i.e. the lack of a trigger to facilitate when to look for an intention to move, as well as the necessity for a high classification accuracy. Then, we present a solution that incorporates Median Nerve Stimulation (MNS). We investigate the specific modulations that MNS causes in the motor cortex and confirm that they can be altered by an intention of movement. Finally, we perform experiments on 16 healthy participants to assess whether an MI-based BCI using MNS is able to generate high classification accuracies. Our results show that MNS may provide a foundation for an innovative BCI that would allow the detection of AAGA.</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Brain Imaging Methods section | New and Recent Articles: Impaired Motor Skill Acquisition Using Mirror Visual Feedback Improved by Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) in Patients With Parkinson’s Disease</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00602</link>
	<content:encoded>Recent non-invasive brain stimulation techniques in combination with motor training can enhance neuroplasticity and learning. It is reasonable to assume that such neuroplasticity-based interventions constitute a useful rehabilitative tool for patients with Parkinson’s Disease (PD). Regarding motor skill training, many kinds of tasks that do not involve real motor movements have been applied to PD patients. The purpose of this study is to elucidate whether motor skill training using mirror visual feedback (MVF) is useful to patients with PD in order to improve untrained hand performance dependent on the time course of training; and whether MVF combined with anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) over primary motor cortex (M1) causes an additional effect based on increased motor cortical excitability. Eighteen right-handed patients with PD in the off-medication state and 10 age-matched healthy subjects (HS) performed four sessions of right-hand ball rotation using MVF (intervention) on two separate days, one week apart (Day1 and Day2). HS subjects received only sham stimulation. The intervention included four sessions of motor-skill training using MVF for 20 minutes comprised of four sets of training for 30 seconds each. PD patients were randomly divided into two intervention groups without or with anodal tDCS over the right M1 contralateral to the untrained hand. As the behavior evaluation, the number of ball rotations of the left hand was counted before (pre) and immediately after (post) intervention on both days (pre Day1, post Day1, pre Day2, and post Day2). Motor evoked potential (MEP), input-output function, and cortical silent period were recorded to evaluate the motor cortical excitatory and inhibitory system in M1 pre Day1 and post Day2. The number of ball rotations of the left hand and the facilitation of MEP by intervention were significantly impaired in patients with PD compared to HS. In contrast, if anodal tDCS was applied to right M1 of patients with PD, the number of ball rotations in accordance with I-O function at 150% intensity was significantly increased after Day1 and retained until Day2. This finding may help provide a new strategy for neurorehabilitation improving task-specific motor memory without real motor movements in PD.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00561</link>
	<content:encoded>Despite the high prevalence and devastating outcome, only a few treatment options for cerebral ischemic stroke exist. Based on the nitric oxide (NO)-stimulating capacity of Non-Pulsed Sinusoidal Electromagnetic Field (NP-SEMF) and the possible neuroprotective role of NO in ischemic stroke, we hypothesized that NP-SEMF is able to enhance survival and neurological outcome in a rat model of cerebral ischemia. The animals in which ischemic injury was induced by occlusion of both common carotid arteries, received daily 20 minutes NP-SEMF of either 10 or 60 Hz for 4 days. NP-SEMF dramatically increased survival, reduced the size of the infarcted brain area and significantly improved the neurological score of the surviving rats. Corresponding to previous reports, NP-SEMF was able to induce NO production in vitro. The importance of NO as a key signaling molecule was highlighted by inhibition of the NP-SEMF beneficial effects in the rat stroke model after blocking NO synthase (NOS). Our results indicate for the first time that NP-SEMF exposure (13.5mT at 60 Hz and 10 Hz) improves the survival and neurological outcome of rats subjected to cerebral ischemia and that this effect is mediated by NO, underlining the great therapeutic potential of NP-SEMF as therapy for ischemic stroke.</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Effects of a Brain-Computer Interface With Virtual Reality (VR) Neurofeedback: A Pilot Study in Chronic Stroke Patients</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2019.00210</link>
	<content:encoded>Rehabilitation for stroke patients with severe motor impairments is burdensome and demanding because most of the current rehabilitation options require some volitional movement to train the affected side. However, research has shown that survivors of severe stroke may receive modest benefits from action observation, virtual reality (VR), and brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). These approaches have shown some success in strengthening key motor pathways thought to support motor recovery after stroke. The purpose of this study was to combine the principles of action observation, VR, and BCI in a platform called REINVENT and assess its effects on four chronic stroke patients across different levels of motor impairment. REINVENT acquires post-stroke EEG signals that indicate an attempt to move and drives the movement of a virtual avatar arm, allowing patient-driven action observation neurofeedback in VR. In addition, synchronous electromyography (EMG) data were also captured to monitor overt muscle activity. Our results show that this EEG-based BCI can be used by stroke survivors across a wide range of motor disabilities. Finally, individual results suggest that patients with more severe motor impairments benefit the most from EEG-based neurofeedback, while patients with more mild impairments may benefit more from EMG-based feedback, harnessing existing sensorimotor pathways. Future research is needed to confirm these findings in a larger and more diverse population.</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Measuring Sharp Waves and Oscillatory Population Activity With the Genetically Encoded Calcium Indicator GCaMP6f</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2019.00274</link>
	<content:encoded>GCaMP6f is among the most widely used genetically-encoded calcium indicators for monitoring neuronal activity. Applications are at both the cellular and population levels. Here we explore two important and under-explored issues. First, we have tested if GCaMP6f is sensitive enough for the detection of population activity with sparse firing, similar to the sensitivity of the local field potential (LFP). Second, we have tested if GCaMP6f is fast enough for the detection of fast network oscillations critical for the encoding and consolidation of memory. We have focused this study on the activity of the hippocampal network including sharp waves (SWs), carbachol-induced theta oscillations, and interictal-like spikes. We compare simultaneous LFP and optical GCaMP6f fluorescent recordings in Thy1-GCaMP6f mouse hippocampal slices. We observe that SWs produce a clear population GCaMP6f signal above noise with an average magnitude of 0.3% ΔF/F. This population signal is highly correlated with the LFP, albeit with a delay of 40.3 ms (SD 10.8 ms). The population GCaMP6f signal follows the LFP evoked by 20 Hz stimulation with high fidelity, while electrically evoked oscillations up to 40 Hz were detectable with reduced amplitude. GCaMP6f and LFP signals showed a large amplitude discrepancy. The amplitude of GCaMP6f fluorescence increased by a factor of 28.9 (SD 13.5) between spontaneous SWs and carbachol-induced theta bursts, while the LFP amplitude increased by a factor of 2.4 (SD 1.0). Our results suggest that GCaMP6f is a useful tool for applications commonly considered beyond the scope of genetically-encoded calcium indicators. In particular, population GCaMP6f signals are sensitive enough for detecting synchronous network events with sparse firing and sub-threshold activity, as well as asynchronous events with only a nominal LFP. In addition, population GCaMP6f signals are fast enough for monitoring theta and beta oscillations (&amp;lt; 25 Hz). Faster calcium indicators (e.g., GCaMP7) will further improve the frequency response for the detection of gamma band oscillations. The advantage of population optical over LFP recordings are that they are non-contact and free from stimulation artifacts. These features may be particularly useful for high-throughput recordings and applications sensitive to stimulus artifact, such as monitoring responses during continuous stimulation.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Sensory neurons with cell bodies situated in dorsal root ganglia convey information from external or internal sites of the body such as actual or potential harm, temperature or muscle length to the central nervous system. In recent years, large investigative efforts have worked towards an understanding of different types of DRG neurons at transcriptional, translational and functional levels. Those studies most commonly rely on data obtained from laboratory animals. Human DRG however, have received far less investigative focus over the last 30 years. Nevertheless, knowledge about human sensory neurons is critical for a translational research approach and future therapeutic development. This review aims to summarize both historical and emerging information about the size and location of human DRG, highlighting advances in the understanding of the neurochemical characteristics of human DRG neurons, in particular nociceptive neurons.</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroanatomy | New and Recent Articles: A Role for the Claustrum in Salience Processing?</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnana.2019.00064</link>
	<content:encoded>The claustrum (CLA) is a subcortical structure, present only in mammals, whose function remains uncertain. Previously, using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) in awake head-fixed rats, we found evidence that the CLA is part of the rodent homolog of the default mode network (Smith et al., 2017). This network emerged as strong functional connections between the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), mediodorsal (MD) thalamus, and CLA in the awake state, which were not present following administration of isoflurane anesthesia. In the present report, we review evidence indicating that the rodent CLA also has connections with structures identified in the rodent homolog of the salience network, a circuit that directs attention towards the most relevant stimuli among a multitude of sensory inputs (Seeley et al., 2007; Menon and Uddin, 2010). In humans, this circuit consists of functional connections between the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and a region that encompasses both the CLA and insular cortex. We further go on to review the similarities and differences between the functional and anatomical connections of the CLA and insula in rodents using both rs-fMRI and neuroanatomical tracing, respectively. We analyze in detail the connectivity of the CLA with the cingulate cortex, which is a major node in the salience network and has been shown to modulate attention. When considered with other recent behavior and physiology studies, the data reveal a role for the CLA in salience-guided orienting. More specifically, we hypothesize that limbic information from mPFC, MD thalamus, and the basolateral amygdala are integrated by the CLA to guide modality-related regions of motor and sensory cortex in directing attention towards relevant (i.e. salient) sensory events.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Golgi staining, though invented hundreds of years ago, is still a reliable method to study cytoarchitecture of the brain. Almost all published Golgi staining protocols and methods were for microtome, and it was rarely applied in cryosection, which restricted the application of this technique. Currently, several commercial Golgi-stain kits are available for both:  vibratome section and cryosection, but these kits are costly and it is still challenging for researchers to get fine results. In the present study, we described a protocol of Golgi-Cox Staining for Cryosection, with the modified cryosection protection solution based on the Golgi –Cox method, which makes cryosection easily applied  in the section of the Golgi-Cox impregnated tissue. Our methods provide a low-cost and simple option for Golgi staining, and it will facilitate researchers to get fine Golgi staining results for neuronal architecture studies.</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroanatomy | New and Recent Articles: Patterned Vascularization of Embryonic Mouse Forebrain, and Neuromeric Topology of Major Human Subarachnoidal Arterial Branches: A Prosomeric Mapping</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnana.2019.00059</link>
	<content:encoded>The prosomeric brain model contemplates progressive regionalization of the central nervous system from a molecular and morphological ontogenetic perspective. It defines the forebrain axis relative to the notochord, and contemplates intersecting longitudinal (zonal, columnar) and transversal (neuromeric) patterning mechanisms. A checkboard pattern of histogenetic units of the neural wall results, where each unit is differentially fated by an unique profile of active genes. These natural neural units later expand their radial dimension during neurogenesis, histogenesis, and correlative differential morphogenesis. This fundamental topologic framework is shared by all vertebrates, as a Bauplan, each lineage varying in some subtle aspects. So far the prosomeric model has been applied only to neural structures, but we attempt here a prosomeric analysis of the hypothesis that major vessels invade the brain wall in patterns that are congruent with its intrinsic natural developmental units, as postulated in the prosomeric model. Anatomic and embryologic studies of brain blood vessels have classically recorded a conserved pattern of branches (thus the conventional terminology), and clinical experience has discovered a standard topography of many brain arterial terminal fields. Such results were described under assumptions of the columnar forebrain model, prevalent during the last century, but this is found insufficient in depth and explanatory power in the modern molecular scenario. We have thus explored the possibility that brain vascularization in rodents and humans may relate systematically to genoarchitectonic forebrain subdivisions contemplated in the prosomeric model. Specifically, we examined first whether early vascular invasion of some molecularly characterized prosomeric domains shows heterochrony. We indeed found a heterochronic pattern of vascular invasion that distinguishes between adjacent brain areas with differential molecular profiles. We next mapped topologically on the prosomeric model the major arterial branches serving the human brain. The results of this approach bear on the possibility of a developmentally-based modern arterial terminology.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>This work describes the conception, synthesis and in vitro and in vivo biological evaluation of novel Multi-Target Directed Ligands (MTDL) able to both activate 5-HT4 receptors, block 5-HT6 receptors and inhibit acetylcholinesterase activity (AChE), in order to exert a synergistic antiamnesic effect, potentially useful in Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Indeed, both activation of 5-HT4 and blockage of 5-HT6 receptors led to an enhanced acetylcholine release, whose depletion would be implied in AD. The preservation of the latter through the inhibition of AChE would complete this approach and lead to an efficiently restoring of the cholinergic neurotransmission. Furthermore, 5-HT4 receptor agonists, also, appear able to promote the non-amyloidogenic cleavage of the amyloid precursor protein and to favor the production of the neurotrophic protein sAPP. This study succeeded in yielding such pleiotropic compounds whose one of them further displayed in vivo an anti-amnesiant effect in a model of scopolamine-induced deficit of working memory from the dose of 0.3 mg/kg.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Olfactory associative learning in &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; is mediated by synaptic plasticity between the Kenyon cells of the mushroom body and their output neurons. Both Kenyon cells and their inputs from projection neurons are cholinergic, yet little is known about the physiological function of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors in learning in adult flies. Here we show that aversive olfactory learning in adult flies requires type A muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChR-A), particularly in the gamma subtype of Kenyon cells. mAChR-A inhibits odor responses and is localized in Kenyon cell dendrites. Moreover, mAChR-A knockdown impairs the learning-associated depression of odor responses in a mushroom body output neuron. Our results suggest that mAChR-A function in Kenyon cell dendrites is required for synaptic plasticity between Kenyon cells and their output neurons.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/47691</link>
	<content:encoded>Lsr2 is a nucleoid-associated protein conserved throughout the actinobacteria, including the antibiotic-producing &lt;i&gt;Streptomyces. Streptomyces&lt;/i&gt; species encode paralogous Lsr2 proteins (Lsr2 and Lsr2-like, or LsrL), and we show here that of the two, Lsr2 has greater functional significance. We found that Lsr2 binds AT-rich sequences throughout the chromosome, and broadly represses gene expression. Strikingly, specialized metabolic clusters were over-represented amongst its targets, and the cryptic nature of many of these clusters appears to stem from Lsr2-mediated repression. Manipulating Lsr2 activity in model species and uncharacterized isolates resulted in the production of new metabolites not seen in wild type strains. Our results suggest that the transcriptional silencing of biosynthetic clusters by Lsr2 may protect &lt;i&gt;Streptomyces&lt;/i&gt; from the inappropriate expression of specialized metabolites, and provide global control over &lt;i&gt;Streptomyces’&lt;/i&gt; arsenal of signaling and antagonistic compounds.</content:encoded>

Here, we report the results. Using three independent primary spheroidal colon cancer cultures that expressed a Wnt reporter construct we observed high Wnt activity was associated with the cell surface markers CD133, CD166, and CD29, but not CD24 and CD44, while the original study found all five markers were correlated with high Wnt activity (Figure 2F; Vermeulen et al., 2010). Clonogenicity was highest in cells with high Wnt activity and clonogenic potential of cells with low Wnt activity were increased by myofibroblast-secreted factors, including HGF. While the effects were in the same direction as the original study (Figure 6D; Vermeulen et al., 2010) whether statistical significance was reached among the different conditions varied. When tested &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;, we did not find a difference in tumorigenicity between high and low Wnt activity, while the original study found cells with high Wnt activity were more effective in inducing tumors (Figure 7E; Vermeulen et al., 2010). Tumorigenicity, however, was increased with myofibroblast-secreted factors, which was in the same direction as the original study (Figure 7E; Vermeulen et al., 2010), but not statistically significant.

	<content:encoded>We investigated afferent inputs from all areas in the frontal cortex (FC) to different subregions in the rostral anterior cingulate cortex (rACC). Using retrograde tracing in macaque monkeys, we quantified projection strength by counting retrogradely labeled cells in each FC area. The projection from different FC regions varied across injection sites in strength, following different spatial patterns. Importantly, a site at the rostral end of the cingulate sulcus stood out as having strong inputs from many areas in diverse FC regions. Moreover, it was at the integrative conjunction of three projection trends across sites. This site marks a connectional hub inside the rACC that integrates FC inputs across functional modalities. Tractography with monkey diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) located a similar hub region comparable to the tracing result. Applying the same tractography method to human dMRI data, we demonstrated that a similar hub can be located in the human rACC.</content:encoded>

While neuroimaging studies have revealed neuroanatomical sites of audiovisual interactions, little is known about the time course by which sounds facilitate visual object processing. Here we used magnetoencephalography to reveal the time course of the facilitatory influence of natural sounds (e.g., barking) on visual object processing and compared this to the facilitatory influence of spoken words (e.g., “dog”). Participants viewed images of blurred objects preceded by a task-irrelevant natural sound, a spoken word, or uninformative noise. A classifier was trained to discriminate multivariate sensor patterns evoked by animate and inanimate intact objects with no sounds, presented in a separate experiment, and tested on sensor patterns evoked by the blurred objects in the 3 auditory conditions. Results revealed that both sounds and words, relative to uninformative noise, significantly facilitated visual object category decoding between 300–500 ms after visual onset. We found no evidence for earlier facilitation by sounds than by words. These findings provide evidence for a semantic route of facilitation by both natural sounds and spoken words, whereby the auditory input first activates semantic object representations, which then modulate the visual processing of objects.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Turner syndrome (TS) is a genetic disorder affecting approximately 1:2000 live-born females. It results from partial or complete X monosomy and is associated with a range of clinical issues including a unique cognitive profile and increased risk for certain behavioral problems. Structural neuroimaging studies in adolescents, adults, and older children with TS have revealed altered neuroanatomy but are unable to identify when in development differences arise. In addition, older children and adults have often been exposed to years of growth hormone and/or exogenous estrogen therapy with potential implications for neurodevelopment. The study presented here is the first to test whether brain structure is altered in infants with TS. Twenty-six infants with TS received high-resolution structural MRI scans of the brain at 1 year of age and were compared to 47 typically developing female and 39 typically developing male infants. Results indicate that the typical neuroanatomical profile seen in older individuals with TS, characterized by decreased gray matter volumes in premotor, somatosensory, and parietal-occipital cortex, is already present at 1 year of age, suggesting a stable phenotype with origins in the prenatal or early postnatal period.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Olfactory perceptual learning is defined as an improvement in the discrimination of perceptually close odorants after passive exposure to these odorants. In mice, simple olfactory perceptual learning involving the discrimination of two odorants depends on an increased number of adult-born neurons in the olfactory bulb, which refines the bulbar output. However, the olfactory environment is complex, raising the question of the adjustment of the bulbar network to multiple discrimination challenges. Perceptual learning of 1 to 6 pairs of similar odorants led to discrimination of all learned odor pairs. Increasing complexity did not increase adult-born neuron survival but enhanced the number of adult-born neurons responding to learned odorants and their spine density. Moreover, only complex learning induced morphological changes in neurons of the granule cell layer born during the first day of life (P0). Selective optogenetic inactivation of either population confirmed functional involvement of adult-born neurons regardless of the enrichment complexity, while preexisting neurons were required for complex discrimination only.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

However, little is known about the underlying temporal dynamics and specifically when exercise-induced vascular adaptations first occur, which is vital for therapeutic applications. In this study, we investigated whether a single session of moderate-intensity exercise was sufficient to induce changes in the cerebral vasculature. We employed arterial spin labeling magnetic resonance imaging to measure global and regional cerebral blood flow (CBF) before and after 20 min of cycling. The blood vessels’ ability to dilate, measured by cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR) to CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; inhalation, was measured at baseline and 25-min postexercise. Our data showed that CBF was selectively increased by 10–12% in the hippocampus 15, 40, and 60 min after exercise cessation, whereas CVR to CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; was unchanged in all regions. The absence of a corresponding change in hippocampal CVR suggests that the immediate and transient hippocampal adaptations observed after exercise are not driven by a mechanical vascular change and more likely represents an adaptive metabolic change, providing a framework for exploring the therapeutic potential of exercise-induced plasticity (neural, vascular, or both) in clinical and aged populations.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Neurodevelopmental abnormalities are the most common noncardiac complications in patients with congenital heart disease (CHD). Prenatal brain abnormalities may be due to reduced oxygenation, genetic factors, or less commonly, teratogens. Understanding the contribution of these factors is essential to improve outcomes. Because primary sulcal patterns are prenatally determined and under strong genetic control, we hypothesized that they are influenced by genetic variants in CHD. In this study, we reveal significant alterations in sulcal patterns among subjects with single ventricle CHD (&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;n&lt;/span&gt; = 115, 14.7 ± 2.9 years [mean ± standard deviation]) compared with controls (&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;n&lt;/span&gt; = 45, 15.5 ± 2.4 years) using a graph-based pattern-analysis technique. Among patients with CHD, the left hemisphere demonstrated decreased sulcal pattern similarity to controls in the left temporal and parietal lobes, as well as the bilateral frontal lobes. Temporal and parietal lobes demonstrated an abnormally asymmetric left–right pattern of sulcal basin area in CHD subjects. Sulcal pattern similarity to control was positively correlated with working memory, processing speed, and executive function. Exome analysis identified damaging de novo variants only in CHD subjects with more atypical sulcal patterns. Together, these findings suggest that sulcal pattern analysis may be useful in characterizing genetically influenced, atypical early brain development and neurodevelopmental risk in subjects with CHD.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;The analysis of neural circuits can provide crucial insights into the mechanisms of neurodegeneration and dementias, and offer potential quantitative biological tools to assess novel therapeutics. Here we use behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD) as a model disease. We demonstrate that inversion of canonical microcircuit models to noninvasive human magnetoencephalography, using dynamic causal modeling, can identify the regional- and laminar-specificity of bvFTD pathophysiology, and their parameters can accurately differentiate patients from matched healthy controls. Using such models, we show that changes in local coupling in frontotemporal dementia underlie the failure to adequately establish sensory predictions, leading to altered prediction error responses in a cortical information-processing hierarchy. Using machine learning, this model-based approach provided greater case–control classification accuracy than conventional evoked cortical responses. We suggest that this approach provides an in vivo platform for testing mechanistic hypotheses about disease progression and pharmacotherapeutics.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

The breadth of ASD symptoms is paralleled by the multiplicity of genes that have been implicated in its etiology. Initial findings revealed numerous ASD risk genes that contribute to synaptic function. More recently, genomic and gene expression studies point to altered chromatin function and impaired transcriptional control as additional risk factors for ASD. The consequences of impaired transcriptional alterations in ASD involve consistent changes in synaptic gene expression and cortical neuron specification during brain development. The multiplicity of genetic and environmental factors associated with ASD risk and their convergence onto common molecular pathways in neurons point to ASD as a disorder of gene regulatory networks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded>

In order to further our understanding of how gene expression contributes to key functional properties of neurons, we combined publicly accessible gene expression, electrophysiology, and morphology measurements to identify cross-cell type correlations between these data modalities. Building on our previous work using a similar approach, we distinguished between correlations which were “class-driven,” meaning those that could be explained by differences between excitatory and inhibitory cell classes, and those that reflected graded phenotypic differences within classes. Taking cell class identity into account increased the degree to which our results replicated in an independent dataset as well as their correspondence with known modes of ion channel function based on the literature. We also found a smaller set of genes whose relationships to electrophysiological or morphological properties appear to be specific to either excitatory or inhibitory cell types. Next, using data from PatchSeq experiments, allowing simultaneous single-cell characterization of gene expression and electrophysiology, we found that some of the gene-property correlations observed across cell types were further predictive of within-cell type heterogeneity. In summary, we have identified a number of relationships between gene expression, electrophysiology, and morphology that provide testable hypotheses for future studies.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/VJEbrzdYvvo&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Computational modeling plays an important role in modern neuroscience research. Much previous research has relied on statistical methods, separately, to address two problems that are actually interdependent. First, given a particular computational model, Bayesian hierarchical techniques have been used to estimate individual variation in parameters over a population of subjects, leveraging their population-level distributions. Second, candidate models are themselves compared, and individual variation in the expressed model estimated, according to the fits of the models to each subject. The interdependence between these two problems arises because the relevant population for estimating parameters of a model depends on which other subjects express the model. Here, we propose a hierarchical Bayesian inference (HBI) framework for concurrent model comparison, parameter estimation and inference at the population level, combining previous approaches. We show that this framework has important advantages for both parameter estimation and model comparison theoretically and experimentally. The parameters estimated by the HBI show smaller errors compared to other methods. Model comparison by HBI is robust against outliers and is not biased towards overly simplistic models. Furthermore, the fully Bayesian approach of our theory enables researchers to make inference on group-level parameters by performing HBI t-test.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/F0fnhkHvtD8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Slow NMDA-Mediated Excitation Accelerates Offset-Response Latencies Generated via a Post-Inhibitory Rebound Mechanism</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/6/3/ENEURO.0106-19.2019?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;In neural circuits, action potentials (spikes) are conventionally caused by excitatory inputs whereas inhibitory inputs reduce or modulate neuronal excitability. We previously showed that neurons in the superior paraolivary nucleus (SPN) require solely synaptic inhibition to generate their hallmark offset response, a burst of spikes at the end of a sound stimulus, via a post-inhibitory rebound mechanism. In addition SPN neurons receive excitatory inputs, but their functional significance is not yet known. Here we used mice of both sexes to demonstrate that in SPN neurons, the classical roles for excitation and inhibition are switched, with inhibitory inputs driving spike firing and excitatory inputs modulating this response. Hodgkin–Huxley modeling suggests that a slow, NMDA receptor (NMDAR)-mediated excitation would accelerate the offset response. We find corroborating evidence from &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; recordings that lack of excitation prolonged offset-response latencies and rendered them more variable to changing sound intensity levels. Our results reveal an unsuspected function for slow excitation in improving the timing of post-inhibitory rebound firing even when the firing itself does not depend on excitation. This shows the auditory system employs highly specialized mechanisms to encode timing-sensitive features of sound offsets which are crucial for sound-duration encoding and have profound biological importance for encoding the temporal structure of speech.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;The central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA) is a brain region implicated in anxiety, stress-related disorders and the reinforcing effects of drugs of abuse. Corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF, &lt;i&gt;Crh)&lt;/i&gt; acting at cognate type 1 receptors (CRF&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Crhr1&lt;/i&gt;) modulates inhibitory and excitatory synaptic transmission in the CeA. Here, we used CRF&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;:GFP reporter mice to characterize the morphological, neurochemical and electrophysiological properties of CRF&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-expressing (CRF&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;+) and CRF&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-non-expressing (CRF&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;–) neurons in the CeA. We assessed these two neuronal populations for distinctions in the expression of GABAergic subpopulation markers and neuropeptides, dendritic spine density and morphology, and excitatory transmission. We observed that CeA CRF&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;+ neurons are GABAergic but do not segregate with calbindin (CB), calretinin (CR), parvalbumin (PV), or protein kinase C- (PKC). Among the neuropeptides analyzed, &lt;i&gt;Penk&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Sst&lt;/i&gt; had the highest percentage of co-expression with &lt;i&gt;Crhr1&lt;/i&gt; in both the medial and lateral CeA subdivisions. Additionally, CeA CRF&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;+ neurons had a lower density of dendritic spines, which was offset by a higher proportion of mature spines compared to neighboring CRF&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;– neurons. Accordingly, there was no difference in basal spontaneous glutamatergic transmission between the two populations. Application of CRF increased overall vesicular glutamate release onto both CRF&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;+ and CRF&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;– neurons and does not affect amplitude or kinetics of EPSCs in either population. These novel data highlight important differences in the neurochemical make-up and morphology of CRF&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;+ compared to CRF&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;– neurons, which may have important implications for the transduction of CRF signaling in the CeA.  &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The mammalian olfactory system learns new odors rapidly, exhibits negligible
interference among odor memories, and identifies known odors under challenging
conditions. The mechanisms by which it does so are unknown. We here present a
general theory for odor learning and identification under noise in the
olfactory system, and demonstrate its efficacy using a neuromorphic model of
the olfactory bulb. As with biological olfaction, the spike timing-based
algorithm utilizes distributed, event-driven computations and rapid online
learning. Localized spike timing-dependent plasticity rules are employed
iteratively over sequential gamma-frequency packets to construct odor
representations from the activity of chemosensor arrays mounted in a wind
tunnel. Learned odors then are reliably identified despite strong destructive
interference. Noise resistance is enhanced by neuromodulation and contextual
priming. Lifelong learning capabilities are enabled by adult neurogenesis. The
algorithm is applicable to any signal identification problem in which
high-dimensional signals are embedded in unknown backgrounds.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1906.06778</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In our recent article (Tu et al., Warnings and caveats in brain
controllability, &lt;a href=&quot;http://export.arxiv.org/abs/1705.08261&quot;&gt;arXiv:1705.08261&lt;/a&gt;) we provided quantitative evidence to show
that there are warnings and caveats in the way Gu and collaborators (Gu et al.
Controllability of structural brain networks. Nature communications 6 (2015):
8414) define brain controllability. The comment by Pasqualetti et al.
(Pasqualetti et al. RE: Warnings and Caveats in Brain Controllability.
NeuroImage 297 (2019), 586-588) confirms the need to go beyond the methodology
and approach presented in Gu et al. original work. In fact, they recognize that
the source of confusion is due to the fact that assessing controllability via
numerical analysis typically leads to ill-conditioned problems, and thus often
generates results that are difficult to interpret. This is indeed the first
warning we discussed: our work was not meant to prove that brain networks are
not controllable from one node, rather we wished to highlight that the one node
controllability framework and all consequent results were not properly
justified based on the methodology presented in Gu et al. We used in our work
the same method of Gu et al. not because we believe it is the best methodology,
but because we extensively investigated it with the aim of replicating, testing
and extending their results. And the warning and caveats we have proposed are
the results of this investigation.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The impact of in-scanner motion on functional magnetic resonance imaging
(fMRI) data has a notorious reputation in the neuroimaging community.
State-ofthe-art guidelines advise to scrub out excessively corrupted frames as
assessed by a composite framewise displacement (FD) score, to regress out
models of nuisance variables, and to include average FD as a covariate in
group-level analyses.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, we studied individual motion time courses at time points typically
retained in fMRI analyses. We observed that even in this set of putatively
clean time points, motion exhibited a very clear spatiotemporal structure, so
that we could distinguish subjects into four groups of movers with varying
characteristics
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, we showed that this spatiotemporal motion cartography tightly relates
to a broad array of anthropometric, behavioral and clinical factors. Convergent
results were obtained from two different analytical perspectives: univariate
assessment of behavioral differences across mover subgroups unraveled defining
markers, while subsequent multivariate analysis broadened the range of involved
factors and clarified that multiple motion/behavior modes of covariance overlap
in the data.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our results demonstrate that even the smaller episodes of motion typically
retained in fMRI analyses carry structured, behaviorally relevant information.
They call for further examinations of possible biases in current
regression-based motion correction strategies.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Blocking facial mimicry selectively alters early stages of facial expression processing. (arXiv:1906.06424v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1906.06424</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Simulation models of facial expressions suggest that posterior visual areas
and brain areas underpinning sensorimotor simulations might interact to improve
facial expression processing. According to these models, facial mimicry may
contribute to the visual perceptual processing of facial expressions by
influencing early stages of face processing, thus playing a crucial role in
understanding the observed emotion. The aim of the present study was to assess
whether and how early sensorimotor simulation influences face structural
encoding/processing. A secondary aim was to investigate whether there is a
relationship between alexithymic traits and sensorimotor simulation as a
mechanism for fine facial expression discrimination. In order to examine the
time-course of face processing, we monitored P1 and N170 components of the
event-related potentials (ERP) in participants performing a fine discrimination
task of facial expressions. An animal discrimination task was implemented as a
control condition. In half of the experiment, participants could freely use
their facial mimicry whereas, in the other half, they had their facial mimicry
blocked by a gel. Our results revealed that the P1 ERP component was not
modulated by the mimicry manipulation while the N170 amplitude was larger in
the blocked mimicry condition when compared to the free mimicry condition
selectively for the face stimuli. Interestingly, this modulation interacted
with the alexithymic traits, with a reduction of the N170 amplitude modulation
as a function of the facial mimicry manipulation for participants with the
highest levels of alexithymic traits. These results demonstrate that
sensorimotor simulation influences visual processing of facial expressions at
early stages and that participants with higher alexithymic traits tend to
underutilize the sensorimotor simulation system.

Here we generated and characterized a Shank3 knock-in mouse line carrying the Q321R mutation (Shank3Q321R mice) identified in a human individual with ASD that affects the ankyrin repeat region (ARR) domain of the Shank3 protein. Homozygous Shank3Q321R/Q321R mice show a selective decrease in the level of Shank3a, an ARR-containing protein variant, but not other variants. CA1 pyramidal neurons in the Shank3Q321R/Q321R hippocampus show decreased neuronal excitability but normal excitatory and inhibitory synaptic transmission. Behaviorally, Shank3Q321R/Q321R mice show moderately enhanced self-grooming and anxiolytic-like behavior, but normal locomotion, social interaction, and object recognition and contextual fear memory. In addition, these mice show abnormal electroencephalogram (EEG) patterns and decreased susceptibility to induced seizures. These results indicate that the Q321R mutation alters Shank3 protein stability, neuronal excitability, repetitive and anxiety-like behavior, EEG patterns, and seizure susceptibility in mice.</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Neurogenesis section | New and Recent Articles: A Critical Period for the Development of Schizophrenia-Like Pathology by Aberrant Postnatal Neurogenesis</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00635</link>
	<content:encoded>Schizophrenia is a complex and serious mental disorder, and patients with schizophrenia are characterized by psychological hallucinations, deregulated emotionality, and cognitive impairment. Evidence indicated that postnatal neurogenesis in the hippocampus is profoundly impaired in schizophrenic individuals but the role of such dysregulated neurodevelopmental processing in the pathophysiological progress of schizophrenia has not been well investigated. Here in this study, by using the rodent model of schizophrenia through maternal immune activation of poly (I:C) injection, we aimed to examine whether the postnatal neurogenesis might be involved in the development of schizophrenia-like pathology. Through the comprehensive behavioral analyses of multiple core symptoms of schizophrenia at different developmental stages (six-, nine-, and twelve-weeks after birth) of the affected offspring, we found a delayed onset of schizophrenia-like behaviors in poly (I:C) animals through the development. Meanwhile, there is an age-dependent alteration of postnatal neurogenesis in the poly (I:C) animals along different development stages by which the aberrant dendritic elaboration functionally correlated with the schizophrenia-like symptoms in nine-week old of age for the animals. Interestingly, increase in the neurogenesis during a critical period of neurodevelopment exacerbates the schizophrenia-like pathology. Conversely, temporal suppression of aberrant postnatal neurogenesis during the same period of neurodevelopment ameliorates the occurrence of schizophrenia-like symptoms. Together, these findings strongly suggested the aberrant dendritic growth of postnatal neurogenesis during the critical time window of development is essential for controlling the pathophysiological progression of schizophrenia-like symptoms. And pharmacological treatments that adjust these abnormalities may provide potential therapeutic benefits toward patients with schizophrenia in clinic.</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Neurodegeneration section | New and Recent Articles: Altered Insulin Signaling in Alzheimer’s Disease Brain – Special Emphasis on PI3K-Akt Pathway</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00629</link>
	<content:encoded>Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and type 2 diabetes (T2D) are both diseases with increasing prevalence in aging populations. T2D, characterized by insulin resistance and defective insulin signaling, is a common co-morbidity and a risk factor for AD, increasing the risk approximately two- to four-fold. Insulin exerts a wide variety of effects as a growth factor as well as by regulating glucose, fatty acid and protein metabolism. Certain lifestyle factors, physical inactivity and typical Western diet (TWD) containing high fat and high sugar are strongly associated with insulin resistance and T2D. The PI3K-Akt signaling pathway is a major mediator of effects of insulin and plays a crucial role in T2D pathogenesis. Decreased levels of phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase (PI3K) subunits as well as blunted Akt kinase phosphorylation have been observed in the AD brain, characterized by amyloid-β and tau pathologies. Furthermore, AD mouse models fed with TWD have shown to display altered levels of PI3K subunits. How impaired insulin-PI3K-Akt signaling in peripheral tissues or in the central nervous system (CNS) affects the development or progression of AD is currently poorly understood. Interestingly, enhancement of PI3K-Akt signaling in the CNS by intranasal insulin (IN) treatment has been shown to improve memory in vivo in mice and in human trials. Insulin is known to augment neuronal growth and synapse formation through the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway. However, PI3K-Akt pathway mediates signaling related to different functions also in other cell types, like microglia and astrocytes. In this review, we will discuss the most prominent molecular mechanisms related to the PI3K-Akt pathway in AD and how T2D and altered insulin signaling may affect the pathogenesis of AD.</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Brain Imaging Methods section | New and Recent Articles: Objective and Automated Detection of Diffuse White Matter Abnormality in Preterm Infants Using Deep Convolutional Neural Networks</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00610</link>
	<content:encoded>Diffuse white matter abnormality (DWMA), or diffuse excessive high signal intensity is observed in 50-80% of very preterm infants at term-equivalent age. It is subjectively defined as higher than normal signal intensity in periventricular and subcortical white matter in comparison to normal unmyelinated white matter on T2-weighted MRI images. Despite the well-documented presence of DWMA, it remains debatable whether DWMA represents pathological tissue injury or a transient developmental phenomenon. Manual tracing of DWMA exhibits poor reliability and reproducibility and unduly increases image processing time. Thus, objective and ideally automatic assessment is critical to accurately elucidate the biologic nature of DWMA. We propose a deep learning approach to automatically identify DWMA regions on T2-weighted MRI images. Specifically, we formulated DWMA detection as an image voxel classification task; that is, the voxels on T2-weighted images are treated as samples and exclusively assigned as DWMA or normal white matter voxel classes. To utilize the spatial information of individual voxels, small image patches centered on the given voxels are retrieved. A deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) model was developed to differentiate DWMA and normal voxels. We tested our deep CNN in multiple validation experiments. First, we examined DWMA detection accuracy of our CNN model using computer simulations. This was followed by in vivo assessments in a cohort of very preterm infants (N=95) using cross-validation and holdout validation. Finally, we tested our approach on an independent preterm cohort (N=28) to externally validate our model. Our deep CNN model achieved Dice similarity index values ranging from 0.85 to 0.99 for DWMA detection in the aforementioned validation experiments. Our proposed deep CNN model exhibited significantly better performance than other popular machine learning models. We present an objective and automated approach for accurately identifying DWMA that may facilitate the clinical diagnosis of DWMA in very preterm infants.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00588</link>
	<content:encoded>The endogenous potential of adult neurogenesis is of particular interest for the development of new strategies for recovery after stroke and traumatic brain injury. These pathological conditions affect endogenous neurogenesis in two aspects. On the one hand, injury usually initiates the migration of neuronal precursors (NPCs) to the lesion area from the already existing, in physiological conditions, neurogenic niche – the ventricular-subventricular zone (V-SVZ) near the lateral ventricles. On the other hand, recent studies have convincingly demonstrated the local generation of new neurons near lesion areas in different brain locations. The striatum, cortex, and hippocampal CA1 region are considered to be locations of such new neurogenic zones in the damaged brain. This review focuses on the relative contribution of two types of NPCs of different origin, resident population in new neurogenic zones and cells migrating from the lateral ventricles, to post-stroke or post-traumatic enhancement of neurogenesis. The migratory pathways of NPCs have also been considered. In addition, the review highlights the advantages and limitations of different methodological approaches to the definition of NPC location and tracking of new neurons. In general, we suggest that despite the considerable number of studies, we still lack a comprehensive understanding of neurogenesis in the damaged brain. We believe that the advancement of methods for in vivo visualization and longitudinal observation of neurogenesis in the brain could fundamentally change the current situation in this field.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00552</link>
	<content:encoded>Formation and aggregation of misfolded proteins in the central nervous system (CNS) is a key hallmark of several age-related neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinson’s disease (PD), Alzheimer’s disease (AD), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). These diseases share key biophysical and biochemical characteristics with prion diseases. It is believed that PD is characterized by abnormal protein aggregation, mainly that of α-synuclein (α-syn). Of particular importance, there is growing evidence indicating that abnormal α-syn can spread to neighboring brain regions and cause aggregation of endogenous α-syn in these regions as seeds, in a “prion-like” manner. Abundant studies in vitro and in vivo have shown that α-syn goes through a templated conformational change, propagates from the original region to neighboring regions, and eventually cause neuron degeneration in the substantia nigra and striatum. The objective of this review is to summarize the mechanisms involved in the aggregation of abnormal intracellular α-syn and its subsequent cell-to-cell transmission. According to these findings, we look forward to effective therapeutic perspectives that can block the progression of neurodegenerative diseases.</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Interpreting Prefrontal Recruitment During Walking After Stroke: Influence of Individual Differences in Mobility and Cognitive Function</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2019.00194</link>
	<content:encoded>Background: Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) is a valuable neuroimaging approach for studying cortical contributions to walking function. Recruitment of prefrontal cortex during walking has been a particular area of focus in the literature. The present study investigated whether task-related change in prefrontal recruitment measured by fNIRS is affected by individual differences in people post-stroke. The primary hypotheses were that poor mobility function would contribute to prefrontal over-recruitment during typical walking, and that poor cognitive function would contribute to a ceiling in prefrontal recruitment during dual-task walking (i.e., walking with a cognitive task).

Methods: Thirty-three adults with chronic post-stroke hemiparesis performed three tasks: typical walking at preferred speed (Walk), serial-7 subtraction (Serial7), and walking combined with serial-7 subtraction (Dual-Task). Prefrontal recruitment was measured with fNIRS and quantified as the change in oxygenated hemoglobin concentration (ΔO2Hb) between resting and active periods for each task. Spatiotemporal gait parameters were measured on an electronic walkway. Stepwise regression was used to assess how prefrontal recruitment was affected by individual differences including age, sex, stroke region, injured hemisphere, stroke chronicity, 10 meter walking speed, balance confidence measured by Activities-specific Balance Confidence (ABC) Scale, sensorimotor impairment measured by Fugl-Meyer Assessment, and cognitive function measured by Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE).

Results: For Walk, poor balance confidence (ABC Scale score) significantly predicted greater prefrontal recruitment (ΔO2Hb; R2 = 0.25, p = 0.003). For Dual-Task poor cognitive function (MMSE score) significantly predicted lower prefrontal recruitment (ΔO2Hb; R2 = 0.25, p = 0.002).  

Conclusions: Poor mobility function predicted higher prefrontal recruitment during typical walking, consistent with compensatory over-recruitment. Poor cognitive function predicted lower prefrontal recruitment during dual-task walking, consistent with a recruitment ceiling effect. These findings indicate that interpretation of prefrontal recruitment should carefully consider the characteristics of the person and demands of the task.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncir.2019.00042</link>
	<content:encoded>Leukoaraiosis (LA) is considered to be associated with cognitive impairment in the older people. This alteration can be reflected in functional connectivity (FC) based on resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI). In this study, we used the triple brain network model to investigate altered changes in FC for LA with different cognitive impairment loads determined by the Mini Mental State Exam (MMSE) and Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR). Eighty-three subjects were divided into four groups based on their clinical diagnosis: the LA-normal cognition group (LA-NC) (n=14, 6 males), LA with mild cognitive impairment (LA-MCI) group (n=27, 13 males), LA with vascular dementia (LA-VD) group (n=12, 6 males) and matched healthy controls (HC) (n=30, 11 males). The triple brain network model includes the default-mode network (DMN), salience networks (SN) and the central executive network (CEN), which were extracted with independent components analysis (ICA) and region of interest (ROI)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    based analysis using the REST toolbox. LA group presented decreased FC for all these three brain networks, compared with matched healthy controls. For inter-brain network analysis, there were decreased negative FC between the SN and DMN in LA group. While there were enhanced inter-brain network FC between the SN and CEN as well as within the SN. The decrease of FC between SN and DMN may reflect the damage mechanism of cognitive impairment of LA, which can compensate with the enhanced inter-brain network between SN and CEN and intra-brain network FC within the SN.</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Secretion of Mast Cell Inflammatory Mediators Is Enhanced by CADM1-Dependent Adhesion to Sensory Neurons</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2019.00262</link>
	<content:encoded>Neuroimmune interactions are important in the pathophysiology of many chronic inflammatory diseases, particularly those associated with alterations in sensory processing and pain. Mast cells and sensory neuron nerve endings are found in areas of the body exposed to the external environment; both are specialized to sense potential damage by injury or pathogens and signal to the immune system and nervous system respectively, to elicit protective responses. Cell adhesion molecule 1 (CADM1), also known as SynCAM1, has previously been identified as an adhesion molecule which may couple mast cells to sensory neurons however, whether this molecule exerts a functional as well as structural role in neuroimmune cross-talk is unknown. Here we show, using a newly developed in vitro co-culture system consisting of murine bone marrow derived mast cells (BMMC) and adult sensory neurons isolated from dorsal root ganglions (DRG), that CADM1 is expressed in mast cells and adult sensory neurons and mediates strong adhesion between the two cell types. Non-neuronal cells in the DRG cultures did not express CADM1, and mast cells did not adhere to them. The interaction of BMMCs with sensory neurons was found to induce mast cell degranulation and IL-6 secretion and to enhance responses to antigen stimulation and activation of FcRI receptors. Secretion of TNF in contrast was not affected, nor was secretion evoked by compound 48/80. Co-cultures of BMMCs with HEK 293 cells, which also express CADM1, while also leading to adhesion did not replicate the effects of sensory neurons on mast cells, indicative of a neuron-specific interaction. Application of a CADM1 blocking peptide or knockdown of CADM1 in BMMCs significantly decreased BMMC attachment to sensory neurites and abolished the enhanced secretory responses of mast cells. In conclusion, CADM1 is necessary and sufficient to drive mast cell-sensory neuron adhesion and promote the development of a microenvironment in which neurons enhance mast cell responsiveness to antigen; this interaction could explain why the incidence of painful neuroinflammatory disorders such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) are increased in atopic patients.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2019.00147</link>
	<content:encoded>Background: Studying structural brain aging is important to understand age-related pathologies, as well as to identify the early manifestations of the Alzheimer’s disease (AD) continuum. In this study, we investigated the long-term trajectory of physiological and pathological brain aging in a large number of participants ranging from the 50s to over 80 years of age. 
Objective: To explore the distinct brain regions that distinguish pathological brain aging from physiological brain aging using sophisticated measurements of cortical thickness.
Methods: A total of 2,823 cognitively normal (CN) individuals and 2,675 patients with AD continuum (874 with subjective memory impairments [SMI], 954 with amnestic mild cognitive impairments [aMCI], and 847 with AD dementia) who underwent a high-resolution 3.0-tesla MRI were included in this study. To investigate pathological brain aging, we further classified patients with aMCI and AD according to the severity of cognitive impairment. Cortical thickness was measured using a surface-based method. Multiple linear regression analyses were performed to evaluate age, diagnostic groups, and cortical thickness.
Results: Aging extensively affected cortical thickness not only in CN individuals but also in AD continuum patients; however, the precuneus and inferior temporal regions were relatively preserved against age-related cortical thinning. Compared to CN individuals, AD continuum patients including those with SMI showed a decreased cortical thickness in the perisylvian region. However, widespread cortical thinning including the precuneus and inferior temporal regions were found from the late-stage aMCI to the moderate to severe AD. Unlike the other age groups, AD continuum patients aged over 80 years showed prominent cortical thinning in the medial temporal region with relative sparing of the precuneus.
Conclusion: Our findings suggested that the precuneus and inferior temporal regions are the key regions in distinguishing between physiological and pathological brain aging. Attempts to differentiate age-related pathology from physiological brain aging at a very early stage would be important in terms of establishing new strategies for preventing accelerated pathological brain aging.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2019.00144</link>
	<content:encoded>Healthy aging limits the activities of daily living and personal independence. Furthermore, cognitive-motor interference in dual-task (e.g., walking while talking) appears to be more pronounced in the elderly. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), a form of the non-invasive brain stimulation technique, is known to modify cortical excitability and has been investigated as a tool for enhancing learning in health and disease. The present study examined the effects of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), applied while dual-tasking (on-line), improves performance in healthy older humans. Anodal, cathodal, bilateral or sham tDCS targeting left DLPFC was applied while performing the grooved pegboard test (GPT) and serial seven subtraction test (SSST) alone or together (dual-tasking). The number of pegs and the number of correct subtractions were recorded before, during and 30 minutes after tDCS. The dual-task performance was measured as the percent change from single to the dual-task condition (dual-task cost DTC). Only bilateral, anode left tDCS, induced a significant increase in subtracted numbers while dual-tasking, i.e., it reduced the DTC of manual dexterity (GPT) to a cognitive task. Significant changes 30 minutes after the stimulation were only present after bilateral anode right tDCS on GPT dual-task costs. These findings suggest that anodal tDCS applied online interacts with a dual-task performance involving demanding cognitive and manual dexterity tasks. The results support the potential use of non-invasive brain stimulation for improvement of cognitive functioning in daily activities in older individuals.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Identifying appropriate animal models is critical in developing translatable in vitro and in vivo systems for therapeutic drug development and investigating disease pathophysiology. These animal models should have direct biological and translational relevance to the underlying disease they are supposed to mimic. Aging dogs not only naturally develop a cognitive decline in many aspects including learning and memory deficits, but they also exhibit human-like individual variability in the aging process. Neurodegenerative processes that can be observed in both human and canine brains include the progressive accumulation of β-amyloid (Aβ) found as diffuse plaques in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), including the gyrus proreus (i.e., medial orbital PFC), as well as the hippocampus and the cerebral vasculature. Tau pathology, a marker of neurodegeneration and dementia progression, was also found in canine hippocampal synapses. Various epidemiological data show that human patients with neurodegenerative diseases have concurrent intestinal lesions, and histopathological changes in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract occurs decades before neurodegenerative changes. Gut microbiome alterations have also been reported in many neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases, as well as inflammatory central nervous system (CNS) diseases. Interestingly, the dog gut microbiome more closely resembles human gut microbiome in composition and functional overlap compared to rodent models. This article reviews the physiology of the gut-brain axis (GBA), and its involvement with neurodegenerative diseases in humans. Additionally, we outline the advantages and weaknesses of current in vitro and in vivo models and discuss future research directions investigating major human neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases using dogs.</content:encoded>

Features that differ markedly from those of prototypical T4SSs include an expanded OMCC and unexpected symmetry mismatch between the OMCC and PRC. This structure is one of the largest bacterial secretion system complexes ever reported and illustrates the remarkable structural diversity that exists among bacterial T4SSs.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Many pathogens possess the capacity for sex through outcrossing, despite being able to reproduce also asexually and/or via selfing. Given that sex is assumed to come at a cost, these mixed reproductive strategies typical of pathogens have remained puzzling. While the ecological and evolutionary benefits of outcrossing are theoretically well-supported, support for such benefits in pathogen populations are still scarce. Here, we analyze the epidemiology and genetic structure of natural populations of an obligate fungal pathogen, &lt;i&gt;Podosphaera plantaginis&lt;/i&gt;. We find that the opportunities for outcrossing vary spatially. Populations supporting high levels of coinfection -a prerequisite of sex - result in hotspots of novel genetic diversity. Pathogen populations supporting coinfection also have a higher probability of surviving winter. Jointly our results show that outcrossing has direct epidemiological consequences as well as a major impact on pathogen population genetic diversity, thereby providing evidence of ecological and evolutionary benefits of outcrossing in pathogens.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: latest articles: Cretaceous dinosaur bone contains recent organic material and provides an environment conducive to microbial communities</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/46205</link>
	<content:encoded>Fossils were thought to lack original organic molecules, but chemical analyses show that some can survive. Dinosaur bone has been proposed to preserve collagen, osteocytes, and blood vessels. However, proteins and labile lipids are diagenetically unstable, and bone is a porous open system, allowing microbial/molecular flux. These ‘soft tissues’ have been reinterpreted as biofilms. Organic preservation versus contamination of dinosaur bone was examined by freshly excavating, with aseptic protocols, fossils and sedimentary matrix, and chemically/biologically analyzing them. Fossil ‘soft tissues’ differed from collagen chemically and structurally; while degradation would be expected, the patterns observed did not support this. 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing revealed that dinosaur bone hosted an abundant microbial community different from lesser abundant communities of surrounding sediment. Subsurface dinosaur bone is a relatively fertile habitat, attracting microbes that likely utilize inorganic nutrients and complicate identification of original organic material. There exists potential post-burial taphonomic roles for subsurface microorganisms.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/46179</link>
	<content:encoded>In humans, a first-degree family history of dementia (FH) is a well-documented risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD); however, the influence of FH on cognition across the lifespan is poorly understood. To address this issue, we developed an internet-based paired-associates learning (PAL) task and tested 59,571 participants between the ages of 18-85. FH was associated with lower PAL performance in both sexes under 65 years old. Modifiers of this effect of FH on PAL performance included age, sex, education, and diabetes. The Apolipoprotein E ε4 allele was also associated with lower PAL scores in FH positive individuals. Here we show, FH is associated with reduced PAL performance four decades before the typical onset of AD; additionally, several heritable and non-heritable modifiers of this effect were identified.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: latest articles: Cryo-EM structures of remodeler-nucleosome intermediates suggest allosteric control through the nucleosome</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/46057</link>
	<content:encoded>The SNF2h remodeler slides nucleosomes most efficiently as a dimer, yet how the two protomers avoid a tug-of-war is unclear. Furthermore, SNF2h couples histone octamer deformation to nucleosome sliding, but the underlying structural basis remains unknown. Here we present cryo-EM structures of SNF2h-nucleosome complexes with ADP-BeF&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; that capture two reaction intermediates. In one structure, histone residues near the dyad and in the H2A-H2B acidic patch, distal to the active SNF2h protomer, appear disordered. The disordered acidic patch is expected to inhibit the second SNF2h protomer, while disorder near the dyad is expected to promote DNA translocation. The other structure doesn't show octamer deformation, but surprisingly shows a 2bp translocation. FRET studies indicate that ADP-BeF&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; predisposes SNF2h-nucleosome complexes for an elemental translocation step. We propose a model for allosteric control through the nucleosome, where one SNF2h protomer promotes asymmetric octamer deformation to inhibit the second protomer, while stimulating directional DNA translocation.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: latest articles: A FRET sensor of C-terminal movement reveals VRAC activation by plasma membrane DAG signaling rather than ionic strength</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/45421</link>
	<content:encoded>Volume-regulated anion channels (VRACs) are central to cell volume regulation. Recently identified as hetero-hexamers formed by LRRC8 proteins, their activation mechanism remains elusive. Here we measured Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) between fluorescent proteins fused to the C-termini of LRRC8 subunits. Inter-subunit FRET from LRRC8 complexes tracked VRAC activation. With patch-clamp fluorometry, we confirmed that the cytoplasmic domains rearrange during VRAC opening. With these FRET reporters, we determined VRAC activation, non-invasively, in live cells and their subcompartments. Reduced intracellular ionic strength did not directly activate VRACs, and VRACs were not activated on endomembranes. Instead, pharmacological manipulation of diacylglycerol (DAG), and protein kinase D (PKD) activity, activated or inhibited plasma membrane-localized VRACs. Finally, we resolved previous contradictory reports concerning VRAC activation, using FRET to detect robust activation by PMA that was absent during whole-cell patch clamp. Overall, non-invasive VRAC measurement by FRET is an essential tool for unravelling its activation mechanism.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/43828</link>
	<content:encoded>Cephalopod mollusks evolved numerous anatomical novelties, including arms and tentacles, but little is known about the developmental mechanisms underlying cephalopod limb evolution. Here we show that all three axes of cuttlefish limbs are patterned by the same signaling networks that act in vertebrates and arthropods, although they evolved limbs independently. In cuttlefish limb buds, &lt;i&gt;Hedgehog&lt;/i&gt; is expressed anteriorly. Posterior transplantation of &lt;i&gt;Hedgehog&lt;/i&gt;-expressing cells induced mirror-image limb duplications. Bmp and Wnt signals, which establish dorsoventral polarity in vertebrate and arthropod limbs, are similarly polarized in cuttlefish. Inhibition of Bmp2/4 dorsally caused ectopic expression of &lt;i&gt;Notum,&lt;/i&gt; which marks the ventral sucker field, and ectopic sucker development. Cuttlefish also show proximodistal regionalization of &lt;i&gt;Hth&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Exd, Dll&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Dac&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Sp8/9&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;Wnt&lt;/i&gt; expression, which delineates arm and tentacle sucker fields. These results suggest that cephalopod limbs evolved by parallel activation of a genetic program for appendage development that was present in the bilaterian common ancestor.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Addiction is characterized by an erosion of cognitive control toward drug taking that is accentuated by negative emotional states. Here we tested the hypothesis that enhanced interference on cognitive control reflects a loss of segregation between cognition 
and emotion in addiction. We analyzed Human Connectome Project data from 1206 young adults, including 89 with cannabis dependence (CD). Two composite factors, one for cognition and one for emotion, were derived using principal component (PC) analyses. Component scores for these PCs were significantly associated in the CD group, such that negative emotionality correlated with poor cognition. However, the corresponding component scores were uncorrelated in matched controls and nondependent recreational cannabis users (&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;n&lt;/span&gt; = 87). In CD, but not controls or recreational users, functional magnetic resonance imaging activations to emotional stimuli (angry/fearful faces &amp;gt; shapes) correlated with activations to cognitive demand (working memory; 2-back &amp;gt; 0-back). Canonical correlation analyses linked individual differences in cognitive and emotional component scores with brain activations. In CD, there was substantial overlap between cognitive and emotional brain–behavior associations, but in controls, associations were more restricted to the cognitive domain. These findings support our hypothesis of impaired segregation between cognitive and emotional processes in CD that might contribute to poor cognitive control under conditions of increased emotional demand.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

Conversely, externally caused somatosensory input is enhanced, for example, during active touch and the haptic exploration of objects. Here, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to ask how the brain accomplishes this delicate weighting of self-generated versus externally caused somatosensory components. Finger movements were either self-generated by our participants or induced by functional electrical stimulation (FES) of the same muscles. During half of the trials, electrotactile impulses were administered when the (actively or passively) moving finger reached a predefined flexion threshold. fMRI revealed an interaction effect in the contralateral posterior insular cortex (pIC), which responded more strongly to touch during self-generated than during FES-induced movements. A network analysis via dynamic causal modeling revealed that connectivity from the secondary somatosensory cortex via the pIC to the supplementary motor area was generally attenuated during self-generated relative to FES-induced movements—yet specifically enhanced by touch received during self-generated, but not FES-induced movements. Together, these results suggest a crucial role of the parietal operculum and the posterior insula in differentiating self-generated from externally caused somatosensory information received from one’s moving limb.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Neocortical GABAergic interneurons expressing vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) contribute to sensory processing, sensorimotor integration, and behavioral control. In contrast to other major subpopulations of GABAergic interneurons, VIP neurons show a remarkable diversity. Studying morphological and electrophysiological properties of VIP cells, we found a peculiar group of neurons in layer II/III of mouse primary somatosensory (barrel) cortex, which showed a highly dynamic burst firing behavior at resting membrane potential that switched to tonic mode at depolarized membrane potentials. Furthermore, we demonstrate that burst firing depends on T-type calcium channels. The burst-tonic switch could be induced by acetylcholine (ACh) and serotonin. ACh mediated a depolarization via nicotinic receptors whereas serotonin evoked a biphasic depolarization via ionotropic and metabotropic receptors in 48% of the population and a purely monophasic depolarization via metabotropic receptors in the remaining cells. These data disclose an electrophysiologically defined subpopulation of VIP neurons that via neuromodulator-induced changes in firing behavior is likely to regulate the state of cortical circuits in a profound manner.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Primates with primary visual cortex (V1) damage often retain residual motion sensitivity, which is hypothesized to be mediated by middle temporal area (MT). MT neurons continue to respond to stimuli shortly after V1 lesions; however, experimental and clinical studies of lesion-induced plasticity have shown that lesion effects can take several months to stabilize. It is unknown what physiological changes occur in MT and whether neural responses persist long after V1 damage. We recorded neuronal responses in MT to moving dot patterns in adult marmoset monkeys 6–12 months after unilateral V1 lesions. In contrast to results obtained shortly after V1 lesions, we found that fewer MT neurons were direction selective, including neurons expected to still receive projections from remaining parts of V1. The firing rates of most cells increased with increases in motion strength, regardless of stimulus direction. Furthermore, firing rates were higher and more variable than in control MT cells. To test whether these observations could be mechanistically explained by underlying changes in neural circuitry, we created a network model of MT. We found that a local imbalance of inhibition and excitation explained the observed firing rate changes. These results provide the first insights into functional implications of long-term plasticity in MT following V1 lesions.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Fluid intelligence is the capacity to solve novel problems in the absence of task-specific knowledge and is highly predictive of outcomes like educational attainment and psychopathology. Here, we modeled the neurocognitive architecture of fluid intelligence in two cohorts: the Centre for Attention, Leaning and Memory sample (CALM) (&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;N&lt;/span&gt; = 551, aged 5–17 years) and the  Enhanced Nathan Kline Institute—Rockland Sample (NKI-RS) (&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;N&lt;/span&gt; = 335, aged 6–17 years). We used multivariate structural equation modeling to test a preregistered watershed model of fluid intelligence. This model predicts that white matter contributes to intermediate cognitive phenotypes, like working memory and processing speed, which, in turn, contribute to fluid intelligence. We found that this model performed well for both samples and explained large amounts of variance in fluid intelligence (&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;R&lt;/span&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;CALM&lt;/sub&gt; = 51.2%, &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;R&lt;/span&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;NKI-RS &lt;/sub&gt;= 78.3%). The relationship between cognitive abilities and white matter differed with age, showing a dip in strength around ages 7–12 years. This age effect may reflect a reorganization of the neurocognitive architecture around pre- and early puberty. Overall, these findings highlight that intelligence is part of a complex hierarchical system of partially independent effects.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

The multiple-breath washout (MBW) is a lung function test that measures the degree of ventilation inhomogeneity (VI). The test is used to identify small airway impairment in patients with lung diseases like cystic fibrosis. However, the physical and physiological factors that influence the test outcomes and differentiate health from disease are not well understood. Computational models have been used to better understand the interaction between anatomical structure and physiological properties of the lung, but none of them has dealt in depth with the tracer gas washout test in a whole. Thus, our aim was to create a lung model that simulates the entire MBW and investigate the role of lung morphology and tissue mechanics on the tracer gas washout procedure. To this end, we developed a multi-scale lung model to simulate the inert gas transport in airways of all size. We then applied systematically different modifications to geometrical and mechanical properties of the lung model (compliance, residual airway volume and flow resistance) which have been associated with VI. The modifications were applied to distinct parts of the model, and their effects on the gas distribution within the lung and on the gas concentration profile were assessed. We found that variability in compliance and residual volume of the airways, as well as the spatial distribution of this variability in the lung had a direct influence on gas distribution among airways and on the MBW pattern (washout duration, characteristic concentration profile during each expiration), while the effects of variable flow resistance were negligible. Based on these findings, it is possible to classify different types of inhomogeneities in the lung and relate them to specific features of the MBW pattern, which builds the basis for a more detailed association of lung function and structure.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/rWwQMLRNGq8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Many complex diseases such as cancer are associated with multiple pathological manifestations. Moreover, the therapeutics for their treatments often lead to serious side effects. Thus, it is needed to develop multi-indication therapeutics that can simultaneously target multiple clinical indications of interest and mitigate the side effects. However, conventional one-drug-one-gene drug discovery paradigm and emerging polypharmacology approach rarely tackle the challenge of multi-indication drug design. For the first time, we propose a one-drug-multi-target-multi-indication strategy. We develop a novel structural systems pharmacology platform 3D-REMAP that uses ligand binding site comparison and protein-ligand docking to augment sparse chemical genomics data for the machine learning model of genome-scale chemical-protein interaction prediction. Experimentally validated predictions systematically show that 3D-REMAP outperforms state-of-the-art ligand-based, receptor-based, and machine learning methods alone. As a proof-of-concept, we utilize the concept of drug repurposing that is enabled by 3D-REMAP to design dual-indication anti-cancer therapy. The repurposed drug can demonstrate anti-cancer activity for cancers that do not have effective treatment as well as reduce the risk of heart failure that is associated with all types of existing anti-cancer therapies. We predict that levosimendan, a PDE inhibitor for heart failure, inhibits serine/threonine-protein kinase RIOK1 and other kinases. Subsequent experiments and systems biology analyses confirm this prediction, and suggest that levosimendan is active against multiple cancers, notably lymphoma, through the direct inhibition of RIOK1 and RNA processing pathway. We further develop machine learning models to predict cancer cell-line’s and a patient’s response to levosimendan. Our findings suggest that levosimendan can be a promising novel lead compound for the development of safe, effective, and precision multi-indication anti-cancer therapy. This study demonstrates the potential of structural systems pharmacology in designing polypharmacology for precision medicine. It may facilitate transforming the conventional one-drug-one-gene-one-disease drug discovery process and single-indication polypharmacology approach into a new one-drug-multi-target-multi-indication paradigm for complex diseases.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/-IDblMFngLo&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

&lt;p&gt;We administered deoxynucleoside monophosphates and deoxynucleoside to 16 TK2‐deficient patients under a compassionate use program.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 5 patients with early onset and severe disease, survival and motor functions were better than historically untreated patients. In 11 childhood and adult onset patients, clinical measures stabilized or improved. Three of 8 patients who were nonambulatory at baseline gained the ability to walk on therapy; 4 of 5 patients who required enteric nutrition were able to discontinue feeding tube use; and 1 of 9 patients who required mechanical ventilation became able to breathe independently. In motor functional scales, improvements were observed in the 6‐minute walk test performance in 7 of 8 subjects, Egen Klassifikation in 2 of 3, and North Star Ambulatory Assessment in all 5 tested. Baseline elevated serum growth differentiation factor 15 levels decreased with treatment in all 7 patients tested. A side effect observed in 8 of the 16 patients was dose‐dependent diarrhea, which did not require withdrawal of treatment. Among 12 other TK2 patients treated with deoxynucleoside, 2 adults developed elevated liver enzymes that normalized following discontinuation of therapy.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This open‐label study indicates favorable side effect profiles and clinical efficacy of deoxynucleoside monophosphate and deoxynucleoside therapies for TK2 deficiency. ANN NEUROL 2019&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>RSS PAP: Cyfip1 haploinsufficiency does not alter GABAA receptor {delta}-subunit expression and tonic inhibition in dentate gyrus PV+ interneurons and granule cells</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0364-18.2019v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Copy number variation at chromosomal region 15q11.2 is linked to increased risk of neurodevelopmental disorders including autism and schizophrenia. A significant gene at this locus is cytoplasmic fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) interacting protein 1 (&lt;i&gt;CYFIP1&lt;/i&gt;). CYFIP1 protein interacts with FMRP, whose monogenic absence causes Fragile X syndrome. FMRP knock-out has been shown to reduce tonic GABAergic inhibition by interacting with the -subunit of the GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptor. Using &lt;i&gt;in situ&lt;/i&gt; hybridization, qPCR, western blot techniques and patch clamp electrophysiology in brain slices from a &lt;i&gt;Cyfip1&lt;/i&gt; haploinsufficient mouse, we examined -subunit mediated tonic inhibition in the dentate gyrus. In wild-type mice, dentate gyrus granule cells (DGGC) responded to the -subunit selective agonist THIP with significantly increased tonic currents. In heterozygous mice, no significant difference was observed in THIP evoked currents in DGGC. Phasic GABAergic inhibition in DGGC was also unaltered with no difference in properties of spontaneous inhibitory post synaptic currents (IPSCs). Additionally, we demonstrate that dentate gyrus granule cell layer PV&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-interneurons (PV&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-IN) have functional -subunit mediated tonic GABAergic currents which, unlike DGGC, are also modulated by the α&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; selective drug zolpidem. Similar to DGGC, both IPSCs and THIP-evoked currents in PV&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-IN were not different between &lt;i&gt;Cyfip1&lt;/i&gt; heterozygous and wild-type mice. Supporting our electrophysiological data, we found no significant change in hippocampal -subunit mRNA expression or protein level and no change in α&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;/α&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; subunit mRNA expression. Thus, &lt;i&gt;Cyfip1&lt;/i&gt; haploinsufficiency, mimicking human 15q11.2 microdeletion syndrome, does not alter hippocampal phasic or tonic GABAergic inhibition, substantially differing from the FMRP knock-out mouse model.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;CYFIP1&lt;/i&gt; is a candidate risk gene for neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders. CYFIP1 protein interacts with FMRP whose loss downregulates tonic GABAergic inhibition via interaction with the -subunit of the GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptor. Here, however, we report that reduced &lt;i&gt;Cyfip1&lt;/i&gt; dosage in mice does not alter tonic GABAergic inhibition in granule cells and PV&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-interneurons of the dentate gyrus, a region rich in -subunit expression. Despite these negative findings, our data does demonstrate that PV&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-interneurons of the DG granule cell layer are functionally regulated by tonic GABAergic inhibition, and in contrast to granule cells, this involves receptors incorporating both  and α&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-subunits. Thus, granule cell layer excitatory neurons and PV&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-interneurons may be differentially modulated by subunit selective GABA receptor targeting drugs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>RSS PAP: Temporal dynamics of inhalation-linked activity across defined subpopulations of mouse olfactory bulb neurons imaged in vivo</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0189-19.2019v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>ABSTRACT&lt;p&gt;In mammalian olfaction, inhalation drives the temporal patterning of neural activity that underlies early olfactory processing. It remains poorly understood how the neural circuits that process incoming olfactory information are engaged in the context of inhalation-linked dynamics. Here, we used artificial inhalation and two-photon calcium imaging to compare the dynamics of activity evoked by odorant inhalation across major cell types of the mouse olfactory bulb (OB). We expressed GCaMP6f or jRGECO1a in mitral and tufted cell subpopulations, olfactory sensory neurons, and two major juxtaglomerular interneuron classes, and imaged responses to a single inhalation of odorant. Activity in all cell types was strongly linked to inhalation, and all cell types showed some variance in the latency, rise-times, and durations of their inhalation-linked response. Juxtaglomerular interneuron dynamics closely matched that of sensory inputs, while mitral and tufted cells showed the highest diversity in responses, with a range of latencies and durations that could not be accounted for by heterogeneity in sensory input dynamics. Diversity was apparent even among 'sister' tufted cells innervating the same glomerulus. Surprisingly, inhalation-linked responses of mitral and tufted cells were highly overlapping and could not be distinguished on the basis of their inhalation-linked dynamics, with the exception of a subpopulation of superficial tufted cells expressing cholecystokinin. Our results are consistent with a model in which diversity in inhalation-linked patterning of OB output arises first at the level of sensory input and is enhanced by feedforward inhibition from juxtaglomerular interneurons which differentially impact different subpopulations of OB output neurons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Inhalation drives the temporal patterning of neural activity that underlies olfactory processing and rapid odor perception, yet the dynamics of the neural circuit elements mediating this processing are poorly understood. By comparing inhalation-linked dynamics of major olfactory bulb subpopulations, we find that diversity in the timing of neural activation arises at the level of sensory input, which is then mirrored by inhibitory interneurons in the glomerular layer. Temporal diversity is higher among olfactory bulb output neurons, with different subpopulations showing distinct but nonetheless highly overlapping ranges of inhalation-linked dynamics. These results implicate feedforward inhibition by glomerular-layer interneurons in diversifying temporal responses among output neurons, which may be important for generating and shaping timing-based odor representations during natural odor sampling.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A key element of the European Union's Human Brain Project (HBP) and other
large-scale brain research projects is simulation of large-scale model networks
of neurons. Here we argue why such simulations will likely be indispensable for
bridging the scales between the neuron and system levels in the brain, and a
set of brain simulators based on neuron models at different levels of
biological detail should thus be developed. To allow for systematic refinement
of candidate network models by comparison with experiments, the simulations
should be multimodal in the sense that they should not only predict action
potentials, but also electric, magnetic, and optical signals measured at the
population and system levels.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1906.06171</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Musical scales are used in cultures throughout the world, but the question as
to how they evolved remains open. Some suggest that scales based on the
harmonic series are inherently pleasant, while others propose that scales are
chosen that are easy to sing, hear and reproduce accurately. However, testing
these theories has been hindered by the sparseness of empirical evidence. Here,
to enable such examination, we assimilate data from diverse ethnomusicological
sources into a cross-cultural database of scales. We generate populations of
scales based on proposed and alternative theories and assess their similarity
to empirical distributions from the database. Most scales can be explained as
tending to include intervals roughly corresponding to perfect fifths
(&quot;imperfect fifths&quot;), and packing arguments explain the salient features of the
distributions. Scales are also preferred if their intervals are compressible,
which could facilitate efficient communication and memory of melodies. While no
single theory can explain all scales, which appear to evolve according to
different selection pressures, the simplest harmonicity-based, imperfect-fifths
packing model best fits the empirical data.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Periodic Codes and Sound Localization. (arXiv:1906.06006v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1906.06006</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Inspired by the sound localization system of the barn owl, we define a new
class of neural codes, called periodic codes, and study their basic properties.
Periodic codes are binary codes with a special patterned form that reflects the
periodicity of the stimulus. Because these codes can be used by the owl to
localize sounds within a convex set of angles, we investigate whether they are
examples of convex codes, which have previously been studied for hippocampal
place cells. We find that periodic codes are typically not convex, but can be
completed to convex codes in the presence of noise. We introduce the convex
closure and Hamming distance completion as ways of adding codewords to make a
code convex, and describe the convex closure of a periodic code. We also find
that the probability of the convex closure arising stochastically is greater
for sparser codes. Finally, we provide an algebraic method using the neural
ideal to detect if a code is periodic. We find that properties of periodic
codes help to explain several aspects of the behavior observed in the sound
localization system of the barn owl, including common errors in localizing pure
tones.

	<title>eLife: latest articles: Acetic acid activates distinct taste pathways in Drosophila to elicit opposing, state-dependent feeding responses</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/47677</link>
	<content:encoded>Taste circuits are genetically determined to elicit an innate appetitive or aversive response, ensuring that animals consume nutritious foods and avoid the ingestion of toxins. We have examined the response of &lt;i&gt;Drosophila melanogaster&lt;/i&gt; to acetic acid, a tastant that can be a metabolic resource but can also be toxic to the fly. Our data reveal that flies accommodate these conflicting attributes of acetic acid by virtue of a hunger-dependent switch in their behavioral response to this stimulus. Fed flies show taste aversion to acetic acid, whereas starved flies show a robust appetitive response. These opposing responses are mediated by two different classes of taste neurons, the sugar- and bitter-sensing neurons. Hunger shifts the behavioral response from aversion to attraction by enhancing the appetitive sugar pathway as well as suppressing the aversive bitter pathway. Thus a single tastant can drive opposing behaviors by activating distinct taste pathways modulated by internal state.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhz098/5513063?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;The embryonic mouse cortex displays a striking low caudo-medial and high rostro-lateral graded expression of the homeoprotein transcription factor Pax6, which presents both cell autonomous and direct noncell autonomous activities. Through the genetic induction of anti-Pax6 single-chain antibody secretion, we have analyzed Pax6 noncell autonomous activity on the migration of cortical hem- and septum-derived Cajal–Retzius (CR) neurons by live imaging of flat mount developing cerebral cortices. Blocking extracellular Pax6 disrupts tangential CR cell migration patterns by decreasing the distance traveled and changing both directionality and depth at which CR cells migrate. Tracking of single CR cells in mutant cortices revealed that extracellular Pax6 neutralization enhances contact repulsion in medial regions yet reduces it in lateral regions. This study demonstrates that secreted Pax6 controls neuronal migration and distribution and suggests that it acts as a bona fide morphogen at an early stage of cerebral cortex development.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Brain State-dependent Gain Modulation of Corticospinal Output in the Active Motor System</title>

	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;The communication through coherence hypothesis suggests that only coherently oscillating neuronal groups can interact effectively and predicts an intrinsic response modulation along the oscillatory rhythm. For the motor cortex (MC) at rest, the oscillatory cycle has been shown to determine the brain’s responsiveness to external stimuli. For the active MC, however, the demonstration of such a phase-specific modulation of corticospinal excitability (CSE) along the rhythm cycle is still missing. Motor evoked potentials in response to transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) over the MC were used to probe the effect of cortical oscillations on CSE during several motor conditions. A brain–machine interface (BMI) with a robotic hand orthosis allowed investigating effects of cortical activity on CSE without the confounding effects of voluntary muscle activation. Only this BMI approach (and not active or passive hand opening alone) revealed a frequency- and phase-specific cortical modulation of CSE by sensorimotor beta-band activity that peaked once per oscillatory cycle and was independent of muscle activity. The active MC follows an intrinsic response modulation in accordance with the communication through coherence hypothesis. Furthermore, the BMI approach may facilitate and strengthen effective corticospinal communication in a therapeutic context, for example, when voluntary hand opening is no longer possible after stroke.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>The nervous and immune systems are classically studied as two separate entities. However, their interactions are crucial for maintaining barrier functions at tissues constantly exposed to the external environment. We focus here on the role of neuronal signaling in regulating the immune system at two major barriers: the skin and respiratory tract. Barrier tissues are heavily innervated by sensory and autonomic nerves, and are densely populated by resident immune cells, allowing rapid, coordinated responses to noxious stimuli, as well as to bacterial and fungal pathogens.</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: DeepConv-DTI: Prediction of drug-target interactions via deep learning with convolution on protein sequences</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/2tye3Y7WxRo/article</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Ingoo Lee, Jongsoo Keum, Hojung Nam&lt;/p&gt;

Identification of drug-target interactions (DTIs) plays a key role in drug discovery. The high cost and labor-intensive nature of &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; experiments have highlighted the importance of &lt;i&gt;in silico&lt;/i&gt;-based DTI prediction approaches. In several computational models, conventional protein descriptors have been shown to not be sufficiently informative to predict accurate DTIs. Thus, in this study, we propose a deep learning based DTI prediction model capturing local residue patterns of proteins participating in DTIs. When we employ a convolutional neural network (CNN) on raw protein sequences, we perform convolution on various lengths of amino acids subsequences to capture local residue patterns of generalized protein classes. We train our model with large-scale DTI information and demonstrate the performance of the proposed model using an independent dataset that is not seen during the training phase. As a result, our model performs better than previous protein descriptor-based models. Also, our model performs better than the recently developed deep learning models for massive prediction of DTIs. By examining pooled convolution results, we confirmed that our model can detect binding sites of proteins for DTIs. In conclusion, our prediction model for detecting local residue patterns of target proteins successfully enriches the protein features of a raw protein sequence, yielding better prediction results than previous approaches.

Differentiation between phenotypically neutral and disease-causing genetic variation remains an open and relevant problem. Among different types of variation, non-frameshifting insertions and deletions (indels) represent an understudied group with widespread phenotypic consequences. To address this challenge, we present a machine learning method, MutPred-Indel, that predicts pathogenicity and identifies types of functional residues impacted by non-frameshifting insertion/deletion variation. The model shows good predictive performance as well as the ability to identify impacted structural and functional residues including secondary structure, intrinsic disorder, metal and macromolecular binding, post-translational modifications, allosteric sites, and catalytic residues. We identify structural and functional mechanisms impacted preferentially by germline variation from the Human Gene Mutation Database, recurrent somatic variation from COSMIC in the context of different cancers, as well as de novo variants from families with autism spectrum disorder. Further, the distributions of pathogenicity prediction scores generated by MutPred-Indel are shown to differentiate highly recurrent from non-recurrent somatic variation. Collectively, we present a framework to facilitate the interrogation of both pathogenicity and the functional effects of non-frameshifting insertion/deletion variants. The MutPred-Indel webserver is available at http://mutpred.mutdb.org/.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/RctPZ2_u5sk&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) is characterized by the accumulation of amyloid β (Aβ) in the walls of cortical vessels and the accrual of microbleeds and microinfarcts over time. The relationship between CAA severity and microbleeds and microinfarcts as well as the sequence of events that lead to lesion formation remain poorly understood.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We scanned intact formalin‐fixed hemispheres of 12 CAA cases with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), followed by histopathological examination in predefined areas and serial sectioning in targeted areas with multiple lesions.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In total, 1,168 cortical microbleeds and 472 cortical microinfarcts were observed on ex vivo MRI. Increasing CAA severity at the whole‐brain or regional level was not associated with the number of microbleeds or microinfarcts. However, locally, the density of Aβ‐positive cortical vessels was lower surrounding a microbleed compared to a simulated control lesion, and higher surrounding microinfarcts. Serial sectioning revealed that for (n = 28) microbleeds, both Aβ (4%) and smooth muscle cells (4%) were almost never present in the vessel wall at the site of bleeding, but Aβ was frequently observed upstream or downstream (71%), as was extensive fibrin(ogen) buildup (87%). In contrast, for (n = 22) microinfarcts, vascular Aβ was almost always observed at the core of the lesion (91%, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001) as well as upstream or downstream (82%), but few vessels associated with microinfarcts had intact smooth muscle cells (9%).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These observations provide a model for how a single neuropathologic process such as CAA may result in hemorrhagic or ischemic brain lesions potentially through 2 different mechanistic pathways. ANN NEUROL 2019&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

&lt;h2&gt;Objectives&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia and is responsible for a huge and growing health care burden in the developed and developing world. The Polygenic Risk Score (PRS) approach has shown 75%‐84% prediction accuracy of identifying individuals with AD risk.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this study we tested the prediction accuracy of AD, MCI and amyloid deposition risks with PRS, including and excluding &lt;i&gt;APOE&lt;/i&gt; genotypes in a large publicly available data set with extensive phenotypic data: the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative cohort. Among MCI individuals with amyloid positive status we examined PRS prediction accuracy in those who converted to AD. In addition, we divided polygenic risk score by biological pathways and tested them independently for distinguishing between AD, MCI and amyloid deposition.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We found that AD and MCI are predicted by both &lt;i&gt;APOE&lt;/i&gt; genotype and PRS (AUC=0.82% and 68%, respectively). Amyloid deposition is predicted by &lt;i&gt;APOE&lt;/i&gt; only (AUC=79%). Further progression to AD of individuals with MCI and amyloid positive status is predicted by PRS over and above &lt;i&gt;APOE&lt;/i&gt; (AUC=67%).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In pathway‐specific PRSs analyses the protein‐lipid complex has the strongest association with AD and amyloid deposition even when genes in &lt;i&gt;APOE&lt;/i&gt; region were removed (p=0.0055 and p=0.0079, respectively).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results showed different pattern of &lt;i&gt;APOE&lt;/i&gt; contribution in PRS risk predictions of AD/MCI and amyloid deposition. Our study suggests that &lt;i&gt;APOE&lt;/i&gt; mostly contributes to amyloid accumulation and the PRS affects risk of further conversion to AD.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>RSS PAP: Targeting microglia using Cx3cr1-cre lines: revisiting the specificity</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0114-19.2019v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Microglia play a pivotal role in maintaining homeostasis of the CNS. There is growing interest in understanding how microglia influence normal brain function and disease progression. Several microglia-specific Cx3cr1-Cre lines have been developed and have become indispensable tools in many investigations of microglial function. However, some recent studies have reported that these lines may have significant leakage into neurons. Other studies have reported that Cx3cr1 is expressed in non-microglial cells, including neurons and astrocytes, in vitro or in vivo either during brain development or upon neurological insult. All these reports raise serious concerns about the trustworthiness of these Cre-lines and whether the conclusions drawn from previous studies are valid. Here, we found that a floxed fluorescent reporter mouse line which has been frequently used to verify Cre lines displayed spontaneous expression of the GFP reporter, independent of Cre recombinase, thus revealing a potential caveat in assessing cre lines. We further confirmed that two Cx3cr1-Cre mouse lines can drive fluorescent reporter expression largely restrictively in microglia. Finally, we clarified that these two mouse lines maintain microglia-specific expression even following excitatory injury. Together, our findings confirm that two previously created Cx3cr1-Cre lines remain as invaluable tools for studying microglia. Moreover, to ensure the quality of data generated and the soundness of conclusions drawn from such data, it should be compulsory to thoroughly examine reporter lines for spontaneous leakiness when labeling cells to study CNS function and diseases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Microglia-specific Cre-lines are essential for studying the role of microglia in the CNS. Several Cx3cr1-Cre lines have been developed and used in a number of landmark studies. However, there is growing concern in the microglia research community regarding potential leakiness of Cre-lines into neurons. The conclusions drawn from previous studies are also being questioned and key ongoing studies have been stalled. We found that a GFP-reporter mouse lines used in a previous study displays spontaneous leakiness into neurons, independent of Cre recombinase. Furthermore, we confirmed that two Cre-lines are microglia-specific and thus can be redeployed without hesitation. Our study also suggests that testing for potential leakiness of GFP-reporter lines should be included as a control in cell-tracing experiments.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1906.05803</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;We model human decision-making behaviors in a risk-taking task using inverse
reinforcement learning (IRL) for the purposes of understanding real human
decision making under risk. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
work applying IRL to reveal the implicit reward function in human risk-taking
decision making and to interpret risk-prone and risk-averse decision-making
policies. We hypothesize that the state history (e.g. rewards and decisions in
previous trials) are related to the human reward function, which leads to
risk-averse and risk-prone decisions. We design features that reflect these
factors in the reward function of IRL and learn the corresponding weight that
is interpretable as the importance of features. The results confirm the
sub-optimal risk-related decisions of human-driven by the personalized reward
function. In particular, the risk-prone person tends to decide based on the
current pump number, while the risk-averse person relies on burst information
from the previous trial and the average end status. Our results demonstrate
that IRL is an effective tool to model human decision-making behavior, as well
as to help interpret the human psychological process in risk decision-making.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1906.05624</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Asynchronous irregular (AI) and critical states are two competing frameworks
proposed to explain spontaneous neuronal activity. Here, we propose a
mean-field model with simple stochastic neurons that generalizes the
integrate-and-fire network of Brunel (2000). We show that the point with
balanced inhibitory/excitatory synaptic weight ratio $g_c \approx 4$
corresponds to a second order absorbing phase transition usual in
self-organized critical (SOC) models. At the synaptic balance point $g_c$, the
network exhibits power-law neuronal avalanches with the usual exponents,
whereas for nonzero external field the system displays the four usual
synchronicity states of balanced networks. We add homeostatic inhibition and
firing rate adaption and obtain a self-organized quasi-critical balanced state
with avalanches and AI-like activity. Our model might explain why different
inhibition levels are obtained in different experimental conditions and for
different regions of the brain, since at least two dynamical mechanisms are
necessary to obtain a truly balanced state, without which the network may hover
in different regions of the presented theoretical phase diagram.

	<content:encoded>Although the evolutionarily conserved functions of the ventral striatal components have been used as a priori knowledge for further studies, whether these functions are conserved between species remains unclear. In particular, whether macroscopic connectivity supports this given the disproportionate volumetric differences between species in the brain regions that project to the ventral striatum, including the prefrontal and limbic areas, has not been established. The evolutionarily conserved functions of the ventral striatal components have been suggested and used as a priori knowledge for further studies. However, whether this hypothesis is supported by macroscopic connectivity remains unclear, especially when considering the disproportionate volumetric differences between species in the brain regions known to project to the ventral striatum, including the prefrontal and limbic areas. In this study, the human and macaque striatum was first tractographically parcellated to define the ventral striatum and its two subregions, the nucleus accumbens (Acb)-like and the neurochemically unique domains of the Acb and putamen (NUDAPs)-like divisions. Our results revealed a similar topographical distribution of the connectivity-based ventral striatal components in the two primate brains. Successively, a set of targets was extracted to construct a connectivity fingerprint to characterize these parcellation results, enabling cross-species comparisons. Our results indicated that the connectivity fingerprints of the ventral striatum-like divisions were dissimilar in the two species. We localized this difference to specific targets to analyze possible interspecies functional modifications. Our results also revealed interspecies-convergent connectivity ratio fingerprints of the target group to these two ventral striatum-like subregions. This convergence may suggest synchronous connectional changes of these ventral striatal components during primate evolution.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00619</link>
	<content:encoded>Age-related hearing loss (ARHL), also called presbycusis, is a progressive disorder affecting hearing functions and among the elderly has been recognized as the third most frequent condition. Among ARHL components, the age-related central auditory processing disorder (CAPD) refers to changes in the auditory network, negatively impacting auditory perception and/or the speech communication performance. The relationship between auditory-perception and speech communication difficulties in age-related CAPD is difficult to establish, mainly because many older subjects have concomitant peripheral ARHL and age-related cognitive changes. In the last two decades, the association between cognitive impairment and ARHL has received great attention. Peripheral ARHL has recently been defined as the modifiable risk factor with the greatest impact on the development of dementia. Even if very few studies have analyzed the relationship between cognitive decline and age-related CAPD, a strong association was highlighted. Therefore, age-related CAPD could be a specific process related to neurodegeneration. Since these two disorders can be concomitant, drawing causal inferences is difficult. The assumption that ARHL, particularly age-related CAPD, may increase the risk of cognitive impairment in the elderly remains unchallenged. This review aims to summarize the evidence of associations between age-related CAPD and cognitive disorders and to define the diagnostic procedure of CAPD in the elderly. Finally, we highlight the importance of tailoring the rehabilitation strategy to this relationship. Future longitudinal studies with larger sample sizes and the use of adequate assessment tools that can disentangle cognitive dysfunction from sensory impairments are warranted.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00617</link>
	<content:encoded>Positron Emission Tomography (PET) represents a unique molecular tool to get in vivo access to a wide spectrum of biological and neuropathological processes, of crucial relevance for neurodegenerative conditions. Although most PET findings are based on massive univariate approaches, in the last decade the increasing interest in multivariate methods has paved the way to the assessment of unexplored cerebral features, spanning from resting state brain networks to whole-brain connectome properties. Currently, the combination of molecular neuroimaging techniques with multivariate connectivity methods represents one of the most powerful, yet still emerging, approach to achieve novel insights into the pathophysiology of neurodegenerative diseases. In this Review, we will summarize the available evidence in the field of PET molecular connectivity, with the aim to provide an overview of how these studies may increase the understanding of the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases, over and above “traditional” structural/functional connectivity studies. Considering the available evidence, a major focus will be represented by molecular connectivity studies using [18F]FDG-PET, today applied in the major neuropathological spectra, from amyloidopathies and tauopathies to synucleinopathies and beyond. Pioneering studies using PET tracers targeting brain neuropathology and neurotransmission systems for connectivity studies will be discussed, and their strengths and limitations highlighted with reference to both applied methodology and results interpretation. The most common methods for molecular connectivity assessment will be reviewed, with particular emphasis on the available strategies to investigate molecular connectivity at the single-subject level, of potential relevance for not only research but also diagnostic purposes. Finally, we will highlight possible future perspectives in the field, with reference in particular to newly available PET tracers, which will expand the application of molecular connectivity to new, exciting, unforeseen possibilities.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00611</link>
	<content:encoded>Studies of functional neurosurgery and electroencephalography in Parkinson’s disease have demonstrated abnormally synchronous activity between basal ganglia and motor cortex. 
Functional neuroimaging studies investigated brain dysfunction during motor task or resting state and primarily have shown altered patterns of activation and connectivity for motor areas. L-dopa administration relatively normalized these functional alterations.
The aim of this pilot study was to examine the effects of L-dopa administration on functional connectivity in early-stage PD, as revealed by simultaneous recording of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and electroencephalographic (EEG) data.
Six patients with diagnosis of probable PD underwent EEG-fMRI acquisitions (1.5 T MR scanner and 64-channel cap) before and immediately after the intake of L-dopa. Regions of interest in the primary motor and sensorimotor regions were used for resting state fMRI analysis. From the EEG data, weighted partial directed coherence was computed in the inverse space after the removal of gradient and cardioballistic artifacts.
FMRI results showed that the intake of L-dopa increased functional connectivity within the sensorimotor network, and between motor areas and both attention and default mode networks. 
EEG connectivity among regions of the motor network did not change significantly, while regions of the default mode network showed a strong tendency to increase their outflow toward the rest of the brain.
This pilot study provided a first insight into the potentiality of simultaneous EEG-fMRI acquisitions in PD patients, showing for both techniques the analogous direction of increased connectivity after L-dopa intake, mainly involving motor, dorsal attention and default mode networks.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Brain functional connectivity network (BFCN) analysis has been widely used in diagnosis of mental disorder, such as schizophrenia. In BFCN methods, the brain network construction is one of the core tasks due to its great influence on the diagnosis result. Most of the existing BFCN construction methods only consider the first-order relationship existing in each pair of brain regions and ignore the useful high-order information, including multi-regions correlation in the whole brain. Some of the early schizophrenia patients have subtle changes in brain function networks, which cannot be detected in conventional BFCN construction methods. It is well known that the high-order method is usually more sensitive to the subtle changes in signal than the low-order method. For exploiting the high-order information among brain regions, we define the triplet correlation among three brain regions, and derive the second-order brain network based on the connectivity difference and ordinal information in each triplet. For making full use of the complementary information in different brain networks, we proposed a hybrid approach to fuse the first-order and second-order brain networks. The proposed method is applied to identifying the biomarkers of schizophrenia. The experimental results on six schizophrenia datasets (totally including 439 patients and 426 controls) show that the proposed method outperforms the existing brain network methods in diagnosis of schizophrenia.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Tissue morphology and mechanics are crucial to the regulation of organ function. Investigating the exceptionally complex tissue of the brain at the sub-micron scale turns out to be challenging due to the complex structure and softness of this tissue despite the large interest of biologist, medical engineers, biophysicists and other sin this topic. Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) both as an imaging and as a mechanical tool provides an excellent opportunity to study soft biological samples such as live brain tissues. Here we review the principles of AFM, the performance of AFM in tissue imaging and me-chanical mapping of cells and tissues, and finally opening the prospects and challenges of probing the biophysical properties of brain tissue using AFM.</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Neurodegeneration section | New and Recent Articles: Effect of L-DOPA/Benserazide on Propagation of Pathological α-Synuclein</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00595</link>
	<content:encoded>Parkinson’s disease (PD) and related disorders are characterized by filamentous or fibrous structures consisting of abnormal α-synuclein in the brains of patients, and the distributions and spread of these pathologies are closely correlated with disease progression. L-DOPA (a dopamine precursor) is the most effective therapy for PD, but it remains unclear whether the drug has any effect on the formation and propagation of pathogenic abnormal α-synuclein in vivo. Here, we tested whether or not L-DOPA influences the prion-like spread of α-synuclein pathologies in a wild-type mouse model of α-synuclein propagation. To quantitate the pathological α-synuclein in mice, we prepared brain sections stained with an anti-phosphoSer129 (PS129) antibody after pretreatments with autoclaving and formic acid, and carefully analyzed positive aggregates on multiple sections covering the areas of interest using a microscope. Notably, a significant reduction in the accumulation of phosphorylated α-synuclein was detected in substantia nigra of L-DOPA/benserazide (a dopamine decarboxylase inhibitor)-treated mice, compared with control mice. These results suggest that L-DOPA may slow the progression of PD in vivo by suppressing the aggregation of α-synuclein in dopaminergic neurons and the cell-to-cell propagation of abnormal α-synuclein. This is the first report describing the suppressing effect of L-DOPA/benserazide on the propagation of pathological α-synuclein. The experimental protocols and detection methods in this study are expected to be useful for evaluation of drug candidates or new therapies targeting the propagation of α-synuclein.</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Neurodegeneration section | New and Recent Articles: The Dual Role of AQP4 in Cytotoxic and Vasogenic Edema Following Spinal Cord Contusion and Its Possible Association With Energy Metabolism via COX5A</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00584</link>
	<content:encoded>Spinal cord edema,mainly including vasogenic and cytotoxic edema,influence neurological outcome after spinal cord contusion (SCC).Aquaporin 4 (AQP4) is the most ubiquitous water channel in central nervous system (CNS),which is a rate-limiting factor in vasogenic edema expressing in brain injury,and it contributes to the formation of cytotoxic edema locating in astrocytes.However,little is known the regulatory mechanism of AQP4 within vasogenic and cytotoxic edema in SCC,and whether regulation mechanism of AQP4 is related to Cytochrome coxidase (COX5A) affecting energy metabolism.Therefore,SCC model is established by Allen’s method,and the degree of edema and neuronal area is measured.Motor function of rats is evaluated by the Basso,Beattie,and Bresnahan (BBB) scoring system.Meanwhile,AQP4 and COX5A are detected by real-time quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR) and western blot (WB).localization of targeted protein is exhibited by immunohistochemical staining (IHC) and immunofluoresce (IF).Besides,the methodology of AQP4 lentivirus-mediated RNA interference (AQP4-RNAi) is used to reveal the effect on edema of SCC and the regulating molecular mechanism. Firstly,we observe that tissue water content increase after SCC,and decrease after the peak value of tissue water content at 3 days (P&amp;lt;0.05) with abundant expression of AQP4 protein locating around vascular endothelial cells,which suggests that the increasing AQP4 promotes water reabsorption and improves vasogenic edema in the early stage of SCC.However,neuronal area is larger than sham group in the 7 days(P&amp;lt;0.05) with the total water content of spinal cord decrease.Meanwhile AQP4 migrate from vascular endothelial cells to neuronal cytomembrane,which indicates that AQP4 play a crucial role in aggravating the formation and development of cytotoxic edema in the middle stages of SCC. Secondly,AQP4-RNAi is used to elucidate the mechanism of AQP4 to edema of SCC.The neuronal area shrinks and the area of cytotoxic edema reduces after AQP4 downregulation.BBB scores is significantly higher than vector group after AQP4-RNAi at 5d,7d and 14d(P &amp;lt; 0.05).There is a relationship between AQP4 and COX5A shown by bioinformatics analysis.After AQP4 inhibition,expression of COX5A significantly up-regulated in the swelling astrocytes.Therefore,inhibition of AQP4 expression reduces cytotoxic edema in SCC and improves motor function,which may associate with upregulation of COX5A via affecting energy metabolism.Moreover,it isn’t clear how the inhibition of AQP4 directly causes the upregulation of COX5A.</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Semantic Processing in Bilingual Aphasia: Evidence of Language Dependency</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2019.00205</link>
	<content:encoded>Individuals with aphasia frequently show lexical retrieval deficits due to increased interference of semantically related competitors, a phenomenon that can be observed in tasks such as naming pictures grouped by semantic category. These deficits are explained in terms of impaired semantic control, a set of abilities that are to some extent dependent upon executive control (EC). However, the extent to which semantic control abilities can be affected in a second and non-dominant language has not been extensively explored. Additionally, findings in healthy individuals are inconclusive regarding the degree to which semantic processing is shared between languages. In this study, we explored the effect of brain damage on semantic processing by comparing the performance of bilingual individuals with aphasia on tasks involving semantic control during word production and comprehension. Furthermore, we explored whether semantic deficits are related to domain-general (EC) deficits. 
First, we investigated the naming performance of Catalan-Spanish bilinguals with fluent aphasia and age-matched healthy controls on a semantically blocked cyclic naming task in each of their two languages. This task measured semantic interference in terms of the difference in naming latencies between pictures grouped by the same semantic category or different categories. Second, we explored whether lexical deficits extend to comprehension by testing participants in a word-picture matching task during a mixed language condition. Third, we used a conflict monitoring task to explore the presence of EC deficits in patients. 
We found two main results. First, in both language tasks, bilingual patients’ performances were more affected than those of healthy controls when they performed the task in their non-dominant language. Second, there was a significant correlation between the speed of processing on the EC task and the magnitude of the semantic interference effect exclusively in the non-dominant language.
Taken together, these results suggest that lexical retrieval may be selectively impaired in bilinguals within those conditions where semantic competition is higher and this could be explained by an excessive amount of language inhibition. Moreover, lexico-semantic impairments seem to be at least somewhat related to conflict monitoring deficits, suggesting a certain degree of overlap between EC and semantic control.</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Characterizing and Predicting Autism Spectrum Disorder by Performing Resting-State Functional Network Community Pattern Analysis</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2019.00203</link>
	<content:encoded>Growing evidence indicates that autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neuropsychological disconnection syndrome that can be analysed using various complex network metrics used as pathology biomarkers. Recently, community detection and analysis rooted in the complex network and graph theories have been introduced to investigate the changes in resting-state functional network community structure under neurological pathologies. However, the potential of hidden patterns in the modular organisation of networks derived from resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging to predict brain pathology has never been investigated. In this study, we present a novel analysis technique to identify alterations in community patterns in functional networks under ASD. In addition, we design machine learning classifiers to predict the clinical class of patients with ASD and controls by using only community pattern quality metrics as features. Analyses conducted on six publicly available datasets from 235 subjects, including patients with ASD and age-matched controls revealed that the modular structure is significantly disturbed in patients with ASD. Machine learning algorithms showed that the predictive power of our five metrics is relatively high (~85.16 peak accuracy for in-site data and ~75.00% peak accuracy for multisite data). These results lend further credence to the dysconnectivity theory of this pathology.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2019.00201</link>
	<content:encoded>Deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) have previously been shown to be useful tools for signal decoding and analysis in a variety of complex domains, such as image processing and speech recognition. By learning from large amounts of data, the representations encoded by these deep networks are often invariant to moderate changes in the underlying feature spaces. Recently, we proposed a CNN architecture that could be applied to electroencephalogram (EEG) decoding and analysis. In this article, we train our CNN model using data from prior experiments in order to later decode the P300 evoked response from an unseen, hold-out experiment. We analyze the CNN output as a function of the underlying variability in the P300 response and demonstrate that the CNN output is sensitive to the experiment-induced changes in the neural response. We then assess the utility of our approach as a means of improving the overall signal-to-noise ratio in the EEG record. Finally, we show an example of how CNN-based decoding can be applied to the analysis of complex data.</content:encoded>

	<title>RSS PAP: Dynamic brain interactions during picture naming</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0472-18.2019v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Brain computations involve multiple processes by which sensory information is encoded and transformed to drive behavior. These computations are thought to be mediated by dynamic interactions between populations of neurons. Here we demonstrate that human brains exhibit a reliable sequence of neural interactions during speech production. We use an autoregressive hidden Markov model to identify dynamical network states exhibited by electrocorticographic signals recorded from human neurosurgical patients. Our method resolves dynamic latent network states on a trial-by-trial basis. We characterize individual network states according to the patterns of directional information flow between cortical regions of interest. These network states occur consistently and in a specific, interpretable sequence across trials and subjects: the data support the hypothesis of a fixed-length visual processing state, followed by a variable-length language state, and then by a terminal articulation state. This empirical evidence validates classical psycho-linguistic theories that have posited such intermediate states during speaking. It further reveals these state dynamics are not localized to one brain area or one sequence of areas, but are instead a network phenomenon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance&lt;/b&gt; Cued speech production engages a distributed set of brain regions that must interact with each other to perform this behavior rapidly and precisely. To characterize the spatio-temporal properties of the networks engaged in picture naming, we recorded from electrodes placed directly on the brain surfaces of patients with epilepsy being evaluated for surgical resection. We used a flexible statistical model applied to broadband gamma to characterize changing brain interactions. Unlike conventional models, ours can identify changes on individual trials that correlate with behavior. Our results reveal that interactions between brain regions are consistent across trials. This flexible statistical model provides a useful platform for quantifying brain dynamics during cognitive processes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: Electroencephalographic reactivity as predictor of neurological outcome in postanoxic coma: A multicenter prospective cohort study</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25507?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Outcome prediction in patients after cardiac arrest (CA) is challenging. Electroencephalographic reactivity (EEG‐R) might be a reliable predictor. We aimed to determine the prognostic value of EEG‐R using a standardized assessment.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a prospective cohort study, a strictly defined EEG‐R assessment protocol was executed twice per day in adult patients after CA. EEG‐R was classified as present or absent by 3 EEG readers, blinded to patient characteristics. Uncertain reactivity was classified as present. Primary outcome was best Cerebral Performance Category score (CPC) in 6 months after CA, dichotomized as good (CPC = 1–2) or poor (CPC = 3–5). EEG‐R was considered reliable for predicting poor outcome if specificity was ≥95%. For good outcome prediction, a specificity of ≥80% was used. Added value of EEG‐R was the increase in specificity when combined with EEG background, neurological examination, and somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEPs).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of 160 patients enrolled, 149 were available for analyses. Absence of EEG‐R for poor outcome prediction had a specificity of 82% and a sensitivity of 73%. For good outcome prediction, specificity was 73% and sensitivity 82%. Specificity for poor outcome prediction increased from 98% to 99% when EEG‐R was added to a multimodal model. For good outcome prediction, specificity increased from 70% to 89%.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EEG‐R testing in itself is not sufficiently reliable for outcome prediction in patients after CA. For poor outcome prediction, it has no substantial added value to EEG background, neurological examination, and SSEPs. For prediction of good outcome, EEG‐R seems to have added value.

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: Residual descending motor pathways influence spasticity after spinal cord injury</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25505?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spasticity is one of the most common symptoms manifested in humans with spinal cord injury (SCI). The neural mechanisms contributing to its development are not yet understood. Using neurophysiological and imaging techniques, we examined the influence of residual descending motor pathways on spasticity in humans with SCI.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We measured spasticity in 33 individuals with motor complete SCI (determined by clinical examination) without preservation of voluntary motor output in the quadriceps femoris muscle. To examine residual descending motor pathways, we used magnetic and electrical stimulation over the leg motor cortex to elicit motor evoked potentials (MEPs) in the quadriceps femoris muscle and structural magnetic resonance imaging to measure spinal cord atrophy.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We found that 60% of participants showed symptoms of spasticity, whereas the other 40% showed no spasticity, demonstrating the presence of 2 clear subgroups of humans with motor complete SCI. MEPs were only present in individuals who had spasticity, and MEP size correlated with the severity of spasticity. Spinal cord atrophy was greater in nonspastic compared with spastic subjects. Notably, the degree of spared tissue in the lateral regions of the spinal cord was positively correlated with the severity of spasticity, indicating preservation of white matter related to motor tracts when spasticity was present.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These results support the hypothesis that preservation of descending motor pathways influences spasticity in humans with motor complete SCI; this knowledge might help the rehabilitation and assessment of people with SCI. ANN NEUROL 2019&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To test whether systemic cytokine release is associated with central nervous system inflammatory responses and glial injury in immune effector cell‐associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS) after chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)‐T cell therapy in children and young adults.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We performed a prospective cohort study of clinical manifestations as well as imaging, pathology, CSF, and blood biomarkers on 43 subjects ages 1 to 25 who received CD19‐directed CAR/T cells for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neurotoxicity occurred in 19 of 43 (44%) subjects. Nine subjects (21%) had CTCAE grade 3 or 4 neurological symptoms, with no neurotoxicity‐related deaths. Reversible delirium, headache, decreased level of consciousness, tremor, and seizures were most commonly observed. Cornell Assessment of Pediatric Delirium (CAPD) scores ≥9 had 94% sensitivity and 33% specificity for grade ≥3 neurotoxicity, and 91% sensitivity and 72% specificity for grade ≥2 neurotoxicity. Neurotoxicity correlated with severity of cytokine release syndrome, abnormal past brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and higher peak CAR‐T cell numbers in blood, but not cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). CSF levels of S100 calcium‐binding protein B and glial fibrillary acidic protein increased during neurotoxicity, indicating astrocyte injury. There were concomitant increases in CSF white blood cells, protein, interferon‐γ (IFNγ), interleukin (IL)‐6, IL‐10, and granzyme B (GzB), with concurrent elevation of serum IFNγ IL‐10, GzB, granulocyte macrophage colony‐stimulating factor, macrophage inflammatory protein 1 alpha, and tumor necrosis factor alpha, but not IL‐6. We did not find direct evidence of endothelial activation.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our data are most consistent with ICANS as a syndrome of systemic inflammation, which affects the brain through compromise of the neurovascular unit and astrocyte injury. ANN NEUROL 2019&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: Genetic risk of dementia mitigated by cognitive reserve: A cohort study</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25501?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We investigated whether cognitive reserve modifies the risk of dementia attributable to apolipoprotein ε4 (&lt;i&gt;APOE‐&lt;/i&gt;ε4), a well‐known genetic risk factor for dementia.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We followed 2,556 cognitively intact participants aged ≥60 years from the ongoing prospective community‐based Swedish National Study on Aging and Care in Kungsholmen (SNAC‐K). Dementia was ascertained through clinical and neuropsychological assessments and diagnosed according to Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th edition criteria. Structural equation modeling was used to generate a cognitive reserve indicator from 4 previously validated contributors: early life education, midlife substantive work complexity, late life leisure activities, and late life social networks. Cox proportional hazard models estimated dementia risk in relation to cognitive reserve indicator. The interaction between the cognitive reserve indicator and &lt;i&gt;APOE‐&lt;/i&gt;ε4 was assessed on multiplicative and additive scales.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After an average of 6.3 years (range = 2.1–10.7) of follow‐up, 232 dementia cases were ascertained. Relative to individuals in the lowest tertile of cognitive reserve indicator, those with moderate and high reserve were at a reduced risk of dementia. There was no multiplicative interaction between &lt;i&gt;APOE‐&lt;/i&gt;ε4 status and cognitive reserve indicator (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.113). Additive interaction was statistically significant. Relative to &lt;i&gt;APOE‐&lt;/i&gt;ε4 carriers with low cognitive reserve, ε4 carriers with high reserve had a reduced risk of dementia (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.28, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.13–0.59). The magnitude of risk reduction was similar in ε4 noncarriers with a high cognitive reserve indicator (HR = 0.24, 95% CI = 0.15–0.40).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lifelong engagement in reserve‐enhancing activities attenuates the risk of dementia attributable to &lt;i&gt;APOE&lt;/i&gt;‐ε4. Promoting cognitive reserve might be especially effective in subpopulations with high genetic risk of dementia. ANN NEUROL 2019&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

&lt;p&gt;Charcot‐Marie‐Tooth (CMT) disease 4B1 and 4B2 (CMT4B1/B2) are characterized by recessive inheritance, early onset, severe course, slowed nerve conduction, and myelin outfoldings. CMT4B3 shows a more heterogeneous phenotype. All are associated with myotubularin‐related protein (MTMR) mutations. We conducted a multicenter, retrospective study to better characterize CMT4B.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We collected clinical and genetic data from CMT4B subjects in 18 centers using a predefined minimal data set including Medical Research Council (MRC) scores of nine muscle pairs and CMT Neuropathy Score.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were 50 patients, 21 of whom never reported before, carrying 44 mutations, of which 21 were novel and six representing novel disease associations of known rare variants. CMT4B1 patients had significantly more‐severe disease than CMT4B2, with earlier onset, more‐frequent motor milestones delay, wheelchair use, and respiratory involvement as well as worse MRC scores and motor CMT Examination Score components despite younger age at examination. Vocal cord involvement was common in both subtypes, whereas glaucoma occurred in CMT4B2 only. Nerve conduction velocities were similarly slowed in both subtypes. Regression analyses showed that disease severity is significantly associated with age in CMT4B1. Slopes are steeper for CMT4B1, indicating faster disease progression. Almost none of the mutations in the &lt;i&gt;MTMR2&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;MTMR13&lt;/i&gt; genes, responsible for CMT4B1 and B2, respectively, influence the correlation between disease severity and age, in agreement with the hypothesis of a complete loss of function of MTMR2/13 proteins for such mutations.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the largest CMT4B series ever reported, demonstrating that CMT4B1 is significantly more severe than CMT4B2, and allowing an estimate of prognosis. ANN NEUROL 2019&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: Epilepsy in families: Age at onset is a familial trait, independent of syndrome</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25499?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We tested 2 hypotheses regarding age at onset within familial epilepsies: (1) family members with epilepsy tend to have similar ages at onset, independent of epilepsy syndrome; and (2) age at onset is younger in successive generations after controlling for sampling bias.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We analyzed clinical data collected by the Epi4K Consortium (303 multiplex families, 1,120 individuals). To test hypothesis 1, we used both linear mixed models commonly used for heritability analysis and Cox regression models with frailty terms to assess clustering of onset within families after controlling for other predictors. To test hypothesis 2, we used mixed effects models, pairwise analyses, and survival analysis to address sampling‐related bias that may mimic anticipation.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regarding hypothesis 1, age at seizure onset was significantly heritable (intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.17, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001) after adjusting for epilepsy type, sex, site, history of febrile seizure, and age at last observation. This finding remained significant after adjusting for epilepsy syndromes, and was robust across statistical methods in all families and in generalized families. Regarding hypothesis 2, the mean age at onset decreased in successive generations (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001). After adjusting for age at last observation, this effect was not significant in mixed effects models (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.14), but remained significant in pairwise (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.0003) and survival analyses (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.02).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Age at seizure onset is an independent familial trait, and may have genetic determinants distinct from the determinants of particular epilepsy syndromes. Younger onsets in successive generations can be explained in part by sampling bias, but the presence of genetic anticipation cannot be excluded. ANN NEUROL 2019&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25498?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intrathecal baclofen treatment is used for the treatment of dystonia in patients with severe dyskinetic cerebral palsy; however, the current level of evidence for the effect is low. The primary aim of this study was to provide evidence for the effect of intrathecal baclofen treatment on individual goals in patients with severe dyskinetic cerebral palsy.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This multicenter, randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled trial was performed at 2 university medical centers in the Netherlands. Patients with severe dyskinetic cerebral palsy (Gross Motor Functioning Classification System level IV–V) aged 4 to 24 years who were eligible for intrathecal baclofen were included. Patients were assigned by block randomization (2:2) for treatment with intrathecal baclofen or placebo for 3 months via an implanted microinfusion pump. The primary outcome was goal attainment scaling of individual treatment goals (GAS T score). A linear regression model was used for statistical analysis with study site as a covariate. Safety analyses were done for number and type of (serious) adverse events.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thirty‐six patients were recruited from January 1, 2013, to March 31, 2018. Data for final analysis were available for 17 patients in the intrathecal baclofen group and 16 in the placebo group. Mean (standard deviation) GAS T score at 3 months was 38.9 (13.2) for intrathecal baclofen and 21.0 (4.6) for placebo (regression coefficient = 17.8, 95% confidence interval = 10.4‐25.0, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001). Number and types of (serious) adverse events were similar between groups.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intrathecal baclofen treatment is superior to placebo in achieving treatment goals in patients with severe dyskinetic cerebral palsy. ANN NEUROL 2019&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Stem cells can stay quiescent for long period of time or proliferate and differentiate into multiple lineages. The activity of stage-specific metabolic programs allows stem cells to best adapt their functions in different microenvironments. Specific cellular phenotypes can be, therefore, defined by precise metabolic signatures. Notably, not only cellular metabolism describes a defined cellular phenotype, but experimental evidences now clearly indicate that also rewiring cells towards a particular cellular metabolism can drive their cellular phenotype and function accordingly. 
Cellular metabolism can be studied by both targeted and untargeted approaches. Targeted analyses focus on a subset of identified metabolites and on their metabolic fluxes. In addition, the overall assessment of the oxygen consumption rate gives a measure of the overall cellular oxidative metabolism and mitochondrial function.  Untargeted approach provides a large-scale identification and quantification of the whole metabolome with the aim to describe a metabolic fingerprinting. 
In this review, we overview the methodologies currently available for the study of in vitro stem cell metabolism, including metabolic fluxes, fingerprint analyses, and single cell metabolomics. Moreover, we summarize available approaches for the study of in vivo stem cell metabolism. For all of the described methods, we highlight their specificities and limitations. In addition, we discuss practical concerns about the most threatening steps, including metabolic quenching, sample preparation and extraction. A better knowledge of the precise metabolic signature defining specific cell population is instrumental to the design of novel therapeutic strategies able to drive undifferentiated stem cells towards a selective and valuable cellular phenotype.</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Neurodegeneration section | New and Recent Articles: Lack of Fractalkine Receptor on Macrophages Impairs Spontaneous Recovery of Ribbon Synapses After Moderate Noise Trauma in C57BL/6 Mice</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00620</link>
	<content:encoded>Noise trauma causes loss of synaptic connections between cochlear inner hair cells (IHCs) and the spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs). Such synaptic loss can trigger slow and progressive degeneration of SGNs. Macrophage fractalkine signaling is critical for neuron survival in the injured cochlea, but its role in cochlear synaptopathy is unknown. Fractalkine, a chemokine, is constitutively expressed by SGNs and signals via its receptor CX3CR1 that is expressed on macrophages. The present study characterized the immune response and examined the function of fractalkine signaling in degeneration and repair of cochlear synapses following noise trauma. Adult mice wild type, heterozygous and knockout for CX3CR1 on a C57BL/6 background were exposed for 2 hours to an octave band noise at 90 dB SPL. Noise exposure caused temporary shifts in hearing thresholds without any evident loss of hair cells in CX3CR1 heterozygous mice that have intact fractalkine signaling. Enhanced macrophage migration towards the inner hair cell-synaptic region was observed immediately after exposure in all genotypes. Synaptic immunolabeling revealed a rapid loss of synapses throughout the basal turn of the cochlea of all genotypes. The damaged synapses spontaneously recovered in mice with intact CX3CR1. However, CX3CR1 knockout (KO) animals displayed enhanced synaptic degeneration that correlated with attenuated suprathreshold neural responses at higher frequencies. Exposed CX3CR1 KO mice also exhibited increased loss of IHCs and SGN cell bodies compared to exposed heterozygous mice. These results indicate that macrophages can promote repair of damaged synapses after moderate noise trauma and that repair requires fractalkine signaling.</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Functional Spectroscopy Mapping of Pain Processing Cortical Areas During Non-painful Peripheral Electrical Stimulation of the Accessory Spinal Nerve</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2019.00200</link>
	<content:encoded>Peripheral electrical stimulation (PES), which encompasses several techniques with heterogeneous physiological responses, has shown in some cases remarkable outcomes for pain treatment and clinical rehabilitation. However, results are still mixed, mainly because there is a lack of understanding regarding its neural mechanisms of action. In this study, we aimed to assess its effects by measuring cortical activation as indexed by functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). fNIRS is a functional optical imaging method to evaluate hemodynamic changes in oxygenated (HbO) and de-oxygenated (HbR) blood hemoglobin concentrations in cortical capillary networks that can be related to cortical activity. We hypothesized that non-painful PES of accessory spinal nerve (ASN) can promote cortical activation of sensorimotor cortex (SMC) and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) pain processing cortical areas. Fifteen healthy volunteers received both active and sham ASN electrical stimulation in a randomized crossover study. The hemodynamic cortical response to unilateral right ASN burst electrical stimulation with 10 Hz was measured by a 40-channel fNIRS system. The effect of ASN electrical stimulation over HbO concentration in cortical areas of interest was observed through the activation of right-DLPFC (p=0.025) and left-SMC (p=0.042) in the active group but not in sham group. Regarding left-DLPFC (p=0.610) and right-SMC (p=0.174) there was no statistical difference between groups. As in non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) top-down modulation, bottom-up electrical stimulation to the accessory spinal nerve seems to activate the same critical cortical areas on pain pathways related to sensory-discriminative and affective-motivational pain dimensions. These results provide additional mechanistic evidence to develop and optimize the effects of peripheral neural electrical stimulation. (NCT 03295370 - clinicaltrials.gov).</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Links Between the Amplitude Modulation of Low-Frequency Spontaneous Fluctuation Across Resting State Conditions and Thalamic Functional Connectivity</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2019.00199</link>
	<content:encoded>A comparison of the different types of resting state reveals some interesting characteristics of spontaneous brain activity that cannot be found in a single condition. Differences in the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF) between the eyes open (EO) and the eyes closed (EC) almost have a spatially distinct pattern with traditional EO-EC activation within sensory systems, suggesting the divergent functional roles of ALFF and activation. However, the underlying mechanism is far from clear. Since the thalamus plays an essential role in sensory processing, one critical step towards understanding the divergences is to depict the relationships between the thalamus and the ALFF modulation in sensory regions. In this preliminary study, we examined the association between the changes of ALFF and the changes of thalamic functional connectivity (FC) between EO and EC. We focused on two visual thalamic nuclei, the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) and the pulvinar (Pu). FC results showed that LGN had stronger synchronization with regions in lateral but not in medial visual networks, while Pu had a weaker synchronization with auditory and sensorimotor areas during EO compared with EC. Moreover, the patterns of FC modulation exhibited considerable overlaps with the ALFF modulation, and there were significant correlations between them across subjects. Our findings support the crucial role of the thalamus in amplitude modulation of low-frequency spontaneous activity in sensory systems, and may pave the way to elucidate the mechanisms governing distinction between evoked activation and modulation of low-frequency spontaneous brain activity.</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Modulation of Fronto-Striatal Functional Connectivity Using Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2019.00190</link>
	<content:encoded>Background
The fronto-striatal network is involved in various motor, cognitive and emotional processes, such as spatial attention, working memory, decision-making and emotion regulation. Intermittent theta burst transcranial magnetic stimulation (iTBS) has been shown to modulate functional connectivity of brain networks. Long stimulation intervals, as well as high stimulation intensities are typically applied in transcranial magnetic stimulation therapy for mood disorders. The role of stimulation intensity on network function and homeostasis has not been explored systematically yet. 
Objective
We aimed to modulate fronto-striatal connectivity by applying iTBS at different intensities to the left dorso-lateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). We measured individual and group changes by comparing resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI) pre-iTBS und post iTBS. Differential effects of individual sub- versus supra-resting motor-threshold stimulation intensities were assessed.
Methods
Sixteen healthy subjects underwent excitatory iTBS at two intensities (90 % and 120 % of individual resting motor threshold) on separate days. 600 pulses (2 s trains, 8 s pauses, duration of 3 minutes, 20 seconds) were applied over the left DLPFC. Directly before and 7 min after stimulation, task-free rsfMRI sessions, lasting 10 min each, were conducted. Individual seed-to-seed functional connectivity changes were calculated for ten fronto-striatal and amygdala regions of interest with the SPM toolbox DPABI.
Results
Sub-threshold-iTBS increased functional connectivity directly between the left DLPFC and the left and right caudate, respectively, as well as between the right DLPFC and the left caudate. Indirectly, functional connectivity between the right putamen and the left nucleus accumbens and the left amygdala, respectively, was increased. 
Supra-threshold stimulation did not change fronto-striatal functional connectivity, but only increased functional connectivity between the left amygdala and the caudate nuclei, as well as the left putamen, respectively.
Conclusion
A short iTBS protocol applied at sub-threshold intensities was not only sufficient, but favourable in order to increase bilateral fronto-striatal functional connectivity, while minimising side effects. Decreased functional connectivity after supra-threshold stimulation was possibly caused by network homeostatic effects.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2019.00038</link>
	<content:encoded>It is often assumed that Hebbian synaptic plasticity forms a cell assembly, a mutually interacting group of neurons that encodes memory. However, in recurrently connected networks with pure Hebbian plasticity, cell assemblies typically diverge or fade under ongoing changes of synaptic strength. Previously assumed mechanisms that stabilize cell assemblies do not robustly reproduce the experimentally reported unimodal and long-tailed distribution of synaptic strengths. Here, we show that augmenting Hebbian plasticity with experimentally observed intrinsic spine dynamics can stabilize cell assemblies and reproduce the distribution of synaptic strengths. Moreover, we posit that strong intrinsic spine dynamics impair learning performance. Our theory explains how excessively strong spine dynamics, experimentally observed in several animal models of autism spectrum disorder, impair learning associations in the brain.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2019.00265</link>
	<content:encoded>Transient potassium current channels (IA channels), which are expressed in most brain areas, have a central role in modulating feedforward and feedback inhibition along the dendroaxonic axis. Loss of the modulatory channels is tightly associated with a number of brain diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, epilepsy, fragile X syndrome, Parkinson’s disease, chronic pain, tinnitus, and ataxia. However, the functional significance of IA channels in these diseases has so far been underestimated. In this review, we discuss the distribution and function of IA channels. Particularly, we posit that downregulation of IA channels results in neuronal (mostly dendritic) hyperexcitability accompanied by imbalanced excitation and inhibition ratio in the brain's networks, eventually causing the brain diseases. Finally, we propose a potential therapeutic target: the enhanced action of IA channels to counteract Ca2+-permeable channels including NMDA receptors could be harnessed to restore dendritic excitability, leading to a balanced neuronal state.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2019.00263</link>
	<content:encoded>The role of neuroinflammation has been increasingly recognized in the field of neurodegenerative diseases. Many studies focusing on the glial cells involved in the inflammatory responses of the brain, namely microglia and astroglia, have over the years pointed out the dynamic and changing behavior of these cells, accompanied by different morphologies and activation forms. This is particularly evident in diseased conditions, where glia react to any shift from homeostasis, acquiring different phenotypes. Particularly for microglia, it has soon become clear that such phenotypes are multiple, as multiple are the functions related to them. Several approaches have over time revealed different facets of microglial phenotypic diversity, and advanced genetic analyses, in recent years, have added new insights into microglial heterogeneity, opening novel scenarios that researchers have just started to explore. Among neurodegenerative diseases, an important section is represented by alpha-synucleinopathies. Here alpha-synuclein accumulates abnormally in the brain and, depending on its pattern of distribution, leads to the development of different clinical conditions. Also for these proteinopathies, neuroinflammation and glial activation have been identified as constant and crucial factors during disease development. In the present review we will address the current literature about glial phenotypic changes with respect to alpha-synucleinopathies, as well as consider the pathophysiological and therapeutic implications of such a dynamic cellular behavior.</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: 17β-Estradiol Treatment Attenuates Neurogenesis Damage and Improves Behavior Performance After Ketamine Exposure in Neonatal Rats</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2019.00251</link>
	<content:encoded>Ketamine exposure in the developing brain disturbed normal neurogenesis and resulted in subsequent neurocognitive deficits. 17β-estradiol provides robust neuroprotection in a variety of brain injury models in animals of both sexes and attenuates neurodegeneration induced by anesthesia agents. In the present study, we investigated whether 17β-estradiol could attenuate disturbed neurogenesis and behavioural deficits induced by ketamine exposure in neonatal rats.
Sprague-Dawley rats at postnatal day (PND) 7 and neural stem cells (NSCs) were treated with either normal saline, ketamine, or 17β-estradiol prior/after ketamine exposure, respectively. The rats were decapitated at PND14 for detection of neurogenesis in the subventricular zone (SVZ) and subgranular zone (SGZ) of the hippocampus by immunostaining. NSC proliferation, neuronal differentiation, and apoptosis were assessed by immunohistochemistry and TUNEL, respectively. The protein expressions of caspase-3 in vivo and GSK-3β, p-GSK-3β in vitro were assessed by western blotting. Spatial learning and memory abilities were measured by the Morris water maze test at PND 42-47.
Ketamine exposure decreased cell proliferation in the SVZ and SGZ, inhibited NSC proliferation and neuronal differentiation, promoted NSC apoptosis and led to late cognitive deficits. Furthermore, ketamine increased caspase-3 expression in vivo and decreased protein expressions of p-GSK-3β in vitro. Treatment with 17β-estradiol attenuated ketamine-elicited changes both in vivo and in vitro.

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Hippocampal Sequences During Exploration: Mechanisms and Functions</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2019.00232</link>
	<content:encoded>Although the hippocampus plays a critical role in spatial and episodic memories, the mechanisms underlying memory formation, stabilization, and recall for adaptive behavior remain relatively unknown. During exploration, within single cycles of the ongoing theta rhythm that dominates hippocampal local field potentials, place cells form precisely ordered sequences of activity. These neural sequences result from the integration of both external inputs conveying sensory-motor information, and intrinsic network dynamics possibly related to memory processes. Their endogenous replay during subsequent sleep is critical for memory consolidation. The present review discusses possible mechanisms and functions of hippocampal theta sequences during exploration. We present several lines of evidence suggesting that these neural sequences play a key role in information processing and support the formation of initial memory traces, and discuss potential functional distinctions between neural sequences emerging during theta versus awake sharp-wave ripples.</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Involvement of microRNA-34a in Age-Related Susceptibility to Oxidative Stress in ARPE-19 Cells by Targeting the Silent Mating Type Information Regulation 2 Homolog 1/p66shc Pathway: Implications for Age-Related Macular Degeneration</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2019.00137</link>
	<content:encoded>The aging retinal pigment epithelium and oxidative stress, mediated by reactive oxygen species accumulation, have been implicated in the mechanisms of age-related macular degeneration (AMD). The expression level of the adapter protein p66shc, a key protein that regulates cellular oxidative stress, is relatively low under normal conditions because of the effects of silent mating type information regulation 2 homolog 1 (SIRT1) on the binding of fully deacetylated histone H3’ to the p66shc promoter region, thus inhibiting p66shc transcription and expression. The equilibrium between SIRT1 and p66shc is disrupted in the presence of various stresses, including AMD. As a major target gene, SIRT1 is regulated by microRNA-34a (miR-34a), and overexpression of miR-34a results in significant inhibition of post-transcriptional expression of SIRT1. Furthermore, our recent studies demonstrated that miR-34a is significantly upregulated, accompanied by reduced tolerance to oxidative stress in hydrogen peroxide-induced prematurely senescent ARPE-19 cells. Moreover, the expression of SIRT1 is decreased, whereas that of p66shc is increased in these cells. Accordingly, miR-34a may play a key role in age-related susceptibility to oxidative stress in ARPE-19 cells by targeting the SIRT1/p66shc pathway, leading to AMD. In this review, we discuss the functions of miR-34a in modulating the SIRT1/p66shc pathway in age-related conditions, including AMD.</content:encoded>

	<title>RSS PAP: A roadmap for understanding memory: Decomposing cognitive processes into operations and representations</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0122-19.2019v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Thanks to patients Phineas Gage and Henry Molaison, we have long known that behavioral control depends on the frontal lobes, whereas declarative memory depends on the medial temporal lobes (MTL). For decades, cognitive functions – behavioral control, declarative memory – have served as labels for characterizing the division of labor in cortex. This approach has made enormous contributions to understanding how the brain enables the mind, providing a systems-level explanation of brain function that constrains lower-level investigations of neural mechanism. Today, the approach has evolved such that functional labels are often applied to brain networks rather than focal brain regions. Furthermore, the labels have diversified to include both broadly-defined cognitive functions (declarative memory, visual perception) and more circumscribed mental processes (recollection, familiarity, priming). We ask whether a process – a high-level mental phenomenon corresponding to an introspectively-identifiable cognitive event – is the most productive label for dissecting memory. For example, recollection conflates a neurocomputational &lt;i&gt;operation&lt;/i&gt; (pattern completion-based retrieval) with a class of &lt;i&gt;representational content&lt;/i&gt; (associative, high-dimensional memories). Because a full theory of memory must identify operations and representations separately, and specify how they interact, we argue that processes like recollection constitute inadequate labels for characterizing neural mechanisms. Instead, we advocate considering the component operations and representations of processes like recollection in isolation. For the organization of memory, the evidence suggests that pattern completion is recapitulated widely across the ventral visual stream and MTL, but the division of labor between sites within this pathway can be explained by representational content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Accounts of cognition often assume that the brain is organized along lines of cognitive process, for example, with recollection mediated by one neural structure and familiarity by another. We argue that cognitive processes – introspectively-identifiable mental events like recollection – are inadequate labels for characterizing neural mechanisms, because they conflate lower-level components of the mechanisms we seek to identify. Recollection involves both a neurocomputational operation (pattern completion) and a neural representation (high-dimensional, associative content). To uncover memory's mechanisms, we must decompose memory processes into their operations and representations, asking how each contributes to mnemonic phenomena. Decomposing recollection suggests that, within the ventral visual pathway and MTL, different brain regions contribute to memory retrieval according to their representational content.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Spontaneous Recurrent Absence Seizure-like Events in Wild-Caught Rats</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/24/4829?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Absence epilepsy is a heritable human neurological disorder characterized by brief nonconvulsive seizures with behavioral arrest, moderate-to-severe loss of consciousness (absence), and distinct spike-wave discharges (SWDs) in the EEG and electrocorticogram (ECoG). Genetic models of this disorder have been created by selectively inbreeding rats for absence seizure-like events with similar electrical and behavioral characteristics. However, these events are also common in outbred laboratory rats, raising concerns about whether SWD/immobility accurately reflects absence epilepsy as opposed to &quot;normal&quot; rodent behavior. We hypothesized that, if SWD/immobility models absence seizures, it would not exist in wild-caught rats due to the pressures of natural selection. To test this hypothesis, we compared chronic video/electrocorticogram recordings from male and female wild-caught (Brown-Norway [BN]) rats to recordings from laboratory outbred BN, outbred Long–Evans, and inbred WAG/Rij rats (i.e., a model of absence epilepsy). Wild-caught BN rats displayed absence-like SWD/immobility events that were highly similar to outbred BN rats in terms of spike-wave morphology, frequency, diurnal rhythmicity, associated immobility, and sensitivity to the anti-absence drug, ethosuximide; however, SWD bursts were less frequent and of shorter duration in wild-caught and outbred BN rats than the outbred Long–Evans and inbred WAG/Rij strains. We conclude that SWD/immobility in rats does not represent absence seizures, although they appear to have many similarities. In wild rats, SWD/immobility appears to represent normal brain activity that does not reduce survival in natural environments, a conclusion that logically extends to outbred laboratory rats and possibly to those that have been inbred to model absence epilepsy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Spike-wave discharges (SWDs), behavioral arrest, and diminished consciousness are cardinal signs of seizures in human absence epilepsy and are used to model this disorder in inbred rats. These characteristics, however, are routinely found in outbred laboratory rats, leading to debate on whether SWD/immobility is a valid model of absence seizures. The SWD/immobility events in wild-caught rats appear equivalent to those found in outbred and inbred rat strains, except for lower incidence and shorter durations. Our results indicate that the electrophysiological and behavioral characteristics of events underlying hypothetical absence epilepsy in rodent models are found in wild rats captured in their natural environment. Other criteria beyond observation of SWDs and associated immobility are required to objectively establish absence epilepsy in rat models.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: AMPA Receptor Dysregulation and Therapeutic Interventions in a Mouse Model of CDKL5 Deficiency Disorder</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/24/4814?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Pathogenic mutations in cyclin-dependent kinase-like 5 (&lt;i&gt;CDKL5&lt;/i&gt;) result in CDKL5 deficiency disorder (CDD), a rare disease marked by early-life seizures, autistic behaviors, and intellectual disability. Although mouse models of CDD exhibit dendritic instability and alterations in synaptic scaffolding proteins, studies of glutamate receptor levels and function are limited. Here we used a novel mouse model of CDD, the &lt;i&gt;Cdkl5&lt;sup&gt;R59X&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt; knock-in mouse (R59X), to investigate changes in synaptic glutamate receptor subunits and functional consequences. Male mice were used for all experiments to avoid the confounding effects of X-inactivation that would be present in female heterozygous mice. We showed that adult male R59X mice recapitulated the behavioral outcomes observed in other mouse models of CDD, including social deficits and memory and learning impairments, and exhibited decreased latency to seizure upon pentylenetetrazol administration. Furthermore, we observed a specific increase in GluA2-lacking α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid)-type glutamate receptors (AMPARs) in the adult R59X hippocampus, which is accompanied electrophysiologically by increased rectification ratio of AMPAR EPSCs and elevated early-phase long term potentiation (LTP). Finally, we showed that acute treatment with the GluA2-lacking AMPAR blocker IEM-1460 decreased AMPAR currents, and rescued social deficits, working memory impairments, and seizure behavior latency in R59X mice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; CDKL5 deficiency disorder (CDD) is a rare disease marked by autistic-like behaviors, intellectual disability, and seizures. While synaptic dysfunction has been observed in mouse models of CDD, there is limited information on how synaptic alterations contribute to behavioral and functional changes in CDD. Here we reveal elevated hippocampal GluA2-lacking AMPAR expression in a novel mouse model of CDD that is accompanied by changes in synaptic AMPAR function and plasticity. We also show, for the first time, that acutely targeting GluA2-lacking AMPAR dysregulation rescues core synaptic and neurobehavioral deficits in CDD.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Modulators of Kv3 Potassium Channels Rescue the Auditory Function of Fragile X Mice</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/24/4797?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is characterized by hypersensitivity to sensory stimuli, including environmental sounds. We compared the auditory brainstem response (ABR) recorded &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; in mice lacking the gene (&lt;i&gt;Fmr1&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;–/&lt;i&gt;y&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;) for fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) with that in wild-type animals. We found that ABR wave I, which represents input from the auditory nerve, is reduced in &lt;i&gt;Fmr1&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;–/&lt;i&gt;y&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; animals, but only at high sound levels. In contrast, wave IV, which represents the activity of auditory brainstem nuclei is enhanced at all sound levels, suggesting that loss of FMRP alters the central processing of auditory signals. Current-clamp recordings of neurons in the medial nucleus of the trapezoid body in the auditory brainstem revealed that, in contrast to neurons from wild-type animals, sustained depolarization triggers repetitive firing rather than a single action potential. In voltage-clamp recordings, K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; currents that activate at positive potentials (&quot;high-threshold&quot; K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; currents), which are required for high-frequency firing and are carried primarily by Kv3.1 channels, are elevated in &lt;i&gt;Fmr1&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;–/&lt;i&gt;y&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; mice, while K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; currents that activate near the resting potential and inhibit repetitive firing are reduced. We therefore tested the effects of AUT2 [((4-({5-[(4R)-4-ethyl-2,5-dioxo-1-imidazolidinyl]-2-pyridinyl}oxy)-2-(1-methylethyl) benzonitrile], a compound that modulates Kv3.1 channels. AUT2 reduced the high-threshold K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; current and increased the low-threshold K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; currents in neurons from &lt;i&gt;Fmr1&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;–/&lt;i&gt;y&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; animals by shifting the activation of the high-threshold current to more negative potentials. This reduced the firing rate and, &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;, restored wave IV of the ABR. Our results from animals of both sexes suggest that the modulation of the Kv3.1 channel may have potential for the treatment of sensory hypersensitivity in patients with FXS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; mRNA encoding the Kv3.1 potassium channel was one of the first described targets of the fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP). Fragile X syndrome is caused by loss of FMRP and, in humans and mice, causes hypersensitivity to auditory stimuli. We found that components of the auditory brain response (ABR) corresponding to auditory brainstem activity are enhanced in mice lacking FMRP. This is accompanied by hyperexcitability and altered potassium currents in auditory brainstem neurons. Treatment with a drug that alters the voltage dependence of Kv3.1 channels normalizes the imbalance of potassium currents, as well as ABR responses &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;, suggesting that such compounds may be effective in treating some symptoms of fragile X syndrome.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Dopamine Depletion Affects Vocal Acoustics and Disrupts Sensorimotor Adaptation in Songbirds</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/6/3/ENEURO.0190-19.2019?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Dopamine is hypothesized to convey error information in reinforcement learning tasks with explicit appetitive or aversive cues. However, during motor skill learning feedback signals arise from an animal’s evaluation of sensory feedback resulting from its own behavior, rather than any external reward or punishment. It has previously been shown that intact dopaminergic signaling from the ventral tegmental area/substantia nigra pars compacta (VTA/SNc) complex is necessary for vocal learning when songbirds modify their vocalizations to avoid hearing distorted auditory feedback (playbacks of white noise). However, it remains unclear whether dopaminergic signaling underlies vocal learning in response to more naturalistic errors (pitch-shifted feedback delivered via headphones). We used male Bengalese finches (&lt;i&gt;Lonchura striata&lt;/i&gt; var. &lt;i&gt;domestica&lt;/i&gt;) to test the hypothesis that the necessity of dopamine signaling is shared between the two types of learning. We combined 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) lesions of dopaminergic terminals within Area X, a basal ganglia nucleus critical for song learning, with a headphones learning paradigm that shifted the pitch of auditory feedback and compared their learning to that of unlesioned controls. We found that 6-OHDA lesions affected song behavior in two ways. First, over a period of days lesioned birds systematically lowered their pitch regardless of the presence or absence of auditory errors. Second, 6-OHDA lesioned birds also displayed severe deficits in sensorimotor learning in response to pitch-shifted feedback. Our results suggest roles for dopamine in both motor production and auditory error processing, and a shared mechanism underlying vocal learning in response to both distorted and pitch-shifted auditory feedback.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Lovastatin, not Simvastatin, Corrects Core Phenotypes in the Fragile X Mouse Model</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/6/3/ENEURO.0097-19.2019?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The cholesterol-lowering drug lovastatin corrects neurological phenotypes in animal models of fragile X syndrome (FX), a commonly identified genetic cause of autism and intellectual disability (ID). The therapeutic efficacy of lovastatin is being tested in clinical trials for FX; however, the structurally similar drug simvastatin has been proposed as an alternative due to an increased potency and brain penetrance. Here, we perform a side-by-side comparison of the effects of lovastatin and simvastatin treatment on two core phenotypes in &lt;i&gt;Fmr1&lt;sup&gt;-/y&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt; mice versus WT littermates: excessive hippocampal protein synthesis and susceptibility to audiogenic seizures (AGSs). We find that simvastatin does not correct excessive hippocampal protein synthesis in the &lt;i&gt;Fmr1&lt;sup&gt;-/y&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt; hippocampus at any dose tested. In fact, simvastatin significantly increases protein synthesis in both &lt;i&gt;Fmr1&lt;sup&gt;-/y&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt; and WT. Moreover, injection of simvastatin does not reduce AGS in the &lt;i&gt;Fmr1&lt;sup&gt;-/y&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt; mouse, while lovastatin significantly reduces AGS incidence and severity versus vehicle-treated animals. These results show that unlike lovastatin, simvastatin does not correct core phenotypes in the &lt;i&gt;Fmr1&lt;sup&gt;-/y&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt; mouse model.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: The NeuroD6 Subtype of VTA Neurons Contributes to Psychostimulant Sensitization and Behavioral Reinforcement</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/6/3/ENEURO.0066-19.2019?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Reward-related behavior is complex and its dysfunction correlated with neuropsychiatric illness. Dopamine (DA) neurons of the ventral tegmental area (VTA) have long been associated with different aspects of reward function, but it remains to be disentangled how distinct VTA DA neurons contribute to the full range of behaviors ascribed to the VTA. Here, a recently identified subtype of VTA neurons molecularly defined by NeuroD6 (NEX1M) was addressed. Among all VTA DA neurons, less than 15% were identified as positive for NeuroD6. In addition to dopaminergic markers, sparse NeuroD6 neurons expressed the vesicular glutamate transporter 2 (&lt;i&gt;Vglut2&lt;/i&gt;) gene. To achieve manipulation of NeuroD6 VTA neurons, NeuroD6(NEX)-Cre-driven mouse genetics and optogenetics were implemented. First, expression of vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2) was ablated to disrupt dopaminergic function in NeuroD6 VTA neurons. Comparing &lt;i&gt;Vmat2&lt;sup&gt;lox/lox;NEX-Cre&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt; conditional knock-out (cKO) mice with littermate controls, it was evident that baseline locomotion, preference for sugar and ethanol, and place preference upon amphetamine-induced and cocaine-induced conditioning were similar between genotypes. However, locomotion upon repeated psychostimulant administration was significantly elevated above control levels in cKO mice. Second, optogenetic activation of NEX-Cre VTA neurons was shown to induce DA release and glutamatergic postsynaptic currents within the nucleus accumbens. Third, optogenetic stimulation of NEX-Cre VTA neurons &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; induced significant place preference behavior, while stimulation of VTA neurons defined by Calretinin failed to cause a similar response. The results show that NeuroD6 VTA neurons exert distinct regulation over specific aspects of reward-related behavior, findings that contribute to the current understanding of VTA neurocircuitry.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/6/3/ENEURO.0048-19.2019?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;The major inhibitory interneurons in olfactory bulb (OB) glomeruli are periglomerular cells (PGCs) and short axon cells (SACs). PGCs and SACs provide feedforward inhibition to all classes of projection neurons, but inhibition between PGCs and SACs is not well understood. We crossed Cre and GFP transgenic mice and used virally-delivered optogenetic constructs to selectively activate either SACs or GAD65cre-ChR2-positive PGCs while recording from identified GAD65cre-ChR2-positive PGCs or SACs, respectively, to investigate inhibitory interactions between these two interneuron types. We show that GAD65cre-ChR2-positive PGCs robustly inhibit SACs and SACs strongly inhibit PGCs. SACs form the interglomerular circuit, which inhibits PGCs in distant glomeruli. Activation of GAD65cre-ChR2-positive PGCs monosynaptically inhibit mitral cells (MCs), which complements recent findings that SACs directly inhibit MCs. Thus, both classes of glomerular inhibitory neurons inhibit each other, as well as OB output neurons. We further show that olfactory nerve input to one glomerulus engages the interglomerular circuit and inhibits PGCs in distant glomeruli. Sensory activation of the interglomerular circuit directly inhibits output neurons in other glomeruli and by inhibiting intraglomerular PGCs, may potentially disinhibit output neurons in other glomeruli. The nature and context of odorant stimuli may determine whether inhibition or excitation prevails so that odors are represented in part by patterns of active and inactive glomeruli.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Critical Analysis of Particle Detection Artifacts in Synaptosome Flow Cytometry</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/6/3/ENEURO.0009-19.2019?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Flow cytometry and fluorescence-activated sorting are powerful techniques that hold great promise for studying heterogeneous populations of submicron particles such as synaptosomes, but many technical challenges arise in these experiments. To date, most flow cytometry studies of synaptosomes have relied on particle detection using forward scatter (FSC) measurements and size estimation with polystyrene (PS) bead standards. However, these practices have serious limitations, and special care must be taken to overcome the poor sensitivity of conventional flow cytometers in the analysis of submicron particles. Technical artifacts can confound these experiments, especially the detection of multiple particles as a single event. Here, we compared analysis of P2 crude synaptosomal preparations from murine forebrain on multiple flow cytometers using both FSC-triggered and fluorescence-triggered detection. We implemented multicolor fluorescent dye-based assays to quantify coincident particle detection and aggregation, and we assessed the false colocalization of antigens in immunostaining analyses. Our results demonstrate that fluorescence triggering and proper dilution can control for coincident particle detection, but not particle aggregation. We confirmed previous studies showing that FSC-based size estimation with PS beads underestimates biological particle size, and we identified pervasive aggregation in the FSC range analyzed in most synaptosome flow cytometry studies. We found that analyzing P2 samples in sucrose/EDTA/tris (SET) buffer reduces aggregation compared to PBS, but does not completely eliminate the presence of aggregates, especially in immunostaining experiments. Our study highlights challenges and pitfalls in synaptosome flow cytometry and provides a methodological framework for future studies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Accelerated Age-Related Degradation of the Tectorial Membrane in the Ceacam16βgal/βgal Null Mutant Mouse, a Model for Late-Onset Human Hereditary Deafness DFNB113</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2019.00147</link>
	<content:encoded>CEACAM16 is a non-collagenous protein of the tectorial membrane, an extracellular structure of the cochlea essential for normal hearing. Dominant and recessive mutations in CEACAM16 have been reported to cause postlingual and progressive forms of deafness in humans. In a previous study of young Ceacam16 βgal/βgal null mutant mice on a C57Bl/6J background, the incidence of spontaneous otoacoustic emissions (SOAEs) was greatly increased relative to Ceacam16+/+ and Ceacam16+/βgal mice, but auditory brain-stem responses (ABRs) and distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs) were near normal, indicating auditory thresholds were not significantly affected. To determine if the loss of CEACAM16 leads to hearing loss at later ages in this mouse line, cochlear structure and auditory function were examined in Ceacam16+/+, Ceacam16+/βgal and Ceacam16βgal/βgal mice at 6 and 12 months of age and compared to that previously described at 1 month.  Analysis of older Ceacam16βgal/βgal mice reveals a progressive loss of matrix from the core of the tectorial membrane that is more extensive in the apical, low-frequency regions of the cochlea. In Ceacam16βgal/βgal mice at 6-7 months, the DPOAE magnitude at 2f1-f2 and the incidence of SOAEs both decrease relative to young animals. By ~12 months, SOAEs and DPOAEs are not detected in Ceacam16βgal/βgal mice and ABR thresholds are increased by up to ~40 dB across frequency, despite a complement of hair cells similar to that present in Ceacam16+/+ mice. Although SOAE incidence decreases with age in Ceacam16βgal/βgal mice, it increases in ageing heterozygous Ceacam16+/βgal mice and is accompanied by a reduction in the accumulation of CEACAM16 in the tectorial membrane relative to controls. An apically-biased loss of matrix from the core of the tectorial membrane, similar to that observed in young Ceacam16βgal/βgal mice, is also seen in Ceacam16+/+ and Ceacam16+/βgal  mice, and other strains of wild-type mice, but at much later ages. The loss of Ceacam16 therefore accelerates age-related degeneration of the tectorial membrane leading, as in humans with mutations in CEACAM16, to a late-onset progressive form of hearing loss.</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Elevated Serum SIRT 2 May Differentiate Parkinson’s Disease From Atypical Parkinsonian Syndromes</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2019.00129</link>
	<content:encoded>Atypical Parkinson Syndromes (APSs) often have symptoms that overlap with those of Parkinson's disease (PD), especially in early in disease, making these disorders difficult to diagnose. Previous studies have demonstrated association of oligomeric α-synuclein (α-Syn), a key element in the pathogenesis of PD, with Sirtuin (SIRT)2 proteins for modulating PD. We aimed to evaluate SIRT proteins expression in serum of PD patients and compare it with APSs and normal elderly control (GC); and correlate with α-Syn. SIRT proteins expression was evaluated in sera of 68 PD; 34 APS and 68 GC without any neuro-psychiatric illness as controls by Surface Plasmon Resonance. SIRT2 expression was correlated with α-Syn in PD and GC. Significant (p&amp;lt;0.0001) differences were observed between serum SIRT2 concentration in PD and APS and GC; and between APS and GC. ROC analysis revealed the strong cut off value to differentiate PD from APS and GC and also APS from GC. Significant correlation was observed among SIRT2 levels in early PD patients with UPDRS, H and Y and increase duration of disease. In addition, a strong positive correlation of SIRT2 with α-Syn (p&amp;lt;0.0001) was observed. However, no such difference was detected for serum SIRT1 in cases of PD and APS; and GC. The present study is the first to report elevated serum SIRT2 in PD. The study also provided a simple test to distinguish PD from APS and may have translational utility for diagnosis.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00612</link>
	<content:encoded>Background: Short-latency intracortical inhibition (SICI) and motor surround inhibition (mSI) are cortical phenomena that have been investigated with Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS). mSI is believed to be necessary for the execution of fine finger movements, and SICI may participate in mSI genesis, however, the mechanisms underlying both mSI and SICI are not entirely clear. Objective: We explored the cortical physiology of SICI and mSI in healthy subjects by TMS-evoked cortical potentials (TEPs). Methods: Single (sp) and paired-pulse (pp) TMS were delivered on the ADM muscle cortical hotspot while recording EEG and EMG. Three conditions were tested: spTMS and ppTMS at rest, and spTMS at the onset of an index finger movement. SICI and mSI were calculated on the ADM motor evoked potential (MEP) and two groups were defined based on the presence of mSI. Average TEPs were calculated for each condition and for five regions of interest. Results: At movement onset we observed a widespread reduction of the inhibitory late component N100 suggesting cortical facilitation associated with motor performance. At motor cortex level, SICI and mSI are associated with similar modulation of TEPs consisting in a reduction of P30 and an increase of N45 amplitude. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that SICI and mSI modulate cortical excitability with shared inhibitory mechanisms.</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Neurodegeneration section | New and Recent Articles: Canine Cognitive Dysfunction and Alzheimer’s Disease – Two Facets of the Same Disease?</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00604</link>
	<content:encoded>Neurodegenerative diseases present a major and increasing burden in the societies worldwide. With aging populations, the prevalence of neurodegenerative diseases is increasing, yet there are no effective cures and very few treatment options are available. Alzheimer’s disease is one of the most prevalent neurodegenerative conditions and although the pathology is well studied, the pathogenesis of this debilitating illness is still poorly understood. This is, among other reasons, also due to the lack of good animal models as laboratory rodents do not develop spontaneous neurodegenerative diseases and human Alzheimer’s disease is only partially mimicked by transgenic rodent models. On the other hand, older dogs commonly develop canine cognitive dysfunction, a disease that is similar to Alzheimer’s disease in many aspects. Dogs show cognitive deficits that could be paralleled to human symptoms such as disorientation, memory loss, changes in behavior, and in their brains, beta amyloid plaques are commonly detected both in extracellular space as senile plaques and around the blood vessels. Dogs could be therefore potentially a very good model for studying pathological process and novel treatment options for Alzheimer’s disease. In the present article, we will review the current knowledge about the pathogenesis of canine cognitive dysfunction, its similarities and dissimilarities with Alzheimer’s disease, and developments of novel treatments for these two diseases with a focus on canine cognitive dysfunction.</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Neurodegeneration section | New and Recent Articles: Classification of Multiple Sclerosis Clinical Profiles via Graph Convolutional Neural Networks</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00594</link>
	<content:encoded>Recent advances in image acquisition and processing techniques, along with the success of novel deep learning architectures, have given the opportunity to develop innovative algorithms capable to provide a better characterization of neurological related diseases. In this work, we introduce a neural network based approach to classify Multiple Sclerosis (MS) patients into four clinical profiles. Starting from their structural connectivity information, obtained by diffusion tensor imaging and represented as a graph, we evaluate the classification performances using unweighted and weighted connectivity matrices. Furthermore, we investigate the role of graph- based features for a better characterization and classification of the pathology. 90 MS patients (12 clinically isolated syndrome, 30 relapsing-remitting, 28 secondary-progressive, and 20 primary- progressive) along with 24 healthy controls, were considered in this study. This work shows the great performances achieved by neural networks methods in the classification of the clinical profiles. Furthermore, it shows local graph metrics do not improve the classification results suggesting that the latent features created by the neural network in its layers have a much important informative content. Finally, we observe that graph weights representation of brain connections preserve important information to discriminate between clinical forms.</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroinformatics | New and Recent Articles: Using the Wild Bootstrap to Quantify Uncertainty in Mean Apparent Propagator MRI</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fninf.2019.00043</link>
	<content:encoded>Purpose: Estimation of uncertainty of MAP-MRI metrics
is an important topic, for several reasons. Bootstrap derived
uncertainty, such as the standard deviation, provides
valuable information, and can be incorporated in MAP-MRI
studies to provide more extensive insight.

Methods: In this paper, the uncertainty of different MAPMRI
metrics was quantified by estimating the empirical distributions
using the wild bootstrap. We applied the wild
bootstrap to both phantom data and human brain data, and
obtain empirical distributions for theMAP-MRImetrics returnto-
origin probability (RTOP), non-Gaussianity (NG) and propagator
anisotropy (PA).

Results: We demonstrated the impact of diffusion acquisition
scheme (number of shells and number of measurements
per shell) on the uncertainty of MAP-MRI metrics.
We demonstrated how the uncertainty of these metrics can
be used to improve group analyses, and to compare different
preprocessing pipelines. We demonstrated that with
uncertainty considered, the results for a group analysis can
be different.

Conclusion: Bootstrap derived uncertain measures provide
additional information to the MAP-MRI derived metrics, and
should be incorporated in ongoing and future MAP-MRI
studies to provide more extensive insight.</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Disparities in Diffuse Cortical White Matter Integrity Between Socioeconomic Groups</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2019.00198</link>
	<content:encoded>There is a growing literature demonstrating a link between lower socioeconomic status (SES) and poorer neuroanatomical health, such as smaller total and regional gray and white matter volumes, as well as greater white matter lesion volumes. Little is known, however, about the relation between SES and white matter integrity. Here we examined the relation between SES and white matter integrity of the brain’s primary cortical regions, and evaluated potential moderating influences of age and self-identified race. Participants were 192 neurologically intact, community-dwelling African American and White adults (mean age = 52 years; 44% male, 60% White, low SES = 52%) from the Healthy Aging in Neighborhoods of Diversity across the Life Span (HANDLS) SCAN study. Participants underwent 3.0-T cranial magnetic resonance imaging. Diffusion tensor imaging was used to estimate regional fractional anisotropy (FA) to quantify the brain’s white matter integrity and trace to capture diffusivity. Multiple regression analyses examined independent and interactive associations of SES, age, and race with FA of the frontal, temporal, parietal, and occipital lobes bilaterally. Sensitivity analyses assessed the influence of several biopsychosocial risk factors on these associations. Exploratory analyses examined these relations with trace and using additional SES indicators. Results indicated there were no significant interactions of SES, age, and race for any region. Individuals with low SES had lower FA in all regions, and higher trace in the right and left frontal, right and left temporal, and left occipital lobes. Findings remained largely unchanged after inclusion of sensitivity variables. Older age was associated with lower FA and greater trace for all regions, except for the right temporal lobe with FA. No main effects were found for race in FA, and Whites had higher trace values in the parietal lobes. Novel findings of this study indicate that relative to the high SES group, low SES was associated with poorer white matter integrity and greater diffusivity. These results may, in part, reflect exposures to various biopsychosocial risk factors experienced by those of lower SES across the lifespan, and may help explain the preponderance of cognitive and functional disparities between socioeconomic groups.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2019.00180</link>
	<content:encoded>Verbal Working memory (vWM) capacity measures the ability to maintain and manipulate verbal information for a short period of time. The specific neural correlates of this construct are still a matter of debate. The aim of this study was to conduct a coordinate-based meta-analysis of 42 fMRI studies on visual vWM in healthy subjects (n=795, males=459, females=325, unknown=11; age range: 18-75). The studies were obtained after an exhaustive literature search on PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Brainmap database. We analyzed regional activation differences during fMRI tasks with the anisotropic effect-size version of seed-based d mapping software (ES-SDM). The results were further validated by performing jackknife sensitivity analyses and heterogeneity analyses. We investigated the effect of numerous relevant influencing factors by fitting corresponding linear regression models. We isolated consistent activation in a network containing fronto-parietal areas, right cerebellum, and basal ganglia structures. Regarding lateralization, the results pointed towards a bilateral frontal activation, a left-lateralization of parietal regions and a right-lateralization of the cerebellum, indicating that the left-hemisphere concept of vWM should be reconsidered. We also isolated activation in regions important for response inhibition, emphasizing the role of attentional control in vWM. Moreover, we found a significant influence of mean reaction time, load and age on activation associated with vWM. Activation in left medial frontal gyrus, left precentral gyrus and left precentral gyrus turned out to be positively associated with mean reaction time whereas load was associated with activation across the PFC, fusiform gyrus, parietal cortex and parts of the cerebellum. In the latter case activation was mainly detectable in both hemispheres whereas the influence of age became manifest predominantly in the left hemisphere. This led us to conclude that future vWM studies should take these factors into consideration.</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: The Human Default Consciousness and Its Disruption: Insights From an EEG Study of Buddhist Jhāna Meditation</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2019.00178</link>
	<content:encoded>The “neural correlates of consciousness” (NCC) is a familiar topic in neuroscience, overlapping with research on the brain’s “default mode network”. Task-based studies of NCC by their nature recruit one part of the cortical network to study another, and are therefore both limited and compromised in what they can reveal about consciousness itself. The form of consciousness explored in such research, we term the human default consciousness (DCs), our everyday waking consciousness. In contrast, studies of anaesthesia, coma, deep sleep, or some extreme pathological states such as epilepsy, reveal very different cortical activity; all of which states are essentially involuntary, and generally regarded as “unconscious”. An exception to involuntary disruption of consciousness is Buddhist jhāna meditation, whose implicit aim is to intentionally withdraw from the default consciousness, to an inward-directed state of stillness referred to as jhāna consciousness, as a basis to develop insight. The default consciousness is sensorily-based, where information about, and our experience of, the outer world is evaluated against personal and organic needs and forms the basis of our ongoing self-experience. This view conforms both to Buddhist models, and to the emerging work on active inference and minimisation of free energy in determining the network balance of the human default consciousness. 

This paper is a preliminary report on the first detailed EEG study of jhāna meditation, with findings radically different to studies of more familiar, less focused forms of meditation. While remaining highly alert and “present” in their subjective experience, a high proportion of subjects display “spindle” activity in their EEG, superficially similar to sleep spindles of stage 2 nREM sleep, while more-experienced subjects display high voltage slow-waves reminiscent, but significantly different, to the slow waves of deeper stage 4 nREM sleep, or even high-voltage delta coma. Some others show brief posterior spike-wave bursts, again similar, but with significant differences, to absence epilepsy. Some subjects also develop the ability to consciously evoke clonic seizure-like activity at will, under full control. We suggest that the remarkable nature of these observations reflects a profound disruption of the human DCs when the personal element is progressively withdrawn.</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: EEG Microstates Analysis in Young Adults With Autism Spectrum Disorder During Resting-State</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2019.00173</link>
	<content:encoded>Electroencephalography (EEG) is a useful tool to inspect the brain activity in resting-state and allows to characterize spontaneous brain activity that is not detected when a subject is cognitively engaged. Moreover, taking advantage of the high time resolution in EEG, it is possible to perform fast topographical reference-free analysis, since different scalp potential fields correspond to changes in the underlying sources within the brain. 
In this study, the spontaneous EEG resting-state (eyes closed) was compared between ten young adults ages 18-30 years with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and thirteen neurotypical controls. A microstate analysis was applied, focusing on four temporal parameters: mean duration, the frequency of occurrence, the ratio of time coverage, and the Global Explained Variance (GEV).
Using data that were acquired from a 65 channel EEG system, six resting-state topographies that best describe the dataset across all subjects were identified by running a two-step cluster analysis, labeled as microstate classes A-F. The results indicated that microstates B and E displayed a statistically significant differences between both groups among the temporal parameters evaluated. Classes B, D, E, and F were consistently more present in ASD, and class C in controls. The combination of these findings with the putative functional significance of the different classes suggests that during resting-state, the ASD group was more focused on visual scene-reconstruction, while the control group was more engaged with self-memory retrieval. Furthermore, from a connectivity perspective, the resting-state networks that have been previously associated with each microstate class overlap the brain regions implicated in impaired social communication and repetitive behaviors that characterize ASD.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2019.00037</link>
	<content:encoded>Event-related fMRI have been widely used in locating brain regions that respond to specific tasks. However, activities of brain regions which modulate or indirectly participate in the response to a specific task are not event-related. Event-related fMRI can’t locate these regulatory regions, detrimental to the integrity of the result that event-related fMRI revealed. Direct-current EEG shifts (DC shifts) have been found linked to the inner brain activity, a fusion DC shifts-fMRI method may have the ability to reveal a more complete response of the brain. In this study, we used DC shifts-fMRI to verify that even when responding to a very simple task, 1). The response of the brain is complicated than event-related fMRI generally revealed; 2). DC shifts-fMRI have the ability of revealing brain regions whose responses are not in event-related way. We used a classical and simple paradigm which is often used in auditory cortex tonotopic mapping. Data were recorded from 50 subjects (25 male, 25 female) who were presented with randomly presented pure tone sequences with six different frequencies (200, 400, 800, 1600, 3200, 6400 Hz). Our traditional fMRI results are consistent with previous findings that the activations are concentrate on the auditory cortex. Our DC shifts-fMRI results showed that the cingulate-caudate-thalamus network which underpins sustained attention is positively activated while the dorsal attention network and the right middle frontal gyrus which underpin attention orientation are negatively activated. The regional-specific correlations between DC shifts and brain networks indicate the complexity of the response of the brain even to a simple task and that the DC shifts can effectively reflect these non-event-related inner brain activities.</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Acetylcholine Release Inhibits Distinct Excitatory Inputs Onto Hippocampal CA1 Pyramidal Neurons via Different Cellular and Network Mechanisms</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2019.00267</link>
	<content:encoded>In hippocampal CA1, muscarinic acetylcholine (ACh) receptor (mAChR) activation via exogenous application of cholinergic agonists has been shown to presynaptically inhibit Schaffer collateral (SC) glutamatergic inputs in stratum radiatum (SR), and temporoammonic (TA) and thalamic nucleus reuniens (RE) glutamatergic inputs in stratum lacunosum-moleculare (SLM). However, steady-state uniform mAChR activation may not mimic the effect of ACh release in an intact hippocampal network. To more accurately examine the effect of ACh release on glutamatergic synaptic efficacy, we measured electrically evoked synaptic responses in CA1 pyramidal cells (PCs) following the optogenetic release of ACh in genetically modified mouse brain slices. The ratio of synaptic amplitudes in response to paired-pulse SR stimulation (stimulus 2/stimulus 1) was significantly reduced by the optogenetic release of ACh, consistent with a postsynaptic decrease in synaptic efficacy. The effect of ACh release was blocked by the M3 receptor antagonist 4-DAMP, the GABAB receptor antagonist CGP 52432, inclusion of GDP-β-S, cesium, QX314 in the intracellular patch clamp solution, or extracellular barium. These observations suggest that ACh release decreased SC synaptic transmission through an M3 muscarinic receptor-mediated increase in inhibitory interneuron excitability, which activate GABAB receptors and inwardly rectifying potassium channels on CA1 pyramidal cells. In contrast, the ratio of synaptic amplitudes in response to paired-pulse stimulation in the SLM was increased by ACh release, consistent with presynaptic inhibition. ACh-mediated effects in SLM were blocked by the M2 receptor antagonist AF-DX 116, presumably located on presynaptic terminals. Therefore, our data indicate that ACh release differentially modulates excitatory inputs in SR and SLM of CA1 through different cellular and network mechanisms.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2019.00266</link>
	<content:encoded>Primary cilia dysfunction has been associated with hyperphagia and obesity in both ciliopathy patients and mouse models of cilia perturbation. Neurons throughout the brain possess these solitary cellular appendages, including in the feeding centers of the hypothalamus. Several cell biology questions associated with primary neuronal cilia signaling are challenging to address in vivo. Here we utilize primary hypothalamic neuronal cultures to study ciliary signaling in relevant cell types. Importantly, these cultures contain neuronal populations critical for appetite and satiety such as pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) and agouti related peptide (AgRP) expressing neurons and are thus useful for studying signaling involved in feeding behavior. Correspondingly, these cultured neurons also display electrophysiological activity and respond to both local and peripheral signals that act on the hypothalamus to influence feeding behaviors, such as leptin and melanin concentrating hormone (MCH). Interestingly, we found that cilia mediated hedgehog signaling, generally associated with developmental processes, can influence ciliary GPCR signaling (Mchr1) in terminally differentiated neurons. Specifically, pharmacological activation of the hedgehog-signaling pathway using the smoothened agonist, SAG, attenuated the ability of neurons to respond to ligands (MCH) of ciliary GPCRs. Understanding how the hedgehog pathway influences cilia GPCR signaling in terminally differentiated neurons could reveal the molecular mechanisms associated with clinical features of ciliopathies, such as hyperphagia-associated obesity.</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Synaptic FUS Localization During Motoneuron Development and Its Accumulation in Human ALS Synapses</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2019.00256</link>
	<content:encoded>Mutations in the Fused in Sarcoma (FUS) gene induce cytoplasmic FUS aggregations, contributing to the neurodegenerative disease amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) in certain cases. While FUS is mainly a nuclear protein involved in transcriptional processes with limited cytoplasmatic functions, it shows an additional somatodendritic localization in neurons. In this study we analyzed the localization of FUS in motoneuron synapses, these being the most affected neurons in ALS, using super-resolution microscopy to distinguish between the pre- and postsynaptic compartments. We report a maturation based variation of FUS localization in rodent synapses where a predominantly postsynaptic FUS was observed in the early stages of synaptic development, while in mature synapses the protein was entirely localized in the axonal terminal. Likewise, we also show that at the synapse of human motoneurons derived from induced pluripotent stem cells of a healthy control, FUS is mainly postsynaptic in the early developmental stages. In motoneurons derived from ALS patients harboring a very aggressive juvenile FUS mutation, increased synaptic accumulation of mutated FUS was observed. Moreover increased aggregation of other synaptic proteins Bassoon and Homer1 was also detected in these abnormal synapses. Having demonstrated changes in the FUS localization during synaptogenesis, a role of synaptic FUS in both dendritic and axonal cellular compartments is probable, and we propose a gain-of-toxic-function due to the synaptic aggregation of mutant FUS in ALS.</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Co-transplantation of Epidermal Neural Crest Stem Cells and Olfactory Ensheathing Cells Repairs Sciatic Nerve Defects in Rats</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2019.00253</link>
	<content:encoded>Cell-based therapy is an alternative strategy to improve outcomes of peripheral nerve injury (PNI). Epidermal neural crest stem cell (EPI-NCSC) is obtained from autologous tissue without immunological rejection, which could expand quickly in vitro and is suitable candidate for cell-based therapy. Olfactory ensheathing cell (OEC) could secrete multiple neurotrophic factors, which is often used to repair PNI individually. However, whether the combination of EPI-NCSC and OEC have better effects on PNI repair remains unclear. Here we use EPI-NCSC and OEC co-transplantation in a rat sciatic nerve defect model to ascertain the effects and potential mechanisms of cells co-transplantation on PNI. The effect of EPI-NCSC and OEC co-transplantation on PNI is assessed by using a combination of immunohistochemistry (IHC), electrophysiological recording and neural function test. Co-transplantation of EPI-NCSC and OEC exerts a beneficial effect upon PNI such as better organized structure, nerve function recovery, and lower motoneuron apoptosis. IHC and ELISA further demonstrate that cells co-transplantation may improve PNI via the expression of BDNF and NGF up-regulated by EPI-NCSC and OEC synergistically. Eventually, the results from this study reveal that EPI-NCSC and OEC co-transplantation effectively repairs PNI through enhancing the level of BDNF and NGF, indicating that cells co-transplantation may serve as a fruitful avenue for PNI in clinic treatment.</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Activated PPARγ Abrogates Misprocessing of Amyloid Precursor Protein, Tau Missorting and Synaptotoxicity</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2019.00239</link>
	<content:encoded>Type 2 diabetes increases the risk for dementia, including Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Pioglitazone (Pio), a pharmacological agonist of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ), improves insulin sensitivity and has been suggested to have potential in the management of AD symptoms, albeit through mostly unknown mechanisms. We here investigated the potential of Pio to counter synaptic malfunction and loss, a characteristic of AD pathology and its accompanying cognitive deficits. Results from experiments on primary mouse neuronal cultures and a human neural cell line (SH-SY5Y) show that Pio treatment attenuates amyloid β (Aβ)-triggered the pathological (mis-)processing of amyloid precursor protein (APP) and inhibits Aβ-induced accumulation and hyperphosphorylation of Tau. These events are accompanied by increased glutamatergic receptor 2B subunit (GluN2B) levels that are causally linked with neuronal death. Further, Pio treatment blocks Aβ-triggered missorting of hyperphosphorylated Tau to synapses and the subsequent loss of PSD95-positive synapses. These latter effects of Pio are PPARγ-mediated since they are blocked in the presence of GW9662, a selective PPARγ inhibitor. Collectively, these data show that activated PPARγ buffer neurons against APP misprocessing, Tau hyperphosphorylation and its missorting to synapses and subsequently, synaptic loss. These first insights into the mechanisms through which PPARγ influences synaptic loss make a case for further exploration of the potential usefulness of PPARγ agonists in the prevention and treatment of synaptic pathology in AD.</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Mental Flexibility Influences the Association Between Poor Balance and Falls in Older People – A Secondary Analysis</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2019.00133</link>
	<content:encoded>Impairments of balance predispose older people to falls. Some cognitive functions, especially executive functioning have been shown to affect balance and discriminate fallers from non-fallers. Mental flexibility is a component of the executive function and comprises multiple cognitive processes that work together to adjust the course of thoughts or actions according to the changing demands of a situation without the use of explicit instructions. However, the role of mental flexibility in balance in older people remains unclear. Mental flexibility comprises complementary cognitive functions required for dealing with unpredictable environmental demands. The study aim was to examine the relationship between mental flexibility and falls in a cohort of 212 older people (80.6 ±4.9 years; 62% female). We hypothesized that: (i) participants with impaired balance would have worse mental flexibility compared to those with good balance; and (ii) poor mental flexibility would predict falls in the sub-group with impaired balance. Balance performance was assessed by measuring postural sway while standing on a medium density foam mat with eyes open for 30 seconds. Mental flexibility was assessed using a computerized short-form of the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST; 64 cards) with its sub-components comprising general performance, perseveration, failure-to-maintain set and conceptual ability. Falls were measured prospectively for 12-months using monthly calendars. MANCOVA revealed that WCST performance was associated with balance (Wilks’ Lambda = 0.883, F=2.168; p=0.013, partial eta squared (η2p) =.061) due primarily to reduced concept formation ability (F2,207=5.787, p=0.004, η2p =.053). Negative binomial regression analysis adjusting for age, education, contrast sensitivity, proprioception, inhibition and inhibitory choice stepping reaction time revealed that lower concept formation ability was predictive for falls (Incidence Rate Ratio 1.0648 (95% confidence interval 1.0316-1.08199)). Further, lower concept formation ability partly explained the association between balance and falls: i.e. fallers in the upper balance tertile had reduced concept formation performance whereas non-fallers had similar concept formation performance across the three balance tertiles. These findings suggest that poor mental flexibility affects the ability to maintain steady balance contributing to increased risk of falls in older people.</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Insulin Resistance Is a Risk Factor for Overall Cerebral Small Vessel Disease Burden in Old Nondiabetic Healthy Adult Population</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2019.00127</link>
	<content:encoded>Background and Purpose：This study aimed to investigate whether insulin resistance (IR) was associated with overall cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD) burden, independent of other clinical risk factors in old nondiabetic healthy subjects.
Methods: We recruited old nondiabetic healthy subjects with no taking any medications prospectively. The overall effect of CSVD on the brain was described by validated CSVD score. The homeostasis model assessment–estimated insulin resistance index(HOMA-IR) was used for IR estimation, and HOMA-IR ≥2.80 was defined as IR. We evaluated the association between IR and increasing severity of CSVD score by ordinal regression models, adjusted for demographics and cardiovascular risk factors.
Results: Our study included 156 healthy participants. 34 showed IR, 122 showed non-IR. The mean age of the IR group was older than non-IR group(70.03± 7.30 versus 67.45 ±5.92, p=0.04), and the ratio of hypertension in IR was higher than non-IR.( 53.28% versus 82.35%, p&amp;lt;0.01). The distribution of lacunar, CMB, EPVS and CSVD score was different between 2 groups, but the WMH. In ordinal regression analysis, IR was positively associated with increasing severity of the total CSVD score (adjusted odds ratio 3.74, 95%CI was 1.63-5.08, and p&amp;lt;0.01 ) after adjusting for traditional risk factors. Furthermore, HOMA-IR levels revealed a positive dose-dependent correlation with the total CSVD score(p &amp;lt;0.01, p for trend &amp;lt;0.01).
Conclusions: IR was independently associated with  increasing severity of overall CSVD burden, independent of other clinical risk factors in nondiabetic healthy adult population. Furthermore, HOMA-IR level is correlated with CSVD burden in a dose-dependent manner.</content:encoded>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Apamin Improves Prefrontal Nicotinic Impairment in Mouse Model of Alzheimer’s Disease</title>

	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Disruption of attention is an early and disabling symptom of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). The underlying cellular mechanisms are poorly understood and treatment options for patients are limited. These early attention deficits are evident in the TgCRND8 mouse, a well-established murine model of AD that recapitulates several features of the disease. Here, we report severe impairment of the nicotinic receptor–mediated excitation of prefrontal attentional circuitry in TgCRND8 mice relative to wild-type littermate controls. We demonstrate that this impairment can be remedied by apamin, a bee venom neurotoxin peptide that acts as a selective antagonist to the SK family of calcium-sensitive potassium channels. We probe this seeming upregulation of calcium-sensitive inhibition and find that the attenuated nicotinic firing rates in TgCRND8 attention circuits are mediated neither by greater cellular calcium signals nor by elevated SK channel expression. Instead, we find that TgCRND8 mice show enhanced functional coupling of nicotinic calcium signals to inhibition. This SK-mediated inhibition exerts a powerful negative feedback on nicotinic excitation, dampening attention-relevant signaling in the TgCRND8 brain. These mechanistic findings identify a new cellular target involved in the modulation of attention and a novel therapeutic target for early attention deficits in AD.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Effects of the LPA1 Receptor Deficiency and Stress on the Hippocampal LPA Species in Mice</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2019.00146</link>
	<content:encoded>Lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) is an important bioactive lipid species that functions in intracellular signaling through six characterized G protein-coupled receptors (LPA1–6). Among these receptors, LPA1 is a strong candidate to mediate the central effects of LPA on emotion and may be involved in promoting normal emotional behaviors. Alterations in this receptor may induce vulnerability to stress and predispose an individual to a psychopathological disease. In fact, mice lacking the LPA1 receptor exhibit emotional dysregulation and cognitive alterations in hippocampus-dependent tasks. Moreover, the loss of this receptor results in a phenotype of low resilience with dysfunctional coping in response to stress and induces anxiety and several behavioral and neurobiological changes that are strongly correlated with mood disorders. In fact, our group proposes that maLPA1-null mice represent an animal model of anxious depression.
However, despite the key role of the LPA-LPA1-pathway in emotion and stress coping behaviors, the available information describing the mechanisms by which the LPA-LPA1-pathway regulates emotion is currently insufficient. Because activation of LPA1 requires LPA, here, we used a Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption/ Ionization mass spectrometry-based approach to evaluate the effects of an LPA1 receptor deficiency on the hippocampal levels of LPA species. Additionally, the impact of stress on the LPA profile was also examined in both wild-type (WT) and the Malaga variant of LPA1-null mice (maLPA1-null-mice). Mice lacking LPA1 did not exhibit gross perturbations in the hippocampal LPA species, but the LPA profile was modified, showing an altered relative abundance of 18:0 LPA. Regardless of the genotype, restraint stress produced profound changes in all LPA species examined, revealing that hippocampal LPA species are a key target of stress. Finally, the relationship between the hippocampal levels of LPA species and performance in the elevated plus maze was established. 
	To our knowledge, this study is the first to detect, identify and profile LPA species in the hippocampus of both LPA1-receptor null mice and WT mice at baseline and after acute stress, as well as to link these LPA species with anxiety-like behaviors. In conclusion, the hippocampal LPA species are a key target of stress and may be involved in psychopathological conditions.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Hypothermia therapy is an old and important method of neuroprotection. Until now, many neurological diseases such as stroke, traumatic brain injury, intracranial pressure elevation, subarachnoid hemorrhage, spinal cord injury, hepatic encephalopathy, and neonatal peripartum encephalopathy have proven to be suppressed by therapeutic hypothermia. Beneficial effects of therapeutic hypothermia have also been discovered, and progress has been made towards improving the benefits of therapeutic hypothermia further through combinations with other neuroprotective treatments and by probing the mechanism of hypothermia neuroprotection. In this review, we compare different hypothermia induction methods and provide a summarized account of the synergistic effect of hypothermia therapy with other neuroprotective treatments along with an overview of hypothermia neuroprotection mechanisms and cold/hypothermia-induced proteins.</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Brain Imaging Methods section | New and Recent Articles: Spatial Resolution and Imaging Encoding fMRI Settings for Optimal Cortical and Subcortical Motor Somatotopy in the Human Brain</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00571</link>
	<content:encoded>There is much controversy about the optimal trade-off between blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) sensitivity and spatial precision in experiments on brain’s topology properties using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). The sparse empirical evidence and regional specificity of these interactions pose a practical burden for the choice of imaging protocol parameters. Here, we test in a motor somatotopy experiment the impact of fMRI spatial resolution on differentiation between body part representations in cortex and subcortical structures. Motor somatotopy patterns were obtained in a block-design paradigm and visually cued movements of face, upper and lower limbs at 1.5, 2 and 3 mm3 spatial resolution. The degree of segregation of the body parts’ spatial representations was estimated using a pattern component model. In cortical areas, we observed the same level of segregation between somatotopy maps across all three resolutions. In subcortical areas the degree of effective similarity between spatial representations was significantly impacted by the image resolution. The 1.5 mm 3D EPI and 3 mm 2D EPI protocols led to higher segregation between motor representations compared to the 2 mm 3D EPI protocol. This finding could not be attributed to differential BOLD sensitivity or delineation of functional areas alone and suggests a crucial role of the image encoding scheme (2D vs 3D EPI). Our study contributes to the field by providing empirical evidence about the impact of acquisition protocols for the delineation of somatotopic areas in cortical and sub-cortical brain regions.</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Neurodegeneration section | New and Recent Articles: Microstates as Disease and Progression Markers in Patients With Mild Cognitive Impairment</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00563</link>
	<content:encoded>Network dysfunction is well established in patients with Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and has been shown to be present early in the disease. This is especially interesting in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) since the majority later develop AD. In EEG, one type of network analysis is microstates where the EEG is divided into quasi-stable states and these microstates have been linked to networks found with resting state functional MRI. In the current exploratory study, we therefore wanted to explore the changes in microstates in MCI, and AD compared to healthy controls (HC) and whether microstates were able to separate patients with MCI who progressed (pMCI) and those who remained stable (sMCI). EEGs were recorded at baseline for 17 patients with AD, 27 patients with MCI, and 38 older HC and the patients were followed for three years. To investigate whole-brain dynamics we extracted different microstate parameters. We found that patients with MCI, and AD had significantly higher occurrence (p-value = 0.028), and coverage (p-value = 0.010) for microstate A compared to HC. However, we did not find any significant systematic deviation of the transition probabilities from randomness for any of the groups. No significant differences were found between pMCI and sMCI but the largest difference in duration was found for microstate C. Microstate A has been linked to the temporal lobes in studies combining EEG and fMRI and the temporal lobes are the most affected by AD pathology in the early stages of the disease. This supports our idea that microstate A may be the first affected microstate in early AD.  Even though not significant between pMCI and sMCI, Microstate C has previously been shown to be associated with the cingulate gyri in fMRI and studies have found that posterior cingulate cortex is associated with progression from MCI to AD. However, larger studies are needed to confirm these findings.</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Neurodegeneration section | New and Recent Articles: Proteomics Approaches for Biomarker and Drug Target Discovery in ALS and FTD</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00548</link>
	<content:encoded>Neurodegenerative disorders such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) are increasing in prevalence but lack targeted therapeutics. Although the pathological mechanisms behind these diseases remain unclear, both ALS and FTD are characterized pathologically by aberrant protein aggregation and inclusion formation within neurons, which correlates with neurodegeneration. Notably, aggregation of several key proteins, including TAR DNA binding protein of 43 kDa (TDP-43), superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1), and tau, have been implicated in these diseases. Proteomics methods are being increasingly applied to better understand disease-related mechanisms and to identify biomarkers of disease, using model systems as well as human samples. Proteomics-based approaches offer unbiased, high-throughput, and quantitative results with numerous applications for investigating proteins of interest. Here, we review recent advances in the understanding of ALS and FTD pathophysiology obtained using proteomics approaches, and we assess technical and experimental limitations. We compare findings from various mass spectrometry approaches including quantitative proteomics methods such as stable isotope labelling by amino acids in cell culture (SILAC) and tandem mass tagging (TMT) to approaches such as label-free quantitation (LFQ) and sequential windowed acquisition of all theoretical fragment ion mass spectra (SWATH-MS) in studies of ALS and FTD. Similarly, we describe disease-related protein-protein interaction (PPI) studies using approaches including immunoprecipitation mass spectrometry (IP-MS) and proximity dependent biotin identification (BioID) and discuss future application of new techniques including proximity-dependent ascorbic acid peroxidase labelling (APEX) and biotinylation by antibody recognition (BAR). Furthermore, we explore the use of mass spectrometry to detect post-translational modifications, such as ubiquitination and phosphorylation, of disease-relevant proteins in ALS and FTD. We also discuss upstream technologies that enable enrichment of proteins of interest, highlighting the contributions of new techniques to isolate disease-relevant protein inclusions including flow cytometric analysis of inclusions and trafficking (FloIT). These recently developed approaches, as well as related advances yet to be applied to studies of these neurodegenerative diseases, offer numerous opportunities for discovery of potential therapeutic targets and biomarkers for ALS and FTD.</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Brain Imaging Methods section | New and Recent Articles: Modeling the Switching Behavior of Functional Connectivity Microstates (FCμstates) as a Novel Biomarker for Mild Cognitive Impairment</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00542</link>
	<content:encoded>It is evident the need for designing and validating novel biomarkers for the detection of mild cognitive impairment (MCI). MCI patients have a high risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease (AD), and for that reason the introduction of novel and reliable biomarkers is of significant clinical importance. Motivated by recent findings about the rich information of dynamic functional connectivity graphs (DFCGs) about brain (dys)function, we introduced a novel approach of identifying MCI based on magnetoencephalographic (MEG)  resting state recordings. 
The activity of different brain rhythms {δ, θ, α1, α2, β1, β2, γ1, γ2} was first beamformed with linear constrained minimum norm variance in the MEG data to determine ninety anatomical regions of interest (ROIs). A dynamic functional connectivity graph (DFCG) was then estimated using the imaginary part of phase lag value (iPLV) for both intra-frequency coupling (8) and also cross-frequency coupling pairs (28). We analysed DFCG profiles of neuromagnetic resting state recordings of 18 Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) patients and 20 healthy controls. We followed our model of identifying the dominant intrinsic coupling mode (DICM) across MEG sources and temporal segments that further leads to the construction of an integrated DFCG (iDFCG). We then filtered statistically and topologically every snapshot of the iDFCG with data-driven approaches. Estimation of the normalized Laplacian transformation for every temporal segment of the iDFCG and the related eigenvalues created a 2D map based on the network metric time series of the eigenvalues (NMTSeigs). NMTSeigs preserves the non-stationarity of the fluctuated synchronizability of iDCFG for each subject. Employing the initial set of 20 healthy elders and 20 MCI patients, as training set, we built an overcomplete dictionary set of network microstates (nμstates). Afterward, we tested the whole procedure in an extra blind set of 20 subjects for external validation. 
We succeeded a high classification accuracy on the blind dataset (85 %) which further supports the proposed Markovian modelling of the evolution of brain states. The adaptation of appropriate neuroinformatic tools that combine advanced signal processing and network neuroscience tools could manipulate properly the non-stationarity of time-resolved FC patterns revealing a robust biomarker for MCI.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2019.00204</link>
	<content:encoded>Background
Dental anxiety is a common reason for avoiding dental visits and is associated with poor dental status. The short version of Dental Anxiety Inventory is an easy-to-use, multi-faceted questionnaire for assessing the level of trait dental anxiety. However, there was no neurophysiological data indicating if its score associates with the state anxiety when an individual is under real / mock dental environment. We hypothesized that there exists such an association.
Materials and methods
Twenty systemic healthy adults with dental attendance experience and self-claimed free of dental phobia were recruited in this cross-sectional study, with their dental anxiety level assessed by short version of Dental Anxiety Inventory. Functional magnetic resonance imaging recorded their brain signals in response to audiovisual footages resembling dental scaler or turbine in action. After the brain imaging, they gave fear ratings to the footages in visual analog scale.
Results
Participants’ short version of Dental Anxiety Inventory scores positively correlated with their responses in the insular cortex (r2 = 0.388–0.445, P &amp;lt; 0.005). Their short version of Dental Anxiety Inventory scores also positively correlated with their fear ratings of the footages (r2 = 0.415–0.555, P &amp;lt; 0.005). 
Discussion
Our findings indicated a possible neurobiological relevance of short version of Dental Anxiety Inventory, and reinforced its neurobiological validity in assessing dental anxiety level of dental attenders.</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Exploring the Neural Correlates in Adopting a Realistic View: A Neural Structural and Functional Connectivity Study With Female Nurses</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2019.00197</link>
	<content:encoded>Empathizing leads to positive and negative consequences. To avoid empathy-induced distress, adopting a realistic view (dealing with a situation practically and efficiently independent of one’s emotional state) is important. We hypothesized that empathy-demanding professions (e.g., nursing) may require individuals to adopt a realistic view, which may demonstrate modulated neural structure and functional connectivity. We confirmed that female nurses showed a higher tendency, compared to controls, to adopt a realistic view, using the Fantasy subscale of the Interpersonal Reactivity Index (inverse scale of the realistic view). We then employed voxel-based morphometry and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging to explore the neural underpinnings related to realistic view adoption. Nurses exhibited significantly lower gray-matter volume (GMV) in the right striatum. In multiple regression analysis, only the Fantasy subscale score showed a significant positive correlation with GMV within the striatum cluster. Moreover, nurses exhibited lower functional connectivity between the right striatum and the right lateral prefrontal cortex (PFC), representing emotional regulation. These findings show that structural differences in the striatum correlated with the realistic view. Furthermore, lower functional connectivity between the striatum and lateral PFC suggests that nurses may use efficient coping strategies that may lessen the recruitment of effortful emotional regulation.</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Motor Imagery of Speech: The Involvement of Primary Motor Cortex in Manual and Articulatory Motor Imagery</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2019.00195</link>
	<content:encoded>Motor imagery refers to the phenomenon of imagining performing an action without action execution. Motor imagery and motor execution are assumed to share a similar underlying neural system that involves primary motor cortex (M1). Previous studies have focused on motor imagery of manual actions, but articulatory motor imagery has not been investigated. In this study, transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) was used to elicit motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) from the articulatory muscles (orbicularis oris) as well as from hand muscles (first dorsal interosseous). Twenty participants were asked to execute or imagine performing a simple squeezing task involving a pair of tweezers, which was comparable across both effectors. MEPs were elicited at six timepoints (50, 150, 250, 350, 450, 550ms post-stimulus) to track the time-course of M1 involvement in both lip and hand tasks. The results showed increased MEP amplitudes for action execution compared to rest for both effectors at time points 350, 450 and 550ms, but we found no evidence of increased cortical activation for motor imagery. The results indicate that motor imagery does not involve M1 for simple tasks for manual or articulatory muscles. The results have implications for models of mental imagery of simple articulatory gestures, in that no evidence is found for somatotopic activation of lip muscles in sub-phonemic contexts during motor imagery of such tasks, suggesting that motor simulation of relatively simple actions does not involve M1.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>There are a variety of methods to access the inner ear and many of these methods depend on utilizing the middle ear as a portal.  In this approach the middle ear can be used as a passive receptacle, as part of an active drug delivery system, or simply as the most convenient way to access the inner ear directly in human subjects.  The purpose of this volume is to examine some of the more cutting-edge approaches to treating the middle ear.  Before considering these therapies, this manuscript provides an overview of some therapies that have been delivered through the middle ear both in the past and at the current time.  This manuscript also serves as a review of many of the methods for accessing the inner ear that directly utilize or pass though the middle ear.   This manuscript provides the reader a basis for understanding middle ear delivery, the basis of delivery of medicines via cochlear implants, and examines the novel approach of using hypothermia as a method of altering the responses of the inner ear to damage.</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Alzheimer’s Disease Associated Genes Ankyrin and Tau Cause Shortened Lifespan and Memory Loss in Drosophila</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2019.00260</link>
	<content:encoded>Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia and is characterized by intracellular neurofibrillary tangles of hyperphosphorylated Tau, including the 0N4R isoform and accumulation of extracellular amyloid beta (ABeta) plaques. However less than 5% of AD cases are familial, with many addition risk factors contributing to AD including ageing, lifestyle, the environment and epigenetics. Recent epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) of AD have identified a number of loci that are differentially methylated in the AD cortex. Indeed, hypermethylation and reduced expression of the Ankyrin 1 (ANK1) gene in AD has been reported in the cortex in numerous different post-mortem brain cohorts. Little is known about the normal function of ANK1 in the healthy brain, nor the role it may play in AD. We have generated Drosophila models to allow us to functionally characterize Drosophila Ank2, the ortholog of human ANK1 and to determine its interaction with human Tau and ABeta. We show expression of human Tau 0N4R or the oligomerizing ABeta 42 amino acid peptide caused shortened lifespan, degeneration, disrupted movement, memory loss and decreased excitability of memory neurons with co-expression tending to make the pathology worse. We find that Drosophila with reduced neuronal Ank2 expression have shortened lifespan, reduced locomotion, reduced memory and reduced neuronal excitability similar to flies overexpressing either human Tau 0N4R or ABeta42. Therefore, we show that the mis-expression of Ank2 can drive disease relevant processes and phenocopy some features of AD. Therefore, we propose targeting human ANK1 may have therapeutic potential. This represents the first study to characterize a gene implicated in AD, which was nominated from EWAS.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2019.00255</link>
	<content:encoded>Merkel cells (MCs) have been proposed to form a part of the MC-neurite complex with sensory neurons. Although recent evidence has indicated that mechano-sensitive ion channels, such as transient receptor potential channels and Piezo channels, contribute to the mechanosensory transduction in MCs, the detailed mechanism for intercellular communication between MCs and neurons have yet to be clarified. The present study examined the increases in intracellular free Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) induced by direct mechanical stimulation of MCs. We also measured [Ca2+]i in the trigeminal ganglion neurons (TGs) following direct mechanical stimulation to the MCs in an MC-TGs coculture. The MCs were isolated from hamster buccal mucosa, while TGs were isolated from neonatal Wistar rats. Both cell populations showed depolarization-induced [Ca2+]i. Direct mechanical stimulation to MCs increased [Ca2+]i, showing stimulation strength dependence. In the MC-TGs coculture, the application of direct mechanical stimulation to MCs resulted in increased [Ca2+]i in the TGs. These changes were significantly suppressed by antagonists of glutamate-permeable anion channels (4,4'-diisothiocyanato-2,2'-stilbenedisulfonic acid; DIDS), and non-competitive antagonist of the N-Methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors (MK801). Apyrase, an ATP-degrading enzyme, and suramin, a non-selective P2 purinergic receptor antagonist, did not exert inhibitory effects on these [Ca2+]i increases in the TGs following MC stimulation. These results indicated that MCs are capable of releasing glutamate, but not ATP, in response to cellular deformation by direct mechanical stimulation. The released glutamate activates the NMDA receptors on TGs. We suggest that MCs act as mechanoelectrical transducers and establish synaptic transmission with neurons, through the MC-neurite complex, to mediate mechanosensory transduction.</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: MEA6 Deficiency Impairs Cerebellar Development and Motor Performance by Tethering Protein Trafficking</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2019.00250</link>
	<content:encoded>Meningioma expressed antigen 6 (MEA6), also called cutaneous T cell lymphoma-associated antigen 5 (cTAGE5), was initially found in tumor tissues. MEA6 is located in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) exit sites and regulates the transport of collagen, very low density lipoprotein, and insulin. It is also reported that MEA6 might be related to Fahr’s syndrome, which comprises neurological, movement, and neuropsychiatric disorders. Here, we show that MEA6 is critical to cerebellar development and motor performance. Mice with conditional knockout of MEA6 (Nestin-Cre;MEA6F/F) display smaller sizes of body and brain compared to control animals, and survive maximal 28 days after birth. Immunohistochemical and behavioral studies demonstrate that these mutant mice have defects in cerebellar development and motor performance. In contrast, PC deletion of MEA6 (pCP2-Cre;MEA6F/F) causes milder phenotypes in cerebellar morphology and motor behaviors. While pCP2-Cre;MEA6F/F mice have normal lobular formation and gait, they present the extensive self-crossing of PC dendrites and damaged motor learning. Interestingly, the expression of key molecules that participates in cerebellar development, including Slit2 and brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), is significantly increased in ER, suggesting that MEA6 ablation impairs ER function and thus these proteins are arrested in ER. Our study provides insight into the roles of MEA6 in the brain and the pathogenesis of Fahr’s syndrome.</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Sphingolipids as Emerging Mediators in Retina Degeneration</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2019.00246</link>
	<content:encoded>The sphingolipids ceramide (Cer), sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P), sphingosine (Sph) and ceramide-1-phosphate (C1P) are key signaling molecules that regulate major cellular functions. Their roles in the retina have gained increasing attention during the last decade since they emerge as mediators of proliferation, survival, migration, neovascularization, inflammation and death in retina cells. As exacerbation of these processes is central to retina degenerative diseases, they appear as crucial players in their progression. This review analyzes the functions of these sphingolipids in retina cell types and their possible pathological roles. Cer appears as a key arbitrator in diverse retinal pathologies; it promotes inflammation in endothelial and retina pigment epithelium (RPE) cells and its increase is a common feature in photoreceptor death in vitro and in animal models of retina degeneration; noteworthy, inhibiting Cer synthesis preserves photoreceptor viability and functionality. In turn, S1P acts as a double edge sword in the retina. It is essential for retina development, promoting the survival of photoreceptors and ganglion cells and regulating proliferation and differentiation of photoreceptor progenitors. However, S1P has also deleterious effects, stimulating migration of Müller glial cells, angiogenesis and fibrosis, contributing to the inflammatory scenario of proliferative retinopathies and age related macular degeneration (AMD). C1P, as S1P, promotes photoreceptor survival and differentiation. Collectively, the expanding role for these sphingolipids in the regulation of critical processes in retina cell types and in their dysregulation in retina degenerations makes them attractive targets for treating these diseases.</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Early-Onset Molecular Derangements in the Olfactory Bulb of Tg2576 Mice: Novel Insights Into the Stress-Responsive Olfactory Kinase Dynamics in Alzheimer’s Disease</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2019.00141</link>
	<content:encoded>The olfactory bulb (OB) is the first processing station in the olfactory pathway. Despite smell impairment is considered an early event in Alzheimer´s disease (AD), little is known about the initial molecular disturbances that accompany the AD development at olfactory level. We have interrogated the time-dependent OB molecular landscape in Tg2576 AD mice prior to the appearance of neuropathological amyloid plaques (2-, and 6-month-old), using combinatorial omics analysis. The metabolic modulation induced by human mutated amyloid precursor protein (APP) overproduction clearly differs between both time points. Besides the progressive perturbation of the APP interactome, functional network analysis unveiled an inverse regulation of downstream extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK1/2), and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) routes in 2-month-old Tg2576 mice respect to wild-type (WT) mice. In contrast, Akt and mitogen-activated protein kinase Kinase 4 (SEK1)/ stress-activated protein kinase (SAPK) axis were parallel activated in the OB of 6-months-old-Tg2576 mice. Furthermore, a survival kinome profiling performed during the aging process (2-, 6-, and 18-month-old) revealed that olfactory APP overexpression leads to changes in the activation dynamics of protein kinase A (PKA), and SEK1/MKK4-SAPK/JNK between 6 and 18 months of age, when memory deficits appear and AD pathology is well established in transgenic mice. Interestingly, both olfactory pathways were differentially activated in a stage-dependent manner in human sporadic AD subjects with different neuropathological grading. Taken together, our data reflect the early impact of mutated APP on the OB molecular homeostasis, highlighting the progressive modulation of specific signaling pathways during the olfactory amyloidogenic pathology.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2019.00140</link>
	<content:encoded>Many neurodegenerative diseases manifest in an overall aged population, the pathology of which is hallmarked by abnormal protein aggregation. It is known that across aging, sleep quality becomes less efficient and protein homeostatic regulatory mechanisms deteriorate. There is a known relationship between extended wakefulness and poorly consolidated sleep and an increase in cellular stress. In an aged population, when sleep is chronically poor, and proteostatic regulatory mechanisms are less efficient, the cell is inundated with misfolded proteins and suffers a collapse in homeostasis. In this review, we explore the interplay between aging, sleep quality, and proteostasis and how these processes are implicated in the development and progression of neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer’s disease. We also present data suggesting that reducing cellular stress and improving proteostasis and sleep quality could serve as potential therapeutic solutions for the prevention or delay in the progression of these diseases.</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Lifespan Changes in Network Structure and Network Topology Dynamics During Rest and Auditory Oddball Performance</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2019.00138</link>
	<content:encoded>Behavioral and physiological evidence suggests that developmental changes lead to enhanced cortical differentiation and integration through maturation and learning, and that senescent changes during aging result in dedifferentiation and reduced cortical specialization of neural cell assemblies. We used electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings to evaluate network structure and network topology dynamics during rest with eyes closed and open, and during auditory oddball task across the lifespan. For this evaluation, we constructed a hyper-frequency network (HFN) based on within- and cross-frequency coupling (WFC and CFC, respectively) at 10 oscillation frequencies ranging between 2 and 20 Hz. We found that WFC increased monotonously across the lifespan, whereas CFC showed a U-shaped relationship. These changes in WFC and CFC strengths coevolve with changes in network structure and network topology dynamics, namely the magnitude of graph-theoretical topology measures increased linearly with age (except for characteristic path length, which is going shorter), while their standard deviation showed an inverse U-shaped relationship with a peak in young adults. Temporal as well as structural or nodal similarity of network topology (with some exceptions) seems to coincide with variability changes, i.e., stronger variability is related to higher similarity between consecutive time windows or nodes. Furthermore, network complexity measures showed different lifespan-related patterns, which depended on the balance of WFC and CFC strengths. Both variability and complexity of HFNs were strongly related to the perceptual speed scores. Finally, investigation of the modular organization of the networks revealed higher number of modules and stronger similarity of community structures across time in young adults as compared with children and older adults. We conclude that network variability and complexity measures reflect temporal and structural topology changes in the functional organization and reorganization of neuronal cell assemblies across the lifespan.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Previous work of ours and others has documented regressive changes in neuronal architecture and function in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) of male rats following chronic stress. As recent focus has shifted toward understanding whether chronic stress effects on mPFC are sexually dimorphic, here we undertake a comprehensive analysis to address this issue. First, we show that chronic variable stress (14-day daily exposure to different challenges) resulted in a comparable degree of adrenocortical hyperactivity, working memory impairment, and dendritic spine loss in mPFC pyramidal neurons in both sexes. Next, exposure of female rats to 21-day regimen of corticosterone resulted in a similar pattern of mPFC dendritic spine attrition and increase in spine volume. Finally, we examined the effects of another widely used regimen, chronic restraint stress (CRS, 21-day of daily 6-h restraint), on dendritic spine changes in mPFC in both sexes. CRS resulted in response decrements in adrenocortical output (habituation), and induced a pattern of consistent, but less widespread, dendritic spine loss similar to the foregoing challenges. Our data suggest that chronic stress or glucocorticoid exposure induces a relatively undifferentiated pattern of structural and functional alterations in mPFC in both males and females.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Brain Imaging Methods section | New and Recent Articles: Quantification of Phase-Amplitude Coupling in Neuronal Oscillations: Comparison of Phase-Locking Value, Mean Vector Length, Modulation Index, and Generalized-Linear-Modeling-Cross-Frequency-Coupling</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00573</link>
	<content:encoded>Phase-amplitude coupling is a promising construct to study cognitive processes in electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetencephalography (MEG). Due to the novelty of the concept, various measures are used in the literature to calculate phase-amplitude coupling. Here, performance of the three most widely used phase-amplitude coupling measures – phase-locking value (PLV), mean vector length (MVL), and modulation index (MI) – and of the generalized linear modeling cross-frequency coupling (GLM-CFC) method is thoroughly compared with the help of simulated data. We combine advantages of previous reviews and use a realistic data simulation, examine moderators and provide inferential statistics for the comparison of all four indices of phase-amplitude coupling. Our analyses show that all four indices successfully differentiate coupling strength and coupling width when monophasic coupling is present. While the mean vector length was most sensitive to modulations in coupling strengths and width, only the modulation index and GLM-CFC can detect biphasic coupling. Coupling values of all four indices were influenced by moderators including data length, signal-to-noise-ratio, and sampling rate when approaching Nyquist frequencies. The modulation index was most robust against confounding influences of these moderators. Based on our analyses, we recommend the modulation index for noisy and short data epochs with unknown forms of coupling. For high quality and long data epochs with monophasic coupling and a high signal-to-noise ratio, the use of the mean vector length is recommended. Ideally, both indices are reported simultaneously for one data set.</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Brain Imaging Methods section | New and Recent Articles: Diffusion MRI: Assessment of the Impact of Acquisition and Preprocessing Methods Using the BrainVISA-Diffuse Toolbox</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00536</link>
	<content:encoded>Diffusion MR images are prone to severe geometric distortions induced by head movement, eddy-current and inhomogeneity of magnetic susceptibility. Various correction methods have been proposed that depend on the choice of the acquisition settings and potentially provide highly different data quality. However, the impact of this choice has not been evaluated in terms of the ratio between scan time and preprocessed data quality. This study aims at investigating the impact of six well-known preprocessing methods, each associated to specific acquisition settings, on the outcome of diffusion analyses. For this purpose, we developed a comprehensive toolbox called Diffuse which automatically guides the user to the best preprocessing pipeline according to the input data. Using MR images of 20 subjects from the HCP dataset, we compared the six pre-processing pipelines regarding the following criteria: the ability to recover brain’s true geometry, the tensor model estimation and derived indices in the white matter, and finally the spatial dispersion of six well known connectivity pathways. As expected, the pipeline associated to the longer acquisition fully repeated with reversed phase-encoding (RPE) yielded the higher data quality and was used as a reference to evaluate the other pipelines. In this way, we highlighted several significant aspects of other pre-processing pipelines. Our results first established that eddy-current correction improves the tensor-fitting performance with a localized impact especially in the corpus callosum. Concerning susceptibility distortions, we showed that the use of a field map is not sufficient and involves additional smoothing, yielding to an artificial decrease of tensor-fitting error. Of most importance, our findings demonstrate that, for an equivalent scan time, the acquisition of a b0 volume with RPE ensures a better brain’s geometry reconstruction and local improvement of tensor quality, without any smoothing of the image. This was found to be the best scan time / data quality compromise. To conclude, this study highlights and attempts to quantify the strong dependence of diffusion metrics on acquisition settings and preprocessing methods.</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Brain Aging and Electrophysiological Signaling: Revisiting the Spreading Depression Model</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2019.00136</link>
	<content:encoded>As a consequence of worldwide improvement in health care, the aging portion of the human population has increased, now representing a higher proportion of the total population. This fact raises great concern regarding how to age while maintaining good brain function. Very often, alterations in brain electrophysiological signaling are associated with age-dependent functional disorders of the brain. Therefore, animal models suitable for the study of age-related changes in electrical activity of the brain can be very useful. Herein, we review changes in brain electrophysiological features as a function of age by analyzing studies in the rat brain on the phenomenon known as cortical spreading depression (CSD). Alterations in the brain’s capability to generate and propagate CSD may be related to differences in the propensity to develop certain neurological diseases, such as epilepsy, stroke, and migraine, which can biunivocally interact with the aging process. In this review, we revisit ours and others’ previous studies on electrophysiological features of the CSD phenomenon, such as its velocity of propagation and amplitude and duration of its slow negative DC shift, as a function of the animal age, as well as the interaction between age and other factors, such as ethanol consumption, physical exercise, and nutritional status. In addition, we discuss one relatively new feature through which CSD modulates brain signaling: the ability to potentiate the brain’s spontaneous electrical activity. We conclude that the CSD model might importantly contribute to a better understanding of the aging/brain signaling relationship.</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Resting-State Functional Connectivity Is Associated With Cerebrospinal Fluid Levels of the Synaptic Protein NPTX2 in Non-demented Older Adults</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2019.00132</link>
	<content:encoded>Intrinsic functional connectivity of large-scale brain networks has been shown to change with aging and Alzheimer’s disease (AD).  These alterations are thought to reflect changes in synaptic function, but the underlying biological mechanisms are poorly understood. This study examined whether Neuronal Pentraxin 2 (NPTX2), a synaptic protein that mediates homeostatic strengthening of inhibitory circuits to control cortical excitability, is associated with functional connectivity as measured by resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI) in five large-scale cognitive brain networks.  In this cross-sectional study, rsfMRI scans were obtained from 130 older individuals (mean age=69 years) with normal cognition (N=113) and Mild Cognitive Impairment (N=17); NPTX2 was measured in the same individuals in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).   Higher levels of NPTX2 in CSF were associated with greater functional connectivity in the salience/ventral attention network, based on linear regression analysis. Moreover, this association was stronger among individuals with lower levels of cognitive reserve, as measured by a composite score (comprised of years of education, reading, and vocabulary measures). Additionally, higher connectivity in the salience/ventral attention network was related to better performance on a composite measure of executive function. Levels of NPTX2 were not associated with connectivity in other networks (executive control, limbic, dorsal attention, and default-mode). Findings also confirmed prior reports that individuals with MCI have lower levels of NPTX2 compared to those with normal cognition. Taken together, the results suggest that NPTX2 mechanisms may play a central role among older individuals in connectivity within the salience/ventral attention network and for cognitive tasks that require modulation of attention and response selection.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>The current ‘one size fits all’ approach to our cognitive aging population is not adequate to close the gap between cognitive health span and lifespan.  In this review paper, we present a  a novel  model for understanding, preventing, and treating age-related cognitive impairment (ARCI) based on the concepts precision medicine.  We will discuss how multiple risk factors can be classified into risk categories because of their interrelatedness in real life, the brain drivers or common mechanisms mediating brain aging, and the genetic variants that increase sensitivity to, or ameliorate, risk for ARCI. Rather than providing a definitive model of risk for ARCI and cognitive decline, the Precision Aging model is meant as a starting point to guide future research. To that end, after briefly discussing key risk categories, brain drivers, and genetic risks, we conclude with a discussion of steps that can be taken to move the field forward.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Age is the major risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and for mild cognitive impairment (MCI). However, there is limited evidence about MCI-specific aging-related simultaneous changes of the brain structure and their impact on cognition. We analyzed the brain imaging data from 269 subjects (97 MCI patients and 172 cognitively normal [CN] elderly) using voxel-based morphometry and tract-based spatial statistics procedures to explore the special structural pattern during aging. We found that the patients with MCI showed accelerated age-related reductions in gray matter volume in the left planum temporale, thalamus, and posterior cingulate gyrus. The similar age×group interaction effect was found in the fractional anisotropy of the bilateral parahippocampal cingulum white matter tract, which connects the temporal regions. Importantly, the age-related temporal gray matter and white matter alterations were more significantly related to performance in memory and attention tasks in MCI patients. The accelerated degeneration patterns in the brain structure provide evidence for different neural mechanisms underlying aging in MCI patients. Temporal structural degeneration may serve as a potential imaging marker for distinguishing the progression of the preclinical AD stage from normal aging.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Axon Guidance and Collective Cell Migration by Substrate-Derived Attractants</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2019.00148</link>
	<content:encoded>Neurons have evolved specialized growth structures to reach and innervate their target cells. These growth cones express specific receptor molecules that sense environmental cues and transform them into steering decisions. Historically, various concepts of axon guidance have been developed to better understand how axons reach and identify their targets. The essence of these efforts seems to be that growth cones require solid substrates, and that major guidance decisions are initiated by extracellular cues. These sometimes highly conserved ligands and receptors have been extensively characterized and mediate four major guidance forces: chemoattraction, chemorepulsion, contact attraction and contact repulsion. However, during development, cells, too, do migrate in order to reach molecularly-defined niches at target locations. In fact, axonal growth could be regarded as a special case of cellular migration, where only a highly polarized portion of the cell is elongating. Here, I combine several examples from genetically tractable model organisms, such as Drosophila or zebrafish, in which cells and axons are guided by attractive cues. Regardless, if these cues are secreted into the extracellular space or exposed on cellular surfaces, migrating cells and axons seem to keep close contact to these attractants and seem to detect them right at their source. Migration towards and along such substrate-derived attractants seem to be particularly robust, as genetic deletion induces obvious searching behaviors and permanent guidance errors. In addition, forced expression of these factors in ectopic tissues is highly distractive too, regardless of the pattern of other endogenous cues. Thus, guidance and migration towards and along attractive tissues is a powerful steering mechanism that exploits affinity differences to the surroundings and, in some instances, determines growth trajectories from source to target region.</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Neural Technology section | New and Recent Articles: Application of Graph Theory for Identifying Connectivity Patterns in Human Brain Networks: A Systematic Review</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00585</link>
	<content:encoded>Background: Analysis of the human connectome using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) started in the mid-1990s and attracted increasing attention in attempts to discover the neural underpinnings of human cognition and neurological disorders. In general, brain connectivity patterns from fMRI data are classified as statistical dependencies (functional connectivity) or causal interactions (effective connectivity) among various neural units. Computational methods, especially graph theory-based methods, have recently played a significant role in understanding brain connectivity architecture.

Objectives: Thanks to the emergence of graph theoretical analysis, the main purpose of the current paper is to systematically review how brain properties can emerge through the interactions of distinct neuronal units in various cognitive and neurological applications using fMRI. Moreover, this article provides an overview of the existing functional and effective connectivity methods used to construct the brain network, along with their advantages and pitfalls.

Methods: In this systematic review, the databases Science Direct, Scopus, arXiv, Google Scholar, IEEE Xplore, PsycINFO, PubMed, and SpringerLink are employed for exploring the evolution of computational methods in human brain connectivity from 1990 to the present, focusing on graph theory. The Cochrane Collaboration's tool was used to assess the risk of bias in individual studies.

Results: Our results show that graph theory and its implications in cognitive neuroscience have attracted the attention of researchers since 2009 (as the Human Connectome Project launched), because of their prominent capability in characterizing the behavior of complex brain systems. Although graph theoretical approach can be generally applied to either functional or effective connectivity patterns during rest or task performance, to date, most articles have focused on the resting-state functional connectivity.

Conclusions: This review provides an insight into how to utilize graph theoretical measures to make neurobiological inferences regarding the mechanisms underlying human cognition and behavior as well as different brain disorders.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2019.00035</link>
	<content:encoded>The neurons of the olivocerebellar circuit exhibit complex electroresponsive dynamics, which are thought to play a fundamental role for network entraining, plasticity induction, signal processing and noise filtering. In order to reproduce these properties in single-point neuron models, we have optimized the Extended-Generalized Leaky Integrate and Fire (E-GLIF) neuron through a multi-objective gradient-based algorithm targeting the desired input-output relationships. In this way, E-GLIF was tuned toward the unique input-output properties of Golgi cells, granule cells, Purkinje cells, molecular layer interneurons, deep cerebellar nuclei cells and inferior olivary cells. E-GLIF proved able to simulate the complex cell-specific electroresponsive dynamics of the main olivocerebellar neurons including pacemaking, adaptation, bursting, post-inhibitory rebound excitation, subthreshold oscillations, resonance and phase reset. The integration of these E-GLIF point-neuron models into olivocerebellar Spiking Neural Networks will allow to evaluate the impact of complex electroresponsive dynamics at the higher scales, up to motor behaviour, in closed-loop simulations of sensorimotor tasks.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnana.2019.00060</link>
	<content:encoded>Recent studies have indicated that direct administration of viral vectors or small compounds to the inner ear may aid in the treatment of sensorineural hearing loss. However, due to species differences between humans and rodents, translating experimental results into clinical applications remains challenging. The common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus), a New World monkey, is considered a pre-clinical animal model. In the present study, we describe morphometric data acquired from the temporal bone of the common marmoset in order to define the routes of topical drug administration to the inner ear. Dissection and diffusion tensor tractography (DTT) were performed on the fixed cadaverous heads of thirteen common marmosets. To investigate potential routes for drug administration to the inner ear, we explored the anatomy of the round window, oval window, semicircular canal, and endolymphatic sac. Among these, the approach via the round window with posterior tympanotomy appeared feasible for delivering drugs to the inner ear without manipulating the tympanic membrane, minimizing the chances of conductive hearing loss. The courses of four critical nerves (including the facial nerve) were visualized using three-dimensional DTT, which may help to avoid nerve damage during surgery. Finally, to investigate the feasibility of actual drug administration, we measured the volume of the round window niche, which was approximately 0.9 µL. The present findings may help to establish experimental standards for evaluating new therapies in this primate model.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>In olfaction, all volatile odor information is tunneled through the main olfactory bulb (OB). Odor information is then processed before it is transferred to higher brain centers.  Odor processing in the OB is carried out by numerous local inhibitory circuits and modulated by top-down input. Top-down modulation of OB function has been shown to act via interneurons but evidence also exists for its direct impact onto the principle mitral and tufted cells (M/Ts). Here, we used monosynaptic rabies trans-synaptic tracing from the OB to map and quantify the local and top-down presynaptic landscape of M/Ts and local inhibitory interneurons. We found that M/Ts receive a significant amount of top-down inputs from various brain regions that matches qualitatively but not quantitatively those that synapse onto local inhibitory inter-neurons. These results show that M/Ts are direct targets of top-down inputs.</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroanatomy | New and Recent Articles: Phosphorylation and Dephosphorylation of Tau Protein During Synthetic Torpor</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnana.2019.00057</link>
	<content:encoded>Tau protein is of primary importance for many physiological processes in neurons, where it affects the dynamics of the microtubule system. When hyperphosphorylated (PP-Tau), Tau monomers detach from microtubules and tend to aggregate firstly in oligomers, and then in neurofibrillary tangles, as it occurs in a group of neurodegenerative disorders named thauopathies. 
A hypothermia-related accumulation of PP-Tau, which is quickly reversed after the return to normothermia, has been shown to occur in the brain of hibernators during torpor. Since, recently, in our lab, a hypothermic torpor-like condition (synthetic torpor, ST) was pharmacologically induced in the rat, a non-hibernator, the aim of the present work was to assess whether ST can lead to a reversible PP-Tau accumulation in the rat brain. 
PP-Tau was immunohistochemically assessed by staining for AT8 (phosphorylated Tau) and Tau-1 (non-phosphorylated Tau) in 19 brain structures, which were chosen mostly due to their involvement in the regulation of autonomic and cognitive functions in relation to behavioral states. During ST, AT8 staining was strongly expressed throughout the brain, while Tau-1 staining was reduced compared to control conditions. During the following recovery period, AT8 staining progressively reduced close to zero after 6h from ST. However, Tau-1 staining remained low even after 38h from ST. Thus, overall, these results show that ST induced an accumulation of PP Tau that was, apparently, only partially reversed to normal during the recovery period. 
While the accumulation of PP-Tau may only depend on the physicochemical characteristics of the enzymes regulating Tau phosphorylation, the reverse process of dephosphorylation should be actively regulated, also in non-hibernators. In conclusion, in this work a reversible and widespread PP-Tau accumulation has been induced through a procedure that leads a non-hibernator to a degree of reversible hypothermia, which is comparable to that observed in hibernators. Therefore, the physiological mechanism involved in this process can sustain an adaptive neuronal response to extreme conditions, which may however lead to neurodegeneration when particular intensities and durations are exceeded.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.cell.com/trends/neurosciences/fulltext/S0166-2236(19)30059-1?rss=yes</link>
	<content:encoded>In the human brain, oscillations occur during neural processes that are relevant for memory. This has been demonstrated by a plethora of studies relating memory processes to specific oscillatory signatures. Several recent studies have gone beyond such correlative approaches and provided evidence supporting the idea that modulating oscillations via frequency-specific entrainment can alter memory functions. Such causal evidence is important because it allows distinguishing mechanisms directly related to memory from mere epiphenomenal oscillatory signatures of memory.</content:encoded>

Epigenetic markers, such as DNA methylation and histone modifications, have been implicated in the formation of not only cellular memories such as cell fate, but also memories of experience at the organismal level. Here, we review recent advances in chromatin regulation that contribute to synaptic plasticity and drive adaptive behaviors through dynamic and precise regulation of transcription output in neurons. We discuss chromatin-associated proteins, histone variant proteins, the contribution of cis-regulatory elements and their interaction with histone modifications, and how these mechanisms are integrated into distinct behavior and environmental response paradigms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2019.00141</link>
	<content:encoded>Neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson’s disease (PD), Alzheimer’s disease (AD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) are chronic, progressive and age-associated neurological disorders characterized by neuronal deterioration in specific brain regions. Although the specific pathological mechanisms underlying these disorders have remained elusive, ion channel dysfunction has become increasingly accepted as a potential mechanism for neurodegenerative diseases. Hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) channels are encoded by the HCN1-4 gene family and conduct the hyperpolarization-activated current (Ih). These channels play important roles in modulating cellular excitability, rhythmic activity, dendritic integration and synaptic transmission. In the present review we first provide a comprehensive picture of the role of HCN channels in PD by summarizing their role in the regulation of neuronal activity in PD-related brain regions. Dysfunction of Ih may participate in 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP+)-induced toxicity and represent a pathogenic mechanism in PD. Given current reports that the critical role of HCN channels in neuroinflammation and depression, we also discussed the putative contribution of HCN channels in inflammatory processes and non-motor symptoms in PD. In the second section, we summarize how HCN channels regulate the formation of β-amyloid peptide in AD and the role of these channels in learning and memory. Finally, we briefly discuss the effects of HCN channels in ALS and SMA based on existing discoveries.</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Astrocyte, a Promising Target for Mood Disorder Interventions</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2019.00136</link>
	<content:encoded>Mood disorders have multiple phenotypes and complex underlying biological mechanisms, and as such, there are no effective therapeutic strategies. A review of recent work on the role of astrocytes in mood disorders is thus warranted and we argue that there is tremendous potential for novel strategies for therapeutic interventions based on the role of astrocytes.
Astrocytes are traditionally considered to have supporting roles within the brain, yet emerging evidence has shown that astrocytes have more direct roles in influencing brain function. Notably, evidence from postmortem human brain tissues has highlighted changes in glial cell morphology, density and astrocyte-related biomarkers and genes following mood disorders, indicating astrocyte involvement in mood disorders. Findings from animal models imply strongly that astrocytes not only change astrocyte morphology and physiological characteristics but also influence neural circuits via synapse structure and formation. This review pays particular attention to interactions between astrocytes and neurons and argues that astrocyte dysfunction affects the monoaminergic system, excitatory-inhibitory balance and neurotrophic states of local networks. Together, these studies provide a foundation of knowledge about the exact role of astrocytes in mood disorders.
Changing focus from neurons to glial cells and their interactions is important so that we can understand newly proposed mechanisms underlying mood disorders, and to identify more diagnostic indicators or effective targets for treatment of these diseases.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00575</link>
	<content:encoded>Iron homeostasis is an essential prerequisite for metabolic and neurological functions throughout the healthy human life, with a dynamic interplay between intracellular and systemic iron metabolism. The development of different neurodegenerative diseases is associated with alterations of the intracellular transport of iron and heavy metals, principally mediated by Divalent Metal Transporter1 (DMT1), responsible for Non Transferrin Bound Iron transport (NTBI). In addition, DMT1 regulation and its compartmentalization in specific brain regions play important roles during aging. This review highlights the contribution of DMT1 to the physiological exchange and distribution of body iron and heavy metals during aging and neurodegenerative diseases. DMT1 also mediates the crosstalk between central nervous system and peripheral tissues, by systemic diffusion through the Blood Brain Barrier (BBB), with the involvement of peripheral iron homeostasis in association with inflammation. In conclusion, a survey about the role of DMT1 and iron will illustrate the complex panel of interrelationship with aging, neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00574</link>
	<content:encoded>Neuroinflammation plays an important role in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) pathogenesis. However, it is difficult to evaluate inflammation of the central nervous system (CNS) or the relationship between neuroinflammation and disease progression in ALS patients. Recent advances in the field of exosomes and CNS-derived exosomes extraction technology provide the possibility of measuring the inflammatory status in the CNS without brain biopsy. In this pilot study, we extracted astrocyte-derived exosomes from the plasma of sporadic ALS patients and age-, sex-matched healthy controls and determined Interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The IL-6 levels in astrocyte-derived exosomes were increased in sALS patients and positively associated with the rate of disease progression. However, the association between IL-6 levels and disease progression rate was limited to patients whose disease duration were less than 12 months. These data suggest an increased inflammatory cascade in the CNS of sALS patients. Our pilot study demonstrates that CNS-derived exosomes could be useful to reveal neuroinflammation of the CNS in ALS patients.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00555</link>
	<content:encoded>The right orbitofrontal cortex (rOFC) has been proposed as the region where conscious olfactory perception arises; however, evidence supporting this hypothesis has all been collected from neuroimaging and lesion studies in which only correlation and not a temporal pattern can be established. Continuous theta burst stimulation (cTBS) causes a reversible disruption of cortical activity and has been used successfully to disrupt orbitofrontal activity. To overcome intrinsic limitations of current experimental research, a crossover, double-blind, prospective and longitudinal study was carried out in which cTBS was applied over the rOFC to evaluate its effect on odorant stimuli detection. All subjects received real and sham cTBS. Experimental procedures were done in two different sessions with a separation of at least one week between them to avoid carryover and learning effects. A total of 15 subjects completed the experiment, and their data were included in the final analysis (10 women, 5 men, mean age 22.40 ± 3.41). Every session consisted of two different measures of the conscious olfactory perception task: A baseline measure and one 5 minutes after cTBS/sham. Compared to baseline, marks in the olfactory task during the sham cTBS session increased (p =0.010), while marks during the real cTBS session decreased (p =0.017). Our results support the hypothesis that rOFC is an important node of a complex network required for conscious olfactory perception to arise. However, the exact mechanism that explains our results is unclear and could be explained by the disruption of other cognitive functions related to the rOFC.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Amyloid-β (Aβ) deposition, neurofibrillary tangles induced by phosphorylation of tau protein and neuronal apoptosis are pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer’s disease (AD).The dementia rate in the alcoholic abusers were found to be higher than the control people. The present study explored potential roles of alcohol dehydrogenase 1B (ADH1B) in AD pathological process.The results showed that ADH1B level decreased significantly both in the serum of AD patients and in the hippocampus of APP/PS-1 AD model mice.The apoptotic rate was reduced and the viability was elevated significantly for the AD model cell transfected with ADH1B over-expressed vector. Moreover,the level of p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75NTR), a receptor of Aβ1-42,was down-regulated in the ADH1B over-expressed AD model cell and up-regulated in the cells transfected with shRNA vector of ADH1B. Furthermore, the protein levels of cleaved caspase-3 and Bax decreased significantly, and Bcl-2 level increased in the cells when overexpressing ADH1B.The opposite trend of cleaved caspase-3,Bax and Bcl-2 were observed in the cells transfected with shRNA vector of ADH1B. The level of reactive oxidative species (ROS) was found to be reduced in the ADH1B over-expressed cells and be enhanced when transfected with shRNA vector of ADH1B. These results indicated that ADH1B might be significant in the prevention of AD, especially for the abusers of alcohol, and a new potential target of AD treatment.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Nav1.2, a voltage-gated sodium channel subunit encoded by the Scn2a gene, has been implicated in various brain disorders, including epilepsy, autism spectrum disorder, intellectual disability, and schizophrenia. Nav1.2 is known to regulate the generation of action potentials in the axon initial segment and their propagation along axonal pathways. Nav1.2 also regulates synaptic integration and plasticity by promoting back-propagation of action potentials to dendrites, but whether Nav1.2 deletion in mice affects neuronal excitability, synaptic transmission, synaptic plasticity, and/or disease-related animal behaviors remains largely unclear. Here we report that mice heterozygous for the Scn2a gene (Scn2a+/– mice) show decreased neuronal excitability and suppressed excitatory synaptic transmission in the presence of network activity in the hippocampus. In addition, Scn2a+/– mice show suppressed hippocampal long-term potentiation in association with impaired spatial learning and memory, but show largely normal locomotor activity, anxiety-like behavior, social interaction, repetitive behavior, and whole-brain excitation. These results suggest that Nav1.2 regulates hippocampal neuronal excitability, excitatory synaptic drive, long-term potentiation, and spatial learning and memory in mice.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00569</link>
	<content:encoded>Neurodegenerative diseases are devastating medical conditions with no effective treatments. Restoration of impaired neurogenesis represents a promising therapeutic strategy for neurodegenerative diseases. Milk fat globule-epidermal growth factor-factor VIII (MFG-E8) is a secretory glycoprotein that plays a wide range of cellular functions including phagocytosis of apoptotic cells, anti-inflammation, tissue regeneration and homeostasis. The beneficial role of MFG-E8 has been shown in cerebral ischemia (stroke), neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease and Parkinson’s disease, and traumatic brain injury (TBI). In stroke, MFG-E8 promotes neural stem cell proliferation and their migration towards the ischemic brain tissues. These novel functions of MFG-E8 are primarily mediated through its receptor αvβ3-integrin. Here we focus on the pivotal role of MFG-E8 in protecting against neuronal diseases by promoting neurogenesis. We also discuss the mechanisms of MFG-E8-mediated neural stem/progenitor cell (NSPC) proliferation and migration, and the potential of MFG-E8 for neural stem cell niche maintenance via angiogenesis. We propose further investigation of the molecular pathways for MFG-E8 signaling in NSPC and effective strategies for MFG-E8 delivery across the blood-brain barrier, which will help develop MFG-E8 as a future drug candidate for the bedside management of neurodegenerative diseases.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00568</link>
	<content:encoded>Background: Little is known about the modulation of cortical excitability in the prefrontal cortex during fear processing in humans. Here, we aimed to transiently modulate and test the cortical excitability during fear processing using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and brain oscillations in theta and alpha frequency bands with electroencephalography (EEG). 
Methods: We conducted two separate experiments (no-TMS and TMS). In the no-TMS experiment, EEG recordings were performed during the instructed fear paradigm in which a visual cue (CS+) was paired with an aversive unconditioned stimulus (electric shock), while the other visual cue was unpaired (CS-). In the TMS experiment, in addition the TMS was applied on the right dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC). The participants also underwent structural MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) scanning and were assigned pseudo-randomly to both experiments, such that age and gender were matched. The cortical excitability was evaluated by time-frequency analysis and functional connectivity with weighted phase lag index (WPLI). We further linked the excitability patterns with markers of stress coping capability.
Results: After visual cue onset, we found increased theta power in the frontal lobe and decreased alpha power in the occipital lobe during CS+ relative to CS- trials. TMS of dmPFC increased theta power in the frontal lobe and reduced alpha power in the occipital lobe during CS+. The TMS pulse increased the information flow from the sensorimotor region to the prefrontal and occipital regions in the theta and alpha bands respectively during CS+ compared to CS-. Pre-stimulation frontal theta power (0.75-1 s) predicted the magnitude of frontal theta power changes after stimulation (1-1.25 s). Finally, the increased frontal theta power during CS+ compared to CS- was positively correlated with stress coping behavior. 
Conclusion: Our results show that TMS over dmPFC transiently modulated the regional cortical excitability and the fronto-occipital information flows during fear processing, while the pre-stimulation frontal theta power determined the strength of achieved effects. The frontal theta power may serve as a biomarker for fear processing and stress-coping responses in individuals and could be clinically tested in mental disorders.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00551</link>
	<content:encoded>TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) is the major component of the ubiquitin-positive protein aggregates seen in the majority of frontotemporal lobar degeneration and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis cases. TDP-43 belongs to the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) family that is involved in the regulation of RNA transcription, splicing, transport and translation. There are a great many hnRNPs, which often have overlapping functions and act cooperatively in RNA processing. Here we demonstrate that another hnRNP family member, hnRNP E2, shows a striking accumulation within dystrophic neurites and cytoplasmic inclusions in the frontal cortex and hippocampus of a subset of FTLD-TDP cases belonging to pathological subtypes A and C, where hnRNP E2 was found to co-localize with 85% of TDP-43 immunopositive inclusions. hnRNP E2-positive inclusions were not seen in FTLD-TDP cases with the C9orf72 expansion or in any other neurodegenerative disorders examined. This interaction with TDP-43 in specific FTLD subtypes suggests different underlying neurodegenerative pathways.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00531</link>
	<content:encoded>Reliable EEG source analysis depends on sufficiently detailed and accurate head models. In this study, we investigate how uncertainties inherent to the experimentally determined conductivity values of the different conductive compartments influence the results of EEG source analysis.
In a single source scenario, the superficial and focal somatosensory P20/N20 component, we analyze the influence of varying conductivities on dipole reconstructions using a generalized polynomial chaos (gPC) approach. We find that in particular the conductivity uncertainties for skin and skull have a significant influence on the EEG inverse solution, leading to variations in source localization by several centimeters. The conductivity uncertainties for gray and white matter were found to have little influence on the source localization, but a strong influence on the strength and orientation of the reconstructed source, respectively. As the CSF conductivity is most accurately determined of all conductivities in a realistic head model, CSF conductivity uncertainties had a negligible influence on the source reconstruction. This small uncertainty is a further benefit of distinguishing the CSF in realistic volume conductor models.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00521</link>
	<content:encoded>The blood-brain barrier (BBB) mediates the communication between the periphery and the central nervous system (CNS). Recently, CNS insulin resistance has been elucidated to play a role in neurodegenerative disease. This has stimulated a wealth of information on the molecular impact of insulin in the brain, particularly in the improvement of cognition. Since the BBB regulates the transport of insulin into the brain and thus, helps to regulate CNS levels, alterations in the BBB response to insulin could impact CNS insulin resistance. In this review, we summarize the effect of insulin on some of the cell types that make up the BBB, including endothelial cells, neurons, astrocytes, and pericytes. We broadly discuss how these changes in specific cell types could ultimately impact the BBB. We also summarize how insulin can regulate levels of the pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer’s disease, including amyloid beta (Aβ) and tau within each cell type. Finally, we suggest interventional approaches to overcome detrimental effects on the BBB in regards to changes in insulin transport.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00518</link>
	<content:encoded>The overall goal of this study is to develop thickness shear mode (TSM) resonators for real-time, label-free, non-destructive sensing of biological adhesion events in small populations (hundreds) of neurons in a cell culture medium and subsequently in vivo in the future. Such measurements will enable discoveries of the role of biomechanical events in neuronal function and dysfunction. Conventional TSM resonators have been used for chemical sensing and biosensing applications in media with hundreds of thousands of cells in culture. However, the sensitivity and spatial resolution of conventional TSM devices need to be further enhanced for sensing smaller cell populations or molecules of interest. In this report, we focus on key challenges such as eliminating inharmonics in solution and maximizing Q-factor while simultaneously miniaturizing the active sensing (electrode) area to make them suitable for small populations of cells. We use theoretical expressions for sensitivity and electrode area of TSM sensors operating in liquid. As a validation of the above design effort, we fabricated prototype TSM sensors with resonant frequencies of 42, 47, 75 and 90 MHz and characterized their performance in liquid using electrode diameters of 150, 200, 400, 800 and 1200 μm and electrode thicknesses of 33 and 230 nm. We validated a candidate TSM resonator with the highest sensitivity and Q-factor for real-time monitoring of adhesion of cortical neurons. We reduced the size of the sensing area to 150-400 μm for TSM devices improving the spatial resolution by monitoring few 100s to 1000s of neurons. Finally, we modified the electrode surface with single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNT) to further enhance adhesion and sensitivity of the TSM sensor to adhering neurons (Marx, 2003).</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fninf.2019.00042</link>
	<content:encoded>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a key technology in multimodal animal studies of brain connectivity and disease pathology. In vivo MRI provides non-invasive, whole brain macroscopic images containing structural and functional information, thereby complementing invasive in vivo high-resolution microscopy and ex vivo molecular techniques. Brain mapping, the correlation of corresponding regions between multiple brains in a standard brain atlas system, is widely used in human MRI. For small animal MRI, however, there is no scientific consensus on pre-processing strategies and atlas-based neuroinformatics. Thus, it remains difficult to compare and validate results from different pre-clinical studies which were processed using custom-made code or individual adjustments of clinical MRI software and without a standard brain reference atlas. Here, we describe AIDAmri, a novel Atlas-based Imaging Data Analysis pipeline to process structural and functional mouse brain data including anatomical MRI, fiber tracking using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and functional connectivity analysis using resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI). The AIDAmri pipeline includes automated pre-processing steps, such as raw data conversion, skull-stripping and bias-field correction as well as image registration with the Allen Brain Reference Atlas (ARA). Following a modular structure developed in Python scripting language, the pipeline integrates established and newly developed algorithms. Each processing step was optimized for efficient data processing requiring minimal user-input and user programming skills. The raw data is analyzed and results transferred to the ARA coordinate system in order to allow an efficient and highly-accurate region-based analysis. AIDAmri is intended to fill the gap of a missing open-access and cross-platform toolbox for the most relevant mouse brain MRI sequences thereby facilitating data processing in large cohorts and multi-center studies.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fninf.2019.00041</link>
	<content:encoded>Due to the limited field of view of the microscopes, acquisitions of macroscopic specimens require many parallel image stacks to cover the whole volume of interest.
Overlapping regions are introduced among stacks in order to make it possible automatic alignment by means of a 3D stitching tool.
Since state-of-the-art microscopes coupled with chemical clearing procedures can generate 3D images whose size exceeds the Terabyte, parallelization is required to keep stitching time within acceptable limits.

In the present paper we discuss how multi-level parallelization reduces the execution times of TeraStitcher, a tool designed to deal with very large images.
%Parallelization has been carried out in such a way that its impact on user interface and software maintenance is negligible.
Two algorithms performing dataset partition for efficient parallelization in a transparent way are presented together with experimental results proving the effectiveness of the approach that achieves a speedup close to 300$\times$, when both coarse- and fine-grained parallelism are exploited.

Multi-level parallelization of TeraStitcher led to a significant reduction of processing times with no changes in the user interface, and with no additional effort required for the maintenance of code.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fninf.2019.00040</link>
	<content:encoded>Distress is a critical problem in developed societies given its long-term negative effects on physical and mental health. The interest in studying this emotion has notably increased during last years, being electroencephalography (EEG) signals preferred over other physiological variables in this research field. In addition, the non-stationary nature of brain dynamics has impulsed the use of non-linear metrics such as symbolic entropies in brain signal analysis. However, only consecutive samples in a time series have been considered in the scientific literature for entropy computation applied to distress identification. Thus, the influence of time-lag on brain patterns assessment has not been tested. Hence, in the present study two permutation entropies denominated Delayed Permutation Entropy and Permutation Min-Entropy have been computed for the first time at different time-lags to discern between calmness and distress emotional states in EEG signals. Moreover, a number of curve-related features were also calculated to assess the signal dynamics across different temporal intervals.Complementary information among these variables was studied through stepwise regression and ten-fold cross-validation approaches. According to the results obtained, the multi-lag analysis has been able to reveal new significant insights so far undiscovered, thus notably improving the process of distress recognition from EEG recordings.</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neural Circuits | New and Recent Articles: Differences in Sodium Channel Densities in the Apical Dendrites of Pyramidal Cells of the Electrosensory Lateral Line Lobe</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncir.2019.00041</link>
	<content:encoded>Heterogeneity of neural properties within a given neural class is ubiquitous in the nervous system and permits different sub-classes of neurons to specialize for specific purposes. This principle has been thoroughly investigated in the hindbrain of the weakly electric fish A. leptorhynchus in the primary electrosensory area, the Electrosensory Lateral Line lobe (ELL). The pyramidal cells that receive inputs from tuberous electroreceptors are organized in three maps in distinct segments of the ELL. The properties of these cells vary greatly across maps due to differences in connectivity, receptor expression, and ion channel composition. These cells are a seminal example of bursting neurons and their bursting dynamic relies on the presence of voltage-gated Na+ channels in the extensive apical dendrites of the superficial pyramidal cells. Other ion channels can affect burst generation and their expression varies across ELL neurons and segments. For example, SK channels cause hyperpolarizing after-potentials decreasing the likelihood of bursting, yet bursting propensity is similar across segments. We question whether the depolarizing mechanism that generates the bursts presents quantitative differences across segments that could counterbalance other differences having the opposite effect. Although their presence and role are established, the distribution and density of the apical dendrites’ Na+ channels have not been quantified and compared across ELL maps. Therefore, we test the hypothesis that Na+ channel density varies across segment by quantifying their distribution in the apical dendrites of immunolabeled ELL sections. We found the Na+ channels to be two-fold denser in the lateral segment than in the centro-medial segment, the centro-lateral segment being intermediate. Our results imply that this differential expression of voltage-gated Na+ channels could counterbalance or interact with other aspects of neuronal physiology that vary across segments (e.g. SK channels). We argue that burst coding of sensory signals, and the way the network regulates bursting, should be influenced by these variations in Na+ channel density.</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Combined Assessment of Diffusion Parameters and Cerebral Blood Flow Within Basal Ganglia in Early Parkinson’s Disease</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2019.00134</link>
	<content:encoded>Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is a sensitive tool for detecting brain tissue microstructural alterations in Parkinson’s disease (PD). Abnormal cerebral perfusion patterns have also been reported in PD patients using arterial spin labeling (ASL) MRI. In this study we aimed to perform a combined DTI and ASL assessment in PD patients within the basal ganglia, in order to test the relationship between microstructural and perfusion alterations.
Fifty-two subjects participated in this study. Specifically, twenty-six PD patients (mean age [SD]=66.7[8.9] years, 21 males, median [IQR] Modified Hoehn and Yahr = 1.5 [1-1.6]) and twenty-six healthy controls (HC, mean age [SD]=65.2[7.5], 15 males) were scanned with 1.5T MRI. Fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), axial diffusivity (AD), radial diffusivity (RD) maps were derived from diffusion-weighted images, while cerebral blood flow (CBF) maps were computed from ASL data. After registration to Montreal Neurological Institute standard space, FA, MD, AD, RD and CBF median values were extracted within specific regions of interest: substantia nigra, caudate, putamen, globus pallidum, thalamus, red nucleus and subthalamic nucleus. DTI measures and CBF were compared between the two groups. The relationship between diffusion parameters and CBF was tested with Spearman’s correlations. False discovery rate (FDR)-corrected p-values lower than 0.05 were considered significant, while uncorrected p-values &amp;lt; 0.05 were considered a trend.
No significant FA differences were observed. AD was significantly increased in PD patients compared with HC in the putamen (p=0.039, pFDR=0.035). No significant CBF differences were found between PD patients and HC. Diffusion parameters were not significantly correlated with CBF in the HC group, while a significant correlation emerged for PD patients in the caudate nucleus, for all DTI measures (with FA: r=0.543, pFDR=0.028; with MD: r=-0.661, pFDR=0.002; with AD: r=-0.628, pFDR=0.007; with RD: r=-0.635, pFDR=0.003).
This study showed that DTI is a more sensitive technique than ASL to detect alterations in the basal ganglia in the early phase of PD. Our results suggest that, although DTI and ASL convey different information, a relationship between microstructural integrity and perfusion changes in the caudate may be present.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2019.00111</link>
	<content:encoded>The hemispheric asymmetry reduction in older adults (HAROLD) is a neurocompensatory process that has been observed across several cognitive functions but has not yet been examined in relation to task-induced relative deactivations of the default mode network. The present study investigated the presence of HAROLD effects specific to neural activations and deactivations using a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) n-back paradigm.  It was hypothesized that HAROLD effects would be identified in relative activations and deactivations during the paradigm, and that they would be associated with better 2-back performance. Forty-five older adults (M age=63.8; range=53-83) were administered a verbal n-back paradigm during fMRI. For each participant, the volume of brain response was summarized by left and right frontal regions of interest, and laterality indices (LI; i.e., left/right) were calculated to assess HAROLD effects. Group level results indicated that age was significantly and negatively correlated with LI (i.e., reduced left lateralization) for deactivations, but positively correlated with LI (i.e., increased left lateralization) for activations. The relationship between age and LI for deactivation was significantly moderated by performance level, revealing a stronger relationship between age and LI at higher levels of 2-back performance. Findings suggest that older adults may employ neurocompensatory processes specific to deactivations, and task-independent processes may be particularly sensitive to age-related neurocompensation.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Despite accumulating evidence suggesting improvement in one’s well-being as a result of meditation, little is known about if or how the brain and the periphery interact to produce these behavioral and mental changes. We hypothesize that meditation reflects changes in the neural representations of visceral activity, such as cardiac behavior, and investigated the integration of neural and visceral systems and the spontaneous whole brain spatiotemporal dynamics underlying traditional Tibetan Buddhist meditation. In a large cohort of long-term Tibetan Buddhist monk meditation practitioners, we found distinct transient modulations of the neural response to heartbeats in the default mode network (DMN), along with large-scale network reconfigurations in the gamma and theta bands of electroencephalography (EEG) activity induced by meditation. Additionally, temporal-frontal network connectivity in the EEG theta band was negatively correlated with the duration of meditation experience, and gamma oscillations were uniquely, directionally coupled to theta oscillations during meditation. Overall, these data suggest that the neural representation of cardiac activity in the DMN and large-scale spatiotemporal network integrations underlie the fundamental neural mechanism of meditation and further imply that meditation may utilize cortical plasticity, inducing both immediate and long-lasting changes in the intrinsic organization and activity of brain networks.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>The relationship between neurons and perineuronal nets (PNNs) is attracting attention as a central mechanism controlling brain plasticity. In the cortex, PNNs primarily surround inhibitory parvalbumin interneurons, playing roles as both a regulator of synaptic plasticity and a protective barrier. PNNs have a delayed developmental trajectory and are key components in the closure of critical periods of heightened neuroplasticity. In animal models, manipulating PNNs outside this critical window can enhance cognition, suggesting a potentially therapeutic approach for attenuating cognitive decline.</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroanatomy | New and Recent Articles: Endothelial Cells Filopodia in the Anastomosis of Central Nervous System Capillaries</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnana.2019.00049</link>
	<content:encoded>In this Perspective we explore filopodia of endothelial cells in the developing central nervous system using the Golgi method and transmission electron microscopy. Filopodia of endothelial cells play a crucial role in the anastomosis of growing capillaries of the central nervous system. The leading endothelial cells filopodia from approaching capillaries interconnect forming complex conglomerates that precede the anastomotic event. The contacting filopodia form narrow spaces between them filled with proteinaceous basal lamina material. The original narrow spaces coalesce into larger ones leading to the formation of a single one that will interconnect (anastomose) the two approaching capillaries. The four leading endothelial cells (two for each approaching capillary) become the wall of the newly formed post-anastomotic CNS capillaries. These new CNS capillaries are very small with narrow and irregular lumina that might permit the passage of fluid but not yet of blood cells. Eventually, their lumen enlarges and permits the passage of blood cells.</content:encoded>

These processes rely on a subtle interplay between the set of genes inherited from the parents, the surrounding environment and epigenetic regulation. Methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MeCP2) has been shown to recognize epigenetic states and regulate gene expression by reading methylated DNA.

To systematically dissect the coupling between stimulation and transcription, we propose creating a ‘stimulation–transcription coupling map’ that describes the transcription response to each possible extracellular stimulus. While we are currently far from having a complete map, recent genomic experiments have begun to facilitate its creation. Here, we describe the current state of the stimulation–transcription coupling map as well as the transcriptional regulation that enables this coupling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Presynaptic boutons support neurotransmitter release with nanoscale precision at sub-millisecond timescales. Studies over the past two decades have revealed a rich tapestry of molecular players governing synaptic vesicle fusion at highly specialized release sites in the active zone (AZ). However, the spatiotemporal organization of release at active synapses remains elusive, in part owing to the extremely small size of the AZ and the limited resolution of conventional approaches. Recent advances in fluorescence nanoscopy have revolutionized direct investigation of presynaptic release organization and dynamics.</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: SUMOylating Two Distinct Sites on the A-type Potassium Channel, Kv4.2, Increases Surface Expression and Decreases Current Amplitude</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2019.00144</link>
	<content:encoded>Post-translational conjugation of Small Ubiquitin-like Modifier (SUMO) peptides to lysine (K) residues on target proteins alters their interactions. SUMOylation of a target protein can either promote its interaction with other proteins that possess SUMO binding domains, or it can prevent target protein interactions that normally occur in the absence of SUMOylation. One subclass of voltage-gated potassium channels that mediates an A-type current, IA, exists as a ternary complex comprising Kv4 pore forming subunits, Kv channel interacting proteins (KChIP) and transmembrane dipeptidyl peptidase like proteins (DPPL). SUMOylation could potentially regulate intra- and/or intermolecular interactions within the complex. This study began to test this hypothesis and showed that Kv4.2 channels were SUMOylated in the rat brain and in human embryonic kidney (HEK) cells expressing a GFP-tagged mouse Kv4.2 channel (Kv4.2g). Prediction software identified two putative SUMOylation sites in the Kv4.2 C-terminus at K437 and K579. These sites were conserved across mouse, rat, and human Kv4.2 channels and across mouse Kv4 isoforms. Increasing Kv4.2g SUMOylation at each site by ~30% produced a significant ~22-50% decrease in IA Gmax, and a ~70-95% increase in channel surface expression. Site-directed mutagenesis of Kv4.2g showed that K437 SUMOylation regulated channel surface expression, while K579 SUMOylation controlled IA Gmax. The K579R mutation mimicked and occluded the SUMOylation-mediated decrease in IA Gmax, suggesting that SUMOylation at K579 blocked an intra- or inter-protein interaction involving K579. The K437R mutation did not obviously alter channel surface expression or biophysical properties, but it did block the SUMOylation-mediated increase in channel surface expression. Interestingly, enhancing K437 SUMOylation in the K579R mutant roughly doubled channel surface expression, but produced no change in IA Gmax, suggesting that the newly inserted channels were electrically silent. This is the first report that Kv4.2 channels are SUMOylated and that SUMOylation can independently regulate Kv4.2 surface expression and IA Gmax in opposing directions. The next step will be to determine if/how SUMOylation affects Kv4 interactions within the ternary complex.</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Elevated Levels of Arachidonic Acid-Derived Lipids Including Prostaglandins and Endocannabinoids Are Present Throughout ABHD12 Knockout Brains: Novel Insights Into the Neurodegenerative Phenotype</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2019.00142</link>
	<content:encoded>Derived from arachidonic acid (AA), the endogenous cannabinoid (eCB) 2-arachidonoyl glycerol (2-AG) is a substrate for αβ-hydrolase domain 12 (ABHD12). Loss-of-function mutations of ABHD12 are associated with the neurodegenerative disorder polyneuropathy, hearing loss, ataxia, retinitis pigmentosa, and cataract (PHARC). ABHD12 knockout (KO) mice show PHARC-like behaviors in older adulthood. Here, we test the hypothesis that ABHD12 deletion age-dependently regulates bioactive lipids in the CNS. Lipidomics analysis of the brainstem, cerebellum, cortex, hippocampus, hypothalamus, midbrain, striatum and thalamus from male young (3-4 months) and older (7 months) adult ABHD12 KO and age-matched wild-type (WT) mice was performed on over 80 lipids via HPLC/MS/MS, including eCBs, lipoamines, 2-acyl glycerols, free fatty acids, and prostaglandins (PGs). Aging and ABHD12 deletion drove widespread changes in the CNS lipidome; however, the effects of ABHD12 deletion were similar between old and young mice, meaning that many alterations in the lipidome precede PHARC-like symptoms. AA-derived lipids were particularly sensitive to ABHD12 deletion. 2-AG increased in the striatum, hippocampus, cerebellum, thalamus, midbrain, and brainstem, whereas the eCB N-arachidonoyl ethanolamine increased in all 8 brain regions, along with at least 2 PGs. Aging also had a widespread effect on the lipidome and more age-related changes in bioactive lipids were found in ABHD12 KO mice than WT suggesting that ABHD12 deletion exacerbates the effects of age. The most robust effects of aging (independent of genotype) across the CNS were decreases in N-acyl GABAs and N-acyl glycines. In conclusion, levels of bioactive lipids are dynamic throughout adulthood and deleting ABHD12 disrupts the wider lipidome, modulating multiple AA-derived lipids with potential consequences for neuropathology.</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Novel Strategies for the Generation of Neuronal Diversity: Lessons From the Fly Visual System</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2019.00140</link>
	<content:encoded>Among all organs of an adult animal, the central nervous system stands out because of its vast complexity and morphological diversity. During early development, the entire central nervous system develops from an apparently homogenous group of progenitors that differentiate into all neural cell types. Therefore, understanding the molecular and genetic mechanisms that give rise to the cellular and anatomical diversity of the brain is a key goal of the developmental neurobiology field. With this aim in mind, the development of the central nervous system of model organisms has been extensively studied. From more than a century, the mechanisms of neurogenesis have been studied in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. The visual system comprises one of the major structures of the Drosophila brain. The visual information is collected by the eye-retina photoreceptors and then processed by the four optic lobe ganglia: the lamina, medulla, lobula and lobula plate. The molecular mechanisms that originate neuronal diversity in the optic lobe have been unveiled in the past decade. In this article, we describe the early development and differentiation of the lobula plate ganglion, from the formation of the optic placode and the inner proliferation centre to the specification of motion detection neurons. We focused specifically on how the precise combination of signalling pathways and cell-specific transcription factors patterns the pool of neural stem cells that generates the different neurons of the motion detection system.</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Proestrus Differentially Regulates Expression of Ion Channel and Calcium Homeostasis Genes in GnRH Neurons of Mice</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2019.00137</link>
	<content:encoded>In proestrus, the changing gonadal hormone milieu alters the physiological properties of GnRH neurons and contributes to the development of the GnRH surge. We hypothesized that proestrus also influences the expression of different ion channel genes in mouse GnRH neurons. Therefore, we performed gene expression profiling of GnRH neurons collected from intact, proestrous and metestrous GnRH-GFP transgenic mice, respectively. Proestrus changed the expression of 37 ion channel and 8 calcium homeostasis-regulating genes. Voltage-gated sodium channels responded with upregulation of three alpha subunits (Scn2a1, Scn3a and Scn9a). Within the voltage-gated potassium channel class, Kcna1, Kcnd3, Kcnh3 and Kcnq2 were upregulated, while others (Kcna4, Kcnc3, Kcnd2 and Kcng1) underwent downregulation. Proestrus also had impact on inwardly rectifying potassium channel subunits manifested in enhanced expression of Kcnj9 and Kcnj10 genes, whereas Kcnj1, Kcnj11 and Kcnj12 subunit genes were downregulated. The two-pore domain potassium channels also showed differential expression with upregulation of Kcnk1 and reduced expression of three subunit genes (Kcnk7, Kcnk12 and Kcnk16). Changes in expression of chloride channels involved both the voltage-gated (Clcn3 and Clcn6) and the intracellular (Clic1) subtypes. Regarding the pore-forming alpha-1 subunits of voltage-gated calcium channels, two (Cacna1b and Cacna1h) were upregulated, while Cacna1g showed downregulation. The ancillary subunits were also differentially regulated (Cacna2d1, Cacna2d2, Cacnb1, Cacnb3, Cacnb4, Cacng5, Cacng6 and Cacng8). In addition, ryanodine receptor 1 (Ryr1) gene was downregulated, while a transient receptor potential cation channel (Trpm3) gene showed enhanced expression. Genes encoding proteins regulating the intracellular calcium homeostasis were also influenced (Calb1, Hpca, Hpcal1, Hpcal4, Cabp7, Cab 39l and Cib2). The differential expression of genes coding for ion channel proteins in GnRH neurons at late proestrus indicates that the altering hormone milieu contributes to remodeling of different kinds of ion channels of GnRH neurons, which might be a prerequisite of enhanced cellular activity of GnRH neurons and the subsequent surge release of the neurohormone.</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Integrative Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Resting-State Brain Network Dysfunctions Associated With Visuomotor Impairments in Autism Spectrum Disorder</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnint.2019.00017</link>
	<content:encoded>Background: Individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) show elevated levels of motor variability that are associated with clinical outcomes. Cortical-cerebellar networks involved in visuomotor control have been implicated in postmortem and anatomical imaging studies of ASD. However, the extent to which these networks show intrinsic functional alterations in patients, and the relationship between intrinsic functional properties of cortical-cerebellar networks and visuomotor impairments in ASD have not yet been clarified. 
Methods: We examined the amplitude of low frequency fluctuation (ALFF) of cortical and cerebellar brain regions during resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) in 23 individuals with ASD and 16 typically developing (TD) controls. Regions of interest (ROIs) with ALFF values significantly associated with motor variability were identified for patients and controls respectively, and their functional connectivity (FC) to each other and the rest of the brain were examined. 
Results: For TD controls, greater ALFF in bilateral cerebellar crus I, left superior temporal gyrus, left inferior frontal gyrus, right supramarginal gyrus and left angular gyrus each were associated with greater visuomotor variability. Greater ALFF in cerebellar lobule VIII was associated with less visuomotor variability. For individuals with ASD, greater ALFF in right calcarine cortex, right middle temporal gyrus (including MT/V5), left Heschl’s gyrus, left postcentral gyrus, right precentral gyrus, and left precuneus was related to greater visuomotor variability. Greater ALFF in cerebellar vermis VI was associated with less visuomotor variability. Individuals with ASD and TD controls did not show differences in ALFF for any of these ROIs. Individuals with ASD showed greater posterior cerebellar connectivity with occipital and parietal cortices relative to TD controls, and reduced FC within cerebellum and between lateral cerebellum and prefrontal and other regions of association cortex. 
Conclusion: Together, these findings suggest that increased resting oscillations within visuomotor networks in ASD are associated with more severe deficits in controlling variability during precision visuomotor behavior. Differences between individuals with ASD and TD controls in the topography of networks showing relationships to visuomotor behavior suggest atypical patterns of cerebellar-cortical specialization and connectivity in ASD that underlies previously documented visuomotor deficits.</content:encoded>

The overexpression of GGT in recurrent gliomas and low level in radiation necrosis were validated by western blot analysis and immunohistochemistry. Furthermore, the ki-67 index evaluation demonstrated the significant increase of malignancy aided by GGT-responsive fluorescent probe to screen out the right specimen through fast enhanced imaging of enzyme activity.

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Neurodegeneration section | New and Recent Articles: A Crosstalk Between Brain Cholesterol Oxidation and Glucose Metabolism in Alzheimer’s Disease</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00556</link>
	<content:encoded>In Alzheimer’s disease (AD), both cholesterol and glucose dysmetabolism precede the onset of memory deficit and contribute to the disease progression. It is indeed now believed that oxidized cholesterol in the form of oxysterols and altered glucose uptake are main triggers in AD affecting production and clearance of Aβ, and tau phosphorylation. However, only a few studies highlight the relationship between them, suggesting the importance of further extensive studies on this topic.
Recently, a molecular link was demonstrated between cholesterol oxidative metabolism and glucose uptake in the brain. In particular, 27-hydroxycholesterol, a key linker between hypercholesterolemia and the increased AD risk, is considered a biomarker for reduced glucose metabolism. In fact, its excess increases the activity of the renin-angiotensin system in the brain, thus reducing insulin-mediated glucose uptake, which has a major impact on brain functioning. Despite this important evidence regarding the role of this oxysterol in regulating glucose uptake by neurons, the involvement of other cholesterol oxidation products that have been clearly demonstrated to be key players in AD, cannot be ruled out.
This review highlights the current understanding of the potential role of cholesterol and glucose dysmetabolism in AD progression, and the bidirectional crosstalk between these two phenomena.</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Neural Technology section | New and Recent Articles: Inhomogeneities in Network Structure and Excitability Govern Initiation and Propagation of Spontaneous Burst Activity</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00543</link>
	<content:encoded>The mesoscale architecture of neuronal networks strongly influences the initiation of spontaneous activity and its pathways of propagation. 
Spontaneous activity has been studied extensively in networks of cultured cortical neurons that generate complex yet reproducible patterns of synchronous bursting events that resemble the activity dynamics in developing neuronal networks in vivo. Synchronous bursts are mostly thought to be triggered at burst initiation sites due to build-up of noise or by highly active neurons, or to reflect reverberating activity that circulates within larger networks, although neither of these has been observed directly. Inferring such collective dynamics in neuronal populations from electrophysiological recordings crucially depends on the spatial resolution and sampling ratio relative to the size of the networks assessed. Using large-scale microelectrode arrays with 1024 electrodes at 0.3 mm pitch that covered the full extent of in vitro networks on about 1 cm2, we investigated where bursts of spontaneous activity arise and how their propagation patterns relate to the regions of origin, the network’s structure, and to the overall distribution of activity. A set of alternating burst initiation zones dominated the initiation of distinct bursting events and triggered specific propagation patterns. Moreover, burst initiation zones were typically located in areas with moderate activity levels, i.e. at transitions between hot and cold spots. The activity-dependent alternation between these zones suggests that the local networks forming the dominating burst initiation zones enter a transient depressed state after several cycles (similar to Eytan et al 2003), allowing other burst initiation zones to take over temporarily. We propose that inhomogeneities in the network structure define such burst initiation zones and that the depletion of local synaptic resources limit repetitive burst initiation.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.00509</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) is one of the most concerned neurodegenerative diseases. In the last decade, studies on AD diagnosis attached great significance to artificial intelligence (AI)-based diagnostic algorithms. Among the diverse modality imaging data, T1-weighted MRI and 18F-FDG-PET are widely researched for this task. In this paper, we propose a novel convolutional neural network (CNN) to fuse the multi-modality information including T1-MRI and FDG-PDT images around the hippocampal area for the diagnosis of AD. Different from the traditional machine learning algorithms, this method does not require manually extracted features, and utilizes the state-of-art 3D image-processing CNNs to learn features for the diagnosis and prognosis of AD. To validate the performance of the proposed network, we trained the classifier with paired T1-MRI and FDG-PET images using the ADNI datasets, including 731 Normal (NL) subjects, 647 AD subjects, 441 stable MCI (sMCI) subjects and 326 progressive MCI (pMCI) subjects. We obtained the maximal accuracies of 90.10% for NL/AD task, 87.46% for NL/pMCI task, and 76.90% for sMCI/pMCI task. The proposed framework yields comparative results against state-of-the-art approaches. Moreover, the experimental results have demonstrated that (1) segmentation is not a prerequisite by using CNN, (2) the hippocampal area provides enough information to give a reference to AD diagnosis.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fninf.2019.00039</link>
	<content:encoded>Neurons which fire in a fixed temporal pattern (i.e., ``cell assemblies'') are hypothesized to be a fundamental unit of neural information processing. Several methods are available for the detection of cell assemblies without time structure. However, the systematic detection of cell assemblies with time structure has been challenging, especially in large datasets, due to the lack of efficient methods for handling the time structure. Here, we show a method to detect a variety of cell-assembly activity patterns recurring in noisy neural population activity at multiple timescales. The key innovation is the use of a computer science method for comparing strings (``edit similarity'') to group spikes into assemblies. We validated the method by using artificial data and experimental data, which were previously recorded from the hippocampus of male Long-Evans rats and the prefrontal cortex of male Brown Norway/Fisher hybrid rats. From the hippocampus, we could simultaneously extract place-cell sequences occurring on different timescales during navigation and awake replay. From the prefrontal cortex, we could discover multiple spike sequences of neurons encoding different segments of a goal-directed task. Unlike conventional event-driven statistical approaches, our method detects cell assemblies without creating event-locked averages.  Thus, the method offers a novel analytical tool for deciphering the neural code during arbitrary behavioral and mental processes.</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroinformatics | New and Recent Articles: ELFENN: A Generalized Platform for Modeling Ephaptic Coupling in Spiking Neuron Models</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fninf.2019.00035</link>
	<content:encoded>The transmembrane ionic currents that underlie changes in a cell’s membrane potential give rise to electric fields in the extracellular space. In the context of brain activity, these electric fields form the basis for extracellularly recorded signals such as multiunit activity, local field potentials and electroencephalograms. Understanding the underlying neuronal dynamics and localizing current sources using these signals is often challenging, and therefore effective computational modeling approaches are critical. Typically, the electric fields from neural activity are modeled in a post-hoc form, i.e. a traditional neuronal model is used to first generate the membrane currents, which in turn are then used to calculate the electric fields. When the conductivity of the extracellular space is high, the electric fields are weak, and therefore treating membrane currents and electric fields separately is justified. However, in brain regions of lower conductivity, extracellular fields can feed back and significantly influence the underlying transmembrane currents and dynamics of nearby neurons – this is often referred to as ephaptic coupling. The closed-loop nature of ephaptic coupling cannot be modeled using the post-hoc approaches implemented by existing software tools; instead, electric fields and neuronal dynamics must be solved simultaneously. To this end, we have developed a generalized modeling toolbox for studying ephaptic coupling in compartmental neuron models: ELFENN (ELectric Field Effects in Neural Networks). In open loop conditions, we validate the separate components of ELFENN for modeling membrane dynamics and associated field potentials against standard approaches (NEURON and LFPy). Unlike standard approaches however, ELFENN enables the closed-loop condition to be modeled as well, in that the field potentials can feed back and influence membrane dynamics. As an example closed-loop case, we use ELFENN to study phase-locking of action potentials generated by a population of axons running parallel in a bundle. Being able to efficiently explore ephaptic coupling from a computational perspective using tools such as ELFENN will allow us to better understand the physical basis of electric fields in the brain, as well as the conditions in which these fields may influence neuronal dynamics in general.</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroanatomy | New and Recent Articles: Distribution of GABAergic Neurons and VGluT1 and VGAT Immunoreactive Boutons in the Ferret (Mustela putorius) Piriform Cortex and Endopiriform Nucleus. Comparison With Visual Areas 17, 18 and 19</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnana.2019.00054</link>
	<content:encoded>We studied the cellular organization of the piriform network (comprising the piriform cortex and endopiriform nucleus) of the ferret (Mustela putorius) -a highly excitable region prone to seizures- and, more specifically, the distribution and morphology of different types of GABAergic neurons, and the distribution and ratio of glutamatergic and GABAergic boutons, and we compared our findings to those in primary visual area 17, and secondary areas 18 and 19. We accomplished this by using cytochrome oxidase and immunohistochemistry for mature neuronal nuclei (NeuN), GABAergic neurons (glutamic acid decarboxylase-67, calretinin and parvalbumin), and for excitatory (vesicular glutamate transporter 1; VGluT1) and inhibitory (vesicular GABA transporter; VGAT) boutons. In the ferret, the cellular organization of the piriform network is similar to that described in other species such as cats, rats and opossums although some differences also exist. GABAergic immunolabeling showed similarities between cortical layers I-III of the piriform cortex and visual areas, such as the relative distribution of GABAergic neurons and the density and area of VGluT1- and VGAT-immunoreactive boutons. However, multiple differences between the piriform network and visual areas (layers I-VI) were found, such as the percentage of GABAergic neurons with respect to the total number of neurons and the ratio of VGluT1- and VGAT-immunoreactive boutons. These findings are relevant to better understand the high excitability of the piriform network.</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroanatomy | New and Recent Articles: The Anatomical Boundary of the Rat Claustrum</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnana.2019.00053</link>
	<content:encoded>The claustrum is a subcortical nucleus that exhibits dense connectivity across the neocortex. Considerable recent progress has been made in establishing its genetic and anatomical characteristics, however a core, contentious issue that regularly presents in the literature pertains to the rostral extent of its anatomical boundary. The present study addressed this issue in the rat brain.
Using a combination of immunohistochemistry and  neuroanatomical tract tracing, we have examined the expression profiles of several genes that have previously been identified as exhibiting a differential expression profile in the claustrum relative to the surrounding cortex. The expression profiles of parvalbumin (PV), crystallin mu (Crym), and guanine nucleotide binding protein (G protein), gamma 2 (Gng2) were assessed immunohistochemically alongside, or in combination with cortical anterograde, or retrograde tracer injections. Retrograde tracer injections into various thalamic nuclei were used to further establish the rostral border of the claustrum. 
Expression of all three markers delineated a nuclear boundary that extended considerably (~500 µm) beyond the anterior horn of the neostriatum. Cortical retrograde and anterograde tracer injections, respectively, revealed distributions of cortically-projecting claustral neurons and cortical efferent inputs to the claustrum that overlapped with the gene marker-derived claustrum boundary. Finally, retrograde tracer injections into the thalamus revealed insular cortico-thalamic projections encapsulating a claustral area with strongly diminished cell label, that extended rostral to the striatum.</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Lifespan Intellectual Factors, Genetic Susceptibility, and Cognitive Phenotypes in Aging: Implications for Interventions</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2019.00129</link>
	<content:encoded>Along with rapid global population aging, the age-related cognitive disorders such as mild cognitive impairment and dementia have posed a serious threat to public health, health care system, and sustainable economic and societal development of all countries. In this narrative review, we seek to summarize the major epidemiological studies from the life-course perspective that investigate the influence of genetic susceptibility (e.g., APOE ε4 allele and BDNF) and intellectual or psychosocial factors (e.g., educational attainments and leisure activities) as well as their interactions on cognitive phenotypes in aging. Numerous population-based studies have suggested that early-life educational attainments and socioeconomic status, midlife work complexity and social engagements, late-life leisure activities (social, physical, and mentally-stimulating activities), certain personality traits (e.g., high neuroticism and low conscientiousness), and depression significantly affect late-life cognitive phenotypes. Furthermore, certain intellectual or psychosocial factors (e.g., leisure activities and depression) may interact with genetic susceptibility (e.g., APOE ε4 allele) to affect the phenotypes of cognitive aging such that risk or beneficial effects of these factors on cognitive function may vary by carrying the susceptibility genes. The cognitive reserve hypothesis has been proposed to partly explain the beneficial effects of lifetime intellectual and psychosocial factors on late-life cognitive function. This implies that, from a life-course perspective, preventive intervention strategies targeting those modifiable intellectual or psychosocial factors could interfere with clinical expression of the cognitive phenotypes in aging and delay the onset of dementia syndrome, and thus, may help achieve healthy brain aging.</content:encoded>

Known exceptions include canonical imprinted genes, random X-chromosome inactivation, olfactory receptors and clustered protocadherins. Here, we highlight recent studies showing that allele-specific expression is frequent in the genome and involves subtypes of epigenetic allelic effects that differ in terms of heritability, clonality and stability over time. Different forms of epigenetic allele regulation could have different roles in brain development, function, and disease. An emerging area involves understanding allelic effects in a cell-type and developmental stage-specific manner and determining how these effects influence the impact of genetic variants and mutations on the brain. A deeper understanding of epigenetics at the allele and cellular level in the brain could help clarify the mechanisms underlying phenotypic variance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded>
