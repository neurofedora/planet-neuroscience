	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: GABAergic neurons and Nav1.1 channel hyperactivity: a novel neocortex-specific mechanism of cortical spreading depression.</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.03.14.991158v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Cortical spreading depression (CSD) is a pathologic mechanism of migraine. We have identified a novel neocortex-specific mechanism of CSD initiation and a novel pathological role of GABAergic neurons. Mutations of the NaV1.1 sodium channel (the SCN1A gene), which is particularly important for GABAergic neurons excitability, cause Familial Hemiplegic Migraine type-3 (FHM3), a subtype of migraine with aura. They induce gain-of-function of NaV1.1 and hyperexcitability of GABAergic interneurons in culture. However, the mechanism linking these dysfunctions to CSD and FHM3 has not been elucidated. Here, we show that NaV1.1 gain-of-function, induced by the specific activator Hm1a, or mimicked by optogenetic-induced hyperactivity of cortical GABAergic neurons, is sufficient to ignite CSD by spiking-generated extracellular K+ build-up. This mechanism is neocortex specific because, with these approaches, CSD was not generated in other brain areas. GABAergic and glutamatergic synaptic transmission is not required for optogenetic CSD initiation, but glutamatergic transmission is implicated in CSD propagation. Thus, our results reveal the key role of hyper-activation of Nav1.1 and GABAergic neurons in a novel mechanism of CSD initiation, which is relevant for FHM3 and possibly also for other types of migraine.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Differential encoding in prefrontal cortex projection neuron classes across cognitive tasks</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.03.14.991018v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Single-cell transcriptomics has been widely applied to classify neurons in the mammalian brain, while systems neuroscience has historically analyzed the encoding properties of cortical neurons without considering cell types. Here we examine how specific transcriptomic types of mouse prefrontal cortex (PFC) projection neurons relate to axonal projections and encoding properties across multiple cognitive tasks. We found that most types projected to multiple targets, and most targets received projections from multiple types, except PFC[-&amp;gt;]PAG (periaqueductal gray). By comparing Ca2+-activity of the molecularly homogeneous PFC[-&amp;gt;]PAG type against two heterogeneous classes in several two-alternative choice tasks in freely-moving mice, we found that all task-related signals assayed were qualitatively present in all examined classes. However, PAG-projecting neurons most potently encoded choice in cued tasks, whereas contralateral PFC-projecting neurons most potently encoded reward context in an uncued task. Thus, task signals are organized redundantly, but with clear quantitative biases across cells of specific molecular-anatomical characteristics.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Increased Ethanol Intake is Associated with Social Anxiety in Offspring Exposed to Ethanol on Gestational Day 12</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.03.13.991562v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) can result in physical, cognitive, and neurological deficits termed Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD). Deficits in social functioning associated with PAE are frequently observed and persist throughout the lifespan. Social impairments, such as social anxiety, are associated with increased alcohol abuse, which is also highly pervasive following PAE. Yet, the relationship between PAE-induced social alterations and alcohol intake later in life is not well understood. In order to test this relationship, we exposed pregnant female Sprague Dawley rats to a single instance of PAE on gestational day 12 and tested offspring in adulthood (postnatal day 63) in a modified social interaction test followed by alternating alone and social ethanol intake sessions. Consistent with our previous findings, we found that, in general, PAE reduced social preference (measure of social anxiety-like behavior) in female but not male adults. However, ethanol intake was significantly higher in the PAE group regardless of sex. When dividing subjects according to level of social anxiety-like behavior (low, medium, or high), PAE males (under both drinking contexts) and control females (under the social drinking context) with a high social anxiety phenotype showed the highest level of ethanol intake. Taken together, these data indicate that PAE differentially affects the interactions between social anxiety, ethanol intake, and drinking context in males and females. These findings extend our understanding of the complexity and persistence of PAE's sex-dependent effects into adulthood.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>The inability to specifically identify and manipulate synaptic glial cells remains a major obstacle to understanding fundamental aspects of synapse formation, stability and repair. Using a combinatorial gene expression approach, we discovered molecular markers that allow us to specifically label perisynaptic Schwann cells (PSCs), glial cells at neuromuscular synapses. Using these markers, we demonstrate that PSCs fully-differentiate postnatally and have a unique molecular signature that includes genes predicted and known to play critical roles at synapses. These findings will serve as a springboard for unprecedented approaches for studying molecular determinants of PSC differentiation and function at neuromuscular synapses and possibly synapse-associated glia throughout the CNS.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: CRISPR-TRAPSeq identifies the QKI RNA binding protein as important for astrocytic maturation and control of thalamocortical synapses.</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.03.13.991224v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Quaking RNA binding protein(QKI) is essential for oligodendrocyte development as myelination requires MBP mRNA regulation and localization by the cytoplasmic isoforms(e.g. QKI-6). QKI-6 is also highly expressed in astrocytes, which were recently demonstrated to have regulated mRNA localization. Here, we show via CLIPseq that QKI-6 binds 3'UTRs of a subset of astrocytic mRNAs, including many enriched in peripheral processes. Binding is enriched near stop codons, which is mediated partially by QKI binding motifs(QBMs) yet spreads to adjacent sequences. We developed CRISPR TRAPseq: a viral approach for mosaic, cell-type specific gene mutation with simultaneous translational profiling. This enabled study of QKI-deleted astrocytes in an otherwise normal brain. Astrocyte-targeted QKI deletion altered translation and maturation, while also increasing synaptic density within the astrocyte's territory. Overall, our data indicate QKI is required for astrocyte maturation and demonstrate an approach for a highly targeted translational assessment of gene knockout in specific cell-types in vivo.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Automated curation of CNMF-E-extracted ROI spatial footprints and calcium traces using open-source AutoML tools</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.03.13.991216v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>In vivo 1-photon calcium imaging is an increasingly prevalent method in behavioural neuroscience. Numerous analysis pipelines have been developed to improve the reliability and scalability of pre-processing and ROI extraction for these large calcium imaging datasets. Despite these advancements in pre-processing methods, manual curation of the extracted spatial footprints and calcium traces of neurons remains important for quality control. Here, we propose an additional semi-automated curation step for sorting spatial footprints and calcium traces from putative neurons extracted using the popular CNMF-E algorithm. We used the automated machine learning tools TPOT and AutoSklearn to generate classifiers to curate the extracted ROIs trained on a subset of human-labeled data. AutoSklearn produced the best performing classifier, achieving an F1 score &amp;gt; 92% on the ground truth test dataset. This automated approach is a useful strategy for filtering ROIs with relatively few labeled data points, and can be easily added to pre-existing pipelines currently using CNMF-E for ROI extraction.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.03.13.990671v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Fear of heights is evolutionarily important for survival, yet it is unclear how and which brain regions encode such height threats. Given the importance of the basolateral amygdala (BLA) in processing both learned and innate fear, we investigated how BLA neurons may respond to high place exposure in freely behaving mice. We found that a discrete set of BLA neurons exhibited robust firing increases when the mouse was either exploring or placed on a high place, accompanied by increased heart rate and freezing. Importantly, these high-place fear neurons were only activated under height threats but not mild anxiogenic conditions. Furthermore, after a fear conditioning procedure, these high-place fear neurons developed conditioned responses to the context, but not the cue, indicating a convergence in encoding of dangerous/risky contextual information. Our results provide insights into the neural representation of the fear of heights and may have implications for treatment of excessive fear disorders.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Arterial pulsations drive oscillatory flow of CSF but not directional pumping</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.03.13.990655v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>The brain lacks a traditional lymphatic system for metabolite clearance. The existence a &quot;glymphatic system&quot; where metabolites are removed from the brain's extracellular space by convective exchange between interstitial fluid (ISF) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) along the paravascular spaces (PVS) around cerebral blood vessels has been controversial for nearly a decade. While recent work has shown clear evidence of directional flow of CSF in the PVS in anesthetized mice, the driving force for the observed fluid flow remains elusive. The heartbeat-driven peristaltic pulsation of arteries has been proposed as a probable driver of directed CSF flow. In this study, we use rigorous fluid dynamic simulations to provide a physical interpretation for peristaltic pumping of fluids. Our simulations match the experimental results and show that arterial pulsations only drive oscillatory motion of CSF in the PVS. The observed directional CSF flow can be explained by naturally occurring and/or experimenter-generated pressure differences.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.03.13.990549v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Parallel processing circuits are thought to dramatically expand the network capabilities of the nervous system. Magnocellular and parvocellular oxytocin neurons have been proposed to subserve two parallel streams of social information processing, which allow a single molecule to encode a diverse array of ethologically distinct behaviors, although to date direct evidence to support this hypothesis is lacking. Here we provide the first comprehensive characterization of magnocellular and parvocellular oxytocin neurons, validated across anatomical, projection target, electrophysiological, and transcriptional criteria. We next used novel multiple feature selection tools in Fmr1 KO mice to provide direct evidence that normal functioning of the parvocellular but not magnocellular oxytocin pathway is required for autism-relevant social reward behavior. Finally, we demonstrate that autism risk genes are uniquely enriched in parvocellular oxytocin neurons. Taken together these results provide the first evidence that oxytocin pathway specific pathogenic mechanisms account for social impairments across a broad range of autism etiologies.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Leptin Receptors in RIP-Cre25Mgn neurons Mediate Anti-Dyslipidemia Effects of Leptin in Insulin-Deficient Male Mice</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.03.13.989442v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Leptin is a potent endocrine hormone produced by adipose tissue and regulates a broad range of metabolism including glucose and lipid metabolism, with and without insulin. It is evident that central leptin signaling can lower hyperglycemia in insulin-deficient rodents via multiple mechanisms including restoration of dyslipidemia. However, the specific neurons that regulate these glucose-lowering and anti-dyslipidemia effects of leptin remain unidentified. Here we report that leptin receptors (LEPRs) in neurons expressing Cre recombinase driven by a short fragment of a promoter region of Ins2 gene (RIP-Cre25Mgn neurons) are required for central leptin signaling to reverse hyperglycemia and dyslipidemia in insulin-deficient mice. Ablation of LEPRs in RIP-Cre25Mgn neurons completely blocks glucose-lowering effects of leptin in insulin-deficient mice. Further investigations reveal that insulin-deficient mice lacking LEPRs in RIP-Cre25Mgn neurons (RIP-Cre{triangleup}LEPR mice) exhibit greater lipid levels in blood and liver compared to wild-type controls, and that leptin injection into the brain does not suppress dyslipidemia in insulin-deficient RIP-Cre{triangleup}LEPR mice. Leptin administration into the brain combined with acipimox, which lowers blood lipids by suppressing triglyceride lipase activity, can restore normal glycemia in insulin-deficient RIP-Cre{triangleup}LEPR mice, suggesting that excess circulating lipids are a driving-force of hyperglycemia in insulin-deficient RIP-Cre{triangleup}LEPR mice. Collectively, our data demonstrate that LEPRs in RIP-Cre25Mgn neurons significantly contribute to glucose-lowering effects of leptin in an insulin-independent manner by suppression of dyslipidemia.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: The breadth-depth dilemma in a finite capacity model of decision-making</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.03.13.987081v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Decision-makers are often faced with limited information about the outcomes of their choices. Current formalizations of uncertain choice, such as the explore-exploit dilemma, do not apply well to decisions in which search capacity can be allocated to each option in variable amounts. Such choices confront decision-makers with the need to tradeoff between breadth (allocating a small amount of capacity to each of many options) and depth (focusing capacity on a few options). We formalize the breadth-depth dilemma through a finite sample capacity model. We find that, if capacity is smaller than 4-7 samples, it is optimal to draw one sample per alternative, favoring breadth. However, for larger capacities, a sharp transition is observed, and it becomes best to deeply sample a very small fraction of alternatives, that decreases with the square root of capacity. Thus, ignoring most options, even when capacity is large enough to shallowly sample all of them, reflects a signature of optimal behavior. Our results also provide a rich casuistic for metareasoning in multi-alternative decisions with bounded capacity.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Human and macaque pairs coordinate differently in a dyadic decision game with face-to-face action visibility</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.03.13.983551v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Interactions of group-living primates with conspecifics range from cooperation to competition. Game theory allows testing the strategies that underlie such interactions, but in classical theory, agents act simultaneously or sequentially. Many real-world decisions, however, are made while directly observing partner's actions. To investigate social decision-making under conditions of face-to-face action visibility, we developed a setup where two agents observe each other and reach to targets on a shared transparent display, enabling naturalistic interactions we call &quot;transparent games&quot;. Here we compared human and macaque pairs in the transparent version of the coordination game &quot;Bach or Stravinsky&quot;, which rewards coordination but entails the conflict about which of the two individually-preferred coordinated options to choose. Most human pairs developed coordinated behavior, and 53% adopted dynamic coordination via turn-taking to equalize the payoffs. All macaque pairs also converged on coordination, but in a simpler, static way: persistently selecting one of the two coordinated options or one of the two display sides. Two animals that underwent training with a turn-taking human confederate learned to coordinate dynamically. When tested as a pair, they mostly converged on the faster monkey's preferred option, and a dynamic coordination emerged as animals spontaneously took turns in leading to their respective preferred option and following to the other's. The observed choices were captured by modeling a probability to see the other's action before own movement. Importantly, such competitive turn-taking was unlike the benevolent turn-taking in humans, who equally often initiated switches to and from their preferred option. Our findings demonstrate that dynamic coordination is not restricted to humans - although it serves a selfish motivation in macaques - and emphasize the importance of action visibility in the emergence and maintenance of coordination.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>The daily cycling of sleep and arousal states are among the most prominent biological rhythms under circadian control. While much is known about the core circadian clock1,2, how this clock regulates sleep and arousal remains poorly understood3. In Drosophila, we previously characterized WIDE AWAKE (WAKE), a clock-output molecule that promotes sleep at night4,5. Here, we show that the function of WAKE is conserved in mice and that mWAKE+ neurons comprise a clock-regulated arousal system. Besides the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), mWAKE is expressed in the dorsomedial hypothalamus (DMH) and other arousal-related regions. mWAKE mutants exhibit increased spiking of mWAKE+ neurons and increased behavioural arousal at night. In the DMH, mWAKE labels a novel circuit that promotes wakefulness and is required for rapid eye-movement sleep. Single-cell sequencing, immunostaining, and patch-clamp experiments reveal that mWAKE+ neurons constitute a glutamatergic/gabaergic population that projects widely, receives neuromodulatory input, and acts on neuromodulatory neurons. Strikingly, broad chemogenetic silencing of mWAKE+ cells leads to profound loss of behavioural responsiveness and low amplitude, low frequency electroencephalography waveforms. These findings suggest that the genetic mechanisms regulating circadian control of sleep and arousal are conserved across &amp;gt;500 million years of evolution and define a clock-regulated neural network critical for arousal.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Selective gating of retinal information by arousal</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.03.12.989913v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>How sensory information is processed by the brain can depend on behavioral state. In the visual thalamus and cortex, arousal/locomotion is associated with changes in the magnitude of responses to visual stimuli. Here, we asked whether such modulation of visual responses might already occur at an earlier stage in this visual pathway. We measured neural activity of retinal axons using wide-field and two-photon calcium imaging in awake mouse thalamus across arousal states associated with different pupil sizes. Surprisingly, visual responses to drifting gratings in retinal axonal boutons were robustly modulated by arousal level, in a manner that varied across stimulus dimensions and across functionally distinct subsets of boutons. At low and intermediate spatial frequencies, the majority of boutons were suppressed by arousal. In contrast, at high spatial frequencies, the proportions of boutons showing enhancement or suppression were more similar, particularly for boutons tuned to regions of visual space ahead of the mouse. Arousal-related modulation also varied with a bouton's sensitivity to luminance changes and direction of motion, with greater response suppression in boutons tuned to luminance decrements vs. increments, and in boutons preferring motion along directions or axes of optic flow. Together, our results suggest that differential filtering of distinct visual information channels by arousal state occurs at very early stages of visual processing, before the information is transmitted to neurons in visual thalamus. Such early filtering may provide an efficient means of optimizing central visual processing and perception of state-relevant visual stimuli.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.03.12.989871v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Anatomic evaluation is an important aspect of many studies in neuroscience; however, it often lacks information about the three-dimensional structure of the brain. With appropriate contrast, micro-CT imaging provides an excellent, nondestructive, method for the evaluation of brain structure, but currently available protocols are labor intensive, use hazardous compounds, complicate standard histological analysis, and require the removal of the skull. Here we present a simple protocol that solves those problems. We use eosin in combination with bone decalcification to create contrast in the tissue and then employ monochromatic and propagation phase-contrast micro-CT imaging to enable the imaging of brain structure with the preservation of the surrounding skull. Instead of relying on descriptive, time-consuming, or subjective methods, we develop simple quantitative analyses to map the locations of recording electrodes and to characterize the presence and extent of brain lesions.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.03.12.989848v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Epidemiological studies indicate that obstructive sleep apnoea is a strong risk factor for the development of Alzheimer's disease but the mechanisms of the risk remain unclear. We developed a method of modelling obstructive sleep apnoea in mice that replicates key features of human obstructive sleep apnoea: altered breathing during sleep, sleep disruption, moderate intermittent hypoxemia and cognitive impairment. When we induced obstructive sleep apnoea in a familial Alzheimer's disease model, the mice displayed exacerbation of cognitive impairment and pathological features of Alzheimer's disease, including increased levels of amyloid-beta and inflammatory markers, as well as selective degeneration of cholinergic basal forebrain neurons. These pathological features were not induced by chronic hypoxia or sleep disruption alone. Our results also revealed that the neurodegeneration was mediated by the oxygen-sensitive p75 neurotrophin receptor and hypoxia inducible factor 1 alpha activity. Furthermore, restoring blood oxygen levels during sleep to prevent intermittent hypoxia prevented the pathological change induced by the OSA. These findings provide a signalling mechanism by which obstructive sleep apnoea induces cholinergic basal forebrain degeneration and could thereby increase the risk of developing Alzheimer's disease, as well as providing a rationale for testing a range of possible prophylactic treatment options for people with obstructive sleep apnoea and hypoxia including increased compliance of continuous positive airway pressure therapy.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Limited correspondence in visual representation between the human brain and convolutional neural networks</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.03.12.989376v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have achieved very high object categorization performance recently. It has increasingly become a common practice in human fMRI research to regard CNNs as working model of the human visual system. Here we reevaluate this approach by comparing fMRI responses from the human brain in three experiments with those from 14 different CNNs. Our visual stimuli included original and filtered versions of real-world object images and images of artificial objects. Replicating previous findings, we found a brain-CNN correspondence in a number of CNNs with lower and higher levels of visual representations in the human brain better resembling those of lower and higher CNN layers, respectively. Moreover, the lower layers of some CNNs could fully capture the representational structure of human early visual areas for both the original and filtered real-world object images. Despite these successes, no CNN examined could fully capture the representational structure of higher human visual processing areas. They also failed to capture that of artificial object images in all levels of visual processing. The latter is particularly troublesome, as decades of vision research has demonstrated that the same algorithms used in the processing of natural images would support the processing of artificial visual stimuli in the primate brain. Similar results were obtained when a CNN was trained with stylized object images that emphasized shape representation. CNNs likely represent visual information in fundamentally different ways from the human brain. Current CNNs thus may not serve as sound working models of the human visual system.</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Performance of virtual screening against GPCR homology models: Impact of template selection and treatment of binding site plasticity</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/3s2xA9w3VrQ/article</link>

Rational drug design for G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) is limited by the small number of available atomic resolution structures. We assessed the use of homology modeling to predict the structures of two therapeutically relevant GPCRs and strategies to improve the performance of virtual screening against modeled binding sites. Homology models of the D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; dopamine (D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;R) and serotonin 5-HT&lt;sub&gt;2A&lt;/sub&gt; receptors (5-HT&lt;sub&gt;2A&lt;/sub&gt;R) were generated based on crystal structures of 16 different GPCRs. Comparison of the homology models to D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;R and 5-HT&lt;sub&gt;2A&lt;/sub&gt;R crystal structures showed that accurate predictions could be obtained, but not necessarily using the most closely related template. Assessment of virtual screening performance was based on molecular docking of ligands and decoys. The results demonstrated that several templates and multiple models based on each of these must be evaluated to identify the optimal binding site structure. Models based on aminergic GPCRs displayed ligand enrichment and there was a trend toward improved virtual screening performance with increasing binding site accuracy. The best models even displayed ligand enrichment better than that of the D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;R and 5-HT&lt;sub&gt;2A&lt;/sub&gt;R crystal structures. Methods to consider binding site plasticity were explored to further improve predictions. Molecular docking to ensembles of structures did not outperform the best individual binding site models, but could increase the diversity of hits from virtual screens and be advantageous for GPCR targets with few known ligands. Molecular dynamics refinement resulted in moderate improvements of structural accuracy and the virtual screening performance of snapshots was either comparable to or worse than that of the raw homology models. These results provide guidelines for successful application of structure-based ligand discovery using GPCR homology models.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/3s2xA9w3VrQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Modelling the epidemiology of residual &lt;i&gt;Plasmodium vivax&lt;/i&gt; malaria in a heterogeneous host population: A case study in the Amazon Basin</title>

The overall malaria burden in the Americas has decreased dramatically over the past two decades, but residual transmission pockets persist across the Amazon Basin, where &lt;i&gt;Plasmodium vivax&lt;/i&gt; is the predominant infecting species. Current elimination efforts require a better quantitative understanding of malaria transmission dynamics for planning, monitoring, and evaluating interventions at the community level. This can be achieved with mathematical models that properly account for risk heterogeneity in communities approaching elimination, where few individuals disproportionately contribute to overall malaria prevalence, morbidity, and onwards transmission. Here we analyse demographic information combined with routinely collected malaria morbidity data from the town of Mâncio Lima, the main urban transmission hotspot of Brazil. We estimate the proportion of high-risk subjects in the host population by fitting compartmental susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) transmission models simultaneously to age-stratified vivax malaria incidence densities and the frequency distribution of &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;vivax&lt;/i&gt; malaria attacks experienced by each individual over 12 months. Simulations with the best-fitting SIS model indicate that 20% of the hosts contribute 86% of the overall vivax malaria burden. Despite the low overall force of infection typically found in the Amazon, about one order of magnitude lower than that in rural Africa, high-risk individuals gradually develop clinical immunity following repeated infections and eventually constitute a substantial infectious reservoir comprised of asymptomatic parasite carriers that is overlooked by routine surveillance but likely fuels onwards malaria transmission. High-risk individuals therefore represent a priority target for more intensive and effective interventions that may not be readily delivered to the entire community.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/t9McFNjeAq0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Formation of phage lysis patterns and implications on co-propagation of phages and motile host bacteria</title>

Coexistence of bacteriophages, or phages, and their host bacteria plays an important role in maintaining the microbial communities. In natural environments with limited nutrients, motile bacteria can actively migrate towards locations of richer resources. Although phages are not motile themselves, they can infect motile bacterial hosts and spread in space via the hosts. Therefore, in a migrating microbial community coexistence of bacteria and phages implies their co-propagation in space. Here, we combine an experimental approach and mathematical modeling to explore how phages and their motile host bacteria coexist and co-propagate. When lytic phages encountered motile host bacteria in our experimental set up, a sector-shaped lysis zone formed. Our mathematical model indicates that local nutrient depletion and the resulting inhibition of proliferation and motility of bacteria and phages are the key to formation of the observed lysis pattern. The model further reveals the straight radial boundaries in the lysis pattern as a telltale sign for coexistence and co-propagation of bacteria and phages. Emergence of such a pattern, albeit insensitive to extrinsic factors, requires a balance between intrinsic biological properties of phages and bacteria, which likely results from coevolution of phages and bacteria.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Mt22RpZ9ec0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Direct Comparison of Odor Responses of Homologous Glomeruli in the Medial and Lateral Maps of the Mouse Olfactory Bulb</title>
	<link>http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/7/2/ENEURO.0449-19.2020?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) expressing same-type odorant receptors typically project to a pair of glomeruli in the medial and lateral sides of the olfactory bulbs (OBs) in rodents. This multiple glomerular representation of homologous inputs is considered to have more important functional roles for odor information processing than the redundant backup system. However, a consensus idea is lacking and this hinders interpretation of the phenomenon. In addition, the shared and unique odorant response properties of the homologous glomeruli remain unclear because the majority of medial glomeruli are hidden in the septal OB, and thus it is difficult to directly compare them. OSNs, which express trace amine-associated odorant receptors (TAARs), were recently identified that project to a pair of glomeruli uniquely located in the dorsal OB. In this study, we measured the odorant-induced calcium responses of homologous pairs of TAAR glomeruli simultaneously in anesthetized mice and directly compared their response patterns. We found that they exhibited similar temporal response patterns and could not find differences in onset latency, rise time, decay time, or response amplitude. However, the medial glomeruli had significantly larger respiration-locked calcium fluctuations than the lateral glomeruli. This trend was observed with/without odorant stimulation in postsynaptic neurons of GABAergic, dopaminergic, and mitral/tufted cells, but not in presynaptic olfactory sensory axon terminals. This indicates that, at least in these TAAR glomeruli, the medial rather than the lateral OB map enhances the respiration-locked rhythm and transfers this information to higher brain centers.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>RSS PAP: Development of perineuronal nets during ontogeny correlates with sensorimotor vocal learning in canaries</title>
	<link>http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0361-19.2020v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Songbirds are a powerful model to study vocal learning given that aspects of the underlying behavioral and neurobiological mechanisms are analogous in many ways to mechanisms involved in speech learning. Perineuronal nets (PNN) represent one of the mechanisms controlling the closing of sensitive periods for vocal learning in the songbird brain. In zebra finches, PNN develop around parvalbumin-expressing interneurons in selected song control nuclei during ontogeny and their development is delayed if juveniles are deprived of a tutor. However, song learning in zebra finches takes place during a relatively short period of development and it is difficult to determine whether PNN development correlates with the end of the sensory or the sensorimotor learning period. Canaries have a longer period of sensorimotor vocal learning, spanning over their first year of life so that it should be easier to test whether PNN development correlates with the end of sensory or sensorimotor vocal learning. Here we quantified PNN around PV-interneurons in the brain of male canaries from hatching until the first breeding season and analyzed in parallel the development of their song. PNN development around PV-interneurons specifically took place and their number reached its maximum around the end of the sensorimotor learning stage, well after the end of sensory vocal learning, and correlated with song development. This suggests that PNN are specifically involved in the termination of the sensitive period for sensorimotor vocal learning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance statement&lt;/b&gt; Perineuronal nets (PNN) are accumulations of components of the extracellular matrix that form usually around parvalbumin-expressing inhibitory neurons. PNN have been associated with various forms of experience- or activity-dependent learning in mammals where they appear to control the end of sensitive periods for learning. It was recently demonstrated that PNN are associated with vocal learning in juveniles and adults of several species of songbirds, but the specific aspect of the learning process they control has not been formally identified. We demonstrate here that during ontogeny in male canaries, PNN develop essentially during the sensorimotor phase of song learning, which suggests that they represent part of the neuronal mechanisms underlying song crystallization.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Human observers perceptually discriminate the dynamic deformation of materials in the real world. However, the psychophysical and neural mechanisms responsible for the perception of dynamic deformation have not been fully elucidated. By using a deforming bar as the stimulus, we showed that the spatial frequency of deformation was a critical determinant of deformation perception. Simulating the response of direction-selective units (i.e., MT pattern motion cells) to stimuli, we found that the perception of dynamic deformation was well explained by assuming a higher-order mechanism monitoring the spatial pattern of direction responses. Our model with the higher-order mechanism also successfully explained the appearance of a visual illusion wherein a static bar apparently deforms against a tilted drifting grating. In particular, it was the lower spatial frequencies in this pattern that strongly contributed to the deformation perception. Finally, by manipulating the luminance of the static bar, we observed that the mechanism for the illusory deformation was more sensitive to luminance than contrast cues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; From the psychophysical and computational points of view, the present study tried to answer the question, &quot;how do human observers see deformation?&quot;. In the psychophysical experiment, we used a clip wherein a bar dynamically deformed. We also tested the illusory deformation of a bar, which was caused by tilted drifting grating, because it was unclear whether the illusory deformation could be described by our model. In the computational analysis, in order to explain psychophysical data for deformation perception, it was necessary to assume an additional unit monitoring the spatial pattern of direction responses of MT cells that were sensitive to local image motion.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Fifty years have passed since David Marr, Masao Ito, and James Albus proposed
seminal models of cerebellar functions. These models share the essential
concept that parallel-fiber-Purkinje-cell synapses undergo plastic changes,
guided by climbing-fiber activities during sensorimotor learning. However, they
differ in several important respects, including holistic versus complementary
roles of the cerebellum, pattern recognition versus control as computational
objectives, potentiation versus depression of synaptic plasticity, teaching
signals versus error signals transmitted by climbing-fibers, sparse expansion
coding by granule cells, and cerebellar internal models. In this review, we
evaluate the different features of the three models based on recent
computational and experimental studies. While acknowledging that the three
models have greatly advanced our understanding of cerebellar control mechanisms
in eye movements and classical conditioning, we propose a new direction for
computational frameworks of the cerebellum. That is, hierarchical reinforcement
learning with multiple internal models.

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2020.00010</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The post-synaptic density protein 95 (PSD-95) plays a central role in excitatory synapse development and synaptic plasticity. Phosphorylation of the N-terminus of PSD-95 at threonine 19 (T19) and serine 25 (S25) decreases PSD-95 stability at synapses; however, a molecular mechanism linking PSD-95 phosphorylation to altered synaptic stability is lacking. Here, we show that phosphorylation of T19/S25 recruits the phosphorylation-dependent peptidyl-prolyl cis–trans isomerase (Pin1) and reduces the palmitoylation of Cysteine 3 and Cysteine 5 in PSD-95. This reduction in PSD-95 palmitoylation accounts for the observed loss in the number of dendritic PSD-95 clusters, the increased AMPAR mobility, and the decreased number of functional excitatory synapses. We find the effects of Pin1 overexpression were all rescued by manipulations aimed at increasing the levels of PSD-95 palmitoylation. Therefore, Pin1 is a key signaling molecule that regulates the stability of excitatory synapses and may participate in the destabilization of PSD-95 following the induction of synaptic plasticity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Objectives: A neurophysiologic biomarker for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is highly desirable and can improve diagnosis, monitoring, and assessment of therapeutic response among children with ASD. We investigated the utility of continuous theta-burst stimulation (cTBS) applied to the motor cortex (M1) as a biomarker for children and adolescents with high-functioning (HF) ASD compared to their age- and gender-matched typically developing (TD) controls. We also compared the developmental trajectory of long-term depression- (LTD-) like plasticity in the two groups. Finally, we explored the influence of a common brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) polymorphism on cTBS aftereffects in a subset of the ASD group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Twenty-nine children and adolescents (age range 10–16) in ASD (n = 11) and TD (n = 18) groups underwent M1 cTBS. Changes in MEP amplitude at 5–60 min post-cTBS and their cumulative measures in each group were calculated. We also assessed the relationship between age and maximum cTBS-induced MEP suppression (ΔMEP&lt;sub&gt;Max&lt;/sub&gt;) in each group. Finally, we compared cTBS aftereffects in BDNF Val/Val (n = 4) and Val/Met (n = 4) ASD participants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Cumulative cTBS aftereffects were significantly more facilitatory in the ASD group than in the TD group (P&lt;sub&gt;FDR&lt;/sub&gt;’s &amp;lt; 0.03). ΔMEP&lt;sub&gt;Max&lt;/sub&gt; was negatively correlated with age in the ASD group (r = −0.67, P = 0.025), but not in the TD group (r = −0.12, P = 0.65). Cumulative cTBS aftereffects were not significantly different between the two BDNF subgroups (P-values &amp;gt; 0.18).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: The results support the utility of cTBS measures of cortical plasticity as a biomarker for children and adolescents with HF-ASD and an aberrant developmental trajectory of LTD-like plasticity in ASD.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Neurodegeneration section | New and Recent Articles: A Systematic Bioinformatics Workflow With Meta-Analytics Identified Potential Pathogenic Factors of Alzheimer’s Disease</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00209</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Potential pathogenic factors, other than well-known APP, APOE4, and PSEN, can be further identified from transcriptomics studies of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) that are specific for Alzheimer’s disease (AD), but findings are often inconsistent or even contradictory. Evidence corroboration by combining meta-analysis and bioinformatics methods may help to resolve existing inconsistencies and contradictions. This study aimed to demonstrate a systematic workflow for evidence synthesis of transcriptomic studies using both meta-analysis and bioinformatics methods to identify potential pathogenic factors. Transcriptomic data were assessed from GEO and ArrayExpress after systematic searches. The DEGs and their dysregulation states from both DNA microarray and RNA sequencing datasets were analyzed and corroborated by meta-analysis. Statistically significant DEGs were used for enrichment analysis based on KEGG and protein–protein interaction network (PPIN) analysis based on STRING. AD-specific modules were further determined by the DIAMOnD algorithm, which identifies significant connectivity patterns between specific disease-associated proteins and non-specific proteins. Within AD-specific modules, the nodes of highest degrees (&amp;gt;95th percentile) were considered as potential pathogenic factors. After systematic searches of 225 datasets, extensive meta-analyses among 25 datasets (21 DNA microarray datasets and 4 RNA sequencing datasets) identified 9,298 DEGs. The dysregulated genes and pathways in AD were associated with impaired amyloid-β (Aβ) clearance. From the AD-specific module, Fyn, and EGFR were the most statistically significant and biologically relevant. This meta-analytical study suggested that the reduced Aβ clearance in AD pathogenesis was associated with the genes encoding Fyn and EGFR, which were key receptors in Aβ downstream signaling.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: MRI-Induced Heating of Coils for Microscopic Magnetic Stimulation at 1.5 Tesla: An Initial Study</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00053</link>
	<content:encoded>Purpose&lt;p&gt;Deep brain stimulation (DBS) has proved to be effective in the treatment of movement disorders. However, the direct contact between the metal contacts of the DBS electrode and the brain can cause RF heating in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanning, due to an increase of local specific absorption rate (SAR). Recently, micro coils (μMS) have demonstrated excitation of neuronal tissue through the electromagnetic induction both in vitro and in vivo experiments. In contrast to electrical stimulation, in μMS, there is no direct contact between the metal and the biological tissue.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;We compared the heating of a μMS coil with a control case of a metal wire. The heating was induced by RF fields in a 1.5 T MRI head birdcage coil (often used for imaging patients with implants) at 64 MHz, and normalized results to 3.2 W/kg whole head average SAR.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;The μMS coil or wire implants were placed inside an anatomically accurate head saline-gel filled phantom inserted in the RF coil, and we observed approximately 1°C initial temperature rise at the μMS coil, while the wire exhibited a 10°C temperature rise in the proximity of the exposed end. The numerical simulations showed a 32-times increase of local SAR induced at the tips of the metal wire compared to the μMS.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;In this work, we show with measurements and electromagnetic numerical simulations that the RF-induced increase in local SAR and induced heating during MRI scanning can be greatly reduced by using magnetic stimulation with the proposed μMS technology.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2020.00020</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;We propose that correlations among neurons are generically strong enough to organize neural activity patterns into a discrete set of clusters, which can each be viewed as a population codeword. Our reasoning starts with the analysis of retinal ganglion cell data using maximum entropy models, showing that the population is robustly in a frustrated, marginally sub-critical, or glassy, state. This leads to an argument that neural populations in many other brain areas might share this structure. Next, we use latent variable models to show that this glassy state possesses well-defined clusters of neural activity. Clusters have three appealing properties: (i) clusters exhibit error correction, i.e., they are reproducibly elicited by the same stimulus despite variability at the level of constituent neurons; (ii) clusters encode qualitatively different visual features than their constituent neurons; and (iii) clusters can be learned by downstream neural circuits in an unsupervised fashion. We hypothesize that these properties give rise to a “learnable” neural code which the cortical hierarchy uses to extract increasingly complex features without supervision or reinforcement.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncir.2020.00008</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;This study describes the cytoarchitecture of the torus longitudinalis (TL) in adult zebrafish by using light and electron microscopy, as well as its main connections as revealed by DiI tract tracing. In addition, by using high resolution confocal imaging followed by digital tracing, we describe the morphology of tectal pyramidal cells (type I cells) that are GFP positive in the transgenic line Tg(1.4dlx5a-dlx6a:GFP)&lt;sup&gt;ot1&lt;/sup&gt;. The TL consists of numerous small and medium-sized neurons located in a longitudinal eminence attached to the medial optic tectum. A small proportion of these neurons are GABAergic. The neuropil shows three types of synaptic terminals and numerous dendrites. Tracing experiments revealed that the main efference of the TL is formed of parallel-like fibers that course within the marginal layer of the optic tectum. A toral projection to the thalamic nucleus rostrolateralis is also observed. Afferents to the TL come from visual and cerebellum-related nuclei in the pretectum, namely the central, intercalated and the paracommissural pretectal nuclei, as well as from the subvalvular nucleus in the isthmus. Additional afferents to the TL may come from the cerebellum but their origins could not be confirmed. The tectal afferent projection to the TL originates from cells similar to the type X cells described in other cyprinids. Tectal pyramidal neurons show round or piriform cell bodies, with spiny apical dendritic trees in the marginal layer. This anatomical study provides a basis for future functional and developmental studies focused on this cerebellum-like circuit in zebrafish.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00039</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Autophagy is a highly conserved degradative process that conveys dysfunctional proteins, lipids, and organelles to lysosomes for degradation. The post-mitotic nature, complex and highly polarized morphology, and high degree of specialization of neurons make an efficient autophagy essential for their homeostasis and survival. Dysfunctional autophagy occurs in aging and neurodegenerative diseases, and autophagy at synaptic sites seems to play a crucial role in neurodegeneration. Moreover, a role of autophagy is emerging for neural development, synaptogenesis, and the establishment of a correct connectivity. Thus, it is not surprising that defective autophagy has been demonstrated in a spectrum of neurodevelopmental disorders, often associated with early-onset epilepsy. Here, we discuss the multiple roles of autophagy in neurons and the recent experimental evidence linking neurodevelopmental disorders with epilepsy to genes coding for autophagic/lysosomal system-related proteins and envisage possible pathophysiological mechanisms ranging from synaptic dysfunction to neuronal death.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00067</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Background: Little is known about the underlying mechanisms of the similarities in the core features of postoperative delirium (POD) and α-synuclein (α-syn)-related cognitive disorders. We herein investigated associations between fluctuated levels of exosomal α-syn in the plasma and POD presentation in geriatric hip fracture patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: We conducted an observational, prospective, and 1:1 matched (on age older than 65, hip fracture diagnosis, American Society of Anesthesiologist’ (ASA) physical status, duration of surgery, and intraoperative bleeding) case-control study: POD cases and non-POD controls were selected from the overall cohort by using Confusion Assessment Method (CAM). Delirium severity was measured by the Memorial Delirium Assessment Scale (MDAS). Plasma exosome levels of α-syn were examined preoperatively and at the time that POD was diagnosed, by using an established immunocapture technology based on a putative brain-cell-specific marker. Circulating concentrations of interleukin-1β (IL-1β), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) were also determined. The relationship between α-syn levels and POD risk, as well as the association between α-syn and MDAS scores and plasma cytokines, were assessed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: POD incidence was 8.4% (17/202). Postoperative α-syn were either elevated or lowered. As primary outcome variables, the change of α-syn in POD patients was significantly higher than non-POD ones (21.0 ± 29.3 pg.ml&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; vs.1.9 ± 20.0, P = 0.047). The α-syn alteration was positively correlated to MDAS (r = 0.436, P = 0.010) and the change of IL-6 (r = 0.383, P = 0.025).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: Exosome α-syn release in plasma may be associated with the POD development which might be due to systemic inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clinical Trial Registration: www.clinicaltrials.gov, identifier ChiCTR-IPR-17012301.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prior Presentation: The abstract of this work has been selected for presentation in the 2019 ANESTHESIOLOGY Journal Symposium “What’s New with the old,” and it has been present in the ASA 2019 annual meeting October 21st, 2019 in Florida.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: The Apolipoprotein E ε4 Allele-Dependent Relationship Between Serum Lipid Levels and Cognitive Function: A Population-Based Cross-sectional Study</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00044</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Objectives: Till now, the effect of serum lipid levels on cognitive function is still controversial. The apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 allele is the most critical genetic risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and cognitive impairment. Additionally, APOE ε4 allele has a major impact on lipid metabolism. The aim of this study was to investigate the APOE genotype-dependent relationship between peripheral serum lipid levels and cognitive impairment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: A total of 1,273 subjects aged 40–86 years participated in this cross-sectional study. Serum lipid levels and the APOE genotype were detected. Mini-Mental State Examination was used to diagnose the cognitive impairment or not. Univariate and multivariate analyses were used to analyze the relationships between APOE genotype, serum lipid levels, and cognition function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: After controlling for all possible covariates, a significant interaction between low serum high-density lipoprotein and the APOE ε4 allele on cognitive impairment (Wald’s χ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 4.269, df = 1, OR = 20.094, p = 0.039) was found in the total participants. In APOE ε4 carriers, low serum high-density lipoprotein was positively associated with cognitive impairment (Wald’s χ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 8.200, df = 1, OR = 60.335, p = 0.004) and serum high-density lipoprotein levels were positively correlated with Mini-Mental State Examination score (r = 0.217, df = 176, p = 0.004). There was no significant correlation between serum total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein, triglycerides (TG) levels, and cognitive impairment in either the total participants or APOE ε4 carriers/non-carriers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: APOE ε4 carriers, but not non-carriers, with lower serum high-density lipoprotein had a higher prevalence of cognitive impairment and a lower Mini-Mental State Examination score. These results suggest that the APOE ε4 allele may affect the relationship between serum lipid levels and cognitive impairment. However, the specific mechanism needs to be further elucidated.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/55326</link>
	<content:encoded>Adaptive immunity vitally depends on major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC I) molecules loaded with peptides. Selective loading of peptides onto MHC I, referred to as peptide editing, is catalyzed by tapasin and the tapasin-related TAPBPR. An important catalytic role has been ascribed to a structural feature in TAPBPR called the scoop loop, but the exact function of the scoop loop remains elusive. Here, using a reconstituted system of defined peptide-exchange components including human TAPBPR variants, we uncover a substantial contribution of the scoop loop to the stability of the MHC I-chaperone complex and to peptide editing. We reveal that the scoop loop of TAPBPR functions as an internal peptide surrogate in peptide-depleted environments stabilizing empty MHC I and impeding peptide rebinding. The scoop loop thereby acts as an additional selectivity filter in shaping the repertoire of presented peptide epitopes and the formation of a hierarchical immune response.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Members of the &lt;i&gt;Corynebacterineae &lt;/i&gt;suborder of Actinobacteria have a unique cell surface architecture and, unlike most well-studied bacteria, grow by tip-extension. To investigate the distinct morphogenic mechanisms shared by these organisms, we performed a genome-wide phenotypic profiling analysis using &lt;i&gt;Corynebacterium glutamicum&lt;/i&gt; as a model. A high-density transposon mutagenized library was challenged with a panel of antibiotics and other stresses. The fitness of mutants in each gene under each condition was then assessed by transposon-sequencing. Clustering of the resulting phenotypic fingerprints revealed a role for several genes of previously unknown function in surface biogenesis. Further analysis identified CofA (Cgp_0016) as an interaction partner of the peptidoglycan synthase PBP1a that promotes its stable accumulation at sites of polar growth. The related &lt;i&gt;Mycobacterium tuberculosis&lt;/i&gt; proteins were also found to interact, highlighting the utility of our dataset for uncovering conserved principles of morphogenesis for this clinically relevant bacterial suborder.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/54712</link>
	<content:encoded>Ion selectivity is a defining feature of a given ion channel and is considered immutable. Here we show that ion selectivity of the lysosomal ion channel TPC2, which is hotly debated (Calcraft et al., 2009; Guo et al., 2017; Jha et al., 2014; Ruas et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2012), depends on the activating ligand. A high throughput screen identified two structurally distinct TPC2 agonists. One of these evoked robust Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-signals and non-selective cation currents, the other weaker Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-signals and Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-selective currents. These properties were mirrored by the Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-mobilizing messenger, NAADP and the phosphoinositide, PI(3,5)P&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, respectively. Agonist action was differentially inhibited by mutation of a single TPC2 residue and coupled to opposing changes in lysosomal pH and exocytosis. Our findings resolve conflicting reports on the permeability and gating properties of TPC2 and they establish a new paradigm whereby a single ion channel mediates distinct, functionally-relevant ionic signatures on demand.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/54128</link>
	<content:encoded>FANCI:FANCD2 monoubiquitination is a critical event for replication fork stabilization by the Fanconi anemia (FA) DNA repair pathway. It has been proposed that at stalled replication forks, monoubiquitinated-FANCD2 serves to recruit DNA repair proteins that contain ubiquitin-binding motifs. Here we have reconstituted the FA pathway &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; to study functional consequences of FANCI:FANCD2 monoubiquitination. We report that monoubiquitination does not promote any specific exogenous protein:protein interactions, but instead stabilizes FANCI:FANCD2 heterodimers on dsDNA. This clamping requires monoubiquitination of only the FANCD2 subunit. We further show that purified monoubiquitinated FANCI:FANCD2 forms filament-like arrays on long dsDNA using electron microscopy. Our results reveal how monoubiquitinated FANCI:FANCD2, defective in many cancer types and all cases of FA, is activated upon DNA binding.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/53071</link>
	<content:encoded>Injury to the newborn mouse heart is efficiently regenerated, but this capacity is lost by one week after birth. We found that IGF2, an important mitogen in heart development, is required for neonatal heart regeneration. IGF2 originates from the endocardium/endothelium and is transduced in cardiomyocytes by the insulin receptor. Following injury on postnatal day 1, absence of IGF2 abolished injury-induced cell cycle entry during the early part of the first postnatal week. Consequently, regeneration failed despite the later presence of additional cell cycle-inducing activities 7 days following injury. Most cardiomyocytes transition from mononuclear diploid to polyploid during the first postnatal week. Regeneration was rescued in Igf2-deficient neonates in three different contexts that elevate the percentage of mononuclear diploid cardiomyocytes beyond postnatal day 7. Thus, IGF2 is a paracrine-acting mitogen for heart regeneration during the early postnatal period, and IGF2-deficiency unmasks the dependence of this process on proliferation-competent mononuclear diploid cardiomyocytes.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/52108</link>
	<content:encoded>The hippocampus supports memory encoding and retrieval, which may occur at distinct phases of the theta cycle. These processes dynamically interact over rapid timescales, especially when sensory information conflicts with memory. The ability to link hippocampal dynamics to memory-guided behaviors has been limited by experiments that lack the temporal resolution to segregate encoding and retrieval. Here, we simultaneously tracked eye movements and hippocampal field potentials while neurosurgical patients performed a spatial memory task. Phase-locking at the peak of theta preceded fixations to retrieved locations, indicating that the hippocampus coordinates memory-guided eye movements. In contrast, phase-locking at the trough of theta followed fixations to novel object-locations and predicted intact memory of the original location. Theta-gamma phase amplitude coupling increased during fixations to conflicting visual content, but predicted memory updating. Hippocampal theta thus supports learning through two interleaved processes: strengthening encoding of novel information and guiding exploration based on prior experience.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/51972</link>
	<content:encoded>A prevalent model is that sharp-wave ripples (SWR) arise 'spontaneously' in CA3 and propagate recent memory traces outward to the neocortex to facilitate memory consolidation there. Using voltage and extracellular glutamate transient recording over widespread regions of mice dorsal neocortex in relation to CA1 multiunit activity (MUA) and SWR, we find that the largest SWR-related modulation occurs in retrosplenial cortex; however, contrary to the unidirectional hypothesis, neocortical activation exhibited a continuum of activation timings relative to SWRs, varying from leading to lagging. Thus, contrary to the model in which SWRs arise 'spontaneously' in the hippocampus, neocortical activation often precedes SWRs and may thus constitute a trigger event in which neocortical information seeds associative reactivation of hippocampal 'indices'. This timing continuum is consistent with a dynamics in which older, more consolidated memories may in fact initiate the hippocampal-neocortical dialog, whereas reactivation of newer memories may be initiated predominantly in the hippocampus.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/47946</link>
	<content:encoded>Every cell is protected by a semipermeable membrane. Peptides with the right properties, for example Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), can disrupt this protective barrier by formation of leaky pores. Unfortunately, matching peptide properties with their ability to selectively form pores in bacterial membranes remains elusive. In particular, the proline/glycine kink in helical peptides was reported to both increase and decrease antimicrobial activity. We used computer simulations and fluorescence experiments to show that a kink in helices affects the formation of membrane pores by stabilizing toroidal pores but disrupting barrel-stave pores. The position of the proline/glycine kink in the sequence further controls the specific structure of toroidal pore. Moreover, we demonstrate that two helical peptides can form a kink-like connection with similar behavior as one long helical peptide with a kink.

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Behavioural choice emerges from nonlinear all-to-all interactions between drives</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.03.12.989574v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Under the right conditions any drive can overcome nearly any other, yet studies of behavioural selection predominantly focus on only one, or occasionally two behaviours. We present an experimental and computational framework that captures and explains the resolution of conflicts between several competing motivations. We characterize neurons that integrate information from all rival drives to generate an aggregate signal that urges male Drosophila to transition out of mating. Experimental investigation of these Drive Integrating Neurons (DINs) revealed time-varying, supralinear interactions among competing drives that stimulate the DINs and induce a change in behaviour. Extending these findings to model the interactions between all of an animal's motivations led to the surprising prediction that, under many conditions, all-to-all interactions actually buffer the dominant drive against challengers. We experimentally validated this prediction, showing that weak drives for a variety of tertiary goals can have a profound stabilizing effect on the ongoing behaviour. These results emerge only if non-linear integration of other motivations occurs for each of an animal's drives, suggesting the potential universality of this mechanism. Our findings emphasize the interconnectedness of motivational systems and the consequent importance of considering the full motivational state of an animal to understand its behaviour.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Maternal cannabis vapor exposure causes long-term alterations in emotional reactivity, social behavior, and behavioral flexibility in offspring.</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.03.12.989210v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>The use of cannabis during pregnancy is a growing public health concern. As more states implement legislation permitting recreational cannabis use, there is an urgent need to better understand its impact on fetal neurodevelopment and its long-term effects in exposed offspring. Studies examining effects of prenatal cannabis exposure typically employ injections of synthetic cannabinoids or isolated cannabis constituents that may not accurately model cannabis use in human populations. To address this limitation, we have developed a novel e-cigarette technology-based system to deliver vaporized cannabis extracts to pregnant Long Evans rats. We used this model to determine effects of prenatal cannabis exposure on emotional, social, and cognitive endpoints of male and female offspring during early development and into adulthood. Dams were exposed to cannabis vapor (CANTHC: 400 mg/ml), vehicle vapor (VEH), or no vapor (AIR) twice daily during mating and gestation. Offspring exposed to CANTHC and VEH showed reduced weight gain relative to AIR offspring prior to weaning. CANTHC offspring made more isolation-induced ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) on postnatal day 6 (P6) relative to VEH-exposed offspring, which is indicative of increased emotional reactivity. Male CANTHC offspring engaged in fewer social investigation behaviors than VEH-exposed male offspring during a social play test on P26. In adulthood, CANTHC-exposed offspring spent less time exploring the open arms of the elevated plus maze and exhibited dose-dependent deficits in behavioral flexibility in an attentional set-shifting task relative to AIR controls. These data collectively indicate that prenatal cannabis exposure causes enduring effects on the behavioral profile of offspring.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.03.12.989129v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Magnetoencephalography (MEG) is a powerful technique for functional neuroimaging, offering a non-invasive window on brain electrophysiology. MEG systems have traditionally been based on cryogenic sensors which detect the small extracranial magnetic fields generated by synchronised current in neuronal assemblies, however such systems have fundamental limitations. In recent years quantum-enabled devices, called optically-pumped magnetometers (OPMs), have promised to lift those restrictions, offering an adaptable, motion-robust MEG device, with improved data quality, at reduced cost. However, OPM-MEG remains a nascent technology, and whilst viable systems exist, most employ small numbers of sensors sited above targeted brain regions. Here, building on previous work, we construct a wearable OPM-MEG system with whole-head coverage based upon commercially available OPMs, and test its capabilities to measure alpha, beta and gamma oscillations. We design two methods for OPM mounting; a flexible (EEG-like) cap and rigid (additively-manufactured) helmet. Whilst both designs allow for high quality data to be collected, we argue that the rigid helmet offers a more robust option with significant advantages for reconstruction of field data into 3D images of changes in neuronal current. Using repeat measurements in two participants, we show signal detection for our device to be highly robust. Moreover, via application of source-space modelling, we show that, despite having 5 times fewer sensors, our system exhibits comparable performance to an established cryogenic MEG device. While significant challenges still remain, these developments provide further evidence that OPM-MEG is likely to facilitate a step change for functional neuroimaging.</content:encoded>

The influence of red blood cell (RBC) deformability in whole blood on platelet margination is investigated using confocal microscopy measurements of flowing human blood and cell resolved blood flow simulations. Fluorescent platelet concentrations at the wall of a glass chamber are measured using confocal microscopy with flowing human blood containing varying healthy-to-stiff RBC fractions. A decrease is observed in the fluorescent platelet signal at the wall due to the increase of stiffened RBCs in flow, suggesting a decrease of platelet margination due to an increased fraction of stiffened RBCs present in the flow. In order to resolve the influence of stiffened RBCs on platelet concentration at the channel wall, cell-pair and bulk flow simulations are performed. For homogeneous collisions between RBC pairs, a decrease in final displacement after a collision with increasing membrane stiffness is observed. In heterogeneous collisions between healthy and stiff RBC pairs, it is found that the stiffened RBC is displaced most. The influence of RBC deformability on collisions between RBCs and platelets was found to be negligible due to their size and mass difference. For a straight vessel geometry with varying healthy-to-stiff RBC ratios, a decrease was observed in the red blood cell-free layer and platelet margination due to an increase in stiffened RBCs present in flow.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/AGjg1s708qU&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Antigen recognition by T-cells is guided by the T-cell receptor (TCR) heterodimer formed by α and β chains. A huge diversity of TCR sequences should be maintained by the immune system in order to be able to mount an effective response towards foreign pathogens, so, due to cooperative binding of α and β chains to the pathogen, any constraints on chain pairing can have a profound effect on immune repertoire structure, diversity and antigen specificity. By integrating available structural data and paired chain sequencing results we were able to show that there are almost no constraints on pairing in TCRαβ complexes, allowing naive T-cell repertoire to reach the highest possible diversity. Additional analysis reveals that the specific choice of contacting amino acids can still have a profound effect on complex conformation. Moreover, antigen-driven selection can distort the uniform landscape of chain pairing, while small, yet significant, differences in the pairing can be attributed to various specialized T-cell subsets such as MAIT and iNKT T-cells, as well as other TCR sets specific to certain antigens.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/AEqpGdCC3f8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Calcium imaging has been widely used for measuring spiking activities of neurons. When using calcium imaging, we need to extract summarized information from the raw movie beforehand. Recent studies have used matrix deconvolution for this preprocessing. However, such an approach can neither directly estimate the generative mechanism of spike trains nor use stimulus information that has a strong influence on neural activities. Here, we propose a new deconvolution method for calcium imaging using marked point processes. We consider that the observed movie is generated from a probabilistic model with marked point processes as hidden variables, and we calculate the posterior of these variables using a variational inference approach. Our method can simultaneously estimate various kinds of information, such as cell shape, spike occurrence time, and tuning curve. We apply our method to simulated and experimental data to verify its performance.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/xvVCa8A-Lno&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/dFYVKQ4wlYc/article</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Michele Tizzoni, André Panisson, Daniela Paolotti, Ciro Cattuto&lt;/p&gt;

In recent years, many studies have drawn attention to the important role of collective awareness and human behaviour during epidemic outbreaks. A number of modelling efforts have investigated the interaction between the disease transmission dynamics and human behaviour change mediated by news coverage and by information spreading in the population. Yet, given the scarcity of data on public awareness during an epidemic, few studies have relied on empirical data. Here, we use fine-grained, geo-referenced data from three online sources—Wikipedia, the GDELT Project and the Internet Archive—to quantify population-scale information seeking about the 2016 Zika virus epidemic in the U.S., explicitly linking such behavioural signal to epidemiological data. Geo-localized Wikipedia pageview data reveal that visiting patterns of Zika-related pages in Wikipedia were highly synchronized across the United States and largely explained by exposure to national television broadcast. Contrary to the assumption of some theoretical epidemic models, news volume and Wikipedia visiting patterns were not significantly correlated with the magnitude or the extent of the epidemic. Attention to Zika, in terms of Zika-related Wikipedia pageviews, was high at the beginning of the outbreak, when public health agencies raised an international alert and triggered media coverage, but subsequently exhibited an activity profile that suggests nonlinear dependencies and memory effects in the relation between information seeking, media pressure, and disease dynamics. This calls for a new and more general modelling framework to describe the interaction between media exposure, public awareness and disease dynamics during epidemic outbreaks.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/dFYVKQ4wlYc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a neurological disease with a substantial genetic component and immune‐mediated neurodegeneration. Patients with MS show structural brain differences relative to individuals without MS, including smaller regional volumes and alterations in white matter (WM) microstructure. Whether genetic risk for MS is associated with brain structure during early neurodevelopment remains unclear. In this study, we explore the association between MS polygenic risk scores (PRS) and brain imaging outcomes from a large, population‐based pediatric sample to gain insight into the underlying neurobiology of MS.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We included 8‐to‐12 year‐old genotyped participants from the Generation R Study in whom T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;‐weighted volumetric‐(n=1,136) and/or diffusion tensor imaging (n=1,088) had been collected. PRS for MS were calculated based on a large genome‐wide association study of MS (n=41,505), and were regressed on regional volumes, global and tract‐specific fractional anisotropy (FA) and global mean diffusivity using linear regression.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No associations were observed for the regional volumes. We observed a positive association between the MS‐PRS and global FA(β=0.098, standard error (SE)=0.030, p=1.08×10&lt;sup&gt;‐3&lt;/sup&gt;). Tract‐specific analyses showed higher FA and lower radial diffusivity in several tracts. We replicated our findings in an independent sample of children (n=186) who were scanned in an earlier phase (Global FA; β=0.189, SE=0.072, p=9.40×10&lt;sup&gt;‐3&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the first study to show that greater genetic predisposition for MS is associated with higher global brain WM FA at an early age in the general population. Our results suggest a pre‐adolescent time‐window within neurodevelopment in which MS risk variants act upon the brain.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Preservation of Partially Mixed Selectivity in Human Posterior Parietal Cortex across Changes in Task Context</title>
	<link>http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/7/2/ENEURO.0222-19.2019?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Recent studies in posterior parietal cortex (PPC) have found multiple effectors and cognitive strategies represented within a shared neural substrate in a structure termed &quot;partially mixed selectivity&quot; (Zhang et al., 2017). In this study, we examine whether the structure of these representations is preserved across changes in task context and is thus a robust and generalizable property of the neural population. Specifically, we test whether the structure is conserved from an open-loop motor imagery task (training) to a closed-loop cortical control task (online), a change that has led to substantial changes in neural behavior in prior studies in motor cortex. Recording from a 4 &lt;font face=&quot;arial,helvetica&quot;&gt;x&lt;/font&gt; 4 mm electrode array implanted in PPC of a human tetraplegic patient participating in a brain–machine interface (BMI) clinical trial, we studied the representations of imagined/attempted movements of the left/right hand and compare their individual BMI control performance using a one-dimensional cursor control task. We found that the structure of the representations is largely maintained between training and online control. Our results demonstrate for the first time that the structure observed in the context of an open-loop motor imagery task is maintained and accessible in the context of closed-loop BMI control. These results indicate that it is possible to decode the mixed variables found from a small patch of cortex in PPC and use them individually for BMI control. Furthermore, they show that the structure of the mixed representations is maintained and robust across changes in task context.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>RSS PAP: Biophysical basis of alpha rhythm disruption in Alzheimers Disease (AD)</title>
	<link>http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0293-19.2020v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Occipital alpha is a prominent rhythm (~10 Hz) detected in electroencephalography (EEG) during wakeful relaxation with closed eyes. The rhythm is generated by a subclass of thalamic pacemaker cells that burst at the alpha frequency, orchestrated by the interplay of hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated channels (HCN) and calcium channels in response to elevated levels of ambient acetylcholine. These oscillations are known to have a lower peak frequency and coherence in the early stages of Alzheimer’s Disease (AD). Interestingly, calcium signaling, HCN channel expression and acetylcholine signaling, crucial for orchestrating the alpha rhythm, are also known to be aberrational in AD. In a biophysically detailed network model of the thalamic circuit, we investigate the changes in molecular signaling and the causal relationships between them that lead to a disrupted thalamic alpha in AD. Our simulations show that lowered HCN expression leads to a slower thalamic alpha, which can be rescued by increasing acetylcholine levels, a common therapeutic target of AD drugs. However, this rescue is possible only over a limited range of reduced HCN expression. The model predicts that lowered HCN expression can modify the network activity in the thalamic circuit leading to increased GABA release in the thalamus and disrupt the calcium homeostasis. The changes in calcium signaling make the network more susceptible to noise, causing a loss in rhythmic activity. Based on our results, we propose that reduced frequency and coherence of the occipital alpha rhythm seen in AD may result from down-regulated HCN expression, rather than modified cholinergic signaling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Aggregation of amyloid-beta, modified expression of ion channels and alterations in calcium signaling are hallmarks of AD neurons. Separately, changes in the alpha rhythm is often an early observation in AD patients. We use a realistic computational model of the thalamus to elucidate the causal links between molecular changes in AD and their effect on alpha rhythm. Our model demonstrates that pathology of HCN, crucial for alpha generation, alters calcium signaling, modifies excitation-inhibition balance in the thalamus makes the network more sensitive to noise. Our model, when seen in conjunction with diverse experimental data, posits a causal relationship between the formation of amyloid-beta plaques, the down-regulation of HCN channels and aberrations in the occipital alpha rhythm.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0320-19.2020v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Axonal demyelination injury and neuronal degeneration are the primary causes of visual disability in multiple sclerosis-linked optic neuritis (MS/optic neuritis) patients. Immunomodulatory therapies targeting inflammation have failed to avert the disease progression and no therapies exist to prevent the neuronal deficits seen in MS to date. Neuroprotective strategies targeting oligodendrocytes and astroglia have shown limited success due to a lack of axonal regeneration from injured neurons. In this study, we used the chronic experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) mouse model of MS to investigate the axonal regenerative approach to improve the neuronal function. Our approach focused on targeted knockout of the developmentally regulated axon growth inhibitory Kruppel-like factor 4 (&lt;i&gt;Klf4&lt;/i&gt;) gene in retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) of &lt;i&gt;Klf4&lt;sup&gt;fl/fl&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt;mice by intravitreal delivery of AAV2-Cre-ires-EGFP recombinant virus 1) at the time of EAE sensitization, and 2) after the onset of optic neuritis-mediated visual defects in the mice. &lt;i&gt;Klf4&lt;/i&gt; gene knockout performed simultaneous with EAE sensitization prevented the visual loss as assessed by pattern electroretinograms (PERG) in the mice and protected the RGCs from EAE mediated death. More importantly, however, &lt;i&gt;Klf4&lt;/i&gt; gene knockout after the onset of optic neuritis also resulted in RGC neuroprotection with additional restoration of their function, thereby improving the visual function outcomes in the EAE model. This study establishes the efficacy of &lt;i&gt;Klf4&lt;/i&gt; targeted knockdown in EAE even after the onset of disease symptoms, and thus should be further explored as a potential treatment strategy for MS/Optic neuritis patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Multiple sclerosis is a leading cause of permanent disability in young adults in which effective treatment has remained elusive. The neuroprotective strategies targeting oligodendrocytes and astroglia have shown limited success due to a lack of axonal regeneration from injured neurons. In the current study, we explored the axon regenerative approach to treat MS in mouse model and showed that targeted knockout of axon growth inhibitory &lt;i&gt;Klf4&lt;/i&gt; gene in RGCs of EAE mice is efficient in preventing not only the EAE mediated RGC death but also restoring the function of injured axons by facilitating regeneration, and thereby improving the visual function in the mice even after the onset of EAE mediated visual defects.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.05405</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Population imaging markedly increased the size of functional-imaging
datasets, shedding new light on the neural basis of inter-individual
differences. Analyzing these large data entails new scalability challenges,
computational and statistical. For this reason, brain images are typically
summarized in a few signals, for instance reducing voxel-level measures with
brain atlases or functional modes. A good choice of the corresponding brain
networks is important, as most data analyses start from these reduced signals.
We contribute finely-resolved atlases of functional modes, comprising from 64
to 1024 networks. These dictionaries of functional modes (DiFuMo) are trained
on millions of fMRI functional brain volumes of total size 2.4TB, spanned over
27 studies and many research groups. We demonstrate the benefits of extracting
reduced signals on our fine-grain atlases for many classic functional data
analysis pipelines: stimuli decoding from 12,334 brain responses, standard GLM
analysis of fMRI across sessions and individuals, extraction of resting-state
functional-connectomes biomarkers for 2,500 individuals, data compression and
meta-analysis over more than 15,000 statistical maps. In each of these analysis
scenarii, we compare the performance of our functional atlases with that of
other popular references, and to a simple voxel-level analysis. Results
highlight the importance of using high-dimensional &quot;soft&quot; functional atlases,
to represent and analyse brain activity while capturing its functional
gradients. Analyses on high-dimensional modes achieve similar statistical
performance as at the voxel level, but with much reduced computational cost and
higher interpretability. In addition to making them available, we provide
meaningful names for these modes, based on their anatomical location. It will
facilitate reporting of results.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Regularization of functional connectomes and its impact on geodesic distance and fingerprinting. (arXiv:2003.05393v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.05393</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Functional connectomes, which are symmetric correlation matrices, have been
used to study changes in brain organization with aging, cognitive abilities and
across a wide range of brain disorders. They have also been shown to provide a
reproducible individual fingerprint, which has opened the possibility of
personalized medicine for neuro/psychiatric disorders. Thus, an accurate way to
compare functional connectomes is essential. Canonically, functional
connectomes are compared using Pearson's correlation coefficient of the entire
functional connectivity profiles. Recently, Venkatesh and colleagues proposed
the use of geodesic distance as a more accurate way of comparing functional
connectomes, one which reflects the underlying non-Euclidean geometry of the
data. They evaluated their approach in the context of participant
identification (or fingerprinting) and showed that it leads to higher
identification rates for all functional MRI conditions assessed. Computing
geodesic distance requires that the functional connectivity matrices being
compared are invertible (or positive-definite). As this requirement depends on
the fMRI scanning length and the parcellation used, it is not always
attainable. Hence Venkatesh and colleagues employed a simple regularization
procedure to ensure that the matrices were invertible. In the present technical
note, we show that regularization is not only crucial for making the functional
connectomes invertible, but also that an optimal magnitude of regularization
can lead to systematically higher identification rates. We also show that this
optimal value of regularization is highly dataset-dependent, and varies as a
function of condition, parcellation, and the number of frames used to compute
the functional connectomes.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.05171</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Background / introduction. Vector symbolic architectures (VSA) are a viable
approach for the hyperdimensional representation of symbolic data, such as
documents, syntactic structures, or semantic frames. Methods. We present a
rigorous mathematical framework for the representation of phrase structure
trees and parse-trees of context-free grammars (CFG) in Fock space, i.e.
infinite-dimensional Hilbert space as being used in quantum field theory. We
define a novel normal form for CFG by means of term algebras. Using a recently
developed software toolbox, called FockBox, we construct Fock space
representations for the trees built up by a CFG left-corner (LC) parser.
Results. We prove a universal representation theorem for CFG term algebras in
Fock space and illustrate our findings through a low-dimensional principal
component projection of the LC parser states. Conclusions. Our approach could
leverage the development of VSA for explainable artificial intelligence (XAI)
by means of hyperdimensional deep neural computation. It could be of
significance for the improvement of cognitive user interfaces and other
applications of VSA in machine learning.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Model Order Reduction in Neuroscience. (arXiv:2003.05133v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.05133</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The human brain contains approximately $10^9$ neurons, each with
approximately $10^3$ connections, synapses, with other neurons. Most sensory,
cognitive and motor functions of our brains depend on the interaction of a
large population of neurons. In recent years, many technologies are developed
for recording large numbers of neurons either sequentially or simultaneously.
An increase in computational power and algorithmic developments have enabled
advanced analyses of neuronal population parallel to the rapid growth of
quantity and complexity of the recorded neuronal activity. Recent studies made
use of dimensionality and model order reduction techniques to extract coherent
features which are not apparent at the level of individual neurons. It has been
observed that the neuronal activity evolves on low-dimensional subspaces. The
aim of model reduction of large-scale neuronal networks is an accurate and fast
prediction of patterns and their propagation in different areas of the brain.
Spatiotemporal features of the brain activity are identified on low dimensional
subspaces with methods such as dynamic mode decomposition (DMD), proper
orthogonal decomposition (POD), discrete empirical interpolation (DEIM) and
combined parameter and state reduction. In this paper, we give an overview of
the currently used dimensionality reduction and model order reduction
techniques in neuroscience.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This work will be featured as a chapter in the upcoming Handbook on Model
Order Reduction,(P. Benner, S. Grivet-Talocia, A. Quarteroni, G. Rozza, W. H.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Effects of fixatives on myelin molecular order probed with RP-CARS microscopy. (arXiv:2003.04890v1 [q-bio.TO])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.04890</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;When live imaging is not feasible, sample fixation allows preserving the
ultrastructure of biological samples for subsequent microscopy analysis. This
process could be performed with various methods, each one affecting differently
the biological structure of the sample. While these alterations were
well-characterized using traditional microscopy, little information is
available about the effects of the fixatives on the spatial molecular
orientation of the biological tissue. We tackled this issue by employing
Rotating-Polarization Coherent Anti-Stokes Raman Scattering (RP-CARS)
microscopy to study the effects of different fixatives on the myelin
sub-micrometric molecular order and micrometric morphology. RP-CARS is a novel
technique derived from CARS microscopy that allows probing spatial orientation
of molecular bonds while maintaining the intrinsic chemical selectivity of CARS
microscopy. By characterizing the effects of the fixation procedures, the
present work represents a useful guide for the choice of the best fixation
technique(s), in particular for polarisation-resolved CARS microscopy. Finally,
we show that the combination of paraformaldehyde and glutaraldehyde can be
effectively employed as a fixative for RP-CARS microscopy, as long as the
effects on the molecular spatial distribution, here characterized, are taken
into account.

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: EEG Effective Source Projections Are More Bilaterally Symmetric in Infants Than in Adults</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00082</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Although anatomical brain hemispheric asymmetries have been clearly documented in the infant brain, findings concerning functional hemispheric specialization have been inconsistent. The present report aims to assess whether bilaterally symmetric synchronous activity between the two hemispheres is a characteristic of the infant brain. To asses cortical bilateral synchronicity, we used decomposition by independent component analysis (ICA) of high-density electroencephalographic (EEG) data collected in an auditory passive oddball paradigm. Decompositions of concatenated 64-channel EEG data epochs from each of 34 typically developing 6-month-old infants and from 18 healthy young adults participating in the same passive auditory oddball protocol were compared to characterize differences in functional brain organization between early life and adulthood. Our results show that infant EEG decompositions comprised a larger number of independent component (IC) effective source processes compatible with a cortical origin and having bilaterally near-symmetric scalp projections (13.8% of the infant data ICs presented a bilateral pattern vs. 4.3% of the adult data ICs). These IC projections could be modeled as the sum of potentials volume-conducted to the scalp from synchronous locally coherent field activities in corresponding left and right cortical source areas. To conclude, in this paradigm, source-resolved infant brain EEG exhibited more bilateral synchronicity than EEG produced by the adult brain, supporting the hypothesis that more strongly unilateral and likely more functionally specialized unihemispheric cortical field activities are concomitants of brain maturation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Multi-session Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation Over Primary Motor Cortex Facilitates Sequence Learning, Chunking, and One Year Retention</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00075</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) over the primary motor cortex (M1) can facilitate motor learning, but it has not been established how stimulation to other brain regions impacts online and offline motor sequence learning, as well as long-term retention. Here, we completed three experiments comparing the effects of tDCS and sham stimulation to the prefrontal cortex (PFC), M1, and the supplementary motor area complex to understand the contributions of these brain regions to motor sequence learning. In Experiment 1, we found that both left and right PFC tDCS groups displayed a slowing in learning in both reaction time and number of chunks, whereas stimulation over M1 improved both metrics over the course of three sessions. To better understand the sequence learning impairment of left PFC anodal stimulation, we tested a left PFC cathodal tDCS group in Experiment 2. The cathodal group demonstrated learning impairments similar to the left PFC anodal stimulation group. In Experiment 3, a subset of participants from the left PFC, M1, and sham tDCS groups of Experiment 1 returned to complete a single session without tDCS on the same sequences assigned to them 1 year previously. We found that the M1 tDCS group reduced reaction time at a faster rate relative to the sham and left PFC groups, demonstrating faster relearning after a one-year delay. Thus, our findings suggest that, regardless of the polarity of stimulation, tDCS to PFC impairs sequence learning, whereas stimulation to M1 facilitates learning and relearning, especially in terms of chunk formation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Theta- and Gamma-Band Activity Discriminates Face, Body and Object Perception</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00074</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Face and body perception is mediated by configural mechanisms, which allow the perception of these stimuli as a whole, rather than the sum of individual parts. Indirect measures of configural processing in visual cognition are the face and body inversion effects (FIE and BIE), which refer to the drop in performance when these stimuli are perceived upside-down. Albeit FIE and BIE have been well characterized at the behavioral level, much still needs to be understood in terms of the neurophysiological correlates of these effects. Thus, in the current study, the brain’s electrical activity has been recorded by a 128 channel electroencephalogram (EEG) in 24 healthy participants while perceiving (upright and inverted) faces, bodies and houses. EEG data were analyzed in both the time domain (i.e., event-related potentials—ERPs) and the frequency domain [i.e., induced theta (5–7 Hz) and gamma (28–45 Hz) oscillations]. ERPs amplitude results showed increased N170 amplitude for inverted faces and bodies (compared to the same stimuli presented in canonical position) but not for houses. ERPs latency results showed delayed N170 components for inverted (vs. upright) faces, houses, but not bodies. Spectral analysis of induced oscillations indicated physiological FIE and BIE; that is decreased gamma-band synchronization over right occipito-temporal electrodes for inverted (vs. upright) faces, and increased bilateral frontoparietal theta-band synchronization for inverted (vs. upright) faces. Furthermore, increased left occipito-temporal and right frontal theta-band synchronization for upright (vs. inverted) bodies was found. Our findings, thus, demonstrate clear differences in the neurophysiological correlates of face and body perception. The neurophysiological FIE suggests disruption of feature binding processes (decrease in occipital gamma oscillations for inverted faces), together with enhanced feature-based attention (increase in frontoparietal theta oscillations for inverted faces). In contrast, the BIE may suggest that structural encoding for bodies is mediated by the first stages of configural processing (decrease in occipital theta oscillations for inverted bodies).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Verbal Working Memory as Emergent from Language Comprehension and Production</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00068</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;This article reviews current models of verbal working memory and considers the role of language comprehension and long-term memory in the ability to maintain and order verbal information for short periods of time. While all models of verbal working memory posit some interaction with long-term memory, few have considered the character of these long-term representations or how they might affect performance on verbal working memory tasks. Similarly, few models have considered how comprehension processes and production processes might affect performance in verbal working memory tasks. Modern theories of comprehension emphasize that people learn a vast web of correlated information about the language and the world and must activate that information from long-term memory to cope with the demands of language input. To date, there has been little consideration in theories of verbal working memory for how this rich input from comprehension would affect the nature of temporary memory. There has also been relatively little attention to the degree to which language production processes naturally manage serial order of verbal information. The authors argue for an emergent model of verbal working memory supported by a rich, distributed long-term memory for language. On this view, comprehension processes provide encoding in verbal working memory tasks, and production processes maintenance, serial ordering, and recall. Moreover, the computational capacity to maintain and order information varies with language experience. Implications for theories of working memory, comprehension, and production are considered.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Functional Brain Connectivity of Language Functions in Children Revealed by EEG and MEG: A Systematic Review</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00062</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The development of language functions is of great interest to neuroscientists, as these functions are among the fundamental capacities of human cognition. For many years, researchers aimed at identifying cerebral correlates of language abilities. More recently, the development of new data analysis tools has generated a shift toward the investigation of complex cerebral networks. In 2015, Weiss-Croft and Baldeweg published a very interesting systematic review on the development of functional language networks, explored through the use of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Compared to fMRI and because of their excellent temporal resolution, magnetoencephalography (MEG) and electroencephalography (EEG) provide different and important information on brain activity. Both therefore constitute crucial neuroimaging techniques for the investigation of the maturation of functional language brain networks. The main objective of this systematic review is to provide a state of knowledge on the investigation of language-related cerebral networks in children, through the use of EEG and MEG, as well as a detailed portrait of relevant MEG and EEG data analysis methods used in that specific research context. To do so, we have summarized the results and systematically compared the methodological approach of 24 peer-reviewed EEG or MEG scientific studies that included healthy children and children with or at high risk of language disabilities, from birth up to 18 years of age. All included studies employed functional and effective connectivity measures, such as coherence, phase locking value, and Phase Slope Index, and did so using different experimental paradigms (e.g., at rest or during language-related tasks). This review will provide more insight into the use of EEG and MEG for the study of language networks in children, contribute to the current state of knowledge on the developmental path of functional connectivity in language networks during childhood and adolescence, and finally allow future studies to choose the most appropriate type of connectivity analysis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Representations in the brain are encoded as patterns of activity of large populations of neurons. The science of population encoded representations, also known as parallel distributed processing (PDP), achieves neurological verisimilitude and has been able to account for a large number of cognitive phenomena in normal people, including reaction times (and reading latencies), stimulus recognition, the effect of stimulus salience on attention, perceptual invariance, simultaneous egocentric and allocentric visual processing, top-down/bottom-up processing, language errors, the effect of statistical regularities of experience, frequency, and age of acquisition, instantiation of rules and symbols, content addressable memory and the capacity for pattern completion, preservation of function in the face of noisy or distorted input, inference, parallel constraint satisfaction, the binding problem and gamma coherence, principles of hippocampal function, the location of knowledge in the brain, limitations in the scope and depth of knowledge acquired through experience, and Piagetian stages of cognitive development. PDP studies have been able to provide a coherent account for impairment in a variety of language functions resulting from stroke or dementia in a large number of languages and the phenomenon of graceful degradation observed in such studies. They have also made important contributions to our understanding of attention (including hemispatial neglect), emotional function, executive function, motor planning, visual processing, decision making, and neuroeconomics. The relationship of neural network population dynamics to electroencephalographic rhythms is starting to emerge. Nevertheless, PDP approaches have scarcely penetrated major areas of study of cognition, including neuropsychology and cognitive neuropsychology, as well as much of cognitive psychology. This article attempts to provide an overview of PDP principles and applications that addresses a broader audience.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Background: Prestimulus alpha oscillations associated with preparatory attention have an impact on response time (RT). However, little is known about whether there is a deficit in the relationship between prestimulus alpha oscillations and RT in older adults with mild cognitive impairment (MCI).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Method: We collected electroencephalography (EEG) data from 28 older adults with MCI and 28 demographically matched healthy controls (HCs) when they were performing an Eriksen flanker task. For each participant, single-trial prestimulus alpha power was calculated for combinations of congruency (congruent vs. incongruent) and response speed (fast vs. slow).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Result: Statistical analysis indicated that prestimulus alpha power was significantly lower for fast trials than slow trials in HCs but not in older adults with MCI. The Fisher’s z scores of the within-subject correlation coefficients between single-trial prestimulus alpha power and RT were significantly larger in HCs than in older adults with MCI. In addition, machine learning analyses indicated that prestimulus alpha power and its correlation with RT could serve as features to distinguish older adults with MCI from HCs and to predict performance on some neuropsychological tests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: The reduced correlation between prestimulus alpha activity and RT suggests that older adults with MCI experience impaired preparatory attention.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neural Circuits | New and Recent Articles: Spinal Interneurons With Dual Axon Projections to Knee-Extensor and Hip-Extensor Motor Pools</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncir.2020.00007</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The central nervous system (CNS) may simplify control of limb movements by activating certain combinations of muscles together, i.e., muscle synergies. Little is known, however, about the spinal cord interneurons that activate muscle synergies by exciting sets of motoneurons for different muscles. The turtle spinal cord, even without brain inputs and movement-related sensory feedback, can generate the patterns of motoneuron activity underlying forward swimming, three forms of scratching, and limb withdrawal. Spinal interneurons activated during scratching are typically activated during all three forms of scratching, to different degrees, even though each form of scratching has its own knee-hip synergy. Such spinal interneurons are also typically activated rhythmically during scratching motor patterns, with hip-related timing. We proposed a hypothesis that such interneurons that are most active during rostral scratch stimulation project their axons to both knee-extensor and hip-flexor motoneurons, thus generating the rostral scratch knee-hip synergy, while those interneurons most active during pocket scratch stimulation project their axons to both knee-extensor and hip-extensor motoneurons, thus generating the pocket scratch knee-hip synergy. The activity of the entire population would then generate the appropriate synergy, depending on the location of sensory stimulation. Mathematical modeling has demonstrated that this hypothesis is feasible. Here, we provide one test of this hypothesis by injecting two fluorescent retrograde tracers into the regions of knee-extensor motoneurons (more rostrally) and hip-extensor motoneurons (more caudally). We found that there were double-labeled interneurons, which projected their axons to both locations. The dual-projecting interneurons were widely distributed rostrocaudally, dorsoventrally, and mediolaterally within the hindlimb enlargement and pre-enlargement spinal segments examined. The existence of such dual-projecting interneurons is consistent with the hypothesis that they contribute to generating the knee-hip synergy for pocket scratching. The dual-projecting interneurons, however, were only about 1% of the total interneurons projecting to each location, which suggests that they might be one of several contributors to the appropriate knee-hip synergy. Indirect projections to both motor pools and/or knee extensor-dedicated interneurons might also contribute. There is evidence for dual-projecting spinal interneurons in frogs and mice as well, suggesting that they may contribute to limb motor control in a variety of vertebrates.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00049</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Many studies supported that bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs) can differentiate into neural cells, but few researchers detected mature and function of nerve cells, especially in vivo study. Some researchers even suggested that BM-MSCs transplantation would not be able to differentiate into functional neural cells. To figure out the dispute, this study examined bone marrow-derived sphere-like cells, harvested via neural stem cell suspension culture, then identified as bone marrow-derived neural progenitor cells (BM-NPCs) by finding the expression of neural progenitor cells genes and proteins, neural progenitor cells characteristic and nerve cell differentiation induced through both methods. Moreover, BM-NPCs transplantation showed long-term survival and improved the ethological and histological indexes of brain injury rats, demonstrating functional nervous cells differentiated from BM-NPCs. These in vitro and in vivo results confirmed BM-NPCs differentiating into mature and functional nerve cells. This study provided valuable experimental data for BM-NPCs, suggesting a potential alternative treatment of central nervous injury disease.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Association of Plasma Transferrin With Cognitive Decline in Patients With Mild Cognitive Impairment and Alzheimer’s Disease</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00038</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Objective: The objective of this study was to examine whether plasma transferrin levels are associated with longitudinal changes in cognitive performance in older individuals with normal cognition (CN), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and mild Alzheimer’s disease (AD).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: At baseline, there were a total of 358 participants from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort, including 58 older individuals with CN, 198 older individuals with MCI, and 102 patients with AD. Linear mixed models were utilized to examine the associations of plasma transferrin levels with changes in cognitive performance over time after adjustment of several potential covariates. The Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and the Clinical Dementia Rating Scale Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB) were used to examine the global cognition of participants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: First, no significant differences in the plasma transferrin levels were observed across three diagnostic groups. Second, in the cross-sectional analyses, the baseline plasma transferrin levels were negatively associated with the MMSE scores in the CN group, but not in the MCI or the AD group. Third, in the longitudinal analyses, we found that a higher plasma transferrin was associated with a steeper cognitive decline in the MCI and AD groups, but not in the CN group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: Higher plasma transferrin levels were associated with a steeper cognitive decline in participants with MCI and AD.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Boosting Antioxidant Self-defenses by Grafting Astrocytes Rejuvenates the Aged Microenvironment and Mitigates Nigrostriatal Toxicity in Parkinsonian Brain via an Nrf2-Driven Wnt/β-Catenin Prosurvival Axis</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00024</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Astrocyte (As) bidirectional dialog with neurons plays a fundamental role in major homeostatic brain functions, particularly providing metabolic support and antioxidant self-defense against reactive oxygen (ROS) and nitrogen species (RNS) via the activation of NF-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), a master regulator of oxidative stress. Disruption of As–neuron crosstalk is chiefly involved in neuronal degeneration observed in Parkinson’s disease (PD), the most common movement disorder characterized by the selective degeneration of dopaminergic (DAergic) cell bodies of the substantia nigra (SN) pars compacta (SNpc). Ventral midbrain (VM)-As are recognized to exert an important role in DAergic neuroprotection via the expression of a variety of factors, including wingless-related MMTV integration site 1 (Wnt1), a principal player in DAergic neurogenesis. However, whether As, by themselves, might fulfill the role of chief players in DAergic neurorestoration of aged PD mice is presently unresolved. Here, we used primary postnatal mouse VM-As as a graft source for unilateral transplantation above the SN of aged 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) mice after the onset of motor symptoms. Spatio-temporal analyses documented that the engrafted cells promoted: (i) a time-dependent nigrostriatal rescue along with increased high-affinity synaptosomal DA uptake and counteraction of motor deficit, as compared to mock-grafted counterparts; and (ii) a restoration of the impaired microenvironment via upregulation of As antioxidant self-defense through the activation of Nrf2/Wnt/β-catenin signaling, suggesting that grafting As has the potential to switch the SN neurorescue-unfriendly environment to a beneficial antioxidant/anti-inflammatory prosurvival milieu. These findings highlight As-derived factors/mechanisms as the crucial key for successful therapeutic outcomes in PD.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Microbiota and Other Preventive Strategies and Non-genetic Risk Factors in Parkinson’s Disease</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00012</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The exact cause of Parkinson’s disease (PD), the second most prevalent neurodegenerative disease in modern societies, is still unknown. Many scientists point out that PD is caused by a complex interaction between different factors. Although the main risk factor is age, there are other influences, genetic and environmental, that individually or in combination may trigger neurodegenerative changes leading to PD. Nowadays, research remains focused on better understanding which environmental factors are related to the risk of developing PD and why. In line with the knowledge on evidence on exposures that prevent/delay PD onset or that impact on disease progression, the aims of this review were: (i) to comment on the non-genetic risk factors that mainly affect idiopathic PD; and (ii) to comment on seemingly reliable preventive interventions. We discuss both environmental factors that may affect the central nervous system (CNS) or the intestinal tract, and the likely mechanisms underlying noxious or protective actions. Knowledge on risk, protective factors, and mechanisms may help to envisage why nigral dopaminergic neurons are so vulnerable in PD and, eventually, to design new strategies for PD prevention and/or anti-PD therapy. This article reviews the variety of the known and suspected environmental factors, such as lifestyle, gut microbiota or pesticide exposition, and distinguishes between those that are harmful or beneficial for the PD acquisition or progression. In fact, the review covers one of the most novel players in the whole picture, and we address the role of microbiota on keeping a healthy CNS and/or on preventing the “side-effects” related to aging.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: latest articles: ATR expands embryonic stem cell fate potential in response to replication stress</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/54756</link>
	<content:encoded>Unrepaired DNA damage during embryonic development can be potentially inherited by a large population of cells. However, the quality control mechanisms that minimize the contribution of damaged cells to developing embryos remain poorly understood. Here, we uncovered an ATR- and CHK1-mediated transcriptional response to replication stress (RS) in mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) that induces genes expressed in totipotent two-cell (2C) stage embryos and 2C-like cells. This response is mediated by &lt;i&gt;Dux&lt;/i&gt;, a multicopy retrogene defining the cleavage-specific transcriptional program in placental mammals. In response to RS, DUX triggers the transcription of 2C-like markers such as murine endogenous retrovirus-like elements (MERVL) and &lt;i&gt;Zscan4&lt;/i&gt;. This response can also be elicited by ETAA1-mediated ATR activation in the absence of RS. ATR-mediated activation of DUX requires GRSF1-dependent post-transcriptional regulation of &lt;i&gt;Dux&lt;/i&gt; mRNA. Strikingly, activation of ATR expands ESCs fate potential by extending their contribution to both embryonic and extra-embryonic tissues. These findings define a novel ATR dependent pathway involved in maintaining genome stability in developing embryos by controlling ESCs fate in response to RS.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/53281</link>
	<content:encoded>Inhibitory neurons play critical roles in regulating and shaping olfactory responses in vertebrates and invertebrates. In insects, these roles are performed by relatively few neurons, which can be interrogated efficiently, revealing fundamental principles of olfactory coding. Here, with electrophysiological recordings from the locust and a large-scale biophysical model, we analyzed the properties and functions of GGN, a unique giant GABAergic neuron that plays a central role in structuring olfactory codes in the locust mushroom body. Our simulations suggest that depolarization of GGN at its input branch can globally inhibit KCs several hundred microns away. Our &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; recordings show that GGN responds to odors with complex temporal patterns of depolarization and hyperpolarization that can vary with odors and across animals, leading our model to predict the existence of a yet-undiscovered olfactory pathway. Our analysis reveals basic new features of GGN and the olfactory network surrounding it.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: latest articles: HIPK4 is essential for murine spermiogenesis</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/50209</link>
	<content:encoded>Mammalian spermiogenesis is a remarkable cellular transformation, during which round spermatids elongate into chromatin-condensed spermatozoa. The signaling pathways that coordinate this process are not well understood, and we demonstrate here that homeodomain-interacting protein kinase 4 (HIPK4) is essential for spermiogenesis and male fertility in mice. HIPK4 is predominantly expressed in round and early elongating spermatids, and &lt;i&gt;Hipk4&lt;/i&gt; knockout males are sterile, exhibiting phenotypes consistent with oligoasthenoteratozoospermia. &lt;i&gt;Hipk4&lt;/i&gt; mutant sperm have reduced oocyte binding and are incompetent for in vitro fertilization, but they can still produce viable offspring via intracytoplasmic sperm injection. Optical and electron microscopy of HIPK4-null male germ cells reveals defects in the filamentous actin (F-actin)-scaffolded acroplaxome during spermatid elongation and abnormal head morphologies in mature spermatozoa. We further observe that HIPK4 overexpression induces branched F-actin structures in cultured fibroblasts and that HIPK4 deficiency alters the subcellular distribution of an F-actin capping protein in the testis, supporting a role for this kinase in cytoskeleton remodeling. Our findings establish HIPK4 as an essential regulator of sperm head shaping and potential target for male contraception.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: latest articles: Adaptation of hydroxymethylbutenyl diphosphate reductase enables volatile isoprenoid production</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/48685</link>
	<content:encoded>Volatile isoprenoids produced by plants are emitted in vast quantities into the atmosphere, with substantial effects on global carbon cycling. Yet, the molecular mechanisms regulating the balance between volatile and non-volatile isoprenoid production remain unknown. Isoprenoids are synthesised via sequential condensation of isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPP) to dimethylallyl pyrophosphate (DMAPP), with volatile isoprenoids containing fewer isopentenyl subunits. The DMAPP:IPP ratio could affect the balance between volatile and non-volatile isoprenoids, but the plastidic DMAPP:IPP ratio is generally believed to be similar across different species. Here we demonstrate that the ratio of DMAPP:IPP produced by hydroxymethylbutenyl diphosphate reductase (HDR/IspH), the final step of the plastidic isoprenoid production pathway, is not fixed. Instead, this ratio varies greatly across HDRs from phylogenetically distinct plants, correlating with isoprenoid production patterns. Our findings suggest that adaptation of HDR plays a previously unrecognised role in determining in vivo carbon availability for isoprenoid emissions, directly shaping global biosphere-atmosphere interactions.</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Meningeal Lymphangiogenesis and Enhanced Glymphatic Activity in Mice with Chronically Implanted EEG Electrodes</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/40/11/2371?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Chronic electroencephalography (EEG) is a widely used tool for monitoring cortical electrical activity in experimental animals. Although chronic implants allow for high-quality, long-term recordings in preclinical studies, the electrodes are foreign objects and might therefore be expected to induce a local inflammatory response. We here analyzed the effects of chronic cranial electrode implantation on glymphatic fluid transport and in provoking structural changes in the meninges and cerebral cortex of male and female mice. Immunohistochemical analysis of brain tissue and dura revealed reactive gliosis in the cortex underlying the electrodes and extensive meningeal lymphangiogenesis in the surrounding dura. Meningeal lymphangiogenesis was also evident in mice prepared with the commonly used chronic cranial window. Glymphatic influx of a CSF tracer was significantly enhanced at 30 d postsurgery in both awake and ketamine-xylazine anesthetized mice with electrodes, supporting the concept that glymphatic influx and intracranial lymphatic drainage are interconnected. Altogether, the experimental results provide clear evidence that chronic implantation of EEG electrodes is associated with significant changes in the brain's fluid transport system. Future studies involving EEG recordings and chronic cranial windows must consider the physiological consequences of cranial implants, which include glial scarring, meningeal lymphangiogenesis, and increased glymphatic activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; This study shows that implantation of extradural electrodes provokes meningeal lymphangiogenesis, enhanced glymphatic influx of CSF, and reactive gliosis. The analysis based on CSF tracer injection in combination with immunohistochemistry showed that chronically implanted electroencephalography electrodes were surrounded by lymphatic sprouts originating from lymphatic vasculature along the dural sinuses and the middle meningeal artery. Likewise, chronic cranial windows provoked lymphatic sprouting. Tracer influx assessed in coronal slices was increased in agreement with previous reports identifying a close association between glymphatic activity and the meningeal lymphatic vasculature. Lymphangiogenesis in the meninges and altered glymphatic fluid transport after electrode implantation have not previously been described and adds new insights to the foreign body response of the CNS.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Interferon-{beta} Plays a Detrimental Role in Experimental Traumatic Brain Injury by Enhancing Neuroinflammation That Drives Chronic Neurodegeneration</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/40/11/2357?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;DNA damage and type I interferons (IFNs) contribute to inflammatory responses after traumatic brain injury (TBI). TBI-induced activation of microglia and peripherally-derived inflammatory macrophages may lead to tissue damage and neurological deficits. Here, we investigated the role of IFN-β in secondary injury after TBI using a controlled cortical impact model in adult male IFN-β-deficient (IFN-β&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt;) mice and assessed post-traumatic neuroinflammatory responses, neuropathology, and long-term functional recovery. TBI increased expression of DNA sensors cyclic GMP-AMP synthase and stimulator of interferon genes in wild-type (WT) mice. IFN-β and other IFN-related and neuroinflammatory genes were also upregulated early and persistently after TBI. TBI increased expression of proinflammatory mediators in the cortex and hippocampus of WT mice, whereas levels were mitigated in IFN-β&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt; mice. Moreover, long-term microglia activation, motor, and cognitive function impairments were decreased in IFN-β&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt; TBI mice compared with their injured WT counterparts; improved neurological recovery was associated with reduced lesion volume and hippocampal neurodegeneration in IFN-β&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt; mice. Continuous central administration of a neutralizing antibody to the IFN-α/β receptor (IFNAR) for 3 d, beginning 30 min post-injury, reversed early cognitive impairments in TBI mice and led to transient improvements in motor function. However, anti-IFNAR treatment did not improve long-term functional recovery or decrease TBI neuropathology at 28 d post-injury. In summary, TBI induces a robust neuroinflammatory response that is associated with increased expression of IFN-β and other IFN-related genes. Inhibition of IFN-β reduces post-traumatic neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration, resulting in improved neurological recovery. Thus, IFN-β may be a potential therapeutic target for TBI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; TBI frequently causes long-term neurological and psychiatric changes in head injury patients. TBI-induced secondary injury processes including persistent neuroinflammation evolve over time and can contribute to chronic neurological impairments. The present study demonstrates that TBI is followed by robust activation of type I IFN pathways, which have been implicated in microglial-associated neuroinflammation and chronic neurodegeneration. We examined the effects of genetic or pharmacological inhibition of IFN-β, a key component of type I IFN mechanisms to address its role in TBI pathophysiology. Inhibition of IFN-β signaling resulted in reduced neuroinflammation, attenuated neurobehavioral deficits, and limited tissue loss long after TBI. These preclinical findings suggest that IFN-β may be a potential therapeutic target for TBI.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Temporal Dynamics of Memory-guided Cognitive Control and Generalization of Control via Overlapping Associative Memories</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/40/11/2343?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Goal-directed behavior can benefit from proactive adjustments of cognitive control that occur in anticipation of forthcoming cognitive control demands (CCD). Predictions of forthcoming CCD are thought to depend on learning and memory in two ways: First, through direct experience, associative encoding may link previously experienced CCD to its triggering item, such that subsequent encounters with the item serve to cue retrieval of (i.e., predict) the associated CCD. Second, in the absence of direct experience, pattern completion and mnemonic integration mechanisms may allow CCD to be generalized from its associated item to other items related in memory. While extant behavioral evidence documents both types of CCD prediction, the neurocognitive mechanisms giving rise to these predictions remain largely unexplored. Here, we tested two hypotheses: (1) memory-guided predictions about CCD precede control adjustments due to the actual CCD required; and (2) generalization of CCD can be accomplished through integration mechanisms that link partially overlapping CCD-item and item-item associations in memory. Supporting these hypotheses, the temporal dynamics of theta and alpha power in human electroencephalography data (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 43, 26 females) revealed that an associative CCD effect emerges earlier than interaction effects involving actual CCD. Furthermore, generalization of CCD from one item (X) to another item (Y) was predicted by a decrease in alpha power following the presentation of the X-Y pair. These findings advance understanding of the mechanisms underlying memory-guided adjustments of cognitive control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Cognitive control adaptively regulates information processing to align with task goals. Experience-based expectations enable adjustments of control, leading to improved performance when expectations match the actual control demand required. Using EEG, we demonstrate that memory for past cognitive control demand proactively guides the allocation of cognitive control, preceding adjustments of control triggered by the demands of the present environment. Furthermore, we demonstrate that learned cognitive control demands can be generalized through mnemonic integration processes, enabling the spread of expectations about cognitive control demands to items associated in memory. We reveal that this generalization is linked to decreased alpha oscillation in medial frontal channels. Collectively, these findings provide new insights into how memory-control interactions facilitate goal-directed behavior.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: SIRT1 Decreases Emotional Pain Vulnerability with Associated CaMKII{alpha} Deacetylation in Central Amygdala</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/40/11/2332?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Emotional disorders are common comorbid conditions that further exacerbate the severity and chronicity of chronic pain. However, individuals show considerable vulnerability to the development of chronic pain under similar pain conditions. In this study on male rat and mouse models of chronic neuropathic pain, we identify the histone deacetylase Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) in central amygdala as a key epigenetic regulator that controls the development of comorbid emotional disorders underlying the individual vulnerability to chronic pain. We found that animals that were vulnerable to developing behaviors of anxiety and depression under the pain condition displayed reduced SIRT1 protein levels in central amygdala, but not those animals resistant to the emotional disorders. Viral overexpression of local SIRT1 reversed this vulnerability, but viral knockdown of local SIRT1 mimicked the pain effect, eliciting the pain vulnerability in pain-free animals. The SIRT1 action was associated with CaMKIIα downregulation and deacetylation of histone H3 lysine 9 at the &lt;i&gt;CaMKII&lt;/i&gt;α promoter. These results suggest that, by transcriptional repression of &lt;i&gt;CaMKII&lt;/i&gt;α in central amygdala, SIRT1 functions to guard against the emotional pain vulnerability under chronic pain conditions. This study indicates that SIRT1 may serve as a potential therapeutic molecule for individualized treatment of chronic pain with vulnerable emotional disorders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Chronic pain is a prevalent neurological disease with no effective treatment at present. Pain patients display considerably variable vulnerability to developing chronic pain, indicating individual-based molecular mechanisms underlying the pain vulnerability, which is hardly addressed in current preclinical research. In this study, we have identified the histone deacetylase Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) as a key regulator that controls this pain vulnerability. This study reveals that the SIRT1–CaMKIIaα pathway in central amygdala acts as an epigenetic mechanism that guards against the development of comorbid emotional disorders under chronic pain, and that its dysfunction causes increased vulnerability to the development of chronic pain. These findings suggest that SIRT1 activators may be used in a novel therapeutic approach for individual-based treatment of chronic pain.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Cholecystokinin-Expressing Interneurons of the Medial Prefrontal Cortex Mediate Working Memory Retrieval</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/40/11/2314?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Distinct components of working memory are coordinated by different classes of inhibitory interneurons in the PFC, but the role of cholecystokinin (CCK)-positive interneurons remains enigmatic. In humans, this major population of interneurons shows histological abnormalities in schizophrenia, an illness in which deficient working memory is a core defining symptom and the best predictor of long-term functional outcome. Yet, CCK interneurons as a molecularly distinct class have proved intractable to examination by typical molecular methods due to widespread expression of CCK in the pyramidal neuron population. Using an intersectional approach in mice of both sexes, we have succeeded in labeling, interrogating, and manipulating CCK interneurons in the mPFC. Here, we describe the anatomical distribution, electrophysiological properties, and postsynaptic connectivity of CCK interneurons, and evaluate their role in cognition. We found that CCK interneurons comprise a larger proportion of the mPFC interneurons compared with parvalbumin interneurons, targeting a wide range of neuronal subtypes with a distinct connectivity pattern. Phase-specific optogenetic inhibition revealed that CCK, but not parvalbumin, interneurons play a critical role in the retrieval of working memory. These findings shine new light on the relationship between cortical CCK interneurons and cognition and offer a new set of tools to investigate interneuron dysfunction and cognitive impairments associated with schizophrenia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Cholecystokinin-expressing interneurons outnumber other interneuron populations in key brain areas involved in cognition and memory, including the mPFC. However, they have proved intractable to examination as experimental techniques have lacked the necessary selectivity. To the best of our knowledge, the present study is the first to report detailed properties of cortical cholecystokinin interneurons, revealing their anatomical organization, electrophysiological properties, postsynaptic connectivity, and behavioral function in working memory.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Post-Saccadic Face Processing Is Modulated by Pre-Saccadic Preview: Evidence from Fixation-Related Potentials</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/40/11/2305?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Humans actively sample their environment with saccadic eye movements to bring relevant information into high-acuity foveal vision. Despite being lower in resolution, peripheral information is also available before each saccade. How the pre-saccadic extrafoveal preview of a visual object influences its post-saccadic processing is still an unanswered question. The current study investigated this question by simultaneously recording behavior and fixation-related brain potentials while human subjects made saccades to face stimuli. We manipulated the relationship between pre-saccadic &quot;previews&quot; and post-saccadic images to explicitly isolate the influences of the former. Subjects performed a gender discrimination task on a newly foveated face under three preview conditions: scrambled face, incongruent face (different identity from the foveated face), and congruent face (same identity). As expected, reaction times were faster after a congruent-face preview compared with a scrambled-face preview. Importantly, intact face previews (either incongruent or congruent) resulted in a massive reduction of post-saccadic neural responses. Specifically, we analyzed the classic face-selective N170 component at occipitotemporal electroencephalogram electrodes, which was still present in our experiments with active looking. However, the post-saccadic N170 was strongly attenuated following intact-face previews compared with the scrambled condition. This large and long-lasting decrease in evoked activity is consistent with a trans-saccadic mechanism of prediction that influences category-specific neural processing at the start of a new fixation. These findings constrain theories of visual stability and show that the extrafoveal preview methodology can be a useful tool to investigate its underlying mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Neural correlates of object recognition have traditionally been studied by flashing stimuli to the central visual field. This procedure differs in fundamental ways from natural vision, where viewers actively sample the environment with eye movements and also obtain a low-resolution preview of soon-to-be-fixated objects. Here we show that the N170, a classic electrophysiological marker of the structural encoding of faces, also occurs during a more natural viewing condition but is strongly reduced due to extrafoveal preprocessing (preview benefit). Our results therefore highlight the importance of peripheral vision during trans-saccadic processing in building a coherent and stable representation of the world around us.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Appetitive Memory with Survival Benefit Is Robust Across Aging in Drosophila</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/40/11/2296?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The formation of memory declines with advancing age. However, susceptibility to memory impairments depends on several factors, including the robustness of memory, the responsible neural circuits, and the internal state of aged individuals. How age-dependent changes in internal states and neural circuits affect memory formation remains unclear. Here, we show in &lt;i&gt;Drosophila melanogaster&lt;/i&gt; that aged flies of both sexes form robust appetitive memory conditioned with nutritious sugar, which suppresses their high mortality rates during starvation. In contrast, aging impairs the formation of appetitive memory conditioned with non-nutritious sugar that lacks survival benefits for the flies. We found that aging enhanced the preference for nutritious sugar over non-nutritious sugar correlated with an age-dependent increase in the expression of &lt;i&gt;Drosophila neuropeptide F&lt;/i&gt;, an ortholog of mammalian neuropeptide Y. Furthermore, a subset of dopaminergic neurons that signal the sweet taste of sugar decreases its function with aging, while a subset of dopaminergic neurons that signal the nutritional value of sugar maintains its function with age. Our results suggest that aging impairs the ability to form memories without survival benefits; however, the ability to form memories with survival benefits is maintained through age-dependent changes in the neural circuits and neuropeptides.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The susceptibility to age-dependent memory impairments depends on the strength of the memory, changes in the responsible neurons, and internal states of aged individuals. How age-dependent changes in such internal states affect neural activity and memory formation remains unclear. We show in &lt;i&gt;Drosophila melanogaster&lt;/i&gt; that aged flies of both sexes form robust appetitive memory conditioned with nutritious sugar, which has survival benefits for aged flies. In contrast, aging impairs the formation of appetitive memory conditioned with non-nutritious sugar that lacks survival benefits for the flies. Aging changes the neural circuits including dopamine neurons and neuropeptide F-expressing neurons, leading to the age-dependent impairment in memory with insufficient survival benefits and the preservation of the ability to form memory with survival benefits.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Social Stimuli Induce Activation of Oxytocin Neurons Within the Paraventricular Nucleus of the Hypothalamus to Promote Social Behavior in Male Mice</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/40/11/2282?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Oxytocin (OT) is critical for the expression of social behavior across a wide array of species; however, the role of this system in the encoding of socially relevant information is not well understood. In the present study, we show that chemogenetic activation of OT neurons within the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVH) of male mice (OT-Ires-Cre) enhanced social investigation during a social choice test, while chemogenetic inhibition of these neurons abolished typical social preferences. These data suggest that activation of the OT system is necessary to direct behavior preferentially toward social stimuli. To determine whether the presence of a social stimulus is sufficient to induce activation of PVH-OT neurons, we performed the first definitive recording of OT neurons in awake mice using two-photon calcium imaging. These recordings demonstrate that social stimuli activate PVH-OT neurons and that these neurons differentially encode social and nonsocial stimuli, suggesting that PVH-OT neurons may act to convey social salience of environmental stimuli. Finally, an attenuation of social salience is associated with social disorders, such as autism. We therefore also examined possible OT system dysfunction in a mouse model of autism, &lt;i&gt;Shank3b&lt;/i&gt; knock-out (KO) mice. Male &lt;i&gt;Shank3b&lt;/i&gt; KO mice showed a marked reduction in PVH-OT neuron number and administration of an OT receptor agonist improved social deficits. Overall, these data suggest that the presence of a social stimulus induces activation of the PVH-OT neurons to promote adaptive social behavior responses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Although the oxytocin (OT) system is well known to regulate a diverse array of social behaviors, the mechanism in which OT acts to promote the appropriate social response is poorly understood. One hypothesis is that the presence of social conspecifics activates the OT system to generate an adaptive social response. Here, we selectively recorded from OT neurons in the paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus (PVH) to show that social stimulus exposure indeed induces activation of the OT system. We also show that activation of the OT system is necessary to promote social behavior and that mice with abnormal social behavior have reduced numbers of PVH-OT neurons. Finally, aberrant social behavior in these mice was rescued by administration of an OT receptor agonist.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Response Dissociation in Hierarchical Cortical Circuits: a Unique Feature of Autism Spectrum Disorder</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/40/11/2269?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A prominent hypothesis regarding the pathophysiology of autism is that an increase in the balance between neural excitation and inhibition results in an increase in neural responses. However, previous reports of population-level response magnitude in individuals with autism have been inconsistent. Critically, network interactions have not been considered in previous neuroimaging studies of excitation and inhibition imbalance in autism. In particular, a defining characteristic of cortical organization is its hierarchical and interactive structure; sensory and cognitive systems are comprised of networks where later stages inherit and build upon the processing of earlier input stages, and also influence and shape earlier stages by top-down modulation. Here we used the well established connections of the human visual system to examine response magnitudes in a higher-order motion processing region [middle temporal area (MT+)] and its primary input region (V1). Simple visual stimuli were presented to adult individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASD; &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 24, mean age 23 years, 8 females) and neurotypical controls (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 24, mean age 22, 8 females) during fMRI scanning. We discovered a strong dissociation of fMRI response magnitude between region MT+ and V1 in individuals with ASD: individuals with high MT+ responses had attenuated V1 responses. The magnitude of MT+ amplification and of V1 attenuation was associated with autism severity, appeared to result from amplified suppressive feedback from MT+ to V1, and was not present in neurotypical controls. Our results reveal the potential role of altered hierarchical network interactions in the pathophysiology of ASD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; An imbalance between neural excitation and inhibition, resulting in increased neural responses, has been suggested as a pathophysiological pathway to autism, but direct evidence from humans is lacking. In the current study we consider the role of interactions between stages of sensory processing when testing increased neural responses in individuals with autism. We used the well known hierarchical structure of the visual motion pathway to demonstrate dissociation in the fMRI response magnitude between adjacent stages of processing in autism: responses are attenuated in a primary visual area but amplified in a subsequent higher-order area. This response dissociation appears to rely on enhanced suppressive feedback between regions and reveals a previously unknown cortical network alteration in autism.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Modifying the Adult Rat Tonotopic Map with Sound Exposure Produces Frequency Discrimination Deficits That Are Recovered with Training</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/40/11/2259?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Frequency discrimination learning is often accompanied by an expansion of the functional region corresponding to the target frequency within the auditory cortex. Although the perceptual significance of this plastic functional reorganization remains debated, greater cortical representation is generally thought to improve perception for a stimulus. Recently, the ability to expand functional representations through passive sound experience has been demonstrated in adult rats, suggesting that it may be possible to design passive sound exposures to enhance specific perceptual abilities in adulthood. To test this hypothesis, we exposed adult female Long–Evans rats to 2 weeks of moderate-intensity broadband white noise followed by 1 week of 7 kHz tone pips, a paradigm that results in the functional over-representation of 7 kHz within the adult tonotopic map. We then tested the ability of exposed rats to identify 7 kHz among distractor tones on an adaptive tone discrimination task. Contrary to our expectations, we found that map expansion impaired frequency discrimination and delayed perceptual learning. Rats exposed to noise followed by 15 kHz tone pips were not impaired at the same task. Exposed rats also exhibited changes in auditory cortical responses consistent with reduced discriminability of the exposure tone. Encouragingly, these deficits were completely recovered with training. Our results provide strong evidence that map expansion alone does not imply improved perception. Rather, plastic changes in frequency representation induced by bottom-up processes can worsen perceptual faculties, but because of the very nature of plasticity these changes are inherently reversible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The potent ability of our acoustic environment to shape cortical sensory representations throughout life has led to a growing interest in harnessing both passive sound experience and operant perceptual learning to enhance mature cortical function. We use sound exposure to induce targeted expansions in the adult rat tonotopic map and find that these bottom-up changes unexpectedly impair performance on an adaptive tone discrimination task. Encouragingly, however, we also show that training promotes the recovery of electrophysiological measures of reduced neural discriminability following sound exposure. These results provide support for future neuroplasticity-based treatments that take into account both the sensory statistics of our external environment and perceptual training strategies to improve learning and memory in the adult auditory system.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Connexin Signaling Is Involved in the Reactivation of a Latent Stem Cell Niche after Spinal Cord Injury</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/40/11/2246?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The ependyma of the adult spinal cord is a latent stem cell niche that is reactivated by spinal cord injury contributing new cells to the glial scar. The cellular events taking place in the early stages of the reaction of the ependyma to injury remain little understood. Ependymal cells are functionally heterogeneous with a mitotically active subpopulation lining the lateral domains of the central canal (CC) that are coupled via gap junctions. Gap junctions and connexin hemichannels are key regulators of the biology of neural progenitors during development and in adult neurogenic niches. Thus, we hypothesized that communication via connexins in the CC is developmentally regulated and may play a part in the reactivation of this latent stem cell niche after injury. To test these possibilities, we combined patch-clamp recordings of ependymal cells with immunohistochemistry for various connexins in the neonatal and the adult (P &amp;gt; 90) normal and injured spinal cord of male and female mice. We find that coupling among ependymal cells is downregulated as postnatal development proceeds but increases after injury, resembling the immature CC. The increase in gap junction coupling in the adult CC was paralleled by upregulation of connexin 26, which correlated with the resumption of proliferation and a reduction of connexin hemichannel activity. Connexin blockade reduced the injury-induced proliferation of ependymal cells. Our findings suggest that connexins are involved in the early reaction of ependymal cells to injury, representing a potential target to improve the contribution of the CC stem cell niche to repair.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Ependymal cells in the adult spinal cord are latent progenitors that react to injury to support some degree of endogenous repair. Understanding the mechanisms by which these progenitor-like cells are regulated in the aftermath of spinal cord injury is critical to design future manipulations aimed at improving healing and functional recovery. Gap junctions and connexin hemichannels are key regulators of the biology of neural progenitors during development and in adult neurogenic niches. We find here that connexin signaling in the ependyma changes after injury of the adult spinal cord, functionally resembling the immature active-stem cell niche of neonatal animals. Our findings suggest that connexins in ependymal cells are potential targets to improve self-repair of the spinal cord.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Dual-Component Structural Plasticity Mediated by {alpha}CaMKII Autophosphorylation on Basal Dendrites of Cortical Layer 2/3 Neurones</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/40/11/2228?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Sensory cortex exhibits receptive field plasticity throughout life in response to changes in sensory experience and offers the experimental possibility of aligning functional changes in receptive field properties with underpinning structural changes in synapses. We looked at the effects on structural plasticity of two different patterns of whisker deprivation in male and female mice: chessboard deprivation, which causes functional plasticity; and all deprived, which does not. Using 2-photon microscopy and chronic imaging through a cranial window over the barrel cortex, we found that layer 2/3 neurones exhibit robust structural plasticity, but only in response to whisker deprivation patterns that cause functional plasticity. Chessboard pattern deprivation caused dual-component plasticity in layer 2/3 by (1) increasing production of new spines that subsequently persisted for weeks and (2) enlarging spine head sizes in the preexisting stable spine population. Structural plasticity occurred on basal dendrites, but not apical dendrites. Both components of plasticity were absent in α&lt;i&gt;CaMKII-T286A&lt;/i&gt; mutants that lack LTP and experience-dependent potentiation in barrel cortex, implying that αCaMKII autophosphorylation is not only important for stabilization and enlargement of spines, but also for new spine production. These studies therefore reveal the relationship between spared whisker potentiation in layer 2/3 neurones and the form and mechanisms of structural plasticity processes that underlie them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; This study provides a missing link in a chain of reasoning that connects LTP to experience-dependent functional plasticity &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. We found that increases in dendritic spine formation and spine enlargement (both of which are characteristic of LTP) only occurred in barrel cortex during sensory deprivation that produced potentiation of sensory responses. Furthermore, the dendritic spine plasticity did not occur during sensory deprivation in mice lacking LTP and experience-dependent potentiation (αCaMKII autophosphorylation mutants). We also found that the dual-component dendritic spine plasticity only occurred on basal dendrites and not on apical dendrites, thereby resolving a paradox in the literature suggesting that layer 2/3 neurones lack structural plasticity in response to sensory deprivation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Interneuron Transplantation Rescues Social Behavior Deficits without Restoring Wild-Type Physiology in a Mouse Model of Autism with Excessive Synaptic Inhibition</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/40/11/2215?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Manipulations that enhance GABAergic inhibition have been associated with improved behavioral phenotypes in autism models, suggesting that autism may be treated by correcting underlying deficits of inhibition. Interneuron transplantation is a method for increasing recipient synaptic inhibition, and it has been considered a prospective therapy for conditions marked by deficient inhibition, including neuropsychiatric disorders. It is unknown, however, whether interneuron transplantation may be therapeutically effective only for conditions marked by reduced inhibition, and it is also unclear whether transplantation improves behavioral phenotypes solely by normalizing underlying circuit defects. To address these questions, we studied the effects of interneuron transplantation in male and female mice lacking the autism-associated gene, &lt;i&gt;Pten&lt;/i&gt;, in GABAergic interneurons. &lt;i&gt;Pten&lt;/i&gt; mutant mice exhibit social behavior deficits, elevated synaptic inhibition in prefrontal cortex, abnormal baseline and social interaction-evoked electroencephalogram (EEG) signals, and an altered composition of cortical interneuron subtypes. Transplantation of wild-type embryonic interneurons from the medial ganglionic eminence into the prefrontal cortex of neonatal &lt;i&gt;Pten&lt;/i&gt; mutants rescued social behavior despite exacerbating excessive levels of synaptic inhibition. Furthermore, transplantation did not normalize recipient EEG signals measured during baseline states. Interneuron transplantation can thus correct behavioral deficits even when those deficits are associated with elevated synaptic inhibition. Moreover, transplantation does not exert therapeutic effects solely by restoring wild-type circuit states. Our findings indicate that interneuron transplantation could offer a novel cell-based approach to autism treatment while challenging assumptions that effective therapies must reverse underlying circuit defects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Imbalances between neural excitation and inhibition are hypothesized to contribute to the pathophysiology of autism. Interneuron transplantation is a method for altering recipient inhibition, and it has been considered a prospective therapy for neuropsychiatric disorders, including autism. Here we examined the behavioral and physiological effects of interneuron transplantation in a mouse genetic model of autism. They demonstrate that transplantation rescues recipient social interaction deficits without correcting a common measure of recipient inhibition, or circuit-level physiological measures. These findings demonstrate that interneuron transplantation can exert therapeutic behavioral effects without necessarily restoring wild-type circuit states, while highlighting the potential of interneuron transplantation as an autism therapy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Kv4.1, a Key Ion Channel For Low Frequency Firing of Dentate Granule Cells, Is Crucial for Pattern Separation</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/40/11/2200?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The dentate gyrus (DG) in the hippocampus may play key roles in remembering distinct episodes through pattern separation, which may be subserved by the sparse firing properties of granule cells (GCs) in the DG. Low intrinsic excitability is characteristic of mature GCs, but ion channel mechanisms are not fully understood. Here, we investigated ionic channel mechanisms for firing frequency regulation in hippocampal GCs using male and female mice, and identified Kv4.1 as a key player. Immunofluorescence analysis showed that Kv4.1 was preferentially expressed in the DG, and its expression level determined by Western blot analysis was higher at 8-week than 3-week-old mice, suggesting a developmental regulation of Kv4.1 expression. With respect to firing frequency, GCs are categorized into two distinctive groups: low-frequency (LF) and high-frequency (HF) firing GCs. Input resistance (&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;in&lt;/sub&gt;) of most LF-GCs is lower than 200 M, suggesting that LF-GCs are fully mature GCs. Kv4.1 channel inhibition by intracellular perfusion of Kv4.1 antibody increased firing rates and gain of the input-output relationship selectively in LF-GCs with no significant effect on resting membrane potential and &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;in&lt;/sub&gt;, but had no effect in HF-GCs. Importantly, mature GCs from mice depleted of Kv4.1 transcripts in the DG showed increased firing frequency, and these mice showed an impairment in contextual discrimination task. Our findings suggest that Kv4.1 expression occurring at late stage of GC maturation is essential for low excitability of DG networks and thereby contributes to pattern separation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The sparse activity of dentate granule cells (GCs), which is essential for pattern separation, is supported by high inhibitory inputs and low intrinsic excitability of GCs. Low excitability of GCs is thought to be attributable to a high K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; conductance at resting membrane potentials, but this study identifies Kv4.1, a depolarization-activated K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channel, as a key ion channel that regulates firing of GCs without affecting resting membrane potentials. Kv4.1 expression is developmentally regulated and Kv4.1 currents are detected only in mature GCs that show low-frequency firing, but not in less mature high-frequency firing GCs. Furthermore, mice depleted of Kv4.1 transcripts in the dentate gyrus show impaired pattern separation, suggesting that Kv4.1 is crucial for sparse coding and pattern separation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony Stimulating Factor As an Indirect Mediator of Nociceptor Activation and Pain</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/40/11/2189?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The interaction between the immune system and the nervous system has been at the center of multiple research studies in recent years. Whereas the role played by cytokines as neuronal mediators is no longer contested, the mechanisms by which cytokines modulate pain processing remain to be elucidated. In this study, we have analyzed the involvement of granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) in nociceptor activation in male and female mice. Previous studies have suggested GM-CSF might directly activate neurons. However, here we established the absence of a functional GM-CSF receptor in murine nociceptors, and suggest an indirect mechanism of action, via immune cells. We report that GM-CSF applied directly to magnetically purified nociceptors does not induce any transcriptional changes in nociceptive genes. In contrast, conditioned medium from GM-CSF-treated murine macrophages was able to drive nociceptor transcription. We also found that conditioned medium from nociceptors treated with the well established pain mediator, nerve growth factor, could also modify macrophage gene transcription, providing further evidence for a bidirectional crosstalk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The interaction of the immune system and the nervous system is known to play an important role in the development and maintenance of chronic pain disorders. Elucidating the mechanisms of these interactions is an important step toward understanding, and therefore treating, chronic pain disorders. This study provides evidence for a two-way crosstalk between macrophages and nociceptors in the peripheral nervous system, which may contribute to the sensitization of nociceptors by cytokines in pain development.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Pericyte-Mediated Tissue Repair through PDGFR{beta} Promotes Peri-Infarct Astrogliosis, Oligodendrogenesis, and Functional Recovery after Acute Ischemic Stroke</title>
	<link>http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/7/2/ENEURO.0474-19.2020?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Post-stroke functional recovery can occur spontaneously during the subacute phase; however, how post-stroke fibrotic repair affects functional recovery is highly debated. Platelet-derived growth factor receptor β (PDGFRβ)-expressing pericytes are responsible for post-stroke fibrotic repair within infarct areas; therefore, we examined peri-infarct neural reorganization and functional recovery after permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (pMCAO) using pericyte-deficient &lt;i&gt;Pdgfrb&lt;sup&gt;+/–&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt; mice. Time-dependent reduction of infarct area sizes, i.e., repair, was significantly impaired in &lt;i&gt;Pdgfrb&lt;sup&gt;+/–&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt; mice with recovery of cerebral blood flow (CBF) in ischemic areas attenuated by defective leptomeningeal arteriogenesis and intrainfarct angiogenesis. Peri-infarct astrogliosis, accompanied by increased STAT3 phosphorylation, was attenuated in &lt;i&gt;Pdgfrb&lt;sup&gt;+/–&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt; mice. Pericyte-conditioned medium (PCM), particularly when treated with platelet-derived growth factor subunit B (PDGFB) homodimer (PDGF-BB; PCM/PDGF-BB), activated STAT3 and enhanced the proliferation and activity of cultured astrocytes. Although peri-infarct proliferation of oligodendrocyte (OL) precursor cells (OPCs) was induced promptly after pMCAO regardless of intrainfarct repair, OPC differentiation and remyelination were significantly attenuated in &lt;i&gt;Pdgfrb&lt;sup&gt;+/–&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt; mice. Consistently, astrocyte-CM (ACM) promoted OPC differentiation and myelination, which were enhanced remarkably by adding PCM/PDGF-BB to the medium. Post-stroke functional recovery correlated well with the extent and process of intrainfarct repair and peri-infarct oligodendrogenesis. Overall, pericyte-mediated intrainfarct fibrotic repair through PDGFRβ may promote functional recovery through enhancement of peri-infarct oligodendrogenesis as well as astrogliosis after acute ischemic stroke.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>RSS PAP: Chronic activation of Gp1 mGluRs leads to distinct refinement of neural network activity through non-canonical p53 and Akt signaling</title>
	<link>http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0438-19.2020v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>ABSTRACT&lt;p&gt;Group 1 metabotropic glutamate receptors (Gp1 mGluRs), including mGluR1 and mGluR5, are critical regulators for neuronal and synaptic plasticity. Dysregulated Gp1 mGluR signaling is observed with various neurological disorders, including Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, epilepsy, and autism spectrum disorders. It is well established that acute activation of Gp1 mGluRs leads to elevation of neuronal intrinsic excitability and long-term synaptic depression. However, it remains unknown how chronic activation of Gp1 mGluRs can affect neural activity and what molecular mechanisms might be involved. In the current study, we employed a multielectrode array (MEA) recording system to evaluate neural network activity of primary mouse cortical neuron cultures. We demonstrated that chronic activation of Gp1 mGluRs leads to elevation of spontaneous spike frequency while burst activity and cross-electrode synchronization are maintained at the baseline. We further showed that these neural network properties are achieved through proteasomal degradation of Akt that is dependent on the tumor suppressor p53. Genetically knocking down p53 disrupts the elevation of spontaneous spike frequency and alters the burst activity and cross-electrode synchronization following chronic activation of Gp1 mGluRs. Importantly, these deficits can be restored by pharmacologically inhibiting Akt to mimic inactivation of Akt mediated by p53. Together, our findings reveal the effects of chronic activation of Gp1 mGluRs on neural network activity and identify a unique signaling pathway involving p53 and Akt for these effects. Our data can provide insights into constitutively active Gp1 mGluR signaling observed in many neurological and psychiatric disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Group 1 metabotropic glutamate receptors are critical effectors of neuroplasticity and essential for neurodevelopment and cognition. Constitutively active Gp1 mGluR signaling has been observed in many pathological conditions but the effects of chronic activation of Gp1 mGluRs on neuroplasticity are largely unknown. Our study provides evidence to demonstrate that chronic activation of Gp1 mGluRs refines the neural network properties through p53-dependent inactivation of Akt. These findings uncover an unconventional signaling pathway underlying Gp1 mGluR-dependent neuroplasticity and suggest distinct effects following acute versus chronic activation of Gp1 mGluRs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In order to find effective treatments for Alzheimer's disease (AD), we need
to identify subjects at risk of AD as early as possible. To this end, recently
developed disease progression models can be used to perform early diagnosis, as
well as predict the subjects' disease stages and future evolution. However,
these models have not yet been applied to rare neurodegenerative diseases, are
not suitable to understand the complex dynamics of biomarkers, work only on
large multimodal datasets, and their predictive performance has not been
objectively validated. In this work I developed novel models of disease
progression and applied them to estimate the progression of Alzheimer's disease
and Posterior Cortical atrophy, a rare neurodegenerative syndrome causing
visual deficits. My first contribution is a study on the progression of
Posterior Cortical Atrophy, using models already developed: the Event-based
Model (EBM) and the Differential Equation Model (DEM). My second contribution
is the development of DIVE, a novel spatio-temporal model of disease
progression that estimates fine-grained spatial patterns of pathology,
potentially enabling us to understand complex disease mechanisms relating to
pathology propagation along brain networks. My third contribution is the
development of Disease Knowledge Transfer (DKT), a novel disease progression
model that estimates the multimodal progression of rare neurodegenerative
diseases from limited, unimodal datasets, by transferring information from
larger, multimodal datasets of typical neurodegenerative diseases. My fourth
contribution is the development of novel extensions for the EBM and the DEM,
and the development of novel measures for performance evaluation of such
models. My last contribution is the organization of the TADPOLE challenge, a
competition which aims to identify algorithms and features that best predict
the evolution of AD.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Functional networks provide a topological description of activity patterns in
the brain, as they stem from the propagation of activity on the anatomical, or
structural network of synaptic connections, which possess a hierarchical
organization. While it is assumed that structural networks shape their
functional counterparts, it is also hypothesized that alterations of brain
activity may come with transformations of functional connectivity, and possibly
its deviation from the hierarchical topology. In this computational study, we
introduce a novel methodology to monitor the persistence and breakdown of
hierarchical order in functional networks, generated from simulations of
activity spreading on both synthetic and real structural connectomes. We show
that hierarchical connectivity is persistent in the quasi-critical regime
associated with optimal processing capabilities and normal brain function
(Griffiths phase) and breaks down in states deviating from this regime, often
associated with pathological conditions. Our results offer important clues for
the study of optimal neurocomputing architectures and processes, which are
capable of tuning patterns of activity and information flow, and show how the
hierarchical topology and its quasi-critical functional counterpart provide an
effective balance between local specialized processing and global integration.

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2020.00037</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Many neurodegenerative conditions are characterized by the deposition of protein aggregates (mainly amyloid-like) in the central nervous system (CNS). In post-mitotic CNS cells protein aggregation causes cytotoxicity by interfering with various cellular functions. Mutations in different genes may directly cause protein aggregation. However, genetic factors together with aging may contribute to the onset of protein aggregation also by affecting cellular degradative functions, in particular the autophagy-lysosomal pathway (ALP). Increasing body of evidence show that ALP dysfunction and protein aggregation are functionally interconnected and induce each other during neurodegenerative processes. We will summarize the findings supporting these concepts by focusing on lysosomal storage diseases (LSDs), a class of metabolic inherited conditions characterized by global lysosomal dysfunction and often associated to a severe neurodegenerative course. We propose a model by which the inherited lysosomal defects initiate aggregate-prone protein deposition, which, in turns, worsen ALP degradation function, thus generating a vicious cycle, which boost neurodegenerative cascades.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00169</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Sleep deprivation (SD) induces hippocampal damage. Hydrogen sulfide (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S) is a neuronal protective factor. Silence information regulating factor 1 (Sirt1) plays an important role in neuroprotection. Therefore, this study was aimed at exploring whether H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S meliorates SD-induced hippocampal damage and whether Sirt1 mediates this protective role of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S. We found that sodium hydrosulfide (NaHS, a donor of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S) alleviated SD-generated hippocampal oxidative stress, including increases in the activation of SOD and the level of GSH as well as a decrease in the level of MDA. Meanwhile, we found that NaHS reduced SD-exerted hippocampal endoplasmic reticulum (ER) Stress, including downregulations of GRP78, CHOP, and cleaved-caspase-12 expression. Moreover, NaHS reduced the apoptosis in the SD-exposed hippocampus, and this included decreases in the number of apoptotic cells and the activation of caspase-3, downregulation of Bax expression, and upregulation of Bcl-2 expression. NaHS upregulated the expression of Sirt1 in the hippocampus of SD-exposed rats. Furthermore, Sirtinol, the inhibitor of Sirt1, abrogated the protection of NaHS against SD-exerted hippocampal oxidative stress, ER stress, and apoptosis. These results suggested that H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S alleviates SD-induced hippocampal damage by upregulation of hippocampal Sirt1.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Structural and functional brain alterations have been always observed in end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients undergoing hemodialysis. The present study aimed to investigate the gray matter volume (GMV) changes in hemodialysis patients compared with those noted in healthy subjects, as well as explore the associated functional connectivity alterations based on the abnormal GMV regions. The experiments revealed the effects of regional morphometry aberrance on the brain functional integrity. A total of 46 hemodialysis patients (53.11 ± 1.58 years, 28 males) and 47 healthy subjects (55.57 ± 0.86 years, 22 males) were enrolled in the present study. All subjects underwent high-resolution T1-weighted imaging, resting-state functional MR imaging, and laboratory examinations were performed in hemodialysis patients. The GMV deficits were analyzed using voxel-based morphometry (VBM) and regions with GMV alteration were defined as seeds for functional connectivity analysis. Correlation analyses between significantly different regions and the results of the blood examination were further performed. We found that bilateral thalamus exhibited significantly increased volumes in the hemodialysis patients compared with those of the healthy subjects. However, the bilateral rectus, bilateral caudate, and bilateral temporal gyrus demonstrated significantly decreased volumes. When the regions with GMV alterations were defined as seeds, the hemodialysis patients exhibited decreased integrations in the thalamo-cortical network and within the basal-ganglia connection. The present study revealed the presence of different types of structural and functional brain impairments in hemodialysis patients.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The processing of self-referential information can be influenced by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). The present randomized controlled study investigated whether similar effects can be elicited through the application of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) regarding the “self-serving bias” (SSB) and the “mnemic neglect effect” (MNE). Seventy-five healthy males (M&lt;sub&gt;age&lt;/sub&gt; = 25; SD = 4.3) were investigated in a between-groups design with random assignment by applying anodal, cathodal, or sham tDCS to the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). After stimulation, the participants judged if 80 personality traits (40 positive, 40 negative) were self-descriptive or not. Finally, the participants had to recall the previously presented adjectives. All three stimulation groups showed the expected SSB and MNE. Still, and contrary to our hypotheses, tDCS revealed neither a significant interaction effect between groups and valence concerning the number of chosen self-referential traits (F&lt;sub&gt;(2,72)&lt;/sub&gt; = 1.36, p = 0.26, ηG2 = 0.02) nor an interaction effect between groups, valence, and self-reference concerning the percentage of recalled words (F&lt;sub&gt;(2,71)&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.69, p = 0.50, ηG2 = 0.01). However, a post hoc inspection of effect sizes revealed that less negative traits were indicated as self-referential in the anodal compared to the cathodal group (ES: −0.59; CI: −1.16 to −0.03). Moreover, the participants showed—regardless of self-reference and type of stimulation—a better recall with tDCS in comparison to sham stimulation. Our results indicate that tDCS of the mPFC in healthy young men has no influence on the SSB and the MNE. However, tDCS seems to improve memory performance.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Autonomic Nervous System and Cognitive Impairment in Older Patients: Evidence From Long-Term Heart Rate Variability in Real-Life Setting</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00040</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Background: In geriatric age, cognitive impairment and cardiovascular disorders are frequent comorbidities. Age-related anatomical and functional cardiac changes, including the autonomic system, could interfere with the control of different cognitive domains. Therefore, we assess the relationship between long-term heart rate variability (HRV), as a measure of autonomic nervous system (ANS) functioning, and cognitive performance in elderly patients representative of outpatients in a real-life setting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Of 155 elderly outpatients (aged &amp;gt;65 years) screened, 117 enrolled patients underwent anthropometric evaluation, cardiac assessment by 12-lead electrocardiogram, 24-h ECG recording, and blood pressure (BP) measurement, as well as global cognitive evaluation by a standardized multidimensional assessment, including the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Montreal Cognitive Assessment test (MoCA). HRV analysis was performed on 24-h ECG recordings focusing on time-domain indices [Standard deviation of the NN intervals (SDNN), standard deviations of 5-min mean values of the NN intervals for each 5-min interval (SDANN), and root mean squares of successive differences of the NN intervals (RMSSD)] and on frequency-domain measurements [heart rate (HR), low frequency (LF), high frequency (HF), and LF/HF]. Multivariate linear analysis was used to explore the influence of the HRV significant variables on MMSE and MoCA test values.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: The MMSE and MoCA scores were both significantly and positively correlated with the sympathetic system parameters (SDNN, SDANN, LF, and LF/HF ratio), but not with the parasympathetic system parameters (RMSSD and HF). Multivariate analysis confirms this relationship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: Our results show that, in a representative real-life community elderly population, an increased sympathetic activity, but not decreased vagal activity, is associated with better cognitive performances. These results support the sympathetic autonomic function, in that the relationship between better cognitive performances and a moderate prevalence of autonomic function appears dependent on long-term changes in heart rate, mediated by sympathetic activation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Spirochete bacteria, including important pathogens, exhibit a distinctive means of swimming via undulations of the entire cell. Motility is powered by the rotation of supercoiled 'endoflagella' that wrap around the cell body, confined within the periplasmic space. To investigate the structural basis of flagellar supercoiling, which is critical for motility, we determined the structure of native flagellar filaments from the spirochete &lt;i&gt;Leptospira&lt;/i&gt; by integrating high-resolution cryo-electron tomography and X-ray crystallography. We show that these filaments are coated by a highly asymmetric, multi-component sheath layer, contrasting with flagellin-only homopolymers previously observed in exoflagellated bacteria. Distinct sheath proteins localize to the filament inner and outer curvatures to define the supercoiling geometry, explaining a key functional attribute of this spirochete flagellum.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Open research data provides considerable scientific, societal, and economic benefits. However, disclosure risks can sometimes limit the sharing of open data, especially in datasets that include sensitive details or information from individuals with rare disorders. This article introduces the concept of synthetic datasets, which is an emerging method originally developed to permit the sharing of confidential census data. Synthetic datasets mimic real datasets by preserving their statistical properties and the relationships between variables. Importantly, this method also reduces disclosure risk to essentially nil as no record in the synthetic dataset represents a real individual. This practical guide with accompanying R script enables biobehavioural researchers to create synthetic datasets and assess their utility via the &lt;i&gt;synthpop&lt;/i&gt; R package. By sharing synthetic datasets that mimic original datasets that could not otherwise be made open, researchers can ensure the reproducibility of their results and facilitate data exploration while maintaining participant privacy.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/52981</link>
	<content:encoded>Methylated cytosine is an effector of epigenetic gene regulation. In the brain, Dnmt3a is the sole ‘writer’ of atypical non-CpG methylation (mCH), and MeCP2 is the only known ‘reader’ for mCH. We asked if MeCP2 is the sole reader for Dnmt3a dependent methylation by comparing mice lacking either protein in GABAergic inhibitory neurons. Loss of either protein causes overlapping and distinct features from the behavioral to molecular level. Loss of Dnmt3a causes global loss of mCH and a subset of mCG sites resulting in more widespread transcriptional alterations and severe neurological dysfunction than MeCP2 loss. These data suggest that MeCP2 is responsible for reading only part of the Dnmt3a dependent methylation in the brain. Importantly, the impact of MeCP2 on genes differentially expressed in both models shows a strong dependence on mCH, but not Dnmt3a dependent mCG, consistent with mCH playing a central role in the pathogenesis of Rett Syndrome.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Cortico-basal ganglia interactions continuously shape the way we move. Ideas about how this circuit works are based largely on models that consider only firing rate as the mechanism of information transfer. A distinct feature of neural activity accompanying movement, however, is increased motor cortical and basal ganglia gamma synchrony. To investigate the relationship between neuronal firing in the basal ganglia and cortical gamma activity during movement, we analysed human ECoG and subthalamic nucleus (STN) unit activity during hand gripping. We found that fast reaction times were preceded by enhanced STN spike-to-cortical gamma phase coupling, indicating a role in motor preparation. Importantly, increased gamma phase coupling occurred independent of changes in mean STN firing rates, and the relative timing of STN spikes was offset by half a gamma cycle for ipsilateral vs. contralateral movements, indicating that relative spike timing is as relevant as firing rate for understanding cortico-basal ganglia information transfer.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>The considerable power needed for large whales to leap out of the water may represent the single most expensive burst maneuver found in nature. However, the mechanics and energetic costs associated with the breaching behaviors of large whales remain poorly understood. In this study we deployed whale-borne tags to measure the kinematics of breaching to test the hypothesis that these spectacular aerial displays are metabolically expensive. We found that breaching whales use variable underwater trajectories, and that high-emergence breaches are faster and require more energy than predatory lunges. The most expensive breaches approach the upper limits of vertebrate muscle performance, and the energetic cost of breaching is high enough that repeated breaching events may serve as honest signaling of body condition. Furthermore, the confluence of muscle contractile properties, hydrodynamics, and the high speeds required likely impose an upper limit to the body size and effectiveness of breaching whales.</content:encoded>

Here we examined the late mitotic stages NPCs &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; and mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; from &lt;i&gt;Pafah1b1&lt;/i&gt;-deficient mutants. &lt;i&gt;Pafah1b1&lt;/i&gt;-deficient neocortical NPCs and MEFs similarly exhibited cleavage plane displacement with mislocalization of furrow-associated markers, associated with actomyosin dysfunction and cell membrane hyper-contractility. Thus, it suggests LIS1 acts as a key molecular link connecting MTs/dynein and actomyosin, ensuring that cell membrane contractility is tightly controlled to execute proper daughter cell separation.</content:encoded>

Most modeling in systems neuroscience has been &lt;i&gt;descriptive&lt;/i&gt; where neural representations such as ‘receptive fields’, have been found by statistically correlating neural activity to sensory input. In the traditional physics approach to modelling, hypotheses are represented by &lt;i&gt;mechanistic&lt;/i&gt; models based on the underlying building blocks of the system, and candidate models are validated by comparing with experiments. Until now validation of mechanistic cortical network models has been based on comparison with neuronal spikes, found from the high-frequency part of extracellular electrical potentials. In this computational study we investigated to what extent the low-frequency part of the signal, the local field potential (LFP), can be used to validate and infer properties of mechanistic cortical network models. In particular, we asked the question whether the LFP can be used to accurately estimate synaptic connection weights in the underlying network. We considered the thoroughly analysed Brunel network comprising an excitatory and an inhibitory population of recurrently connected integrate-and-fire (LIF) neurons. This model exhibits a high diversity of spiking network dynamics depending on the values of only three network parameters. The LFP generated by the network was computed using a hybrid scheme where spikes computed from the point-neuron network were replayed on biophysically detailed multicompartmental neurons. We assessed how accurately the three model parameters could be estimated from power spectra of stationary ‘background’ LFP signals by application of convolutional neural nets (CNNs). All network parameters could be very accurately estimated, suggesting that LFPs indeed can be used for network model validation.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/en3vGG03NXk&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a fundamental cellular process and plays an essential role in development, tissue regeneration, and cancer metastasis. Interestingly, EMT is not a binary process but instead proceeds with multiple partial intermediate states. However, the functions of these intermediate states are not fully understood. Here, we focus on a general question about how the number of partial EMT states affects cell transformation. First, by fitting a hidden Markov model of EMT with experimental data, we propose a statistical mechanism for EMT in which many unobservable microstates may exist within one of the observable macrostates. Furthermore, we find that increasing the number of intermediate states can accelerate the EMT process and that adding parallel paths or transition layers may accelerate the process even further. Last, a stabilized intermediate state traps cells in one partial EMT state. This work advances our understanding of the dynamics and functions of EMT plasticity during cancer metastasis.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/pZ-QQG0UAtA&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

The Hybrid Automata Library (HAL) is a Java Library developed for use in mathematical oncology modeling. It is made of simple, efficient, generic components that can be used to model complex spatial systems. HAL’s components can broadly be classified into: on- and off-lattice agent containers, finite difference diffusion fields, a GUI building system, and additional tools and utilities for computation and data collection. These components are designed to operate independently and are standardized to make them easy to interface with one another. As a demonstration of how modeling can be simplified using our approach, we have included a complete example of a hybrid model (a spatial model with interacting agent-based and PDE components). HAL is a useful asset for researchers who wish to build performant 1D, 2D and 3D hybrid models in Java, while not starting entirely from scratch. It is available on GitHub at https://github.com/MathOnco/HAL under the MIT License. HAL requires the Java JDK version 1.8 or later to compile and run the source code.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/U835N0G1po4&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Carrier of Wingless (Cow) Regulation of Drosophila Neuromuscular Junction Development</title>
	<link>http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/7/2/ENEURO.0285-19.2020?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;The first Wnt signaling ligand discovered, &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; Wingless [Wg (Wnt1 in mammals)], plays critical roles in neuromuscular junction (NMJ) development, regulating synaptic architecture, and function. Heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs), consisting of a core protein with heparan sulfate (HS) glycosaminoglycan (GAG) chains, bind to Wg ligands to control both extracellular distribution and intercellular signaling function. &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; HSPGs previously shown to regulate Wg trans-synaptic signaling at the NMJ include the glypican Dally-like protein (Dlp) and perlecan Terribly Reduced Optic Lobes (Trol). Here, we investigate synaptogenic functions of the most recently described &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; HSPG, secreted Carrier of Wingless (Cow), which directly binds Wg in the extracellular space. At the glutamatergic NMJ, we find that Cow secreted from the presynaptic motor neuron acts to limit synaptic architecture and neurotransmission strength. In c&lt;i&gt;ow&lt;/i&gt; null mutants, we find increased synaptic bouton number and elevated excitatory current amplitudes, phenocopying presynaptic Wg overexpression. We show &lt;i&gt;cow&lt;/i&gt; null mutants exhibit an increased number of glutamatergic synapses and increased synaptic vesicle fusion frequency based both on GCaMP imaging and electrophysiology recording. We find that membrane-tethered Wg prevents &lt;i&gt;cow&lt;/i&gt; null defects in NMJ development, indicating that Cow mediates secreted Wg signaling. It was shown previously that the secreted Wg deacylase Notum restricts Wg signaling at the NMJ, and we show here that Cow and Notum work through the same pathway to limit synaptic development. We conclude Cow acts cooperatively with Notum to coordinate neuromuscular synapse structural and functional differentiation via negative regulation of Wg trans-synaptic signaling within the extracellular synaptomatrix.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: More than a Corepressor: The Role of CoREST Proteins in Neurodevelopment</title>
	<link>http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/7/2/ENEURO.0337-19.2020?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;The molecular mechanisms governing normal neurodevelopment are tightly regulated by the action of transcription factors. Repressor element 1 (RE1) silencing transcription factor (REST) is widely documented as a regulator of neurogenesis that acts by recruiting corepressor proteins and repressing neuronal gene expression in non-neuronal cells. The REST corepressor 1 (CoREST1), CoREST2, and CoREST3 are best described for their role as part of the REST complex. However, recent evidence has shown the proteins have the ability to repress expression of distinct target genes in a REST-independent manner. These findings indicate that each CoREST paralogue may have distinct and critical roles in regulating neurodevelopment and are more than simply &quot;REST corepressors,&quot; whereby they act as independent repressors orchestrating biological processes during neurodevelopment.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>RSS PAP: Inter-individual differences in occipital alpha oscillations correlate with white matter tissue properties of the optic radiation</title>
	<link>http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0224-19.2020v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Neural oscillations at approximately 10 Hz, called alpha oscillations, are one of the most prominent components of neural oscillations in the human brain. In recent years, characteristics (power/frequency/phase) of occipital alpha oscillations have been correlated with various perceptual phenomena. However, the relationship between inter-individual differences in alpha oscillatory characteristics and the properties of the underlying brain structures, such as white matter pathways, is unclear. A possibility is that intrinsic occipital alpha oscillations are mediated by thalamocortical interaction; we hypothesized that the most promising candidate for characterizing the intrinsic alpha oscillation is optic radiation (OR), which is the geniculo-cortical pathway carrying signals between the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) and primary visual cortex (V1). We used resting-state magnetoencephalography (MEG) and diffusion-weighted/quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI/qMRI) to correlate the frequency and power of occipital alpha oscillations with the tissue properties of the OR by focusing on the different characteristics across individuals. We found that alpha frequency negatively correlated with intra-cellular volume fraction, reflecting diffusion properties in intracellular (axonal) space, whereas alpha power was not correlated with any tissue properties measurements. No significant correlation was found between OR and beta frequency/amplitude or between other white matter tract connecting parietal and inferotemporal cortex and alpha frequency/amplitude. These results support the hypothesis that an interaction between thalamic nuclei and early visual areas is essential for determining the occipital alpha oscillatory rhythm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Alpha oscillations, the most salient neural oscillations in the human brain, are known to be involved in various types of perception. The frequency of occipital alpha oscillations varies across participants, but the underlying structures regulating this variability remain unknown. We combined MEG measurements with diffusion and quantitative MRI measurements and found that frequency properties of intrinsic occipital alpha oscillations correlated with a tissue property of the optic radiation (OR), a white matter tract connecting the lateral geniculate nucleus and primary visual cortex. This result supports the idea that thalamocortical interactions mediate the properties of intrinsic occipital alpha oscillations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.04000</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Theta-nested gamma oscillations have been reported in many areas of the brain
and are believed to represent a fundamental mechanism to transfer information
across spatial and temporal scales. In a series of recent experiments in vitro
it has been possible to replicate with an optogenetic theta frequency
stimulation several features of cross-frequency coupling among theta and gamma
rhythms observed in behaving animals. In order to reproduce the main findings
of these experiments we have considered a new class of neural mass models able
to reproduce exactly the macroscopic dynamics of spiking neural networks. In
this framework, we have examined two set-ups able to support collective gamma
oscillations: the pyramidal interneuronal network gamma (PING) and the
interneuronal network gamma (ING). In both set-ups we observe the emergence of
theta-nested gamma oscillations by driving the system with a sinusoidal
theta-forcing in proximity of a Hopf bifurcation. These mixed rhythms display
always phase amplitude coupling. However 2 different types of nested
oscillations can be identified: one characterized by a perfect phase locking
between theta and gamma rhythms, corresponding to an overall periodic
behaviour; another one where the locking is imperfect and the dynamics is
quasi-periodic or even chaotic. From our analysis it emerges that the locked
states are more frequent in the ING set-up. In agreement with the experiments,
we find theta-nested gamma oscillations for forcing frequencies in the range
[1:10] Hz, whose amplitudes grow proportionally to the forcing one and which
are clearly modulated by the theta phase. At variance with experimental
findings, the gamma-power peak does not shift to higher frequencies by
increasing the theta frequency. This effect can be obtained, in or model, only
by incrementing, at the same time, also the noise or the forcing amplitude.

We derive our method based upon an (approximate) analysis of the dynamics of

that the use of spike timing alone out-competes existing biologically plausible
methods for synaptic weight inference in spiking neural network models.
Furthermore, our proposed method is also more flexible, being applicable to any
spiking neuron model, is conservative in how many parameters are required for
implementation and can be deployed in an online-fashion with minimal
computational overhead. These features, together with its biological
plausibility, make it an attractive candidate technique for weight inference at
single synapses.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Exact Inference of Linear Dependence Between Multiple Autocorrelated Time Series. (arXiv:2003.03887v2 [stat.ME] UPDATED)</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.03887</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The ability to quantify complex relationships within multivariate time series
is a key component of modelling many physical systems, from the climate to
brains and other biophysical phenomena. Unfortunately, even testing the
significance of simple dependence measures, such as Pearson correlation, is
complicated by altered sampling properties when autocorrelation is present in
the individual time series. Moreover, it has been recently established that
commonly used multivariate dependence measures---such as Granger
causality---can produce substantially inaccurate results when applying
classical hypothesis-testing procedures to digitally-filtered time series.
Here, we suggest that the digital filtering-induced bias in Granger causality
is an effect of autocorrelation, and we present a principled statistical
framework for the hypothesis testing of a large family of linear-dependence
measures between multiple autocorrelated time series. Our approach unifies the
theoretical foundations established by Bartlett and others on variance
estimators for autocorrelated signals with the more intricate multivariate
measures of linear dependence. Specifically, we derive the sampling
distributions and subsequent hypothesis tests for any measure that can be
decomposed into terms that involve independent partial correlations, which we
show includes Granger causality and mutual information under a multivariate
linear-Gaussian model. In doing so, we provide the first exact tests for
inferring linear dependence between vector autoregressive processes with
limited data. Using numerical simulations and brain-imaging datasets, we
demonstrate that our newly developed tests maintain the expected false-positive
rate (FPR) with minimally-sufficient samples, while the classical
log-likelihood ratio tests can yield an unbounded FPR depending on the
parameters chosen.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.03829</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Krabbe disease (KD) is a rare demyelinating sphingolipidosis, often fatal in
the first years of life. It is caused by the inactivation of the
galactocerebrosidase (GALC) enzyme that causes an increase in the cellular
levels of psychosine considered to be at the origin of the tissue-level
effects. GALC is inactivated also in the Twitcher (TWI) mouse: a genetic model
of KD that is providing important insights into the understating of the
pathogenetic process and the development of possible treatments. In this
article an innovative optical technique, RP-CARS, is proposed as a tool to
study the degree of order of the CH2 bonds inside the myelin sheaths of
TWI-mice sciatic-nerve fibres. RP-CARS, a recently developed variation of CARS
microscopy, is able to combine the intrinsic chemical selectivity of CARS
microscopy with molecular-bond-spatial-orientation sensibility. This is the
first time RP-CARS is applied to the study of a genetic model of a pathology,
leading to the demonstration of a post-onset progressive spatial
disorganization of the myelin CH2 bonds. The presented result could be of great
interest for a deeper understanding of the pathogenic mechanisms underlying the
human KD and, moreover, it is an additional proof of the experimental validity
of this microscopy technique.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.03626</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Objective: This paper aims to demonstrate functional discriminability among
restored hand sensations with different locations, qualities, and intensities
that are evoked by microelectrode stimulation of residual afferent fibers in
human amputees. Methods: We implanted a Utah Slanted Electrode Array (USEA) in
the median and ulnar residual arm nerves of three transradial amputees and
delivered stimulation via different electrodes and at different frequencies to
produce various locations, qualities, and intensities of sensation on the
missing hand. Blind discrimination trials were performed to determine how well
subjects could discriminate among these restored sensations. Results: Subjects
discriminated among restored sensory percepts with varying cutaneous and
proprioceptive locations, qualities, and intensities in blind trials, including
discrimination among up to 10 different location-intensity combinations (15/30
successes, p &amp;lt; 0.0005). Variations in the site of stimulation within the nerve,
via electrode selection, enabled discrimination among up to 5 locations and
qualities (35/35 successes, p &amp;lt; 0.0001). Variations in the stimulation
frequency enabled discrimination among 4 different intensities at the same
location (13/20 successes, p &amp;lt; 0.005). One subject discriminated among
simultaneous, alternating, and isolated stimulation of two different USEA
electrodes, as may be desired during multi-sensor closed-loop prosthesis use
(20/25 successes, p &amp;lt; 0.001). Conclusion: USEA stimulation enables encoding of
a diversity of functionally discriminable sensations with different locations,
qualities, and intensities. Significance: These percepts provide a potentially
rich source of sensory feedback that may enhance performance and embodiment
during multi-sensor, closed-loop prosthesis use.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1910.01618</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;To understand how rich dynamics emerge in neural populations, we require
models exhibiting a wide range of activity patterns while remaining
interpretable in terms of connectivity and single-neuron dynamics. However, it
has been challenging to fit such mechanistic spiking networks at the single
neuron scale to empirical population data. To close this gap, we propose to fit
such data at a meso scale, using a mechanistic but low-dimensional and hence
statistically tractable model. The mesoscopic representation is obtained by
approximating a population of neurons as multiple homogeneous `pools' of
neurons, and modelling the dynamics of the aggregate population activity within
each pool. We derive the likelihood of both single-neuron and connectivity
parameters given this activity, which can then be used to either optimize
parameters by gradient ascent on the log-likelihood, or to perform Bayesian
inference using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling. We illustrate this
approach using a model of generalized integrate-and-fire neurons for which
mesoscopic dynamics have been previously derived, and show that both
single-neuron and connectivity parameters can be recovered from simulated data.
In particular, our inference method extracts posterior correlations between
model parameters, which define parameter subsets able to reproduce the data. We
compute the Bayesian posterior for combinations of parameters using MCMC
sampling and investigate how the approximations inherent to a mesoscopic

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Time irreversibility and its application in epileptic brain electrical activities. (arXiv:1901.00258v2 [q-bio.NC] UPDATED)</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1901.00258</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Time irreversibility (temporal asymmetry) is one of fundamental properties
that characterize the nonlinearity of complex dynamical processes, and our
brain is a typical complex dynamical system manifested with nonlinearity. Two
subtraction-based parameters, Ys and X2, are employed to measure the
probabilistic differences of permutations instead of raw vectors for the
simplified quantification of time irreversibility, which is validated by
chaotic and reversible processes and the surrogate data. We show that it is
equivalent to quantify time irreversibility by measuring probabilistic
difference between the forward and its backward processes and between the
symmetric permutations. And we detect time irreversibility of two groups of
epileptic EEGs, from the Nanjing General Hospital (NJGH) and from the public
Bonn epileptic database. In our contribution, NJGH epileptic EEGs during
seizure-free intervals of have lower time irreversibility than the control data
while those of the Bonn data sets have higher nonlinearity than the healthy
brain electrical activities. For the inconsistent results, we conduct
multi-scale analysis and elucidate from the circadian rhythms in epileptic
nonlinearity, however, more targeted researches are needed to verify our
assumptions or to determine if there are other reasons leading to the
inconsistency.

	<title>Frontiers in Synaptic Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Modeling the Shape of Synaptic Spines by Their Actin Dynamics</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsyn.2020.00009</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Dendritic spines are the morphological basis of excitatory synapses in the cortex and their size and shape correlates with functional synaptic properties. Recent experiments show that spines exhibit large shape fluctuations that are not related to activity-dependent plasticity but nonetheless might influence memory storage at their synapses. To investigate the determinants of such spontaneous fluctuations, we propose a mathematical model for the dynamics of the spine shape and analyze it in 2D—related to experimental microscopic imagery—and in 3D. We show that the spine shape is governed by a local imbalance between membrane tension and the expansive force from actin bundles that originates from discrete actin polymerization foci. Experiments have shown that only few such polymerization foci co-exist at any time in a spine, each having limited life time. The model shows that the momentarily existing set of such foci pushes the membrane along certain directions until foci are replaced and other directions may now be affected. We explore these relations in depth and use our model to predict shape and temporal characteristics of spines from the different biophysical parameters involved in actin polymerization. Approximating the model by a single recursive equation we finally demonstrate that the temporal evolution of the number of active foci is sufficient to predict the size of the model-spines. Thus, our model provides the first platform to study the relation between molecular and morphological properties of the spine with a high degree of biophysical detail.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: A Meta-Analysis of Neuron-Specific Enolase Levels in Cerebrospinal Fluid and Serum in Children With Epilepsy</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2020.00024</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Background: Studies suggest that neuron-specific enolase (NSE) levels in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and serum play an important role in childhood epilepsy. However, these investigations remain controversial due to inconsistent clinical results. The present study aimed to quantitatively summarize and assess whether CSF and serum NSE levels are associated with epilepsy in children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods : A systematic search of the Harvard Hollis+, Clinicaltrials, Open Gray, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, and Wanfang databases was performed. Studies investigating NSE and epilepsy were identified and retrieved. Original studies with data overlapping those from other investigations and those lacking the necessary data were excluded. The included studies were extracted and synthesized, and data were analyzed using a random-effects model in R Studio and Comprehensive Meta-Analysis version 3 (Biostat, Englewood, NJ, USA).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Random-effects meta-analysis of 26 studies, including 1,360 patients, and 1,256 healthy control, revealed that childhood epilepsy exhibited meaningfully increased CSF and serum levels of NSE compared with controls [Hedges' g = 1.962 (95% confidence interval, 1.413–2.512); P &amp;lt; 0.001]. No single study meaningfully influenced the overall association between CSF and serum levels of NSE and epilepsy after sensitivity analysis. Subgroup analyses according to sample source and assay type revealed a significant association between NSE levels and epilepsy. Stratified analysis confirmed that NSE levels were significantly correlated with the severity of neurological compromise. Metaregression analyses revealed that sample size, mean age, and sex may contribute to effect-size reductions; however, sample source, assay type, and country did not moderate effect size. Funnel plots constructed using the trim-and-fill method confirmed that the outcome of the meta-analysis could not be due to publication bias.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: The results demonstrated that childhood epilepsy exhibits significantly elevated levels of NSE in the CSF and serum, thus strengthening the association between increased NSE levels and epilepsy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2020.00021</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a widely distributed neurodegenerative disease characterized clinically by cognitive deficits and pathologically by formation of amyloid-β (Aβ) plaque and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) in the brain. Vanadium is a biological trace element that has a function to mimic insulin for diabetes. Bis(ethylmaltolato) oxidovanadium (IV) (BEOV) has been reported to have a hypoglycemic property, but its effect on AD remains unclear. In this study, BEOV was supplemented at doses of 0.2 and 1.0 mmol/L to the AD model mice APPSwe/PS1dE9 for 3 months. The results showed that BEOV substantially ameliorated glucose metabolic disorder as well as synaptic and behavioral deficits of the AD mice. Further investigation revealed that BEOV significantly reduced Aβ generation by increasing the expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma and insulin-degrading enzyme and by decreasing β-secretase 1 in the hippocampus and cortex of AD mice. BEOV also reduced tau hyperphosphorylation by inhibiting protein tyrosine phosphatase-1B and regulating the pathway of insulin receptor/insulin receptor substrate-1/protein kinase B/glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta. Furthermore, BEOV could enhance autophagolysosomal fusion and restore autophagic flux to increase the clearance of Aβ deposits and phosphorylated tau in the brains of AD mice. Collectively, the present study provides solid data for revealing the function and mechanism of BEOV on AD pathology.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnint.2020.00011</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Many studies in neuroscience use head-fixed behavioral preparations, which confer a number of advantages, including the ability to limit the behavioral repertoire and use techniques for large-scale monitoring of neural activity. But traditional studies using this approach use extremely limited behavioral measures, in part because it is difficult to detect the subtle movements and postural adjustments that animals naturally exhibit during head fixation. Here we report a new head-fixed setup with analog load cells capable of precisely monitoring the continuous forces exerted by mice. The load cells reveal the dynamic nature of movements generated not only around the time of task-relevant events, such as presentation of stimuli and rewards, but also during periods in between these events, when there is no apparent overt behavior. It generates a new and rich set of behavioral measures that have been neglected in previous experiments. We detail the construction of the system, which can be 3D-printed and assembled at low cost, show behavioral results collected from head-fixed mice, and demonstrate that neural activity can be highly correlated with the subtle, whole-body movements continuously produced during head restraint.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00210</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI), or concussion, is reported to interfere with cerebral blood flow and microcirculation in patients, but our current understanding is quite limited and the results are often controversial. Here we used longitudinal in vivo two-photon imaging to investigate dynamic changes in cerebral vessels and velocities of red blood cells (RBC) following mTBI. Closed-head mTBI induced using a controlled cortical impact device resulted in a significant reduction of dwell time in a Rotarod test but no significant change in water maze test. Cerebral blood vessels were repeatedly imaged through a thinned skull window at baseline, 0.5, 1, 6 h, and 1 day following mTBI. In both arterioles and capillaries, their diameters and RBC velocities were significantly decreased at 0.5, 1, and 6 h after injury, and recovered in 1 day post-mTBI. In contrast, decreases in the diameter and RBC velocity of venules occurred only in 0.5–1 h after mTBI. We also observed formation and clearance of transient microthrombi in capillaries within 1 h post-mTBI. We concluded that in vivo two-photon imaging is useful for studying earlier alteration of vascular dynamics after mTBI and that mTBI induced reduction of cerebral blood flow, vasospasm, and formation of microthrombi in the acute stage following injury. These changes may contribute to early brain functional deficits of mTBI.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00203</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The developing nervous system is a complex yet organized system of neurons, glial support cells, and extracellular matrix that arranges into an elegant, highly structured network. The extracellular and intracellular events that guide axons to their target locations have been well characterized in many regions of the developing nervous system. However, despite extensive work, we have a poor understanding of how axonal growth cones interact with surrounding glial cells to regulate network assembly. Glia-to-growth cone communication is either direct through cellular contacts or indirect through modulation of the local microenvironment via the secretion of factors or signaling molecules. Microglia, oligodendrocytes, astrocytes, Schwann cells, neural progenitor cells, and olfactory ensheathing cells have all been demonstrated to directly impact axon growth and guidance. Expanding our understanding of how different glial cell types directly interact with growing axons throughout neurodevelopment will inform basic and clinical neuroscientists. For example, identifying the key cellular players beyond the axonal growth cone itself may provide translational clues to develop therapeutic interventions to modulate neuron growth during development or regeneration following injury. This review will provide an overview of the current knowledge about glial involvement in development of the nervous system, specifically focusing on how glia directly interact with growing and maturing axons to influence neuronal connectivity. This focus will be applied to the clinically-relevant field of regeneration following spinal cord injury, highlighting how a better understanding of the roles of glia in neurodevelopment can inform strategies to improve axon regeneration after injury.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00193</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;For more than a decade, researchers have sought to uncover the biological function of the enigmatic leucine rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) enzyme, a large multi-domain protein with dual GTPase and kinase activities. Originally identified as a familial Parkinson’s disease (PD) risk gene, variations in LRRK2 are also associated with risk of idiopathic PD, inflammatory bowel disease and susceptibility to bacterial infections. LRRK2 is highly expressed in peripheral immune cells and the potential of LRRK2 to regulate immune and inflammatory pathways has emerged as common link across LRRK2-implicated diseases. This review outlines the current genetic and biochemical evidence linking LRRK2 to the regulation of innate immune inflammatory pathways, including the toll-like receptor and inflammasome pathways. Evidence suggests a complex interplay between genetic risk and protective alleles acts to modulate immune outcomes in a manner dependent on the particular pathogen and cell type invaded.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00189</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Exercise enhances cognitive function through increased neurogenesis but can also cause neurogenesis-induced forgetting. It remains unclear whether the diminished memory traces are completely forgotten. Our goals were to determine whether spatial memory is diminished by exercise, and if so, whether the memory is completely gone or whether only the local details disappear but not the acquired strategy. Two-month-old male C57BL/6J mice were trained on a spatial memory task using the Morris water maze and tested to determine that they had learned the platform location. Another mouse group received no training. Half the mice in each group then exercised on a running wheel, while the other half remained sedentary in home cages. After 4 weeks of this, previously trained mice were tested for their retention of the platform location. All mice were then subjected to the task, but the platform was located in a different position (reversal learning for previously trained mice). We found that exercise significantly facilitated the forgetting of the first platform location (i.e., diminished spatial memory) but also significantly enhanced reversal learning. Compared with mice that received no pre-exercise training, mice that had been previously trained, even those in the exercise group that had decreased recall, showed significantly better performance in the reversal learning test. Activation of new adult-born neurons was also examined. Although newborn neuron activation between groups that had or had not received prior task training was not different, activation was significantly higher in exercise groups than in sedentary groups after the probe test for reversal learning. These results indicated that the experience of pre-exercise training equally facilitated new learning in the sedentary and exercise groups, even though significantly lower memory retention was found in the exercise group, suggesting rule-based learning in mice. Furthermore, newborn neurons equally participated in similar and novel memory acquisition.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00172</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a kind of severe brain injury characterized with a high incidence rate and a high disability rate. Low-intensity transcranial ultrasound stimulation (LITUS) is a promising neuroprotective method for improving the functional prognosis of TBI. The fractional anisotropy (FA) value and mean diffusivity (MD) value can be sensitive to abnormal brain structure and function and can thus be used to evaluate the effect of LITUS on TBI. Our purpose was to evaluate the therapeutic effect of LITUS in a moderate TBI rat model with FA and MD values. For our method, we used 45 male Sprague Dawley rats (15 sham normal, 15 TBI, and 15 LITUS treatment rats). We used single-shot spin echo echo-planar imaging sequences at 3.0T to obtain the DTI parameters. Parameters of FA and MD on the treated side of the injury cortex were measured to evaluate the therapeutic effect of LITUS in a TBI rat model. For FA and MD values, groups were compared by using a two-way analysis of variance for repeated measures, and this was followed by Tukey’s post hoc test. Differences were considered significant at P &amp;lt; 0.05. The results were that the FA value in the LITUS treatment group at 1 day after TBI was significantly higher than that in the control group (adjusted P = 0.0422) and significantly lower than that in the TBI group at 14, 21, and 35 days after TBI (adjusted P = 0.0015, 0.0064, and 0.0173, respectively). At the end of the scan time point, the differences between the two groups were not significant (adjusted P = 0.3242). The MD values in the LITUS treatment group were significantly higher in the early stage than that in the TBI group (adjusted P = 0.0167) and significantly lower at the following time points than in the TBI group. In conclusion, daily treatment with LITUS for 10 min effectively improved the brain damage in the Controlled Cortical Impact (CCI)-caused TBI model. FA and MD values can serve as evaluation indicators for the neuro-protective effect of LITUS.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00171</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A variety of assessment tools are currently available to help clinicians assess Sports Related Concussion (SRC). Currently, the most widely available tools are neither objective nor portable, and are therefore not ideal for assessment at the site and time of a suspected injury. A portable system was developed to deliver a measurement of the steady-state visual-evoked potential (SSVEP). This system involved a smartphone housed in a Google Cardboard frame, which delivered a 15-Hz flicker visual stimulus while an electroencephalography (EEG) headset recorded EEG signals. Sixty-five rugby union players were tested during their regular season and were stratified into healthy, concussed, and recovered groups based on clinical examination. Their SSVEP response was quantified into a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). The SNRs of players in each study group were summarized. Additionally, the SNRs of individual players who had baseline, post-injury, and post-recovery readings were analyzed. Sixty-five participants completed a baseline evaluation to measure their SSVEP. Twelve of these participants sustained a medically diagnosed concussion and completed SSVEP re-testing within 72 h. Eight concussed players received follow-up SSVEP testing after recovery. Concussed participants had a lower SNR [2.20 (2.04–2.38)] when compared to their baseline [4.54 (3.79–5.10)]. When clinically recovered, participant SNR was not significantly different to their baseline [4.82 (4.13–5.18)]. The baseline SNRs of the players who experienced a concussion during the season were not different to those of players who did not experience a concussion [4.80 (4.07–5.68)]. This is the first study to identify differences in SSVEP responses in male amateur rugby union players with and without concussion. It is also the first SSVEP demonstration for concussion evaluation at point-of-care. SSVEPs are significantly attenuated in the presence of concussion in these male athletes. Individuals returned to their baseline SSVEP following clinical recovery from the concussive injury. The use of SSVEPs has the potential to be a supplemental aid for the assessment and management of concussion.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Brain Imaging Methods section | New and Recent Articles: Differences in Net Information Flow and Dynamic Connectivity Metrics Between Physically Active and Inactive Subjects Measured by Functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS) During a Fatiguing Handgrip Task</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00167</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Twenty-three young adults (4 Females, 25.13 ± 3.72 years) performed an intermittent maximal handgrip force task using their dominant hand for 20 min (3.5 s squeeze/6.5 s release, 120 blocks) with concurrent cortical activity imaging by functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (fNRIS; OMM-3000, Shimadzu Corp., 111 channels). Subjects were grouped as physically active (n = 10) or inactive (n = 12) based on a questionnaire (active-exercise at least four times a week, inactive- exercise less than two times a week). We explored how motor task fatigue affected the vasomotion-induced oscillations in ΔHbO as measured by fNIRS at each hemodynamic frequency band: endothelial component (0.003–0.02 Hz) associated to microvascular activity, neurogenic component (0.02–0.04 Hz) related to intrinsic neuronal activity, and myogenic component (0.04–0.15 Hz) linked to activity of smooth muscles of arterioles. To help understand how these three neurovascular regulatory mechanisms relate to handgrip task performance we quantified several dynamic fNIRS metrics, including directional phase transfer entropy (dPTE), a computationally efficient and data-driven method used as a marker of information flow between cortical regions, and directional connectivity (DC), a means to compute directionality of information flow between two cortical regions. The relationship between static functional connectivity (SFC) and functional connectivity variability (FCV) was also explored to understand their mutual dependence for each frequency band in the context of handgrip performance as fatigued increased. Our findings ultimately showed differences between subject groups across all fNIRS metrics and hemodynamic frequency bands. These findings imply that physical activity modulates neurovascular control mechanisms at the endogenic, neurogenic, and myogenic frequency bands resulting in delayed fatigue onset and enhanced performance. The dynamic cortical network metrics quantified in this work for young, healthy subjects provides baseline measurements to guide future work on older individuals and persons with impaired cardiovascular health.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00165</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Functional brain network (FBN) provides an effective biomarker for understanding brain activation patterns and a diagnostic criterion for neurodegenerative diseases detections. Unfortunately, it remains challenges to estimate the biologically meaningful or discriminative FBNs accurately, because of the poor quality of functional magnetic resonance imaging data or our limited understanding of human brain. In this study, a novel FBN estimation model based on group similarity prior was proposed. In particular, we extended the FBN estimation model to tensor form and incorporated the tensor trace-norm regularizer to formulate the group similarity constraint. To verify the proposed method, we conducted experiments on identifying mild cognitive impairments (MCIs) from normal controls (NCs) based on the estimated FBNs. Experimental results illustrated that our method is effective in modeling FBNs. Consequently, we achieved 91.97% classification accuracy, outperforming the state-of-the-art methods. The post hoc analysis further demonstrated that more biologically meaningful functional brain connections were obtained using our proposed method.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Neurodegeneration section | New and Recent Articles: The Effect of Estrogen Replacement Therapy on Alzheimer's Disease and Parkinson's Disease in Postmenopausal Women: A Meta-Analysis</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00157</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Background: Estrogen replacement therapy (ERT) is a common treatment method for menopausal syndrome; however, its therapeutic value for the treatment of neurological diseases is still unclear. Epidemiological studies were performed, and the effect of postmenopausal ERT on treating neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD), was summarized through a meta-analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Twenty-one articles were selected using a systematic searching of the contents listed on PubMed and Web of Science before June 1, 2019. Epidemiological studies were extracted, and relevant research data were obtained from the original articles based on the predefined inclusion criteria and data screening principles. The Comprehensive Meta-Analysis Version 2 software was used to pool effective size, test heterogeneity, conduct meta-regression and subgroup analysis, and to calculate publication bias.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Our results showed that ERT significantly decreased the risk of onset and/or development of AD [odds ratio (OR): 0.672; 95% CI: 0.581–0.779; P &amp;lt; 0.001] and PD (OR: 0.470; 95% CI: 0.368–0.600; P &amp;lt; 0.001) compared with the control group. A subgroup and meta-regression analysis showed that study design and measure of effect were the source of heterogeneity. Age, sample size, hormone therapy ascertainment, duration of the treatment, or route of administration did not play a significant role in affecting the outcome of the meta-analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: We presented evidence here to support the use of estrogen therapy for the treatment of AD and PD.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroinformatics | New and Recent Articles: Robust Monte-Carlo Simulations in Diffusion-MRI: Effect of the Substrate Complexity and Parameter Choice on the Reproducibility of Results</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fninf.2020.00008</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Monte-Carlo Diffusion Simulations (MCDS) have been used extensively as a ground truth tool for the validation of microstructure models for Diffusion-Weighted MRI. However, methodological pitfalls in the design of the biomimicking geometrical configurations and the simulation parameters can lead to approximation biases. Such pitfalls affect the reliability of the estimated signal, as well as its validity and reproducibility as ground truth data. In this work, we first present a set of experiments in order to study three critical pitfalls encountered in the design of MCDS in the literature, namely, the number of simulated particles and time steps, simplifications in the intra-axonal substrate representation, and the impact of the substrate's size on the signal stemming from the extra-axonal space. The results obtained show important changes in the simulated signals and the recovered microstructure features when changes in those parameters are introduced. Thereupon, driven by our findings from the first studies, we outline a general framework able to generate complex substrates. We show the framework's capability to overcome the aforementioned simplifications by generating a complex crossing substrate, which preserves the volume in the crossing area and achieves a high packing density. The results presented in this work, along with the simulator developed, pave the way toward more realistic and reproducible Monte-Carlo simulations for Diffusion-Weighted MRI.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Train Your Brain? Can We Really Selectively Train Specific EEG Frequencies With Neurofeedback Training</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00022</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Neurofeedback (NFB) is an operant conditioning procedure whereby an individual learns to self-regulate the electrical activity of his/her brain. Initially developed as a treatment intervention for pathologies with underlying EEG dysfunctions, NFB is also used as a training tool to enhance specific cognitive states required in high-performance situations. The original idea behind the NFB training effect is that the changes should only be circumscribed to the trained EEG frequencies. The EEG frequencies which are not used as feedback frequencies should be independent and not affected by the neurofeedback training. Despite the success of sensorimotor rhythm NFB training in cognitive performance enhancement, it remains unclear whether all participants can intentionally modify the power densities of specifically selected electroencephalographic (EEG) frequencies. In the present study, participants were randomly assigned to either a control heart rate variability (HRV) biofeedback (HRV) training group or a combination of HRV biofeedback and neurofeedback (HRV/NFB) training group. This randomized mixed design experiment consisted of two introductory theoretical lessons and a training period of 6 weeks. We investigated the evolution of the different EEG frequency bands of our two experimental groups across and within session. All the participants exhibited EEG changes across and within session. However, within the HRV/NFB training group, untrained EEG frequencies have been significantly modified, unlike some of the trained frequencies. Moreover, EEG activity was modified in both the HRV group and the HRV/NFB groups. Hence, the EEG changes were not only circumscribed to the trained frequency bands or to the training modality.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Hepcidin-to-Ferritin Ratio Is Decreased in Astrocytes With Extracellular Alpha-Synuclein and Iron Exposure</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00047</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Astrocytes are the most abundant glial cells in the central nervous system (CNS). As indispensable elements of the neurovascular unit, they are involved in the inflammatory response and disease-associated processes. Alpha-synuclein (α-syn) is released into the extracellular space by neurons and can be internalized by adjacent astrocytes, which activates glial cells to induce neuroinflammation. We were interested in whether astrocyte-mediated neuroinflammation is modulated by intracellular iron status and extracellular α-syn. Our results showed that recombinant α-syn (1 μg/ml and 5 μg/ml) treatment for 24 h did not affect the expression of the iron transporters divalent metal transporter 1 (DMT1) and ferroportin 1 (FPN1), nor those of iron regulatory protein (IRP) 1 or IRP2. Several proinflammatory cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin (IL)-1β, and IL-6 exhibited up-regulated mRNA levels in 5 μg/ml α-syn-treated astrocytes. TNF-α release was increased, indicating that inflammatory responses were triggered in these cells. Pretreatment with the iron-overload reagent ferric ammonium citrate (FAC, 100 μmol/L) for 24 h had no effects on mRNA levels and release of proinflammatory cytokines. Inflammatory responses triggered by α-syn were not affected by iron overload. The iron chelator desferrioxamine (DFO, 100 μmol/L) exerted suppressive effects on TNF-α mRNA levels, although no change was observed for TNF-α release. Hepcidin mRNA levels were down-regulated significantly in astrocytes co-treated with FAC and α-syn, although independent treatment with either FAC or α-syn did not alter hepcidin levels. In contrast, hepcidin mRNA levels were up-regulated in DFO and α-syn co-treated cells. As expected, ferritin protein levels were up-regulated or down-regulated with FAC or DFO treatment, respectively. Following the up-regulation of ferritin mediated by α-syn, hepcidin-to-ferritin levels were indicative of modulatory effects in α-syn-treated astrocytes with altered iron status. Therefore, we propose that the hepcidin-to-ferritin ratio is indicative of a detrimental response in primary cultured astrocytes experiencing iron and extracellular α-syn.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00045</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Aggregation of α-Synuclein, possibly caused by disturbance of proteostasis, has been identified as a common pathological feature of Parkinson’s disease (PD). However, the initiating events of aggregation have not been fully illustrated, and this knowledge may be critical to understanding the disease mechanisms of PD. Proteostasis is essential in maintaining normal cellular metabolic functions, which regulate the synthesis, folding, trafficking, and degradation of proteins. The toxicity of the aggregating proteins is dramatically influenced by its physical and physiological status. Genetic mutations may also affect the metastable phase transition of proteins. In addition, neuroinflammation, as well as lipid metabolism and its interaction with α-Synuclein, are likely to contribute to the pathogenesis of PD. In this review article, we will highlight recent progress regarding α-Synuclein proteostasis in the context of PD. We will also discuss how the phase transition status of α-Synuclein could correlate with different functional consequences in PD.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Peroxisomes exist in most cells, where they participate in lipid metabolism, as well as scavenging the reactive oxygen species (ROS) that are produced as by-products of their metabolic functions. In certain tissues such as the liver and kidneys, peroxisomes have more specific roles, such as bile acid synthesis in the liver and steroidogenesis in the adrenal glands. In the brain, peroxisomes are critically involved in creating and maintaining the lipid content of cell membranes and the myelin sheath, highlighting their importance in the central nervous system (CNS). This review summarizes the peroxisomal lifecycle, then examines the literature that establishes a link between peroxisomal dysfunction, cellular aging, and age-related disorders that affect the CNS. This review also discusses the gap of knowledge in research on peroxisomes in the CNS.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: CD8 T-cell Recruitment Into the Central Nervous System of Cuprizone-Fed Mice: Relevance to Modeling the Etiology of Multiple Sclerosis</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00043</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Cuprizone (CPZ)-feeding in mice induces atrophy of peripheral immune organs (thymus and spleen) and suppresses T-cell levels, thereby limiting its use as a model for studying the effects of the immune system in demyelinating diseases such as Multiple Sclerosis (MS). To investigate whether castration (Cx) can protect the peripheral immune organs from CPZ-induced atrophy and enable T-cell recruitment into the central nervous system (CNS) following a breach of the blood-brain barrier (BBB), three related studies were carried out. In Study 1, Cx prevented the dose-dependent reductions (0.1% &amp;lt; 0.2% CPZ) in thymic and splenic weight, size of the thymic medulla and splenic white pulp, and CD4 and CD8 (CD4/8) levels remained comparable to gonadally intact (Gi) control males. Importantly, 0.1% and 0.2% CPZ were equipotent at inducing central demyelination and glial activation. In Study 2, combining Cx with 0.1% CPZ-feeding and BBB disruption with pertussis toxin (PT) enhanced CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T-cell recruitment into the CNS. The increased CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T-cell level observed in the parenchyma of the cerebrum, cerebellum, brainstem and spinal cord were confirmed by flow cytometry and western blot analyses of CNS tissue. In Study 3, PT+0.1% CPZ-feeding to Gi female mice resulted in similar effects on the peripheral immune organs, CNS demyelination, and gliosis comparable to Gi males, indicating that testosterone levels alone were not responsible for the immune response seen in Study 2. The combination of Cx+0.1% CPZ-feeding+PT indicates that CPZ-induced demyelination can trigger an “inside-out” immune response when the peripheral immune system is spared and may provide a better model to study the initiating events in demyelinating conditions such as MS.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Development of Brain Structural Networks Over Age 8: A Preliminary Study Based on Diffusion Weighted Imaging</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00061</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Brain structural network changes provide key information about the aging process of the brain. Unfortunately, there has yet to be a detailed characterization of these structural networks across different age groups. Efforts to classify these networks have also been hampered by their reliance on technically limited traditional methods, which are unable to track multiple fiber orientations within a voxel and consequently are prone to false detection and artifacts. In this study, a newly developed Ensemble Average Propagator (EAP) based probabilistic tractography method was applied to construct a structural network, with the strength of the link between any two brain functional regions estimated according to the alignment of the EAP along connecting pathways. Age-related changes in the topological organization of human brain structural networks were thereby characterized across a broad age range (ages 8–75 years). The data from 48 healthy participants were divided into four age groups (Group 1 aged 8–15 years; Group 2 aged 25–35 years; Group 3 aged 45–55 years; and, Group 4 aged 65–75 years; N = 12 per group). We found that the brain structural network continues to strengthen during later adolescence and adulthood, through the first 20–30 years of life. Older adults, aged 65–75, had a significantly less optimized topological organization in their structural network, with decreased global efficiency and increased path lengths versus subjects in other groups. This study suggests that probabilistic tractography based on EAP provides a reliable method to construct macroscale structural connectivity networks to capture the age-associated changes of brain structures.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

More recent epidemiological studies further indicated a bidirectional association, not only in the patients themselves but also in their relatives. This association between PD and melanoma offers a unique opportunity to understand PD. Here, we summarize epidemiological, clinical, and biological evidence in regard to shared risk factors and possible underlying mechanisms for these two seemingly distinct conditions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1α and 2α Have Beneficial Effects in Remote Ischemic Preconditioning Against Stroke by Modulating Inflammatory Responses in Aged Rats</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00054</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Limb remote ischemic preconditioning (RIPC) has been proven to alleviate stroke injury in young rats, but its protective effect and its mechanism in aged rats are still unclear. Hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) is one of the important markers of stroke, and its high expression plays an important role in the pathogenesis of stroke. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that RIPC could regulate the expression of HIF, leading to reduced inflammatory responses in aged rats. Stroke was induced by transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAo) in aged rats, and RIPC was conducted in both hind limbs. The HIF-1α and HIF-2α mRNA and protein were examined by real-time RT-PCR and western blotting (WB). Inflammatory cytokines in the peripheral blood and brain were measured using AimPlex multiplex immunoassays. The protein levels of p-Akt, Akt, p-ERK, and ERK were examined by WB. We investigated that RIPC reduced the infarct size, improved neurological functions, and decreased the expression of HIF-1α and HIF-2α in the ischemic brain. RIPC reduced the levels of IL-1β, IL-6 and IFN-γ in the peripheral blood and the levels of IL-1β and IFN-γ in the ischemic brain 48 h post-stroke. Moreover, intraperitoneal injection of the HIF inhibitor, acriflavine hydrochloride (ACF), abolished the protection of RIPC with respect to infarct size and neurological functions and neutralized the downregulation of pro-inflammatory IL-1β, IL-6 and IFN-γ. ACF also reversed the activation of the Akt signaling pathway induced by RIPC following stroke. HIF may play a key role in RIPC, which was likely mediated by the Akt signaling pathway and systemic modulation of the inflammatory response in aged rats.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Modeling binary and graded cone cell fate patterning in the mouse retina</title>

Nervous systems are incredibly diverse, with myriad neuronal subtypes defined by gene expression. How binary and graded fate characteristics are patterned across tissues is poorly understood. Expression of opsin photopigments in the cone photoreceptors of the mouse retina provides an excellent model to address this question. Individual cones express S-opsin only, M-opsin, or both S-opsin and M-opsin. These cell populations are patterned along the dorsal-ventral axis, with greater M-opsin expression in the dorsal region and greater S-opsin expression in the ventral region. Thyroid hormone signaling plays a critical role in activating M-opsin and repressing S-opsin. Here, we developed an image analysis approach to identify individual cone cells and evaluate their opsin expression from immunofluorescence imaging tiles spanning roughly 6 mm along the D-V axis of the mouse retina. From analyzing the opsin expression of ~250,000 cells, we found that cones make a binary decision between S-opsin only and co-expression competent fates. Co-expression competent cells express graded levels of S- and M-opsins, depending nonlinearly on their position in the dorsal-ventral axis. M- and S-opsin expression display differential, inverse patterns. Using these single-cell data, we developed a quantitative, probabilistic model of cone cell decisions in the retinal tissue based on thyroid hormone signaling activity. The model recovers the probability distribution for cone fate patterning in the mouse retina and describes a minimal set of interactions that are necessary to reproduce the observed cell fates. Our study provides a paradigm describing how differential responses to regulatory inputs generate complex patterns of binary and graded cell fates.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/unCUJsPOQmo&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Despite medical advances, the emergence and re-emergence of infectious diseases continue to pose a public health threat. Low-dimensional epidemiological models predict that epidemic transitions are preceded by the phenomenon of critical slowing down (CSD). This has raised the possibility of anticipating disease (re-)emergence using CSD-based early-warning signals (EWS), which are statistical moments estimated from time series data. For EWS to be useful at detecting future (re-)emergence, CSD needs to be a generic (model-independent) feature of epidemiological dynamics irrespective of system complexity. Currently, it is unclear whether the predictions of CSD—derived from simple, low-dimensional systems—pertain to real systems, which are high-dimensional. To assess the generality of CSD, we carried out a simulation study of a hierarchy of models, with increasing structural complexity and dimensionality, for a measles-like infectious disease. Our five models included: i) a nonseasonal homogeneous Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered (SEIR) model, ii) a homogeneous SEIR model with seasonality in transmission, iii) an age-structured SEIR model, iv) a multiplex network-based model (Mplex) and v) an agent-based simulator (FRED). All models were parameterised to have a herd-immunity immunization threshold of around 90% coverage, and underwent a linear decrease in vaccine uptake, from 92% to 70% over 15 years. We found evidence of CSD prior to disease re-emergence in all models. We also evaluated the performance of seven EWS: the autocorrelation, coefficient of variation, index of dispersion, kurtosis, mean, skewness, variance. Performance was scored using the Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC) statistic. The best performing EWS were the mean and variance, with AUC &amp;gt; 0.75 one year before the estimated transition time. These two, along with the autocorrelation and index of dispersion, are promising candidate EWS for detecting disease emergence.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/K2jOcjR0Lvc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Systems Biology models reveal relationships between signaling inputs and observable molecular or cellular behaviors. The complexity of these models, however, often obscures key elements that regulate emergent properties. We use a Bayesian model reduction approach that combines Parallel Tempering with Lasso regularization to identify minimal subsets of reactions in a signaling network that are sufficient to reproduce experimentally observed data. The Bayesian approach finds distinct reduced models that fit data equivalently. A variant of this approach that uses Lasso to perform selection at the level of reaction modules is applied to the NF-&lt;i&gt;κ&lt;/i&gt;B signaling network to test the necessity of feedback loops for responses to pulsatile and continuous pathway stimulation. Taken together, our results demonstrate that Bayesian parameter estimation combined with regularization can isolate and reveal core motifs sufficient to explain data from complex signaling systems.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/ITjCk7Q1l10&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Together with a large state space, the complexity of this behaviour can make it difficult to create concise mathematical models that can be easily extended or modified. This paper introduces the Beacon Calculus, a process algebra designed to simplify the task of modelling interacting biological components. Its breadth is demonstrated by creating models of DNA replication dynamics, the gene expression dynamics in response to DNA methylation damage, and a multisite phosphorylation switch. The flexibility of these models is shown by adapting the DNA replication model to further include two topics of interest from the literature: cooperative origin firing and replication fork barriers. The Beacon Calculus is supported with the open-source simulator bcs (https://github.com/MBoemo/bcs.git) to allow users to develop and simulate their own models.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/gHH0sfQR5to&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Shared Physiological Correlates of Multisensory and Expectation-Based Facilitation</title>

	<content:encoded>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Perceptual performance in a visual task can be enhanced by simultaneous multisensory information, but can also be enhanced by a symbolic or amodal cue inducing a specific expectation. That similar benefits can arise from multisensory information and within-modality expectation raises the question of whether the underlying neurophysiological processes are the same or distinct. We investigated this by comparing the influence of the following three types of auxiliary probabilistic cues on visual motion discrimination in humans: (1) acoustic motion, (2) a premotion visual symbolic cue, and (3) a postmotion symbolic cue. Using multivariate analysis of the EEG data, we show that both the multisensory and preceding visual symbolic cue enhance the encoding of visual motion direction as reflected by cerebral activity arising from occipital regions ~200–400 ms post-stimulus onset. This suggests a common or overlapping physiological correlate of cross-modal and intramodal auxiliary information, pointing to a neural mechanism susceptive to both multisensory and more abstract probabilistic cues. We also asked how prestimulus activity shapes the cue–stimulus combination and found a differential influence on the cross-modal and intramodal combination: while alpha power modulated the relative weight of visual motion and the acoustic cue, it did not modulate the behavioral influence of a visual symbolic cue, pointing to differences in how prestimulus activity shapes the combination of multisensory and abstract cues with task-relevant information.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>RSS PAP: Neural Isolation of the Olfactory Bulbs Severely Impairs Taste-Guided Behavior to Normally Preferred, But Not Avoided, Stimuli</title>
	<link>http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0026-20.2020v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>ABSTRACT&lt;p&gt;Here we systematically tested the hypothesis that motivated behavioral responsiveness to preferred and avoided taste compounds is relatively independent of the olfactory system in mice whose olfactory bulbs (main and accessory) were surgically disconnected from the rest of the brain (bulbotomy; BULBx). BULBx was confirmed histologically as well as functionally with the buried food test. In brief access taste tests, animals received 10-s trials of various concentrations of a taste compound delivered quasi-randomly. BULBx C57BL/6 (B6) mice displayed severely blunted concentration-dependent licking for the disaccharide sucrose, the maltodextrin Maltrin, and the fat emulsion Intralipid relative to their sham-operated controls (SHAM B6). Licking for the noncaloric sweetener saccharin was also blunted by bulbotomy, but less so. As expected, mice lacking a functional &quot;sweet&quot; receptor (T1R2+T1R3 knockout, KO) displayed concentration-dependent responsiveness to Maltrin and severely attenuated licking to sucrose. Like in B6 mice, responsiveness to both stimuli was exceptionally curtailed by bulbotomy. In contrast to these deficits in taste-guided behavior for unconditionally preferred stimuli, BULBx in B6 and KO mice did not alter concentration-dependent decreases for the representative non-preferred stimuli, quinine and citric acid. Nor did it temper intake of and preference for high concentrations of affectively positive stimuli when presented in long-term (23-hr) 2-bottle tests, demonstrating that the surgery does not lead to a generalized motivational deficit. Collectively, these behavioral results demonstrate that specific aspects of taste-guided ingestive motivation are profoundly disturbed by eliminating the anatomical connections between the main/accessory olfactory bulbs and the rest of the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE&lt;/b&gt; The senses of taste and smell have long been known to interact to contribute to the perception of flavor, but they are generally thought to operate independently. Here we found that severing the anatomical connections between the olfactory bulb and the rest of the brain, severely blunts taste-motivated licking responses of mice to brief presentations of a wide range of concentrations of highly preferred stimuli that have an unconditioned positive affective valence. In contrast, the concentration-dependent decrease in licking of taste stimuli considered aversive was impervious to this neural transection. These results underscore the importance of understanding gustatory function in a broader context that involves a significant contribution from the olfactory/vomeronasal system in the maintenance of certain taste-motivated behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Cognitive Reserve Is Not Associated With Hippocampal Microstructure in Older Adults Without Dementia</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2019.00380</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Objective: Mean Diffusivity (MD) as measured by diffusion tensor imaging can be used to detect microstructural alterations of the brain’s gray matter (GM). A previous study found that higher education, which is a proxy for cognitive reserve (CR), was related to decreased hippocampal MD in middle-aged healthy adults, indicating decreased microstructural damage in more educated participants. Based on this study, we aimed at determining the role of hippocampal GM MD in the interaction of AD pathology and CR in older people without dementia.
Method: We used a sample of 52 cognitively normal people and 38 participants with late mild cognitive impairment (LMCI) from the ADNI database. MCI and cognitively normal participants were analyzed separately. Using linear models, we regressed hippocampal GM MD on CR (quantified by a composite score), amyloid status and the interaction of both, adjusting for age, gender and memory score. 
Results: CR was not associated with hippocampal GM MD and hippocampal GM volume. Also, no interaction of amyloid status and CR was found.
Conclusions: Our results do not confirm an association of CR and hippocampal GM MD in older adults. In contrast to previous studies, we did not find an association between CR and microstructural, nor macrostructural alterations of the hippocampus in older adults. More research is needed to determine the influence of CR on hippocampal microstructural integrity in relation to age and AD pathology.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: The Specific Impact of Apolipoprotein E Epsilon 2 on Cognition and Brain Function in Cognitively Normal Elders and Mild Cognitive Impairment Patients</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2019.00374</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Variants in the apolipoprotein E (APOE) gene play an important role in the development of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Specifically, the APOE-ε4 allele is an established genetic risk factor for AD, while the APOE-ε2 allele is a protective factor against AD. However, the mechanism underlying this impact of APOE genotype on the pathogenesis of AD remain unclear. This study sought to investigate the influence of APOE genotype on cognition and neuroimaging features in cognitively normal (CN) elderly individuals and patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). A total of 177 participants were selected from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative database, including 101 MCI patients and 76 CN individuals. A 2 × 3 (consisting of 2 groups and 3 APOE genotypes) analysis of covariance was carried out to measure the influences of diagnosis and APOE genotype on cognition and brain features, assessed based on global functional connectivity density (gFCD) and hippocampal volume. In addition, a mediation analysis was carried out to investigate the indirect influence of neuroimaging features on the relationship between APOE genotype and cognitive performance in the MCI group. This analysis revealed that APOE genotype had an influence on brain function in the bilateral precentral gyrus, right thalamus, and posterior cingulate cortex. In addition, an interactive influence between diagnosis and APOE genotype was found on general cognition, immediate memory, executive function, hippocampal volume, and gFCD in the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and medial prefrontal cortex. Finally, this mediation analysis revealed that hippocampal volume and gFCD in the thalamus may mediate the relationship between APOE genotype and cognitive performance in the MCI group. Taken together, our findings provide novel insights into the neural mechanisms underlying the genetically guided pathogenic mechanisms of AD.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Brain Imaging Methods section | New and Recent Articles: Shape Information Improves the Cross-Cohort Performance of Deep Learning-Based Segmentation of the Hippocampus</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00015</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Performing an accurate segmentation of the hippocampus from brain magnetic resonance images is a crucial task in neuroimaging research, since its structural integrity is strongly related to several neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer’s Disease (AD). Some automatic segmentation tools are already being used, but, in recent years, new deep learning (DL) based methods have been proven to be much more accurate in various medical image segmentation tasks. In this work, we propose a DL-based hippocampus segmentation framework that embeds statistical shape of the hippocampus as context information into the deep neural network (DNN). The inclusion of shape information is achieved with three main steps: (1) a U-Net based segmentation, (2) a shape model estimation and (3) a second U-Net based segmentation which uses both the original input data and the fitted shape model. The trained DL architectures were tested on image data of three diagnostic groups (AD patients, subjects with mild cognitive impairment and controls) from two cohorts (ADNI and AddNeuroMed). Both intra-cohort validation and cross-cohort validation were performed and compared with the conventional U-net architecture and some variations with other types of context information (i.e. autocontext and tissue-class context). Our results suggest that adding shape information can improve the segmentation accuracy in cross-cohort validation, i.e. when DNNs are trained on one cohort and applied to another. However, no significant benefit is observed in intra-cohort validation, i.e. training and testing DNNs on images from the same cohort. Moreover, compared to other types of context information, the use of shape context was shown to be the most successful in increasing the accuracy, while keeping the computational time in the order of a few minutes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The characterisation of the brain as a &quot;connectome&quot;, in which the connections
are represented by correlational values across timeseries and as summary
measures derived from graph theory analyses, has been very popular in the last
years. However, although this representation has advanced our understanding of
the brain function, it may represent an oversimplified model. This is because
the typical fMRI datasets are constituted by complex and highly heterogeneous
timeseries that vary across space (i.e., location of brain regions). We compare
various modelling techniques from deep learning and geometric deep learning to
pave the way for future research in effectively leveraging the rich spatial and
temporal domains of typical fMRI datasets, as well as of other similar
datasets. As a proof-of-concept, we compare our approaches in the homogeneous
and publicly available Human Connectome Project (HCP) dataset on a supervised
binary classification task. We hope that our methodological advances relative
to previous &quot;connectomic&quot; measures can ultimately be clinically and
computationally relevant by leading to a more nuanced understanding of the
brain dynamics in health and disease. Such understanding of the brain can
fundamentally reduce the constant specialised clinical expertise in order to
accurately understand brain variability.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Effects of neuronal variability on phase synchronization of neural networks. (arXiv:2003.03289v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2003.03289</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;An important idea in neural information processing is the
communication-through-coherence hypothesis, according to which communication
between two brain regions is effective only if they are phase-locked. Also of
importance is neuronal variability, a phenomenon in which a single neuron's
inter-firing times may be highly variable. In this work, we aim to connect
these two ideas by studying the effects of that variability on the capability
of neurons to reach phase synchronization. We simulate a network of
modified-Hodgkin-Huxley-bursting neurons possessing a small-world topology.
First, variability is shown to be correlated with the average degree of phase
synchronization of the network. Next, restricting to spatial variability -
which measures the deviation of firing times between all neurons in the network
- we show that it is positively correlated to a behavior we call promiscuity,
which is the tendency of neurons to to have their relative phases change with
time. This relation is observed in all cases we tested, regardless of the
degree of synchronization or the strength of the inter-neuronal coupling: high
variability implies high promiscuity (low duration of phase-locking), even if
the network as a whole is synchronized and the coupling is strong. We argue
that spatial variability actually generates promiscuity. Therefore, we conclude
that variability has a strong influence on both the degree and the manner in
which neurons phase synchronize, which is another reason for its relevance in
neural communication.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;We propose a neurobiologically inspired visual simultaneous localization and
mapping (SLAM) system based on direction sparse method to real-time build
cognitive maps of large-scale environments from a moving stereo camera. The
core SLAM system mainly comprises a Bayesian attractor network, which utilizes
neural responses of head direction (HD) cells in the hippocampus and grid cells
in the medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) to represent the head direction and the
position of the robot in the environment, respectively. Direct sparse method is
employed to accurately and robustly estimate velocity information from a stereo
camera. Input rotational and translational velocities are integrated by the HD
cell and grid cell networks, respectively. We demonstrated our
neurobiologically inspired stereo visual SLAM system on the KITTI odometry
benchmark datasets. Our proposed SLAM system is robust to real-time build a
coherent semi-metric topological map from a stereo camera. Qualitative
evaluation on cognitive maps shows that our proposed neurobiologically inspired
stereo visual SLAM system outperforms our previous brain-inspired algorithms
and the neurobiologically inspired monocular visual SLAM system both in terms
of tracking accuracy and robustness, which is closer to the traditional
state-of-the-art one.

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2020.00019</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Automatic segmentation of Multiple Sclerosis (MS) lesions from Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) images is essential for clinical assessment and treatment planning of MS. Recent years have seen an increasing use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for this task. Although these methods provide accurate segmentation, their applicability in clinical settings remains limited due to a reproducibility issue across different image domains. MS images can have highly variable characteristics across patients, MRI scanners and imaging protocols; retraining a supervised model with data from each new domain is not a feasible solution because it requires manual annotation from expert radiologists. In this work, we explore an unsupervised solution to the problem of domain shift. We present a framework, Seg-JDOT, which adapts a deep model so that samples from a source domain and samples from a target domain sharing similar representations will be similarly segmented. We evaluated the framework on a multi-site dataset, MICCAI 2016, and showed that the adaptation toward a target site can bring remarkable improvements in a model performance over standard training.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Functional Brain Network Connectivity Patterns Associated With Normal Cognition at Old-Age, Local β-amyloid, Tau, and APOE4</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00046</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Background: Integrity of functional brain networks is closely associated with maintained cognitive performance at old age. Consistently, both carrier status of Apolipoprotein E ε4 allele (APOE4), and age-related aggregation of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) pathology result in altered brain network connectivity. The posterior cingulate and precuneus (PCP) is a node of particular interest due to its role in crucial memory processes. Moreover, the PCP is subject to the early aggregation of AD pathology. The current study aimed at characterizing brain network properties associated with unimpaired cognition in old aged adults. To determine the effects of age-related brain change and genetic risk for AD, pathological proteins β-amyloid and tau were measured by Positron-emission tomography (PET), PCP connectivity as a proxy of cognitive network integrity, and genetic risk by APOE4 carrier status.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Fifty-seven cognitively unimpaired old-aged adults (MMSE = 29.20 ± 1.11; 73 ± 8.32 years) were administered 11C Pittsburgh Compound B and 18F Flutemetamol PET for assessing β-amyloid, and 18F AV-1451 PET for tau. Individual functional connectivity seed maps of the PCP were obtained by resting-state multiband BOLD functional MRI at 3-Tesla for increased temporal resolution. Voxelwise correlations between functional connectivity, β-amyloid- and tau-PET were explored by Biological Parametric Mapping (BPM).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Local β-amyloid was associated with increased connectivity in frontal and parietal regions of the brain. Tau was linked to increased connectivity in more spatially distributed clusters in frontal, parietal, occipital, temporal, and cerebellar regions. A positive interaction was observable for APOE4 carrier status and functional connectivity with brain regions characterized by increased local β-amyloid and tau tracer retention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: Our data suggest an association between spatially differing connectivity systems and local β-amyloid, and tau aggregates in cognitively normal, old-aged adults, which is moderated by APOE4. Additional longitudinal studies may determine protective connectivity patterns associated with healthy aging trajectories of AD-pathology aggregation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To characterize trajectories of normative cognitive aging&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Older persons without dementia at study enrollment (n = 1,010) had annual cognitive testing for up to 24 years (mean = 9.9 years, SD = 5.0), died, and underwent a neuropathologic examination to quantify 9 postmortem markers of common neurodegenerative and cerebrovascular conditions. To accommodate the heterogeneity in cognitive trajectories, we used functional mixed effects models which allow individuals to have different patterns of cognitive decline under a unified model structure.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a functional mixed effects model, postmortem markers (AD pathology, Lewy bodies, transactive response DNA‐binding protein 43 (TDP‐43) pathology, hippocampal sclerosis, atherosclerosis, gross infarcts) were associated with global cognitive decline. Residual global cognitive decline after adjustment for neuropathologic burden was weakly related to age at death; it occurred in only about one third of participants, mostly proximate to death. Results were comparable after eliminating the initial cognitive assessments to minimize retest learning or controlling for frailty proximate to death. Analyses were also conducted with composite measures of episodic memory and perceptual speed. Residual decline not attributable to neuropathologic burden was confined to a subset for each outcome and was most evident proximate to death. Age at death was unrelated to residual decline in episodic memory but was related to residual decline in perceptual speed.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Late‐life cognitive loss mainly reflects non‐normative pathologic and mortality‐related processes rather than normative age‐related processes.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Chronic Ethanol Differentially Modulates Glutamate Release from Dorsal and Ventral Prefrontal Cortical Inputs onto Rat Basolateral Amygdala Principal Neurons</title>
	<link>http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/7/2/ENEURO.0132-19.2019?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;The medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and the basolateral amygdala (BLA) have strong reciprocal connectivity. Projections from the BLA to the mPFC can drive innate, anxiety-related behaviors, but it is unclear whether reciprocal projections from the mPFC to BLA have similar roles. Here, we use optogenetics and chemogenetics to characterize the neurophysiological and behavioral alterations produced by chronic ethanol exposure and withdrawal on dorsal mPFC (dmPFC) and ventral mPFC (vmPFC) medial prefrontal cortical terminals in the BLA. We exposed adult male Sprague Dawley rats to chronic intermittent ethanol (CIE) using vapor chambers, measured anxiety-like behavior on the elevated zero maze, and used electrophysiology to record glutamatergic and GABAergic responses in BLA principal neurons. We found that withdrawal from a 7 d CIE exposure produced opposing effects at dmPFC (increased glutamate release) and vmPFC (decreased glutamate release) terminals in the BLA. Chemogenetic inhibition of dmPFC terminals in the BLA attenuated the increased anxiety-like behavior we observed during withdrawal. These data demonstrate that chronic ethanol exposure and withdrawal strengthen the synaptic connections between the dmPFC and BLA but weakens the vmPFC–BLA pathway. Moreover, facilitation of the dmPFC–BLA pathway during withdrawal contributes to anxiety-like behavior. Given the opposing roles of dmPFC–BLA and vmPFC–BLA pathways in fear conditioning, our results suggest that chronic ethanol exposure simultaneously facilitates circuits involved in the acquisition of and diminishes circuits involved with the extinction of withdrawal-related aversive behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>RSS PAP: RatHat: A self-targeting printable brain implant system</title>
	<link>http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0538-19.2020v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;There has not been a major change in how neuroscientists approach stereotaxic methods in decades. Here we present a new stereotaxic method that provides an alternative approach to a traditional u-frame stereotaxic device and reduces costs, surgical time, and aids repeatability. The RatHat brain implantation system is a 3D printable stereotaxic device for rats that is fabricated prior to surgery and fits to the shape of the skull. RatHat builds are directly implanted into the brain without the need for head-leveling or coordinate-mapping during surgery. The RatHat can be used in conjunction with the traditional u-frame stereotaxic device, but does not require the use of a micromanipulator for successful implantations. Each RatHat contains several primary components including the implant for mounting intracranial components, the surgical stencil for targeting drill sites, and the protective cap for preventing damage from impacts and debris. Each component serves a unique function and can be used together or separately. We demonstrate the feasibility of the RatHat in four different proof-of-principle experiments: 1) a 3-pole cannula apparatus, 2) an optrode-electrode assembly, 3) a fixed-electrode array, and 4) a tetrode hyperdrive. Implants were successful, durable, and long-lasting (up to 9 months). RatHat print files are easily created, can be modified in CAD software for a variety of applications, and are easily shared, contributing to open science goals and replications. The RatHat has been adapted to multiple experimental paradigms in our lab and should be a useful new way to conduct stereotaxic implant surgeries in rodents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; We demonstrate a new approach to rodent stereotaxic surgery. Rodent neurosurgery is a complex skill that requires expensive equipment for head stabilization and micromanipulators for localization. The RatHat is a 3D printable brain implant system that reduces costs and time using pre-mapped and printed surgical files. A surgical stencil allows for quick placement of drill holes, and a RatHat places components in the brain using atlas coordinates. The RatHat is an easily shared resource facilitating open science goals for replications and the archiving of specific experimental applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>RSS PAP: Deficit in motor skill consolidation-dependent synaptic plasticity at motor cortex to Dorso Lateral Striatum synapses in a mouse model of Huntingtons disease</title>
	<link>http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0297-19.2020v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Huntington’s disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative disease notably characterized by progressive motor symptoms. Although the loss of Medium Spiny Neurons (MSNs) in the striatum has been associated with motor deficits, premanifest patients already present cognitive deficiencies and show early signs of motor disabilities. Here in a YAC128 HD mouse model, we identified impairment in motor skill consolidation at the age of 11 - 14 weeks. Using optogenetic stimulation, we found that excitatory synaptic transmission from motor cortex to MSNs located in the Dorso Lateral part of the Striatum (DLS) is altered. Using single pellet reaching task, we observed that while motor skill consolidation is accompanied by a dynamic change in AMPA/NMDA ratio in wild type mice, this form of synaptic plasticity does not occur in YAC128 mice. This study not only proposes new meaningful insight in the synaptopathic mechanisms of HD, but also highlights that deficit in motor skill consolidation-dependent synaptic plasticity at motor cortex to DLS synapses represents an early biomarker for Huntington’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Huntington’s disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by prominent motor manifestations in addition to nonmotor changes in behavior and cognition. Several studies have provided evidences that the neuropathological hallmark of HD begins and progresses before the conventional diagnosis can be made. Here using an animal model, we identified deficit in motor skill in early stage of the disease. Remarkably these early behavioural deficits are accompanied by aberrant plasticity at synapses between motor cortex and dorsal striatum. This study not only gives a better understanding in the synaptopathic mechanisms of HD, but also highlights that deficit in motor skill consolidation-dependent synaptic plasticity at motor cortex to dorsal striatum synapses represents an early biomarker for Huntington’s disease.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25712?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rett syndrome (RTT) is an X‐linked dominant neurodevelopmental disorder due to pathogenic mutations in the &lt;i&gt;MECP2&lt;/i&gt; gene. Motor impairment constitutes the core diagnostic feature of RTT. Preclinical studies have consistently demonstrated alteration of excitation/inhibition (E/I) balance and aberrant synaptic plasticity at cortical level. Herein we aimed at understanding neurobiological mechanisms underlying motor deficit by assessing in “vivo” synaptic plasticity and E/I balance in the primary motor cortex (M1).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On 14 patients with typical RTT, 9 epilepsy controls patients and 11 healthy controls we applied paired‐pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) protocols to evaluate the Excitation Index, a biomarker reflecting the contribution of inhibitory and facilitatory circuits in M1. Intermittent TMS‐theta burst stimulation was used to probe Long‐Term‐Potentiation (LTP)‐like plasticity in M1. Motor impairment, assessed by ad hoc clinical scales, was correlated with neurophysiological metrics.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RTT patients displayed a significant increase of the Excitation Index (p= 0.003), as demonstrated by the reduction of short‐interval intracortical inhibition and increase of intra‐cortical facilitation, suggesting a shift toward cortical excitation likely due to GABAergic dysfunction. Impairment of inhibitory circuits was also confirmed by the reduction of long‐interval intracortical inhibition (p= 0.002). LTP‐like plasticity in M1 was abolished (p= 0.008) and scaled with motor disability (all p= 0.003).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TMS is a method that can be used to assess cortical motor function in RTT patients. Our findings support the introduction of TMS measures in clinical and research settings to monitor the progression of motor deficit and response to treatment.&lt;/p&gt;

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1910.09495</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;We propose a new supervised learning rule for multilayer spiking neural
networks (SNNs) that use a form of temporal coding known as rank-order-coding.
With this coding scheme, all neurons fire exactly one spike per stimulus, but
the firing order carries information. In particular, in the readout layer, the
first neuron to fire determines the class of the stimulus. We derive a new
learning rule for this sort of network, named S4NN, akin to traditional error
backpropagation, yet based on latencies. We show how approximated error
gradients can be computed backward in a feedforward network with any number of
layers. This approach reaches state-of-the-art performance with supervised
multi fully-connected layer SNNs: test accuracy of 97.4% for the MNIST dataset,
and 99.2% for the Caltech Face/Motorbike dataset. Yet, the neuron model that we
use, non-leaky integrate-and-fire, is much simpler than the one used in all
previous works. The source codes of the proposed S4NN are publicly available at
https://github.com/SRKH/S4NN.

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2020.00012</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;We describe a model of neurological disease based on dysfunctional brain oscillators. This is not a new model, but it is not one that is widely appreciated by clinicians. The value of this model lies in the predictions it makes and the utility it provides in translational applications, in particular for neuromodulation devices. Specifically, we provide a perspective on devices that provide input to sensory receptors and thus stimulate endogenous sensory networks. Current forms of clinically applied neuromodulation, including devices such as (implanted) deep brain stimulators (DBS) and various, noninvasive methods such as transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and transcranial current methods (tACS, tDCS), have been studied extensively. The potential strength of neuromodulation of a sensory organ is access to the same pathways that natural environmental stimuli use and, importantly, the modulatory signal will be transformed as it travels through the brain, allowing the modulation input to be consistent with regional neuronal dynamics. We present specific examples of devices that rely on sensory neuromodulation and evaluate the translational potential of these approaches. We argue that sensory neuromodulation is well suited to, ideally, repair dysfunctional brain oscillators, thus providing a broad therapeutic approach for neurological diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Melatonin Protects Neural Stem Cells Against Tri-Ortho-Cresyl Phosphate-Induced Autophagy</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2020.00025</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Tri-ortho-cresyl phosphate (TOCP) is an extensively used organophosphate in industry. It has been proven to lead to toxicity in different organ systems, especially in the nervous system. Neural stem cells (NSCs) play important roles in both embryonic and adult nervous systems. However, whether TOCP induces cytotoxicity in embryonic NSCs remains unclear. In this study, mouse NSCs were exposed to different concentrations of TOCP for 24 h. The results showed that TOCP led to impaired proliferation of NSCs and induced the autophagy of NSCs by increasing the generation of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and decreasing the phosphorylation of extracellular regulated protein kinase (ERK1/2). Melatonin has been reported to exert neuroprotective effects via various mechanisms. Therefore, we further investigate whether melatonin has potential protective effects against TOCP-induced cytotoxicity on NSCs. Our data showed that melatonin pretreatment attenuated TOCP-induced autophagy by suppressing oxidative stress and restoring ERK1/2 phosphorylation consistently. Taken together, the results indicated that TOCP induced the autophagy in mouse NSCs, and melatonin may effectively protect NSCs against TOCP-induced autophagy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Caspr1 Facilitates sAPPα Production by Regulating α-Secretase ADAM9 in Brain Endothelial Cells</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2020.00023</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The expression of contactin-associated protein 1 (Caspr1) in brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMECs), one of the major cellular components of the neurovascular unit (NVU), has been revealed recently. However, the physiological role of Caspr1 in BMECs remains unclear. We previously reported the nonamyloidogenic processing of amyloid protein precursor (APP) pathway in the human BMECs (HBMECs). In this study, we found Caspr1 depletion reduced the levels of soluble amyloid protein precursor α (sAPPα) in the supernatant of HBMECs, which could be rescued by expression of full-length Caspr1. Our further results showed that ADAM9, the α-secretase essential for processing of APP to generate sAPPα, was decreased in Caspr1-depleted HBMECs. The reduced sAPPα secretion in Caspr1-depleted HBMECs was recovered by expression of exogenous ADAM9. Then, we identified that Caspr1 specifically regulates the expression of ADAM9, but not ADAM10 and ADAM17, at transcriptional level by nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) signaling pathway. Caspr1 knockout attenuated the activation of NF-κB and prevented the nuclear translocation of p65 in brain endothelial cells, which was reversed by expression of full-length Caspr1. The reduced sAPPα production and ADAM9 expression upon Caspr1 depletion were effectively recovered by NF-κB agonist. The results of luciferase assays indicated that the NF-κB binding sites are located at −859 bp to −571 bp of ADAM9 promoter. Taken together, our results demonstrated that Caspr1 facilitates sAPPα production by transcriptional regulation of α-secretase ADAM9 in brain endothelial cells.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2020.00020</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Purpose: The aim of this study was to evaluate the potential neurotrophic factors and expression of neurotrophin receptors in peripheral blood mononuclear cells linked with the antidepressant action of exercise intervention during protracted methamphetamine (METH) abstinence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Materials and Methods: A total of 72 male METH addicts, including 47 individuals with depression and 25 individuals without depression, were recruited in this study. Individuals with depression were divided into the depression control group and the depression exercised group. Consequently, 12 weeks of supervised exercise intervention was applied. Depression and anxiety were analyzed; plasma brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), neuronal growth factor (NGF), neurotrophin-3 (NT-3), NT-4, and proBDNF levels were tested using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; the mRNA expressions of TrkA, TrkB-FL, TrkB-T1, TrkCB, and P75NTR in peripheral blood mononuclear cells were detected by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: NT-4 plasma levels were correlated with depression (r = −0.330, p = 0.005), which remained significant after Bonferroni correction. In addition, the BDNF and NT-3 levels in the plasma were significantly correlated with depression (r = −0.268, p = 0.023; r = −0.259, p = 0.028), but did not reach significance after Bonferroni correction. The BDNF, NT-3, and NT-4 plasma levels were significantly different between the depressive control group and the depressive exercise group using pre-exercise values as the covariate. The fold changes in TrkB-FL and TrkB-T1 mRNA in peripheral blood mononuclear cells between the post-exercise and pre-exercise demonstrated a remarkable decrease (fold change = −11.056 and −39.055).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: Exercise intervention can alleviate depression and anxiety during protracted METH abstinence. Decrease in BDNF and the expression of TrkB in peripheral blood mononuclear cells occur following the exercise intervention.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Neural Technology section | New and Recent Articles: Motorized Shoes Induce Robust Sensorimotor Adaptation in Walking</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00174</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The motor system has the flexibility to update motor plans according to systematic changes in the environment or the body. This capacity is studied in the laboratory through sensorimotor adaptation paradigms imposing sustained and predictable motor demands specific to the task at hand. However, these studies are tied to the laboratory setting. Thus, we asked if a portable device could be used to elicit locomotor adaptation outside the laboratory. To this end, we tested the extent to which a pair of motorized shoes could induce similar locomotor adaptation to split-belt walking, which is a well-established sensorimotor adaptation paradigm in locomotion. We specifically compared the adaptation effects (i.e. after-effects) between two groups of young, healthy participants walking with the legs moving at different speeds by either a split-belt treadmill or a pair of motorized shoes. The speeds at which the legs moved in the split-belt group was set by the belt speed under each foot, whereas in the motorized shoes group were set by the combined effect of the actuated shoes and the belts’ moving at the same speed. We found that the adaptation of joint motions and measures of spatial and temporal asymmetry, which are commonly used to quantify sensorimotor adaptation in locomotion, were indistinguishable between groups. We only found small differences in the joint angle kinematics during baseline walking between the groups – potentially due to the weight and height of the motorized shoes. Our results indicate that robust sensorimotor adaptation in walking can be induced with a paired of motorized shoes, opening the exciting possibility to study sensorimotor adaptation during more realistic situations outside the laboratory.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Neural Technology section | New and Recent Articles: rTMS-Induced Changes in Glutamatergic and Dopaminergic Systems: Relevance to Cocaine and Methamphetamine Use Disorders</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00137</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Cocaine use disorder and methamphetamine use disorder are chronic, relapsing disorders with no US Food and Drug Administration-approved interventions. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a non-invasive brain stimulation tool that has been increasingly investigated as a possible therapeutic intervention for substance use disorders. rTMS may have the ability to induce beneficial neuroplasticity in abnormal circuits and networks in individuals with addiction. The aim of this review is to highlight the rationale and potential for rTMS to treat cocaine and methamphetamine dependence: we synthesize the outcomes of studies in healthy humans and animal models to identify and understand the neurobiological mechanisms of rTMS that seem most involved in addiction, focusing on the dopaminergic and glutamatergic systems. rTMS-induced changes to neurotransmitter systems include alterations to striatal dopamine release and metabolite levels, as well as to glutamate transporter and receptor expression, which may be relevant for ameliorating the aberrant plasticity observed in individuals with substance use disorders. We also discuss the clinical studies that have used rTMS in humans with cocaine and methamphetamine use disorders. Many such studies suggest changes in network connectivity following acute rTMS, which may underpin reduced craving following chronic rTMS. We suggest several possible future directions for research relating to the therapeutic potential of rTMS in addiction that would help fill current gaps in the literature. Such research would apply rTMS to animal models of addiction, developing a translational pipeline that would guide evidence-based rTMS treatment of cocaine and methamphetamine use disorder.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: The Effects of Instruction Manipulation on Motor Performance Following Action Observation</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00033</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The effects of action observation (AO) on motor performance can be modulated by instruction. The effects of two top-down aspects of the instruction on motor performance have not been fully resolved: those related to attention to the observed task and the incorporation of motor imagery (MI) during AO. In addition, the immediate vs. 24-h retention test effects of those instruction’s aspects are yet to be elucidated. Forty-eight healthy subjects were randomly instructed to: (1) observe reaching movement (RM) sequences toward five lighted units with the intention of reproducing the same sequence as fast and as accurate as possible (Intentional + Attentional group; AO+At); (2) observe the RMs sequence with the intention of reproducing the same sequence as fast and as accurate as possible and simultaneously to the observation to imagine performing the RMs (Intentional + attentional + MI group; AO+At+MI); and (3) observe the RMs sequence (Passive AO group). Subjects’ performance was tested before and immediately after the AO and retested after 24 h. During each of the pretest, posttest, and retest, the subject performed RMs toward the units that were activated in the same order as the observed sequence. Occasionally, the sequence order was changed by beginning the sequence with a different activated unit. The outcome measures were: averaged response time of the RMs during the sequences, difference between the response time of the unexpected and expected RMs and percent of failures to reach the target within 1 s. The averaged response time and the difference between the response time of the unexpected and expected RMs were improved in all groups at posttest compared to pretest, regardless of instruction. Averaged response time was improved in the retest compared to the posttest only in the Passive AO group. The percent of failures across groups was higher in pretest compared to retest. Our findings suggest that manipulating top-down aspects of instruction by adding attention and MI to AO in an RM sequence task does not improve subsequent performance more than passive observation. Off-line learning of the sequence in the retention test was improved in comparison to posttest following passive observation only.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neural Circuits | New and Recent Articles: Testing Navigation in Real Space: Contributions to Understanding the Physiology and Pathology of Human Navigation Control</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncir.2020.00006</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Successful navigation relies on the flexible and appropriate use of metric representations of space or topological knowledge of the environment. Spatial dimensions (2D vs. 3D), spatial scales (vista-scale vs. large-scale environments) and the abundance of visual landmarks critically affect navigation performance and behavior in healthy human subjects. Virtual reality (VR)-based navigation paradigms in stationary position have given insight into the major navigational strategies, namely egocentric (body-centered) and allocentric (world-centered), and the cerebral control of navigation. However, VR approaches are biased towards optic flow and visual landmark processing. This major limitation can be overcome to some extent by increasingly immersive and realistic VR set-ups (including large-screen projections, eye tracking and use of head-mounted camera systems). However, the highly immersive VR settings are difficult to apply particularly to older subjects and patients with neurological disorders because of cybersickness and difficulties with learning and conducting the tasks. Therefore, a need for the development of novel spatial tasks in real space exists, which allows a synchronous analysis of navigational behavior, strategy, visual explorations and navigation-induced brain activation patterns. This review summarizes recent findings from real space navigation studies in healthy subjects and patients with different cognitive and sensory neurological disorders. Advantages and limitations of real space navigation testing and different VR-based navigation paradigms are discussed in view of potential future applications in clinical neurology.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Direct Medial Entorhinal Cortex Input to Hippocampal CA3 Is Crucial for eEF2K Inhibitor-Induced Neuronal Oscillations in the Mouse Hippocampus</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00024</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The hippocampal formation plays a vital role in memory formation and takes part in the control of the default neuronal network activity of the brain. It also represents an important structure to analyze drug-induced effects on subregion-specific synchronization of neuronal activity. However, the consequences of an altered functional state of synapses for subregion-specific synchronization of neuronal microcircuits remain to be fully understood. Therefore, we analyzed the direct interaction of neuronal microcircuits utilizing a genetically encoded calcium sensor (GCaMP6s) and local field potential (LFP) recording in acute hippocampal–entorhinal brain slices in response to a modulator of synaptic transmission. We observed that application of the eukaryotic elongation factor-2 kinase (eEF2K) inhibitor A484954, induced a large-scale synchronization of neuronal activity within different regions of the hippocampal formation. This effect was confirmed by the recording of extracellular LFPs. Further, in order to understand if the synchronized activity depended on interconnected hippocampal areas, we lesioned adjacent regions from each other. These experiments identified the origin of A484954-induced synchronized activity in the hippocampal CA3 subfield localized near the hilus of the dentate gyrus. Remarkably, the synchronization of neuronal activity in the hippocampus required an intact connection with the medial entorhinal cortex (MEC). In line with this observation, we detected an increase in neuronal activity in the MEC area after application of A484954. In summary, inhibition of eEF2K alters the intrinsic activity of interconnected neuronal microcircuits dominated by the MEC–CA3 afferents.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Reaction time (RT) and RT variability are core components of cognitive performance that can be captured through brief and easy-to-administer tasks of simple RT and choice RT. The current study aims to describe age-related differences in cognitive performance, toward better characterizing normative performance across the lifespan. We examined mean and variability of response times on a simple RT and choice RT tasks in a large and diverse web-based sample (10,060 visitors to TestMyBrain.org). We also examined lifespan-related differences in response time variability using multiple different approaches (raw variability, mean scaled variability, and mean residualized variability). These analyses revealed significant heterogeneity in the patterns of age-related differences in performance, across metrics and within different estimates of the same metric. Based on segmented regression analysis, age of peak performance differed significantly across metrics, with young adults having the best performance based on measures of median RT, middle age adults at peak on certain measures of RT variability (standard deviation and coefficient of variability), and older adults showing the best performance based on accuracy and mean-corrected RT variability. Our results indicate that no single measure of cognitive performance and performance variability produces the same findings with respect to age related change, with further work needed to establish the validity of particular metrics for different applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Steps Towards Developing Effective Treatments for Neuropsychiatric Disturbances in Alzheimer’s Disease: Insights From Preclinical Models, Clinical Data, and Future Directions</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00056</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia worldwide. It is mostly known for its devastating effect on memory and learning but behavioral alterations commonly known as neuropsychiatric disturbances (NPDs) are also characteristics of the disease. These include apathy, depression-like behavior, and sleep disturbances, and they all contribute to an increased caregiver burden and earlier institutionalization. The interaction between NPDs and AD pathology is not well understood, but the consensus is that they contribute to disease progression and faster decline. Consequently, recognizing and treating NPDs might improve AD pathology and increase the quality of life for both patients and caregivers. In this review article, we examine previous and current literature on apathy, depressive symptoms, and sleep disturbances in AD patients and preclinical AD mechanistic models. We hypothesize that tau accumulation, beta-amyloid (Aβ) aggregation, neuroinflammation, mitochondrial damage, and loss of the locus coeruleus (LC)-norepinephrine (NE) system all collectively impact the development of NPDs and contribute synergistically to AD pathology. Targeting more than one of these processes might provide the most optimal strategy for treating NPDs and AD. The development of such clinical approaches would be preceded by preclinical studies, for which robust and reliable mechanistic models of NPD-like behavior are needed. Thus, developing effective preclinical research models represents an important step towards a better understanding of NPDs in AD.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Executive Function Is Related to the Urinary Urgency in Non-demented Patients With Parkinson’s Disease</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00055</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Introduction: Evidence suggests urinary urgency is associated with cognitive impairment in a subtype of Parkinson’s disease (PD) patients. This study investigates if cognitive impairment independently predicts the presence of urinary dysfunction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: We report data of 189 idiopathic PD patients, excluding those with concomitant diseases or medication interacting with bladder function. A standardized questionnaire was used to define the presence of urinary urgency. All patients underwent a comprehensive motor, cognitive non-motor and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) assessment. Multivariable linear regression analysis was performed to identify independent variables characterizing urinary urgency in PD (PD-UU), which were assigned as discriminant features to estimate their individual contribution to the phenotype of the PD-UU group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Of 189 PD patients, 115 (60.8%) reported PD-UU. The linear regression analysis showed that among cognitive domains, executive function (EF; p = 0.04) had a significant negative association with PD-UU. In a second model, scores of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) significantly differentiated between study groups (p = 0.007) and also non-motor symptom (NMS) burden (p &amp;lt; 0.001). The third model consisted of reports of HRQoL, of which stigma was the only subscale of the Parkinson’s Disease Questionnaire (PDQ-39) differentiating between patients with and without PD-UU (p = 0.02). The linear discriminant analysis provided evidence that the combination of EF, NMS burden, nocturia, and stigma discriminated between groups with 72.4% accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: In our large, non-demented PD cohort, urinary urgency was associated with executive dysfunction (EF), supporting a possible causative link between both symptoms. A combination of neuropsychological and non-motor aspects identified patients with PD-UU with high discriminative accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00053</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Aim: Oxidative stress and inflammation play critical roles in the neuropathogenesis of PD. We aimed to evaluate oxidative stress and inflammation status by measuring serum superoxide dismutase (SOD) with lipoprotein cholesterol and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) respectively in PD patients, and explore their correlation with the disease severity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: We performed a cross-sectional study that included 204 PD patients and 204 age-matched healthy controls (HCs). Plasma levels of SOD, hsCRP, total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) were measured. A series of neuropsychological assessments were performed to rate the severity of PD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: The plasma levels of SOD (135.7 ± 20.14 vs. 147.2 ± 24.34, P &amp;lt; 0.0001), total cholesterol, HDL-C and LDL-C in PD were significantly lower than those in HCs; the hsCRP level was remarkably increased in PD compared to HC (2.766 ± 3.242 vs. 1.637 ± 1.597, P &amp;lt; 0.0001). The plasma SOD was negatively correlated with the hsCRP, while positively correlated with total cholesterol, HDL-C, and LDL-C in PD patients. The plasma SOD were negatively correlated with H&amp;amp;Y, total UPDRS, UPDRS (I), UPDRS (II), and UPDRS (III) scores, but positively correlated with MoCA and MMSE scores. Besides, hsCRP was negatively correlated with MoCA; while total cholesterol, HDL-C and LDL-C were positively correlated with the MoCA, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: Our findings suggest that lower SOD along with cholesterol, HDL-C and LDL-C, and higher hsCRP levels might be important markers to assess the PD severity. A better understanding of SOD and hsCRP may yield insights into the pathogenesis of PD.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Succination of Protein Thiols in Human Brain Aging</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00052</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Human brain evolution toward complexity has been achieved with increasing energy supply as the main adaptation in brain metabolism. Energy metabolism, like other biochemical reactions in aerobic cells, is under enzymatic control and strictly regulated. Nevertheless, physiologically uncontrolled and deleterious reactions take place. It has been proposed that these reactions constitute the basic molecular mechanisms that underlie the maintenance or loss-of-function of neurons and, by extension, cerebral functions during brain aging. In this review article, we focus attention on the role of the nonenzymatic and irreversible adduction of fumarate to the protein thiols, which leads to the formation of S-(2-succino)cysteine (2SC; protein succination) in the human brain. In particular, we first offer a brief approach to the succination reaction, features related to the specificity of protein succination, methods for their detection and quantification, the bases for considering 2SC as a biomarker of mitochondrial stress, the succinated proteome, the cross-regional differences in 2SC content, and changes during brain aging, as well as the potential regulatory significance of fumarate and 2SC. We propose that 2SC defines cross-regional differences of metabolic mitochondrial stress in the human brain and that mitochondrial stress is sustained throughout the healthy adult lifespan in order to preserve neuronal function and survival.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The association between physical fitness and cognitive performance has been widely investigated in the literature. However, the neurophysiological mechanisms underlying this relationship are not yet clear. Here, we aim to evaluate the interactions between executive function measures, heart rate variability (HRV), and physical fitness in the context of the neurovisceral integration (NVI) theory. Twenty-eight healthy elderly subjects (&amp;gt;60 years) were submitted to evaluation of executive performance with three computerized tests: the N-back test measured working memory capacity, the Stroop Color test evaluated inhibitory control and selective attention, and the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST) evaluated abstract reasoning and cognitive flexibility. We also used the Physical Testing Battery for the Elderly to measure aerobic capacity, dynamic balance, upper body flexibility, and handgrip strength. Our results confirm the relationship between executive function and physical fitness, particularly between working memory, cardiorespiratory fitness, and dynamic balance. We also demonstrate an association between executive performance and HRV in older people, corroborating previous results from other groups obtained in young adults. However, our regression models did not indicate that HRV mediates the relationship between cognition and physical fitness in the elderly, suggesting that age-related degeneration of autonomic control can affect aspects of NVI in this population.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00049</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Normative aging is known to affect how decisions are made in risky situations. Although important individual variability exists, on average, aging is accompanied by greater risk aversion. Here the behavioral and neural mechanisms of greater risk aversion were examined in young and old rats trained on an instrumental probability discounting task. Consistent with the literature, old rats showed greater discounting of reward value when the probability of obtaining rewards dropped below 100%. Behaviorally, reward magnitude discrimination was the same between young and old rats, and yet these same rats exhibited reduced sensitivity to positive, but not negative, choice outcomes. The latter behavioral result was congruent with additional findings that the aged ventral tegmental neurons (including dopamine cells) were less responsive to rewards when compared to the same cell types recorded from young animals. In sum, it appears that reduced responses of dopamine neurons to rewards contribute to aging-related changes in risky decisions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Whole genome sequencing of bacteria has become daily routine in many fields. Advances in DNA sequencing technologies and continuously dropping costs have resulted in a tremendous increase in the amounts of available sequence data. However, comprehensive in-depth analysis of the resulting data remains an arduous and time-consuming task. In order to keep pace with these promising but challenging developments and to transform raw data into valuable information, standardized analyses and scalable software tools are needed. Here, we introduce ASA&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;P, a fully automatic, locally executable and scalable assembly, annotation and analysis pipeline for bacterial genomes. The pipeline automatically executes necessary data processing steps, &lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;i&gt;e&lt;/i&gt;. quality clipping and assembly of raw sequencing reads, scaffolding of contigs and annotation of the resulting genome sequences. Furthermore, ASA&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;P conducts comprehensive genome characterizations and analyses, &lt;i&gt;e&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt;. taxonomic classification, detection of antibiotic resistance genes and identification of virulence factors. All results are presented via an HTML5 user interface providing aggregated information, interactive visualizations and access to intermediate results in standard bioinformatics file formats. We distribute ASA&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;P in two versions: a locally executable Docker container for small-to-medium-scale projects and an OpenStack based cloud computing version able to automatically create and manage self-scaling compute clusters. Thus, automatic and standardized analysis of hundreds of bacterial genomes becomes feasible within hours.

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Corticotropin-Releasing Factor Receptor-1 Neurons in the Lateral Amygdala Display Selective Sensitivity to Acute and Chronic Ethanol Exposure</title>
	<link>http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/7/2/ENEURO.0420-19.2020?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;The lateral amygdala (LA) serves as the point of entry for sensory information within the amygdala complex, a structure that plays a critical role in emotional processes and has been implicated in alcohol use disorders. Within the amygdala, the corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) system has been shown to mediate some of the effects of both stress and ethanol, but the effects of ethanol on specific CRF1 receptor circuits in the amygdala have not been fully established. We used male CRF1:GFP reporter mice to characterize CRF1-expressing (CRF1&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) and nonexpressing (CRF1&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt;) LA neurons and investigate the effects of acute and chronic ethanol exposure on these populations. The CRF1&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; population was found to be composed predominantly of glutamatergic projection neurons with a minority subpopulation of interneurons. CRF1&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; neurons exhibited a tonic conductance that was insensitive to acute ethanol. CRF1&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt; neurons did not display a basal tonic conductance, but the application of acute ethanol induced a  GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptor subunit-dependent tonic conductance and enhanced phasic GABA release onto these cells. Chronic ethanol increased CRF1&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; neuronal excitability but did not significantly alter phasic or tonic GABA signaling in either CRF1&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; or CRF1&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt; cells. Chronic ethanol and withdrawal also did not alter basal extracellular GABA or glutamate transmitter levels in the LA/BLA and did not alter the sensitivity of GABA or glutamate to acute ethanol-induced increases in transmitter release. Together, these results provide the first characterization of the CRF1&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; population of LA neurons and suggest mechanisms for differential acute ethanol sensitivity within this region.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>RSS PAP: Paired Associative Stimulation Fails to Induce Plasticity in Freely Behaving Intact Rats</title>
	<link>http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0396-19.2020v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Paired Associative Stimulation (PAS) has been explored in humans as a non-invasive tool to drive plasticity and promote recovery after neurological insult. A more thorough understanding of PAS-induced plasticity is needed to fully harness it as a clinical tool. Here, we tested the efficacy of PAS with multiple inter-stimuli intervals in an awake rat model in order to study the principles of associative plasticity. Using chronically implanted electrodes in motor cortex and forelimb, we explored PAS parameters to effectively drive plasticity. We assessed changes in corticomotor excitability using a closed loop, EMG-controlled cortical stimulation paradigm. We tested eleven PAS intervals, chosen to force the coincidence of neuronal activity in the rats’ motor cortex and spinal cord with timings relevant to the principles of Hebbian spike-timing-dependent plasticity. However, despite a relatively large number of stimulus pairings (300), none of the tested intervals reliably changed corticospinal excitability relative to control conditions. Our results question PAS effectiveness under these conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Paired Associative Stimulation (PAS) can be applied non-invasively to modulate corticomotor plasticity in humans. However, our understanding of how we can use paired stimuli to produce the greatest beneficial reshaping of corticomotor connections &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; is still rudimentary. We completed a systematic study varying inter-stimulus intervals between cortical and muscle stimulation in a freely-behaving rat PAS model, following the principles of spike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP). Crucially, our experiments have &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; demonstrated that the STDP model is effective &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; using our PAS protocol. We discuss several other factors in addition to the inter-stimulus interval which may play a larger role in driving plasticity, and potential ways that the field can approach future work.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Targeting Oxidative Stress and Inflammation to Prevent Ischemia-Reperfusion Injury</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2020.00028</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The cerebral ischemia injury can result in neuronal death and/or functional impairment, which leads to further damage and dysfunction after recovery of blood supply. Cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury (CIRI) often causes irreversible brain damage and neuronal injury and death, which involves many complex pathological processes including oxidative stress, amino acid toxicity, the release of endogenous substances, inflammation and apoptosis. Oxidative stress and inflammation are interactive and play critical roles in ischemia/reperfusion injury in the brain. Oxidative stress is important in the pathological process of ischemic stroke and is critical for the cascade development of ischemic injury. Oxidative stress is caused by reactive oxygen species (ROS) during cerebral ischemia and is more likely to lead to cell death and ultimately brain death after reperfusion. During reperfusion especially, superoxide anion free radicals, hydroxyl free radicals, and nitric oxide (NO) are produced, which can cause lipid peroxidation, inflammation and cell apoptosis. Inflammation alters the balance between pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory factors in cerebral ischemic injury. Inflammatory factors can therefore stimulate or exacerbate inflammation and aggravate ischemic injury. Neuroprotective therapies for various stages of the cerebral ischemia cascade response have received widespread attention. At present, neuroprotective drugs mainly include free radical scavengers, anti-inflammatory agents, and anti-apoptotic agents. However, the molecular mechanisms of the interaction between oxidative stress and inflammation, and their interplay with different types of programmed cell death in ischemia/reperfusion injury are unclear. The development of a suitable method for combination therapy has become a hot topic.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Trace Amine-Associated Receptor 5 Provides Olfactory Input Into Limbic Brain Areas and Modulates Emotional Behaviors and Serotonin Transmission</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2020.00018</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Trace amine-associated receptors (TAARs) are a class of G-protein-coupled receptors found in mammals. While TAAR1 is expressed in several brain regions, all the other TAARs have been described mainly in the olfactory epithelium and the glomerular layer of the olfactory bulb and are believed to serve as a new class of olfactory receptors sensing innate odors. However, there is evidence that TAAR5 could play a role also in the central nervous system. In this study, we characterized a mouse line lacking TAAR5 (TAAR5 knockout, TAAR5-KO) expressing beta-galactosidase mapping TAAR5 expression. We found that TAAR5 is expressed not only in the glomerular layer in the olfactory bulb but also in deeper layers projecting to the limbic brain olfactory circuitry with prominent expression in numerous limbic brain regions, such as the anterior olfactory nucleus, the olfactory tubercle, the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), the amygdala, the hippocampus, the piriform cortex, the entorhinal cortex, the nucleus accumbens, and the thalamic and hypothalamic nuclei. TAAR5-KO mice did not show gross developmental abnormalities but demonstrated less anxiety- and depressive-like behavior in several behavioral tests. TAAR5-KO mice also showed significant decreases in the tissue levels of serotonin and its metabolite in several brain areas and were more sensitive to the hypothermic action of serotonin 5-HT1A receptor agonist 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propilamino)tetralin (8-OH-DPAT). These observations indicate that TAAR5 is not just innate odor-sensing olfactory receptor but also serves to provide olfactory input into limbic brain areas to regulate emotional behaviors likely via modulation of the serotonin system. Thus, anxiolytic and/or antidepressant action of future TAAR5 antagonists could be predicted. In general, “olfactory” TAAR-mediated brain circuitry may represent a previously unappreciated neurotransmitter system involved in the transmission of innate odors into emotional behavioral responses.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Neural Technology section | New and Recent Articles: Simulation of Closed-Loop Deep Brain Stimulation Control Schemes for Suppression of Pathological Beta Oscillations in Parkinson’s Disease</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00166</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;This study presents a computational model of closed-loop control of deep brain stimulation (DBS) for Parkinson’s disease (PD) to investigate clinically viable control schemes for suppressing pathological beta-band activity. Closed-loop DBS for PD has shown promising results in preliminary clinical studies and offers the potential to achieve better control of patient symptoms and side effects with lower power consumption than conventional open-loop DBS. However, extensive testing of algorithms in patients is difficult. The model presented provides a means to explore a range of control algorithms in silico and optimize control parameters before preclinical testing. The model incorporates (i) the extracellular DBS electric field, (ii) antidromic and orthodromic activation of STN afferent fibers, (iii) the LFP detected at non-stimulating contacts on the DBS electrode and (iv) temporal variation of network beta-band activity within the thalamo-cortico-basal ganglia loop. The performance of on-off and dual-threshold controllers for suppressing beta-band activity by modulating the DBS amplitude were first verified, showing levels of beta suppression and reductions in power consumption comparable with previous clinical studies. Proportional (P) and proportional-integral (PI) closed-loop controllers for amplitude and frequency modulation were then investigated. A simple tuning rule was derived for selecting effective PI controller parameters to target long duration beta bursts while respecting clinical constraints that limit the rate of change of stimulation parameters. Of the controllers tested, PI controllers displayed superior performance for regulating network beta-band activity whilst accounting for clinical considerations. Proportional controllers resulted in undesirable rapid fluctuations of the DBS parameters which may exceed clinically tolerable rate limits. Overall, the PI controller for modulating DBS frequency performed best, reducing the mean error by 83% compared to DBS off and the mean power consumed to 25% of that utilized by open-loop DBS. The network model presented captures sufficient physiological detail to act as a surrogate for preclinical testing of closed-loop DBS algorithms using a clinically accessible biomarker, providing a first step for deriving and testing novel, clinically suitable closed-loop DBS controllers.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Neurodegeneration section | New and Recent Articles: Altered Large-Scale Brain Functional Connectivity in Ocular Hypertension</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00146</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;We hypothesized that assessment of brain connectivity may shed light on the underpinnings of ocular hypertension (OHT), characterized by raised intraocular pressure (IOP) and no typical glaucomatous findings. OHT carries a risk for future glaucoma development, thus representing a model of presymptomatic condition. In previous studies on glaucoma, we showed altered brain connectivity since the early stage and in case of normal IOP. In this pilot study, we used a multimodal MRI approach by modeling voxelwise measures of gray matter volume, anatomical connectivity along white matter(WM) tracts, and large-scale functional connectivity in OHT subjects (n = 18, age: 58.3 ± 9.8 years) and demographically matched normal controls (n = 29). While OHT brain had no structural alterations, it showed significantly decreased functional connectivity in key cognitive networks [default mode network, frontoparietal working memory network (WMN), ventral attention network (VAN), and salience network (SN)] and altered long-range functional connectivity, which was decreased between default mode and SNs and increased between primary and secondary visual networks (VN). Overall, such findings seem to delineate a complex neuroplasticity in the OHT brain, where decreased functional connectivity in non-visual networks may reflect a type of temporarily downregulated functional reserve while increased functional connectivity between VN may be viewed as a very early attempt of adaptive functional reorganization of the visual system.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Neurodegeneration section | New and Recent Articles: Neurodegeneration-Associated Proteins in Human Olfactory Neurons Collected by Nasal Brushing</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00145</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The olfactory neuroepithelium is located in the upper vault of the nasal cavity, lying on the olfactory cleft and projecting into the dorsal portion of the superior and middle turbinates beyond the mid-portion of the nasal septum. It is composed of a variety of cell types including olfactory sensory neurons, supporting glial-like cells, microvillar cells, and basal stem cells. The cells of the neuroepithelium are often intermingled with respiratory and metaplastic epithelial cells. Olfactory neurons undergo a constant self-renewal in the timespan of 2–3 months; they are directly exposed to the external environment, and thus they are vulnerable to physical and chemical injuries. The latter might induce metabolic perturbations and ultimately be the cause of cell death. However, the lifespan of olfactory neurons is biologically programmed, and for this reason, these cells have an accelerated metabolic cycle leading to an irreversible apoptosis. These characteristics make these cells suitable for research related to nerve cell degeneration and aging. Recent studies have shown that a non-invasive and painless olfactory brushing procedure allows an efficient sampling from the olfactory neuroepithelium. This approach allows to detect the pathologic prion protein in patients with sporadic Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease, using the real-time quaking-induced conversion assay. Investigating the expression of all the proteins associated to neurodegeneration in the cells of the olfactory mucosa is a novel approach toward understanding the pathogenesis of human neurodegenerative diseases. Our aim was to investigate the expression of α-synuclein, β-amyloid, tau, and TDP-43 in the olfactory neurons of normal subjects. We showed that these proteins that are involved in neurodegenerative diseases are expressed in olfactory neurons. These findings raise the question on whether a relationship exists between the mechanisms of protein aggregation that occur in the olfactory bulb during the early stage of the neurodegenerative process and the protein misfolding occurring in the olfactory neuroepithelium.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: A Population Model of Deep Brain Stimulation in Movement Disorders From Circuits to Cells</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00055</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;For more than 30 years, deep brain stimulation (DBS) has been used to target the symptoms of a number of neurological disorders and in particular movement disorders such as Parkinson’s disease (PD) and essential tremor (ET). It is known that the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra leads to PD, while the exact impact of this on the brain dynamics is not fully understood, the presence of beta-band oscillatory activity is thought to be pathological. The cause of ET, however, remains uncertain, however pathological oscillations in the thalamocortical-cerebellar network have been linked to tremor. Both of these movement disorders are treated with DBS, which entails the surgical implantation of electrodes into a patient’s brain. While DBS leads to an improvement in symptoms for many patients, the mechanisms underlying this improvement is not clearly understood, and computational modeling has been used extensively to improve this. Many of the models used to study DBS and its effect on the human brain have mainly utilized single neuron and single axon biophysical models. We have previously shown in separate models however, that the use of population models can shed much light on the mechanisms of the underlying pathological neural activity in PD and ET in turn, and on the mechanisms underlying DBS. Together, this work suggested that the dynamics of the cerebellar-basal ganglia thalamocortical network support oscillations at frequency range relevant to movement disorders. Here, we propose a new combined model of this network and present new results that demonstrate that both Parkinsonian oscillations in the beta band and oscillations in the tremor frequency range arise from the dynamics of such a network. We find regions in the parameter space demonstrating the different dynamics and go on to examine the transition from one oscillatory regime to another as well as the impact of DBS on these different types of pathological activity. This work will allow us to better understand the changes in brain activity induced by DBS, and allow us to optimize this clinical therapy, particularly in terms of target selection and parameter setting.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00026</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;While an increasing number of behavioral studies suggest the importance of statistical learning in acquiring orthographic regularity across writing systems, no direct neural evidence supports this claim. The present study used event-related potentials (ERPs) to investigate the time course and the neural correlate of statistical learning of positional consistency in Chinese orthography. Visual ERPs were recorded, while Chinese adults performed an orthographic statistical learning task involving artificial characters varying in high, moderate, and low levels of positional consistency. The negative ERP deflection at the N1 time window, typically linked with orthographic regularity processing, was found in orthographic statistical learning with the low and moderate consistencies eliciting larger neural responses than the high consistency in the time window of 150–210 ms over occipital–temporal brain areas. These results suggest that orthographic statistical learning begins within the first 210 ms and that the N1 might be its neural indicator.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00048</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Adult reading tests (ART) have been widely used in both research and clinical settings as a measure of premorbid cognitive abilities or cognitive reserve. However, the neural substrates underlying ART performance are largely unknown. Furthermore, it has not yet been examined whether the neural substrates of ART performance reflect the cortical regions associated with premorbid intelligence or cognitive reserve. The aim of the study is to identify the functional neural correlates of ART performance using 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) imaging in the cognitively normal (CN) middle- and old-aged adults. Voxel-wise analyses revealed positive correlations between glucose metabolism and ART performance in the frontal and primary somatosensory regions, more specifically the lateral frontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex and postcentral gyrus (PCG). When conducted again only for amyloid-β (Aβ)-negative individuals, the voxel-wise analysis showed significant correlations in broader areas of the frontal and primary somatosensory regions. This is the first neuroimaging study to directly demonstrate the cerebral resting-state glucose utilization associated with ART performance. Our findings provide important evidence at the neural level that ART predicts premorbid general intelligence and cognitive reserve, as brain areas that showed significant correlations with ART performance correspond to regions that have been associated with general intelligence and cognitive reserve.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Striated myocyte structural integrity: Automated analysis of sarcomeric z-discs</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/PYC0H622dkY/article</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Tessa Altair Morris, Jasmine Naik, Kirby Sinclair Fibben, Xiangduo Kong, Tohru Kiyono, Kyoko Yokomori, Anna Grosberg&lt;/p&gt;

As sarcomeres produce the force necessary for contraction, assessment of sarcomere order is paramount in evaluation of cardiac and skeletal myocytes. The uniaxial force produced by sarcomeres is ideally perpendicular to their z-lines, which couple parallel myofibrils and give cardiac and skeletal myocytes their distinct striated appearance. Accordingly, sarcomere structure is often evaluated by staining for z-line proteins such as &lt;i&gt;α&lt;/i&gt;-actinin. However, due to limitations of current analysis methods, which require manual or semi-manual handling of images, the mechanism by which sarcomere and by extension z-line architecture can impact contraction and which characteristics of z-line architecture should be used to assess striated myocytes has not been fully explored. Challenges such as isolating z-lines from regions of off-target staining that occur along immature stress fibers and cell boundaries and choosing metrics to summarize overall z-line architecture have gone largely unaddressed in previous work. While an expert can qualitatively appraise tissues, these challenges leave researchers without robust, repeatable tools to assess z-line architecture across different labs and experiments. Additionally, the criteria used by experts to evaluate sarcomeric architecture have not been well-defined. We address these challenges by providing metrics that summarize different aspects of z-line architecture that correspond to expert tissue quality assessment and demonstrate their efficacy through an examination of engineered tissues and single cells. In doing so, we have elucidated a mechanism by which highly elongated cardiomyocytes become inefficient at producing force. Unlike previous manual or semi-manual methods, characterization of z-line architecture using the metrics discussed and implemented in this work can quantitatively evaluate engineered tissues and contribute to a robust understanding of the development and mechanics of striated muscles.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/PYC0H622dkY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Insufficient sleep has been considered a seizure trigger in people with epilepsy for thousands of years. Here, we reviewed the evidence upon which this axiomatic association might be predicated. After evaluating evidence suggesting insufficient sleep as an EEG activator, we systematically reviewed the literature for longitudinal studies measuring the effect of insufficient sleep on seizure risk. Ultimately, published works designed to prove a causal relationship were of low level of evidence and disagreed with one another. Despite the idea's deep‐seated nature, when considering causal evidence only, no conclusion can be made regarding the relationship between insufficient sleep and seizure risk.&lt;/p&gt;

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Ensemble classifiers have been proven to result in better classification accuracy than that of a single strong learner in many machine learning studies. Although many studies on electroencephalography-brain-computer interface (BCI) used ensemble classifiers to enhance the BCI performance, ensemble classifiers have hardly been employed for near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS)-BCIs. In addition, since there has not been any systematic and comparative study, the efficacy of ensemble classifiers for NIRS-BCIs remains unknown. In this study, four NIRS-BCI datasets were employed to evaluate the efficacy of linear discriminant analysis ensemble classifiers based on the bootstrap aggregating. From the analysis results, significant (or marginally significant) increases in the bitrate as well as the classification accuracy were found for all four NIRS-BCI datasets employed in this study. Moreover, significant bitrate improvements were found in two of the four datasets.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Neurodegeneration section | New and Recent Articles: Uric Acid as a Potential Peripheral Biomarker for Disease Features in Huntington’s Patients</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00073</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Oxidative stress has long been implicated in the pathophysiology and progression of Huntington’s disease (HD). Uric acid (UA) is a naturally occurring antioxidant that is present in the brain and periphery. Growing evidence has implicated UA as a molecular biomarker for several neurodegenerative diseases, most notably Parkinson’s disease (PD). In this study, we investigated UA levels in clinical samples from HD patients and normal controls (NCs) and assessed potential relationships between UA levels and disease and clinical data. UA levels were measured in plasma (n = 107) and saliva (n = 178) samples from premanifest (pre-HD) and manifest HD patients and control subjects. Gender effects of UA levels were observed in both biofluids, with male patients showing higher UA levels compared to female patients. Comparisons of UA levels across diagnostic groups, separated by gender, revealed that both plasma and salivary UA levels were significantly lower in female pre-HD and manifest HD patients compared to NCs. Salivary levels of UA were also significantly lower in male manifest HD patients versus controls, but not in plasma. Correlations of peripheral UA levels to clinical data also showed differences according to gender. In male HD patients, both plasma and salivary UA levels were significantly negatively correlated with total functional capacity (TFC), while positive correlations were observed with total motor score (TMS). Female HD patients showed a significant positive correlation between plasma UA levels and TMS, while salivary UA levels from female patients were significantly correlated to disease burden. Finally, in a separate cohort, we show that UA levels are decreased in postmortem prefrontal cortical samples (n = 20) from HD subjects compared to matched controls. These findings suggest that decreased levels of UA in the brains of HD patients can be reflected in peripheral fluids, with salivary measures of UA particularly offering significant promise as a potentially relevant, non-invasive biomarker of disease symptoms and burden. Our findings further highlight the impact of sexual dimorphism in HD pathophysiology.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Mosaic analysis provides a means to probe developmental processes in situ by generating loss-of-function mutants within otherwise wildtype tissues. Combining these techniques with quantitative microscopy enables researchers to rigorously compare RNA or protein expression across the resultant clones. However, visual inspection of mosaic tissues remains common in the literature because quantification demands considerable labor and computational expertise. Practitioners must segment cell membranes or cell nuclei from a tissue and annotate the clones before their data are suitable for analysis. Here, we introduce Fly-QMA, a computational framework that automates each of these tasks for confocal microscopy images of &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; imaginal discs. The framework includes an unsupervised annotation algorithm that incorporates spatial context to inform the genetic identity of each cell. We use a combination of real and synthetic validation data to survey the performance of the annotation algorithm across a broad range of conditions. By contributing our framework to the open-source software ecosystem, we aim to contribute to the current move toward automated quantitative analysis among developmental biologists.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/37vL7SeJQL0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Origins of Functional Organization in the Visual Cortex</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2020.00010</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;How are the complex maps for orientation selectivity (OS) created in the primary visual cortex (V1)? Rodents and rabbits have a random distribution of OS preferences across V1 while in cats, ferrets, and all primates cells with similar OS preferences cluster together into relatively wide cortical columns. Given other clear similarities in the organization of the visual pathways, why is it that maps coding OS preferences are so radically different? Prominent models have been created of cortical OS mapping that incorporate Hebbian plasticity, intracortical interactions, and the properties of growing axons. However, these models suggest that the maps arise primarily through intracortical interactions. Here we focus on several other features of the visual system and brain that may influence V1 structure. These are: eye divergence, the total number of cells in V1, the thalamocortical networks, the topography of the retina and phylogeny. We outline the evidence for and against these factors contributing to map formation. One promising theory is that the central-to-peripheral ratio (CP ratio) of retinal cell density can be used to predict whether or not a species has pinwheel maps. Animals with high CP ratios (&amp;gt;7) have orientation columns while those with low CP ratios (&amp;lt;4) have random OS maps. The CP ratio is related to the total number of cells in cortex, which also appears to be a reasonable contributing factor. However, while these factors correlate with map structure to some extent, there is a gray area where certain species do not fit elegantly into the theory. A problem with the existing literature is that OS maps have been investigated in only a small number of mammals, from a small fraction of the mammalian phylogenetic tree. We suggest four species (agouti, fruit bat, sheep, and wallaby) that have a range of interesting characteristics, which sit at intermediate locations between primates and rodents, that make them good targets for filling in the missing gaps in the literature. We make predictions about the map structures of these species based on the organization of their brains and visual systems and, in doing so, set possible paths for future research.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2020.00009</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The propensity to engage in risky behaviors including excessive alcohol consumption may impose increased medical, emotional, and psychosocial burdens. Personality and behavioral traits of individuals may contribute in part to the involvement in risky behaviors, and therefore the classification of one’s traits may help identify those who are at risk for future onset of the addictive disorder and related behavioral issues such as alcohol misuse. Personality and behavioral characteristics including impulsivity, anger, reward sensitivity, and avoidance were assessed in a large sample of healthy young adults (n = 475). Participants also underwent diffusion tensor imaging for the analysis of structural brain networks. A data-driven clustering using personality and behavioral traits of the participants identified four subtypes. As compared with individuals clustered into the neutral type, individuals with a high level of impulsivity (A subtype) and those with high levels of reward sensitivity, impulsivity, anger, and avoidance (B subtype) showed significant associations with problem drinking. In contrast, individuals with high levels of impulsivity, anger, and avoidance but not reward sensitivity (C subtype) showed a pattern of social drinking that was similar to those of the neutral subtype. Furthermore, logistic regression analysis with ridge estimators was applied to demonstrate the neurobiological relevance for the identified subtypes according to distinct patterns of structural brain connectivity within the addiction circuitry [neutral vs. A subtype, the area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUC) = 0.74, 95% CI = 0.67–0.81; neutral vs. B subtype, AUC = 0.74, 95% CI = 0.66–0.82; neutral vs. C subtype, AUC = 0.77, 95% CI = 0.70–0.84]. The current findings enable the characterization of individuals according to subtypes based on personality and behavioral traits that are also corroborated by neuroimaging data and may provide a platform to better predict individual risks for addictive disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Neurodegeneration section | New and Recent Articles: Platelets in Amyloidogenic Mice Are Activated and Invade the Brain</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00129</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease with a complex and not fully understood pathogenesis. Besides brain-intrinsic hallmarks such as abnormal deposition of harmful proteins, i.e., amyloid beta in plaques and hyperphosphorylated Tau in neurofibrillary tangles, blood-derived elements, in particular, platelets have been discussed to be involved in AD pathogenesis. The underlying mechanisms, however, are rather unexplored. Here, we investigate a potential role of platelets in an AD transgenic animal model with severe amyloid plaque formation, the APP-PS1 transgenic mice, and analyzed the presence, spatial location and activation status of platelets within the brain. In APP-PS1 mice, a higher number of platelets were located within the brain parenchyma, i.e., outside the cerebral blood vessels compared to WT controls. Such platelets were activated according to the expression of the platelet activation marker CD62P and to morphological hallmarks such as membrane protrusions. In the brain, platelets were in close contact exclusively with astrocytes suggesting an interaction between these two cell types. In the bloodstream, although the percentage of activated platelets did not differ between transgenic and age-matched control animals, APP-PS1 blood-derived platelets showed remarkable ultrastructural peculiarities in platelet-specific organelles such as the open canalicular system (OCS). This work urges for further investigations on platelets and their yet unknown functional roles in the brain, which might go beyond AD pathogenesis and be relevant for various age-related neurodegenerative diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Eye Movements During RAN as an Operationalization of the RAN-Reading “Microcosm”</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00067</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Rapid Automatized Naming (RAN) is a strong predictor of reading aloud, though there is little agreement on what underpins RAN or how it relates to reading. Some theorize phonological skills, while others suggest that RAN reflects the “microcosm” of cognitive and attentional processes also required for reading, with more recent research using eye movements in an attempt to study this relationship. In the current study, we aimed to extend previous investigations to identify whether the temporal patterns of eye movements predict RAN and can, therefore, be established as a method to study the cognitive processes underlying RAN that could then be utilized to elucidate the relationship of RAN to reading. A Gazepoint eye tracker was used to record the eye movements of 93 learner readers aged 5–8 years (M age = 7.00) while performing a custom computerized alphabetic RAN task. Text reading accuracy, comprehension and rate; nonverbal intelligence; and phonological awareness abilities were also assessed. Regression analyses showed that, independently of phonological awareness, eye movements [Fixation Count (FC) and Fixation Duration (FD)] measured during RAN tasks were highly reflective of children’s rapid naming performance (92.8%). Both mean FC and mean FD during RAN tasks also predicted text reading accuracy (36.3%), comprehension (31.6%), and rate (36.2%) scores, and in predicting these text reading skills there was a high level of shared variance with RAN performance. In a sub-sample of participants, longer average FDs and counts independently discriminated children with reading difficulties (n = 18; aged 7–9) from neurotypical children matched for age (n = 18), but not from younger neurotypical children matched for reading level (n = 18; aged 5–6). Together, these results suggest that the analysis of eye movements recorded during RAN allows for the operationalization of many of the spatially and temporally-bound cognitive and attentional processes that underpin the RAN, and a step towards elucidating its relationship to reading.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Repeated Application of Transcranial Diagnostic Ultrasound Towards the Visual Cortex Induced Illusory Visual Percepts in Healthy Participants</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00066</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) of the visual cortex can induce phosphenes as participants look at a visual target. So can non-diagnostic ultrasound (nDU), delivered in a transcranial fashion, while participants have closed their eyes during stimulation. Here, we sought to determine if DU, aimed at the visual cortex, could alter the perception of a visual target. We applied a randomized series of actual or sham DU, transcranially and towards the visual cortex of healthy participants while they stared at a visual target (a white crosshair on a light-blue background), with the ultrasound device placed where TMS elicited phosphenes. These participants observed percepts seven out of ten times, which consisted of extra or extensions of lines relative to the original crosshair, and additional colors, an average of 53.7 ± 2.6% of the time over the course of the experiment. Seven out of ten different participants exposed to sham-only DU observed comparable percepts, but only an average of 36.3 ± 1.9% of the time, a statistically significant difference (p &amp;lt; 0.00001). Moreover, on average, participants exposed to a combination of sham and actual ultrasound reported a net increase of 47.9 percentage points in the likelihood that they would report a percept by the end of the experiment. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that a random combination of sham-only and actual DU, applied directly over the visual cortex of participants, increased the likelihood that they would observe visual effects, but not the type of effects, with that likelihood increasing over the course of the experiment. From this, we conclude that repeated exposures by DU may make the visual cortex more responsive to stimulation of their visual cortex by the visual target itself. Future studies should identify the biophysical mechanism(s) and neural pathways by which DU, in our hands and others, can generate its observed effects on brain function. These observations, consistent with other’s observation of effects of DU stimulation of the human motor cortex and amygdala, as well as the FDA approved nature of DU, may lead to increased use of DU as a means of altering brain function.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Age-Dependent Asymmetry of Wrist Position Sense Is Not Influenced by Stochastic Tactile Stimulation</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00065</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Stochastic stimulation has been shown to improve movement, balance, the sense of touch, and may also improve position sense. This stimulation can be non-invasive and may be a simple technology to enhance proprioception. In this study, we investigated whether sub-threshold stochastic tactile stimulation of mechanoreceptors reduces age-related errors in wrist position estimation. Fifteen young (24.5±1.5y) and 23 elderly (71.7±7.3y) unimpaired, right-handed adults completed a wrist position gauge-matching experiment. In each trial, the participant's concealed wrist was moved to a target position between 10 and 30° of wrist flexion or extension by a robotic manipulandum. The participant then estimated the wrist's position on a virtual gauge. During half of the trials, sub-threshold stochastic tactile stimulation was applied to the wrist muscle tendon areas. Stochastic stimulation did not significantly influence wrist position sense. In the elderly group, estimation errors decreased non-significantly when stimulation was applied compared to the trials without stimulation [mean constant error reduction Δμ(θconof)=0.8° in flexion and Δμ(θconoe)=0.7° in extension direction, p = 0.95]. This effect was less pronounced in the young group [Δμ(θcony)=0.2° in flexion and in extension direction, p = 0.99]. These improvements did not yield a relevant effect size (Cohen's d &amp;lt; 0.1). Estimation errors increased with target angle magnitude in both movement directions. In young participants, estimation errors were non-symmetric, with estimations in flexion [μ(θconyf)=1.8°, σ(θconyf)=7.0°] being significantly more accurate than in extension [μ(θconye)=8.3°, σ(θconye)=9.3°, p &amp;lt; 0.01]. This asymmetry was not present in the elderly group, where estimations in flexion [μ(θconof)=7.5°, σ(θconof)=9.8°] were similar to extension [μ(θconoe)=7.7°, σ(θconoe)=9.3°]. Hence, young and elderly participants performed equally in extension direction, whereas wrist position sense in flexion direction deteriorated with age (p &amp;lt; 0.01). Though unimpaired elderly adults did not benefit from stochastic stimulation, it cannot be deduced that individuals with more severe impairments of their sensory system do not profit from this treatment. While the errors in estimating wrist position are symmetric in flexion and extension in elderly adults, young adults are more accurate when estimating wrist flexion, an effect that has not been described before.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Developmental Differences in Cortical Activation During Action Observation, Action Execution and Interpersonal Synchrony: An fNIRS Study</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00057</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Interpersonal synchrony (IPS) is an important everyday behavior influencing social cognitive development; however, few studies have investigated the developmental differences and underlying neural mechanisms of IPS. functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) is a novel neuroimaging tool that allows the study of cortical activation in the presence of natural movements. Using fNIRS, we compared cortical activation patterns between children and adults during action observation, execution, and IPS. Seventeen school-age children and 15 adults completed a reach to cleanup task while we obtained cortical activation data from bilateral inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), superior temporal sulcus (STS), and inferior parietal lobes (IPL). Children showed lower spatial and temporal accuracy during IPS compared to adults (i.e., spatial synchrony scores (Mean ± SE) in children: 2.67 ± 0.08 and adults: 2.85 ± 0.06; temporal synchrony scores (Mean ± SE) in children: 2.74 ± 0.06 and adults: 2.88 ± 0.05). For both groups, the STS regions were more activated during action observation, while the IFG and STS were more activated during action execution and IPS. The IPS condition involved more right-sided activation compared to action execution suggesting that IPS is a higher-order process involving more bilateral cortical activation. In addition, adults showed more left lateralization compared to the children during movement conditions (execution and IPS); which indicated greater inhibition of ipsilateral cortices in the adults compared to children. These findings provide a neuroimaging framework to study imitation and IPS impairments in special populations such as children with Autism Spectrum Disorder.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00044</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Intracranial electroencephalography (IEEG) involves recording from electrodes placed directly onto the cortical surface or deep brain locations. It is performed on patients with medically refractory epilepsy, undergoing pre-surgical seizure localization. IEEG recordings, combined with advancements in computational capacity and analysis tools, have accelerated cognitive neuroscience. This Perspective describes a potential pitfall latent in many of these recordings by virtue of the subject population—namely interictal epileptiform discharges (IEDs), which can cause spurious results due to the contamination of normal neurophysiological signals by pathological waveforms related to epilepsy. We first discuss the nature of IED hazards, and why they deserve the attention of neurophysiology researchers. We then describe four general strategies used when handling IEDs (manual identification, automated identification, manual-automated hybrids, and ignoring by leaving them in the data), and discuss their pros, cons, and contextual factors. Finally, we describe current practices of human neurophysiology researchers worldwide based on a cross-sectional literature review and a voluntary survey. We put these results in the context of the listed strategies and make suggestions on improving awareness and clarity of reporting to enrich both data quality and communication in the field.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Neuronal Degeneration Impairs Rhythms Between Connected Microcircuits</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2020.00018</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Synchronization of neural activity across brain regions is critical to processes that include perception, learning, and memory. After traumatic brain injury (TBI), neuronal degeneration is one possible effect and can alter communication between neural circuits. Consequently, synchronization between neurons may change and can contribute to both lasting changes in functional brain networks and cognitive impairment in patients. However, fundamental principles relating exactly how TBI at the cellular scale affects synchronization of mesoscale circuits are not well understood. In this work, we use computational networks of Izhikevich integrate-and-fire neurons to study synchronized, oscillatory activity between clusters of neurons, which also adapt according to spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP). We study how the connections within and between these neuronal clusters change as unidirectional connections form between the two neuronal populations. In turn, we examine how neuronal deletion, intended to mimic the temporary or permanent loss of neurons in the mesoscale circuit, affects these dynamics. We determine synchronization of two neuronal circuits requires very modest connectivity between these populations; approximately 10% of neurons projecting from one circuit to another circuit will result in high synchronization. In addition, we find that synchronization level inversely affects the strength of connection between neuronal microcircuits – moderately synchronized microcircuits develop stronger intercluster connections than do highly synchronized circuits. Finally, we find that highly synchronized circuits are largely protected against the effects of neuronal deletion but may display changes in frequency properties across circuits with targeted neuronal loss. Together, our results suggest that strongly and weakly connected regions differ in their inherent resilience to damage and may serve different roles in a larger network.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: BrainOS: A Novel Artificial Brain-Alike Automatic Machine Learning Framework</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2020.00016</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Human intelligence is constituted by a multitude of cognitive functions activated either directly or indirectly by external stimuli of various kinds. Computational approaches to the cognitive sciences and to neuroscience are partly premised on the idea that computational simulations of such cognitive functions and brain operations suspected to correspond to them can help to further uncover knowledge about those functions and operations, specifically, how they might work together. These approaches are also partly premised on the idea that empirical neuroscience research, whether following on from such a simulation (as indeed simulation and empirical research are complementary) or otherwise, could help us build better artificially intelligent systems. This is based on the assumption that principles by which the brain seemingly operate, to the extent that it can be understood as computational, should at least be tested as principles for the operation of artificial systems. This paper explores some of the principles of the brain that seem to be responsible for its autonomous, problem-adaptive nature. The brain operating system (BrainOS) explicated here is an introduction to ongoing work aiming to create a robust, integrated model, combining the connectionist paradigm underlying neural networks and the symbolic paradigm underlying much else of AI. BrainOS is an automatic approach that selects the most appropriate model based on the (a) input at hand, (b) prior experience (a history of results of prior problem solving attempts), and (c) world knowledge (represented in the symbolic way and used as a means to explain its approach). It is able to accept diverse and mixed input data types, process histories and objectives, extract knowledge and infer a situational context. BrainOS is designed to be efficient through its ability to not only choose the most suitable learning model but to effectively calibrate it based on the task at hand.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Myelination Increases the Spatial Extent of Analog-Digital Modulation of Synaptic Transmission: A Modeling Study</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00040</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Analog-digital facilitations (ADFs) have been described in local excitatory brain circuits and correspond to a class of phenomena describing how subthreshold variations of the presynaptic membrane potential influence spike-evoked synaptic transmission. In many brain circuits, ADFs rely on the propagation of somatic membrane potential fluctuations to the presynaptic bouton where they modulate ion channels availability, inducing modifications of the presynaptic spike waveform, the spike-evoked Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; entry, and the transmitter release. Therefore, one major requirement for ADFs to occur is the propagation of subthreshold membrane potential variations from the soma to the presynaptic bouton. To date, reported ADFs space constants are relatively short (250–500 μm) which limits their action to proximal synapses. However, ADFs have been studied either in unmyelinated axons or in juvenile animals in which myelination is incomplete. We examined here the potential gain of ADFs spatial extent caused by myelination using a realistic model of L5 pyramidal cell. Myelination of the axon was found to induce a 3-fold increase in the axonal length constant. As a result, the different forms of ADF were found to display a much longer spatial extent (up to 3,000 μm). In addition, while the internodal length displayed a mild effect, the number of myelin wraps ensheathing the internodes was found to play a critical role in the ADFs spatial extents. We conclude that axonal myelination induces an increase in ADFs spatial extent in our model, thus making ADFs plausible in long-distance connections.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Direct coupling analysis of epistasis in allosteric materials</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/O_qve59Df_g/article</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Barbara Bravi, Riccardo Ravasio, Carolina Brito, Matthieu Wyart&lt;/p&gt;

In allosteric proteins, the binding of a ligand modifies function at a distant active site. Such allosteric pathways can be used as target for drug design, generating considerable interest in inferring them from sequence alignment data. Currently, different methods lead to conflicting results, in particular on the existence of long-range evolutionary couplings between distant amino-acids mediating allostery. Here we propose a resolution of this conundrum, by studying epistasis and its inference in models where an allosteric material is evolved &lt;i&gt;in silico&lt;/i&gt; to perform a mechanical task. We find in our model the four types of epistasis (Synergistic, Sign, Antagonistic, Saturation), which can be both short or long-range and have a simple mechanical interpretation. We perform a Direct Coupling Analysis (DCA) and find that DCA predicts well the cost of point mutations but is a rather poor generative model. Strikingly, it can predict short-range epistasis but fails to capture long-range epistasis, in consistence with empirical findings. We propose that such failure is generic when function requires subparts to work in concert. We illustrate this idea with a simple model, which suggests that other methods may be better suited to capture long-range effects.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/O_qve59Df_g&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Machine learning with random subspace ensembles identifies antimicrobial resistance determinants from pan-genomes of three pathogens</title>

The evolution of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) poses a persistent threat to global public health. Sequencing efforts have already yielded genome sequences for thousands of resistant microbial isolates and require robust computational tools to systematically elucidate the genetic basis for AMR. Here, we present a generalizable machine learning workflow for identifying genetic features driving AMR based on constructing reference strain-agnostic pan-genomes and training random subspace ensembles (RSEs). This workflow was applied to the resistance profiles of 14 antimicrobials across three urgent threat pathogens encompassing 288 &lt;i&gt;Staphylococcus aureus&lt;/i&gt;, 456 &lt;i&gt;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&lt;/i&gt;, and 1588 &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; genomes. We find that feature selection by RSE detects known AMR associations more reliably than common statistical tests and previous ensemble approaches, identifying a total of 45 known AMR-conferring genes and alleles across the three organisms, as well as 25 candidate associations backed by domain-level annotations. Furthermore, we find that results from the RSE approach are consistent with existing understanding of fluoroquinolone (FQ) resistance due to mutations in the main drug targets, &lt;i&gt;gyrA&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;parC&lt;/i&gt;, in all three organisms, and suggest the mutational landscape of those genes with respect to FQ resistance is simple. As larger datasets become available, we expect this approach to more reliably predict AMR determinants for a wider range of microbial pathogens.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/xr9hwylhAMM&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

The status of the infant’s developing brain in its most vulnerable state and the impact that physiological elements of music, silences and sounds may make in the earliest stages of brain development can enhance vitality. However, little attention has been focused on the integral aspects of the music itself.

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Neural Technology section | New and Recent Articles: Latent Factor Decoding of Multi-Channel EEG for Emotion Recognition Through Autoencoder-Like Neural Networks</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00087</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Robust cross-subject emotion recognition based on multichannel EEG has always been hard work. In this work, we hypothesize that there exist default brain variables across subjects in emotional processes. Hence, the states of the latent variables that relate to emotional processing must contribute to building robust recognition models. Specifically, we propose to utilize an unsupervised deep generative model (e.g., variational autoencoder) to determine the latent factors from the multichannel EEG. Through a sequence modeling method, we examine the emotion recognition performance based on the learnt latent factors. The performance of the proposed methodology is verified on two public datasets (DEAP and SEED) and compared with traditional matrix factorization-based (ICA) and autoencoder-based approaches. Experimental results demonstrate that autoencoder-like neural networks are suitable for unsupervised EEG modeling, and our proposed emotion recognition framework achieves an inspiring performance. As far as we know, it is the first work that introduces variational autoencoder into multichannel EEG decoding for emotion recognition. We think the approach proposed in this work is not only feasible in emotion recognition but also promising in diagnosing depression, Alzheimer's disease, mild cognitive impairment, etc., whose specific latent processes may be altered or aberrant compared with the normal healthy control.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Many in the neuroscience community were surprised and saddened to learn of Bruce McEwen’s sudden passing on January 2, 2020 after a brief illness. Several of us had interacted with Bruce recently, read his recent publications, and saw no signs of his enthusiasm for science or productivity waning despite being close to his 82nd birthday. Given that Bruce had a larger-than-life capacity for generating, storing, and integrating scientific knowledge, and a seemingly never-failing enthusiasm for stress neurobiology and neuroendocrinology in general, it seemed as though he would live forever.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25709?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The identification of sensitive biomarkers is essential to validate therapeutics for Huntington's disease (HD). We directly compare structural imaging markers across the largest collective imaging HD dataset, to identify a set of imaging markers robust to multi‐centre variation and to derive upper estimates on sample sizes for clinical trials in HD.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We used one post‐processing pipeline to retrospectively analyse T1‐weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans from 624 participants at three time points, from the PREDICT‐HD, TRACK‐HD and IMAGE‐HD studies. We used mixed effects models to adjust regional brain volumes for covariates, calculate effect sizes, and simulate possible treatment effects in disease‐affected anatomical regions. We used our model to estimate the statistical power of possible treatment effects for anatomical regions and clinical markers.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We identify a set of common anatomical regions that have similarly large standardised effect sizes (&amp;gt;0.5) between healthy control and pre‐manifest (PreHD) groups. These include: sub‐cortical, white matter, and cortical regions, and non‐ventricular cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). We also observe a consistent spatial distribution of effect size by region across the whole brain. We find that multi‐centre studies are necessary to capture treatment effect variance; that for a 20% treatment effect, power &amp;gt; 80% is achieved for the caudate (N=661), pallidum (N=687), and non‐ventricular CSF (N=939); and, crucially, that these imaging markers provide greater power than standard clinical markers.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our findings provide the first cross‐study validation of structural imaging markers in HD, supporting the use of these measurements as endpoints for both observational studies and clinical trials.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Frontiers in Synaptic Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Electroencephalographic Functional Connectivity With the Tacit Learning System Prosthetic Hand: A Case Series Using Motor Imagery</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsyn.2020.00007</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;We previously created a prosthetic hand with a tacit learning system (TLS) that automatically supports the control of forearm pronosupination. This myoelectric prosthetic hand enables sensory feedback and flexible motor output, which allows users to move efficiently with minimal burden. In this study, we investigated whether electroencephalography can be used to analyze the influence of the auxiliary function of the TLS on brain function. Three male participants who had sustained below-elbow amputations and were myoelectric prosthesis users performed a series of physical movement trials with the TLS inactivated and activated. Trials were video recorded and a sequence of videos was prepared to represent each individual’s own use while the system was inactivated and activated. In a subsequent motor imagery phase during which electroencephalography (EEG) signals were collected, each participant was asked to watch both videos of themself while actively imagining the physical movement depicted. Differences in mean cortical current and amplitude envelope correlation (AEC) values between supplementary motor areas (SMA) and each vertex were calculated. For all participants, there were differences in the mean cortical current generated by the motor imagery tasks when the TLS inactivated and activated conditions were compared. The AEC values were higher during the movement imagery task with TLS activation, although their distribution on the cortex varied between the three individuals. In both S1 and other brain areas, AEC values increased in conditions with the TLS activated. Evidence from this case series indicates that, in addition to motor control, TLS may change sensory stimulus recognition.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Probing Cortical Activity During Head-Fixed Behavior</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2020.00030</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The cortex is crucial for many behaviors, ranging from sensory-based behaviors to working memory and social behaviors. To gain an in-depth understanding of the contribution to these behaviors, cellular and sub-cellular recordings from both individual and populations of cortical neurons are vital. However, techniques allowing such recordings, such as two-photon imaging and whole-cell electrophysiology, require absolute stability of the head, a requirement not often fulfilled in freely moving animals. Here, we review and compare behavioral paradigms that have been developed and adapted for the head-fixed preparation, which together offer the needed stability for live recordings of neural activity in behaving animals. We also review how the head-fixed preparation has been used to explore the function of primary sensory cortices, posterior parietal cortex (PPC) and anterior lateral motor (ALM) cortex in sensory-based behavioral tasks, while also discussing the considerations of performing such recordings. Overall, this review highlights the head-fixed preparation as allowing in-depth investigation into the neural activity underlying behaviors by providing highly controllable settings for precise stimuli presentation which can be combined with behavioral paradigms ranging from simple sensory detection tasks to complex, cross-modal, memory-guided decision-making tasks.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2020.00026</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Since the discovery of TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) in 1995, our understanding of its role continues to expand as research progresses. In particular, its role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) has drawn increasing interest in recent years. TDP-43 may participate in various pathogenic mechanisms underlying AD, such as amyloid β deposition, tau hyperphosphorylation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and neuroinflammation. Because AD is complex and heterogeneous, and because of the distinct characteristics of TDP-43, mostly seen in the oldest-old and those with more severe clinical phenotype, subcategorization based on specific features or biomarkers may significantly improve diagnosis and treatment. AD-like cognitive dysfunction associated with TDP-43 pathology may therefore be a distinct encephalopathy, referred to as limbic-predominant age-related TDP-43 encephalopathy (LATE).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Brain Imaging Methods section | New and Recent Articles: Low-Density EEG for Neural Activity Reconstruction Using Multivariate Empirical Mode Decomposition</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00175</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Several approaches can be used to estimate neural activity. The main differences between them concern the a priori information used and its sensitivity to high noise levels. Empirical mode decomposition (EMD) has been recently applied to electroencephalography EEG-based neural activity reconstruction to provide a priori time-frequency information to improve the estimation of neural activity. EMD has the specific ability to identify independent oscillatory modes in non-stationary signals with multiple oscillatory components. However, attempts to use EMD in EEG analysis have not yet provided optimal reconstructions, due to the intrinsic mode-mixing problem of EMD. Several studies have used single-channel analysis, whereas others have used multiple-channel analysis for other applications. Here, we present the results of multiple-channel analysis using multivariate empirical mode decomposition (MEMD) to reduce the mode-mixing problem and provide useful a priori time-frequency information for the reconstruction of neuronal activity using several low-density EEG electrode montages. The methods were evaluated using real and synthetic EEG data, in which the reconstructions were performed using the multiple sparse priors (MSP) algorithm with EEG electrode montages of 32, 16, and 8 electrodes. The quality of the source reconstruction was assessed using the Wasserstein metric. A comparison of the solutions without pre-processing and those after applying MEMD showed the source reconstructions to be improved using MEMD as a priori information for the low-density montages of 8 and 16 electrodes. The mean source reconstruction error on a real EEG dataset was reduced by 59.42 and 66.04% for the 8 and 16 electrode montages, respectively, and that on a simulated EEG with three active sources, by 87.31 and 31.45% for the same electrode montages.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Neural Technology section | New and Recent Articles: Restoring Somatosensation: Advantages and Current Limitations of Targeting the Brainstem Dorsal Column Nuclei Complex</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00156</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Current neural prostheses can restore limb movement to tetraplegic patients by translating brain signals coding movements to control a variety of actuators. Fast and accurate somatosensory feedback is essential for normal movement, particularly dexterous tasks, but is currently lacking in motor neural prostheses. Attempts to restore somatosensory feedback have largely focused on cortical stimulation which, thus far, have succeeded in eliciting minimal naturalistic sensations. Yet, a question that deserves more attention is whether the cortex is the best place to activate the central nervous system to restore somatosensation. Here, we propose that the brainstem dorsal column nuclei are an ideal alternative target to restore somatosensation. We review some of the recent literature investigating the dorsal column nuclei functional organization and neurophysiology and highlight some of the advantages and limitations of the dorsal column nuclei as a future neural prosthetic target. Recent evidence supports the dorsal column nuclei as a potential neural prosthetic target, but also identifies several gaps in our knowledge as well as potential limitations which need to be addressed before such a goal can become reality.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Neurodegeneration section | New and Recent Articles: Abnormality of m6A mRNA Methylation Is Involved in Alzheimer’s Disease</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00098</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s disease (AD), the most common form of dementia, is highly prevalent in older adults. The main clinical feature is the progressive decline of memory function, which eventually leads to the decline of cognitive function. At present, the pathogenesis of AD is unclear. In the disease process, synaptic changes are the key. Recent studies have shown that the dysregulation of RNA methylation is related to many biological processes, including neurodevelopment and neurodegenerative diseases. N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is the most abundant modification in eukaryotic RNA. In this study, RNA m6A methylation was quantified in APP/PS1 transgenic mice, which is an AD mouse model, and C57BL/6 control mice, and data showed that m6A methylation was elevated in the cortex and the hippocampus of APP/PS1 transgenic mice. Next, the alterations of m6A RNA methylation in AD and in C57BL/6 mice were investigated using high-throughput sequencing. Genome-wide maps of m6A mRNA showed that the degrees of m6A methylation were higher in many genes and lower in others in AD mice. Interestingly, the expression of the m6A methyltransferase METTL3 was elevated and that of the m6A demethylase FTO was decreased in AD mice. The data were analyzed by gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analyses, and pathways that might be related to synaptic or neuron development and growth were constructed. The related pathways and genes predicted the potential roles of the differentially expressed m6A methylation RNA in AD. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that the m6A methylation of RNA promotes the development of AD.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Neurodegeneration section | New and Recent Articles: Dexmedetomidine Alleviated Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress via Inducing ER-phagy in the Spinal Cord of Neuropathic Pain Model</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00090</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Studies demonstrated that spinal autophagy was impaired in spinal nerve ligation (SNL) rats. However, the relationship of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and ER-phagy and whether dexmedetomidine (DEX) modulates ER-phagy remain unclear. In this study, male Sprague–Dawley (SD) rats and the SNL animal model were used. 4-Phenylbutyric acid (4-PBA), tunicamycin (TM), rapamycin (RAP), and 3-methyladenine (3-MA) were intrathecally administered, respectively to demonstrate the relationship of ER stress and ER-phagy. Dexmedetomidine (30 μg/kg) was administered as treatment. Mechanical withdrawal threshold (MWT) and thermal withdrawal latency (TWL) tests were performed to evaluate nociceptive hypersensitivity. Protein expressions were examined by Western blot, and the location of glucose-regulated protein 78 (Grp78) was examined by immunofluorescence staining. SNL induced ER stress and ER-phagy impairment. ER stress was altered in rostral ventromedial medulla (RVM); 4-phenylbutyric acid induced analgesic effect via inhibiting ER stress and unfolded protein response (UPR) pathways to induce ER-phagy; tunicamycin led to worsening pain through enhancing ER stress and UPR pathways to further impair ER-phagy. Rapamycin provided analgesic effect through enhancing ER-phagy to relieve SNL-induced ER stress and UPR pathway activation; 3-methyladenine deteriorated pain via further impairing ER-phagy to aggravate ER stress. Dexmedetomidine provided analgesic effect through elevating ER-phagy. In conclusion, ER stress led to ER-phagy impairment in the spinal cord of SNL rats and participated in the nociceptive descending system. ER-phagy impairment was both a trigger and an effector of ER stress via UPR pathways in SNL rats. Dexmedetomidine targeted ER-phagy to provide analgesic effect.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00074</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Hereditary spastic paraplegias (HSP) are a group of neurodegenerative diseases sharing spasticity in lower limbs as common symptom. There is a large clinical variability in the presentation of patients, partly underlined by the large genetic heterogeneity, with more than 60 genes responsible for HSP. Despite this large heterogeneity, the proteins with known function are supposed to be involved in a limited number of cellular compartments such as shaping of the endoplasmic reticulum or endolysosomal function. Yet, it is difficult to understand why alteration of such different cellular compartments can lead to degeneration of the axons of cortical motor neurons. A common feature that has emerged over the last decade is the alteration of lipid metabolism in this group of pathologies. This was first revealed by the identification of mutations in genes encoding proteins that have or are supposed to have enzymatic activities on lipid substrates. However, it also appears that mutations in genes affecting endoplasmic reticulum, mitochondria, or endolysosome function can lead to changes in lipid distribution or metabolism. The aim of this review is to discuss the role of lipid metabolism alterations in the physiopathology of HSP, to evaluate how such alterations contribute to neurodegenerative phenotypes, and to understand how this knowledge can help develop therapeutic strategy for HSP.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;High-fidelity measurements of neural activity can enable advancements in our understanding of the neural basis of complex behaviors such as speech, audition, and language, and are critical for developing neural prostheses that address impairments to these abilities due to disease or injury.

With this device, we provide the first demonstration of sensory-evoked modulation of surface-recorded single unit responses. We establish that single unit activity is consistently sensed from micro-ECoG electrodes over the surface of sensorimotor nucleus HVC (used as a proper name) in anesthetized European starlings, and validate responses with correlated firing in single units recorded simultaneously at surface and depth. The results establish a platform for high-fidelity recording from the surface of subcortical structures that will accelerate neurophysiological studies, and development of novel electrode arrays and neural prostheses.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroinformatics | New and Recent Articles: A Standardized Protocol for Efficient and Reliable Quality Control of Brain Registration in Functional MRI Studies</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fninf.2020.00007</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Automatic alignment of brain anatomy in a standard space is a key step when processing magnetic resonance imaging for group analyses. Such brain registration is prone to failure, and the results are therefore typically reviewed visually to ensure quality. There is however no standard, validated protocol available to perform this visual quality control (QC). We propose here a standardized QC protocol for brain registration, with minimal training overhead and no required knowledge of brain anatomy. We validated the reliability of three-level QC ratings (OK, Maybe, Fail) across different raters. Nine experts each rated N = 100 validation images, and reached moderate to good agreement (kappa from 0.4 to 0.68, average of 0.54 ± 0.08), with the highest agreement for “Fail” images (Dice from 0.67 to 0.93, average of 0.8 ± 0.06). We then recruited volunteers through the Zooniverse crowdsourcing platform, and extracted a consensus panel rating for both the Zooniverse raters (N = 41) and the expert raters. The agreement between expert and Zooniverse panels was high (kappa = 0.76). Overall, our protocol achieved a good reliability when performing a two level assessment (Fail vs. OK/Maybe) by an individual rater, or aggregating multiple three-level ratings (OK, Maybe, Fail) from a panel of experts (3 minimum) or non-experts (15 minimum). Our brain registration QC protocol will help standardize QC practices across laboratories, improve the consistency of reporting of QC in publications, and will open the way for QC assessment of large datasets which could be used to train automated QC systems.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neural Circuits | New and Recent Articles: Semaphorin-3A Promotes Degradation of Fragile X Mental Retardation Protein in Growth Cones via the Ubiquitin-Proteasome Pathway</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncir.2020.00005</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) is an RNA-binding protein that regulates local translation in dendrites and spines for synaptic plasticity. In axons, FMRP is implicated in axonal extension and axon guidance. We previously demonstrated the involvement of FMRP in growth cone collapse via a translation-dependent response to Semaphorin-3A (Sema3A), a repulsive axon guidance factor. In the case of attractive axon guidance factors, RNA-binding proteins such as zipcode binding protein 1 (ZBP1) accumulate towards the stimulated side of growth cones for local translation. However, it remains unclear how Sema3A effects FMRP localization in growth cones. Here, we show that levels of FMRP in growth cones of hippocampal neurons decreased after Sema3A stimulation. This decrease in FMRP was suppressed by the ubiquitin-activating enzyme E1 enzyme inhibitor PYR-41 and proteasome inhibitor MG132, suggesting that the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway is involved in Sema3A-induced FMRP degradation in growth cones. Moreover, the E1 enzyme or proteasome inhibitor suppressed Sema3A-induced increases in microtubule-associated protein 1B (MAP1B) in growth cones, suggesting that the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway promotes local translation of MAP1B, whose translation is mediated by FMRP. These inhibitors also blocked the Sema3A-induced growth cone collapse. Collectively, our results suggest that Sema3A promotes degradation of FMRP in growth cones through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, leading to growth cone collapse via local translation of MAP1B. These findings reveal a new mechanism of axon guidance regulation: degradation of the translational suppressor FMRP via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00042</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The plasticity of the central nervous system (CNS) in response to neuronal activity has been suggested as early as 1894 by Cajal (1894). CNS plasticity has first been studied with a focus on neuronal structures. However, in the last decade, myelin plasticity has been unraveled as an adaptive mechanism of importance, in addition to the previously described processes of myelin repair. Indeed, it is now clear that myelin remodeling occurs along with life and adapts to the activity of neuronal networks. Until now, it has been considered as a two-part dialog between the neuron and the oligodendroglial lineage. However, other glial cell types might be at play in myelin plasticity. In the present review, we first summarize the key structural parameters for myelination, we then describe how neuronal activity modulates myelination and finally discuss how other glial cells could participate in myelinic adaptivity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Slowing of the Time Course of Acidification Decreases the Acid-Sensing Ion Channel 1a Current Amplitude and Modulates Action Potential Firing in Neurons</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00041</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Acid-sensing ion channels (ASICs) are H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-activated neuronal Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channels. They are involved in fear behavior, learning, neurodegeneration after ischemic stroke and in pain sensation. ASIC activation has so far been studied only with fast pH changes, although the pH changes associated with many roles of ASICs are slow. It is currently not known whether slow pH changes can open ASICs at all. Here, we investigated to which extent slow pH changes can activate ASIC1a channels and induce action potential signaling. To this end, ASIC1a current amplitudes and charge transport in transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells, and ASIC-mediated action potential signaling in cultured cortical neurons were measured in response to defined pH ramps of 1–40 s duration from pH 7.4 to pH 6.6 or 6.0. A kinetic model of the ASIC1a current was developed and integrated into the Hodgkin-Huxley action potential model. Interestingly, whereas the ASIC1a current amplitude decreased with slower pH ramps, action potential firing was higher upon intermediate than fast acidification in cortical neurons. Indeed, fast pH changes (&amp;lt;4 s) induced short action potential bursts, while pH changes of intermediate speed (4–10 s) induced longer bursts. Slower pH changes (&amp;gt;10 s) did in many experiments not generate action potentials. Computer simulations corroborated these observations. We provide here the first description of ASIC function in response to defined slow pH changes. Our study shows that ASIC1a currents, and neuronal activity induced by ASIC1a currents, strongly depend on the speed of pH changes. Importantly, with pH changes that take &amp;gt;10 s to complete, ASIC1a activation is inefficient. Therefore, it is likely that currently unknown modulatory mechanisms allow ASIC activity in situations such as ischemia and inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Application of Iron Oxide Nanoparticles in the Diagnosis and Treatment of Neurodegenerative Diseases With Emphasis on Alzheimer’s Disease</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00021</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Neurodegenerative diseases are characterized by chronic progressive degeneration of the structure and function of the nervous system, which brings an enormous burden on patients, their families, and society. It is difficult to make early diagnosis, resulting from the insidious onset and progressive development of neurodegenerative diseases. The drugs on the market cannot cross the blood–brain barrier (BBB) effectively, which leads to unfavorable prognosis and less effective treatments. Therefore, there is an urgent demand to develop a novel detection method and therapeutic strategies. Recently, nanomedicine has aroused considerable attention for diagnosis and therapy of central nervous system (CNS) diseases. Nanoparticles integrate targeting, imaging, and therapy in one system and facilitate the entry of drug molecules across the blood–brain barrier, offering new hope to patients. In this review, we summarize the application of iron oxide nanoparticles (IONPs) in the diagnosis and treatment of neurodegenerative disease, including Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Parkinson’s disease (PD), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). We focus on IONPs as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contrast agents (CAs) and drug carriers in AD. What most neurodegenerative diseases have in common is that hall marker lesions are represented by protein aggregates (Soto and Pritzkow, 2018). These diseases are of unknown etiology and unfavorable prognosis, and the treatments toward them are less effective (Soto and Pritzkow, 2018). Such diseases usually develop in aged people, and early clinical manifestations are atypical, resulting in difficulty in early diagnosis. Recently, nanomedicine has aroused considerable attention for therapy and diagnosis of CNS diseases because it integrates targeting, imaging, and therapy in one system (Gupta et al., 2019). In this review article, we first introduce the neurodegenerative diseases and commonly used MRI CAs. Then we review the application of IONPs in the diagnosis and treatment of neurodegenerative diseases with the purpose of assisting early theranostics (therapy and diagnosis).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroanatomy | New and Recent Articles: Monosynaptic Input Mapping of Diencephalic Projections to the Cerebrospinal Fluid-Contacting Nucleus in the Rat</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnana.2020.00007</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Objective: To investigate the projections the cerebrospinal fluid-contacting (CSF-contacting) nucleus receives from the diencephalon and to speculate on the functional significance of these connections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: The retrograde tracer cholera toxin B subunit (CB) was injected into the CSF-contacting nucleus in SD rats according to the experimental formula of the stereotaxic coordinates. Animals were perfused 7–10 days after the injection, and the diencephalon was sliced at 40 μm with a freezing microtome. CB-immunofluorescence was performed on all diencephalic sections. The features of CB-positive neuron distribution in the diencephalon were observed with a fluorescence microscope.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: The retrograde labeled CB-positive neurons were found in the epithalamus, subthalamus, and hypothalamus. Three functional diencephalic areas including 43 sub-regions revealed projections to the CSF-contacting nucleus. The CB-positive neurons were distributed in different density ranges: sparse, moderate, and dense.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: Based on the connectivity patterns of the CSF-contacting nucleus that receives anatomical inputs from the diencephalon, we preliminarily assume that the CSF-contacting nucleus participates in homeostasis regulation, visceral activity, stress, emotion, pain and addiction, and sleeping and arousal. The present study firstly illustrates the broad projections of the CSF-contacting nucleus from the diencephalon, which implies the complicated functions of the nucleus especially for the unique roles of coordination in neural and body fluids regulations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2020.00029</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Activity and expression of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) catalytic isoform, PIK3CD/p110δ, is increased in schizophrenia, autism, and intellectual delay and pro-cognitive preclinical efficacy of p110δ-inhibition has been demonstrated in pharmacological, genetic, and developmental rodent models of psychiatric disorders. Although PI3K signaling has been implicated in the development and function of neurons and glia; isoform-specific roles of the individual PI3Ks are less clear and the biological effects of increased p110δ on neuronal development are unknown. Since the pathobiological direction of p110δ changes in neurodevelopmental disorders are increased expression and activity, we hypothesized that overexpression of p110δ would impact measures of neuronal development and maturation relevant to connectivity and synaptic transmission. p110δ overexpression in primary rat hippocampal cultures significantly reduced dendritic morphogenesis and arborization and increased immature and mature dendritic spine densities, without impacting cell viability, soma size, or axon length. Together, our novel findings demonstrate the importance of homeostatic regulation of the p110δ isoform for normative neuronal development and highlight a potential pathophysiological mechanism of association to disorders of neurodevelopment.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Proteomics Analysis of Brain Tissue in a Rat Model of Ischemic Stroke in the Acute Phase</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2020.00027</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Background: Stroke is a leading health issue, with high morbidity and mortality rates worldwide. Of all strokes, approximately 80% of cases are ischemic stroke (IS). However, the underlying mechanisms of the occurrence of acute IS remain poorly understood because of heterogeneous and multiple factors. More potential biomarkers are urgently needed to reveal the deeper pathogenesis of IS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: We identified potential biomarkers in rat brain tissues of IS using an iTRAQ labeling approach coupled with LC-MS/MS. Furthermore, bioinformatrics analyses including GO, KEGG, DAVID, and Cytoscape were used to present proteomic profiles and to explore the disease mechanisms. Additionally, Western blotting for target proteins was conducted for further verification.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: We identified 4,578 proteins using the iTRAQ-based proteomics method. Of these proteins, 282 differentiated proteins, comprising 73 upregulated and 209 downregulated proteins, were observed. Further bioinformatics analysis suggested that the candidate proteins were mainly involved in energy liberation, intracellular protein transport, and synaptic plasticity regulation during the acute period. KEGG pathway enrichment analysis indicated a series of representative pathological pathways, including energy metabolite, long-term potentiation (LTP), and neurodegenerative disease-related pathways. Moreover, Western blotting confirmed the associated candidate proteins, which refer to oxidative responses and synaptic plasticity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: Our findings highlight the identification of candidate protein biomarkers and provide insight into the biological processes involved in acute IS.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2020.00009</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Canine adenovirus-2 (CAV) is a canine pathogen that has been used in a variety of applications, from vaccines against more infectious strains of CAV to treatments for neurological disorders. With recent engineering, CAV has become a natural choice for neuroscientists dissecting the connectivity and function of brain circuits. Specifically, as a reliable genetic vector with minimal immunogenic and cytotoxic reactivity, CAV has been used for the retrograde transduction of various types of projection neurons. Consequently, CAV is particularly useful when studying the anatomy and functions of long-range projections. Moreover, combining CAV with conditional expression and transsynaptic tracing results in the ability to study circuits with cell- and/or projection-type specificity. Lastly, with the well-documented knowledge of viral transduction, new innovations have been developed to increase the transduction efficiency of CAV and circumvent its tropism, expanding the potential of CAV for circuit analysis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Integrative Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: What Can Computational Models Learn From Human Selective Attention? A Review From an Audiovisual Unimodal and Crossmodal Perspective</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnint.2020.00010</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Selective attention plays an essential role in information acquisition and utilization from the environment. In the past 50 years, research on selective attention has been a central topic in cognitive science. Compared with unimodal studies, crossmodal studies are more complex but necessary to solve real-world challenges in both human experiments and computational modeling. Although an increasing number of findings on crossmodal selective attention have shed light on humans' behavioral patterns and neural underpinnings, a much better understanding is still necessary to yield the same benefit for intelligent computational agents. This article reviews studies of selective attention in unimodal visual and auditory and crossmodal audiovisual setups from the multidisciplinary perspectives of psychology and cognitive neuroscience, and evaluates different ways to simulate analogous mechanisms in computational models and robotics. We discuss the gaps between these fields in this interdisciplinary review and provide insights about how to use psychological findings and theories in artificial intelligence from different perspectives.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neural Circuits | New and Recent Articles: Fictive Scratching Patterns in Brain Cortex-Ablated, Midcollicular Decerebrate, and Spinal Cats</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncir.2020.00001</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Background: The spinal cord’s central pattern generators (CPGs) have been explained by the symmetrical half-center hypothesis, the bursts generator, computational models, and more recently by connectome circuits. Asymmetrical models, at odds with the half-center paradigm, are composed of extensor and flexor CPG modules. Other models include not only flexor and extensor motoneurons but also motoneuron pools controlling biarticular muscles. It is unknown whether a preferred model can explain some particularities that fictive scratching (FS) in the cat presents. The first aim of this study was to investigate FS patterns considering the aiming and the rhythmic periods, and second, to examine the effects of serotonin (5HT) on and segmental inputs to FS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: The experiments were carried out first in brain cortex-ablated cats (BCAC), then spinalized (SC), and for the midcollicular (MCC) preparation. Subjects were immobilized and the peripheral nerves were used to elicit the Monosynaptic reflex (MR), to modify the scratching patterns and for electroneurogram recordings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: In BCAC, FS was produced by pinna stimulation and, in some cases, by serotonin. The scratching aiming phase (AP) initiates with the activation of either flexor or extensor motoneurons. Serotonin application during the AP produced simultaneous extensor and flexor bursts. Furthermore, WAY 100635 (5HT1A antagonist) produced a brief burst in the tibialis anterior (TA) nerve, followed by a reduction in its electroneurogram (ENG), while the soleus ENG remained silent. In SC, rhythmic phase (RP) activity was recorded in the soleus motoneurons. Serotonin or WAY produced FS bouts. The electrical stimulation of Ia afferent fibers produced heteronymous MRes waxing and waning during the scratch cycle. In MCC, FS began with flexor activity. Electrical stimulation of either deep peroneus (DP) or superficial peroneus (SP) nerves increased the duration of the TA electroneurogram. Medial gastrocnemius (MG) stretching or MG nerve electrical stimulation produced a reduction in the TA electroneurogram and an initial MG extensor burst. MRes waxed and waned during the scratch cycle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: Descending pathways and segmental afferent fibers, as well as 5-HT and WAY, can change the FS pattern. To our understanding, the half-center hypothesis is the most suitable for explaining the AP in MCC.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Bi-Directional Communication Between Neurons and Astrocytes Modulates Spinal Motor Circuits</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00030</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Evidence suggests that astrocytes are not merely supportive cells in the nervous system but may actively participate in the control of neural circuits underlying cognition and behavior. In this study, we examined the role of astrocytes within the motor circuitry of the mammalian spinal cord. Pharmacogenetic manipulation of astrocytic activity in isolated spinal cord preparations obtained from neonatal mice revealed astrocyte-derived, adenosinergic modulation of the frequency of rhythmic output generated by the locomotor central pattern generator (CPG) network. Live Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; imaging demonstrated increased activity in astrocytes during locomotor-related output and in response to the direct stimulation of spinal neurons. Finally, astrocytes were found to respond to neuronally-derived glutamate in a metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5) dependent manner, which in turn drives astrocytic modulation of the locomotor network. Our work identifies bi-directional signaling mechanisms between neurons and astrocytes underlying modulatory feedback control of motor circuits, which may act to constrain network output within optimal ranges for movement.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00106</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) technology, which is amongst the most used non-invasive brain stimulation techniques currently available, has developed rapidly from 2009 to 2018. However, reports on the trends of rTMS using bibliometric analysis are rare. The goal of the present bibliometric analysis is to analyze and visualize the trends of rTMS, including general (publication patterns) and emerging trends (research frontiers), over the last 10 years by using the visual analytic tool CiteSpace V. Publications related to rTMS from 2009 to 2018 were retrieved from the Web of Science (WoS) database, including 2,986 peer-reviewed articles/reviews. Active authors, journals, institutions, and countries were identified by WoS and visualized by CiteSpace V, which could also detect burst changes to identify emerging trends. GraphPad Prism 8 was used to analyze the time trend of annual publication outputs. The USA ranked first in this field. Pascual-Leone A (author A), Fitzgerald PB (author B), George MS (author C), Lefaucheur JP (author D), and Fregni F (author E) made great contributions to this field of study. The most prolific institution to publish rTMS-related publications in the last decade was the University of Toronto. The journal Brain Stimulation published most papers. Lefaucheur et al.'s paper in 2014, and the keyword “sham controlled trial” showed the strongest citation bursts by the end of 2018, which indicates increased attention to the underlying work, thereby indicating the research frontiers. This study reveals the publication patterns and emerging trends of rTMS based on the records published from 2009 to 2018. The insights obtained have reference values for the future research and application of rTMS.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Neurodegeneration section | New and Recent Articles: Hypermethylation of the Gene Coding for PGC-1α in Peripheral Blood Leukocytes of Patients With Parkinson’s Disease</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00097</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Decreased expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator-1α (PGC-1α) is implicated in the pathophysiology of Parkinson’s disease (PD). However, our understanding of the mechanism regulating the PGC-1α expression is still limited. We sought to determine whether the epigenetic modification of PPARGC1A (the gene encoding PGC-1α) could account for its diminished expression. We performed a study of PPARGC1A risk-SNP genotypes, methylation level, and the expression in blood from 171 subjects. The mean DNA methylation level of PPARGC1A intron 1 in patients with PD was higher than that in the controls (7.18 ± 1.74 vs. 6.36 ± 1.28, P = 0.007). A detailed comparison of the DNA methylation level at each CpG site showed that CpG_1, CpG_13.14, CpG_17.18, and CpG_20 were significantly hypermethylated in patients with PD. There was a significant negative correlation between PPARGC1A methylation and expression level (R = −0.404, P &amp;lt; 0.001). We found no correlations between the PPARGC1A methylation level and the clinical features, while the CpG_13.14 site methylation level was positively correlated with H&amp;amp;Y stage (R = 0.246, P = 0.020) and was increased in people carrying the rs2970848 AA genotype compared with that in carriers of the AG/GG genotype (7.27 ± 1.86 vs. 6.65 ± 1.92, P = 0.032). Our results support a link between PPARGC1A methylation, gene expression, and variability, which indicated that a novel epigenetic regulatory mechanism controlling PPARGC1A expression influences PD pathogenesis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00033</link>
	<content:encoded>Purpose&lt;p&gt;Epilepsy therapy is currently based on anti-seizure drugs that do not modify the course of the disease, i.e., they are not anti-epileptogenic in nature. Previously, we observed that in vivo casein kinase 2 (CK2) inhibition with 4,5,6,7-tetrabromotriazole (TBB) had anti-epileptogenic effects in the acute epilepsy slice model.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;Here, we pretreated rats with TBB in vivo prior to the establishment of a pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus (SE) in order to analyze the long-term sequelae of such a preventive TBB administration.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;We found that TBB pretreatment delayed onset of seizures after pilocarpine and slowed down disease progression during epileptogenesis. This was accompanied with a reduced proportion of burst firing neurons in the CA1 area. Western blot analyses demonstrated that CA1 tissue from TBB-pretreated epileptic animals contained significantly less CK2 than TBB-pretreated controls. On the transcriptional level, TBB pretreatment led to differential gene expression changes of K&lt;sub&gt;Ca&lt;/sub&gt;2.2, but also of HCN1 and HCN3 channels. Thus, in the presence of the HCN channel blocker ZD7288, pretreatment with TBB rescued the afterhyperpolarizing potential (AHP) as well as spike frequency adaptation in epileptic animals, both of which are prominent functions of K&lt;sub&gt;Ca&lt;/sub&gt;2 channels.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;These data indicate that TBB pretreatment prior to SE slows down disease progression during epileptogenesis involving increased K&lt;sub&gt;Ca&lt;/sub&gt;2 function, probably due to a persistently decreased CK2 protein expression.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsyn.2020.00001</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Connections between neurons called synapses are the key components underlying all nervous system functions of animals and humans. However, important genetic information on the formation and plasticity of one type, the electrical (gap junction-mediated) synapse, is understudied in many invertebrates. In the present study, we set forth to identify and characterize the gap junction-encoding gene innexin in the central nervous system (CNS) of the mollusk pond snail Lymnaea stagnalis. With PCR, 3′ and 5′ RACE, and BLAST searches, we identified eight innexin genes in the L. stagnalis genome, named Lst Inx1–Lst Inx8. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the L. stagnalis innexin genes originated from a single copy in the common ancestor of molluskan species by multiple gene duplication events and have been maintained in L. stagnalis since they were generated. The paralogous innexin genes demonstrate distinct expression patterns among tissues. In addition, one paralog, Lst Inx1, exhibits heterogeneity in cells and ganglia, suggesting the occurrence of functional diversification after gene duplication. These results introduce possibilities to study an intriguing potential relationship between innexin paralog expression and cell-specific functional outputs such as heterogenic ability to form channels and exhibit synapse plasticity. The L. stagnalis CNS contains large neurons and functionally defined networks for behaviors; with the introduction of L. stagnalis in the gap junction gene field, we are providing novel opportunities to combine genetic research with direct investigations of functional outcomes at the cellular, synaptic, and behavioral levels.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Rett syndrome (RTT, OMIM 312750), a severe neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by regression with loss of spoken language and hand skills, development of characteristic hand stereotypies, and gait dysfunction, is primarily caused by de novo mutations in the X-linked gene Methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MECP2). Currently, treatment options are limited to symptomatic management, however, reversal of disease phenotype is possible in mouse models by restoration of normal MECP2 gene expression. A significant challenge is the lack of biomarkers of disease state, disease severity, or treatment response. Using a non-targeted metabolomic approach we evaluated metabolite profiles in plasma from thirty-four people with RTT compared to thirty-seven unaffected age- and gender-matched siblings. We identified sixty-six significantly altered metabolites that cluster broadly into amino acid, nitrogen handling, and exogenous substance pathways. RTT disease metabolite and metabolic pathways abnormalities point to evidence of oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and alterations in gut microflora. These observed changes provide insight into underlying pathological mechanisms and the foundation for biomarker discovery of disease severity biomarkers.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Selection of the time-window mainly affects the effectiveness of piecewise feature extraction procedures. We present an enhanced bag-of-patterns representation that allows capturing the higher-level structures of brain dynamics within a wide window range. So, we introduce augmented instance representations with extended window lengths for the short-time Common Spatial Pattern algorithm. Based on multiple-instance learning, the relevant bag-of-patterns are selected by a sparse regression to feed a bag classifier. The proposed higher-level structure representation promotes two contributions: (i) accuracy improvement of bi-conditional tasks, (ii) A better understanding of dynamic brain behavior through the learned sparse regression fits. Using a support vector machine classifier, the achieved performance on a public motor imagery dataset (left-hand and right-hand tasks) shows that the proposed framework performs very competitive results, providing robustness to the time variation of electroencephalography recordings and favoring the class separability.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Heterogeneity between late-onset Parkinson’s disease (LOPD) and early-onset Parkinson’s disease (EOPD) is mainly reflected in the following aspects including genetics, disease progression, drug response, clinical manifestation, and neuropathological change.

In this study, regional homogeneity (ReHo) and amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF) maps were used to explore different spontaneous brain activity patterns in EOPD and LOPD patients. Abnormal synchronizations were found in the motor and emotional circuits of the EOPD group, as well as in the motor, emotional, and visual circuits of the LOPD group. EOPD patients showed functional activity change in the visual, emotional and motor circuits, and LOPD patients only showed increased functional activity in the emotional circuits. In summary, the desynchronization process in the LOPD group was relatively strengthened, and the brain areas with changed functional activity in the EOPD group were relatively widespread. The results might point out different impairments in the synchronization and functional activity for EOPD and LOPD patients.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Neurodegeneration section | New and Recent Articles: Identification of Novel Compound Heterozygous Mutations in the GAN Gene of a Chinese Patient Diagnosed With Giant Axonal Neuropathy</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00085</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Giant axonal neuropathy (GAN) is a very rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by abnormally large and dysfunctional neuronal axons. Mutations in the GAN gene have been identified as the cause of this disorder. In this report, we performed a detailed phenotypic assessment of a Chinese patient with GAN. An array-based exon capture test and targeted next-generation sequencing were used to detect the suspected mutation sites. Compound heterozygous mutations of p.S79L (c.236C &amp;gt; T) in the BTB domain and p.T489S (c.1466C &amp;gt; G) in the kelch domain were identified in the proband’s genome. S79L was a known mutation, and T489S was reported for the first time. The p.S79L and p.T489S were confirmed in the proband’s mother and father, respectively. Both mutations were located in highly conserved regions and affected the predicted protein crystal structures. The proband’s sural biopsy revealed the classical GAN phenotype of swollen axons filled with closely packed neurofilaments. The combined application of the next-generation sequencing platform and bioinformatics analyses was an effective method for diagnosing GAN. The novel compound mutations of S79L and T489S in the GAN gene were likely the cause of the patient’s GAN symptoms. Our findings enrich the spectrum of mutations associated with this rare type of axonopathy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2020.00014</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Modern machine learning is based on powerful algorithms running on digital computing platforms and there is great interest in accelerating the learning process and making it more energy efficient. In this paper we present a fully autonomous probabilistic circuit for fast and efficient learning that makes no use of digital computing. Specifically we use SPICE simulations to demonstrate a clockless autonomous circuit where the required synaptic weights are read out in the form of analog voltages. This allows us to demonstrate a circuit that can be built with existing technology to emulate the Boltzmann machine learning algorithm based on gradient optimization of the maximum likelihood function. Such autonomous circuits could be particularly of interest as standalone learning devices in the context of mobile and edge computing.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Depolarizing GABA Transmission Restrains Activity-Dependent Glutamatergic Synapse Formation in the Developing Hippocampal Circuit</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00036</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;γ-Aminobutyric acid (GABA) is the main inhibitory neurotransmitter in the mature brain but has the paradoxical property of depolarizing neurons during early development. Depolarization provided by GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; transmission during this early phase regulates neural stem cell proliferation, neural migration, neurite outgrowth, synapse formation, and circuit refinement, making GABA a key factor in neural circuit development. Importantly, depending on the context, depolarizing GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; transmission can either drive neural activity or inhibit it through shunting inhibition. The varying roles of depolarizing GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; transmission during development, and its ability to both drive and inhibit neural activity, makes it a difficult developmental cue to study. This is particularly true in the later stages of development when the majority of synapses form and GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; transmission switches from depolarizing to hyperpolarizing. Here, we addressed the importance of depolarizing but inhibitory (or shunting) GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; transmission in glutamatergic synapse formation in hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons. We first showed that the developmental depolarizing-to-hyperpolarizing switch in GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; transmission is recapitulated in organotypic hippocampal slice cultures. Based on the expression profile of K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;−Cl&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; co-transporter 2 (KCC2) and changes in the GABA reversal potential, we pinpointed the timing of the switch from depolarizing to hyperpolarizing GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; transmission in CA1 neurons. We found that blocking depolarizing but shunting GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; transmission increased excitatory synapse number and strength, indicating that depolarizing GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; transmission can restrain glutamatergic synapse formation. The increase in glutamatergic synapses was activity-dependent but independent of BDNF signaling. Importantly, the elevated number of synapses was stable for more than a week after GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; inhibitors were washed out. Together these findings point to the ability of immature GABAergic transmission to restrain glutamatergic synapse formation and suggest an unexpected role for depolarizing GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; transmission in shaping excitatory connectivity during neural circuit development.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00035</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Forkhead Box G1 (FOXG1) is a member of the Forkhead family of genes with non-redundant roles in brain development, where alteration of this gene’s expression significantly affects the formation and function of the mammalian cerebral cortex. FOXG1 haploinsufficiency in humans is associated with prominent differences in brain size and impaired intellectual development noticeable in early childhood, while homozygous mutations are typically fatal. As such, FOXG1 has been implicated in a wide spectrum of congenital brain disorders, including the congenital variant of Rett syndrome, infantile spasms, microcephaly, autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and schizophrenia. Recent technological advances have yielded greater insight into phenotypic variations observed in FOXG1 syndrome, molecular mechanisms underlying pathogenesis of the disease, and multifaceted roles of FOXG1 expression. In this review, we explore the emerging mechanisms of FOXG1 in a range of transcriptional to posttranscriptional events in order to evolve our current view of how a single transcription factor governs the assembly of an elaborate cortical circuit responsible for higher cognitive functions and neurological disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Early Neurotoxic Effects of Inorganic Arsenic Modulate Cortical GSH Levels Associated With the Activation of the Nrf2 and NFκB Pathways, Expression of Amino Acid Transporters and NMDA Receptors and the Production of Hydrogen Sulfide</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00017</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Exposure to toxic metals and metalloids is an important cause of preventable diseases worldwide. Inorganic arsenic (iAs) affects several organs and tissues, causing neurobehavioral alterations in the central nervous system (CNS) that might lead to neurodegeneration. In this work, we wanted to explore the time- and dose-related changes on glutathione (GSH) levels in several regions of the CNS, such as the cortex, striatum, hippocampus, and cerebellum, to identify the initial cellular changes associated to GSH depletion due to iAs exposure. Mice received a single intraperitoneal injection containing 5 or 14 mg/kg sodium arsenite. Animals were killed at 2, 6, and 24 h. Significant depletion of GSH levels was observed in the cortex at 2 and 6 h, while on the striatum, hippocampus, or cerebellum regions, no significant changes were observed. GSH depletion in the cortex was associated with the activation of the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and nuclear factor kappa B (NFκB) pathways, which led to the upregulation of xCT, excitatory amino acid carrier 1 (EAAC1), glutamate/aspartate transporter (GLAST), and glial glutamate transporter 1 (GLT-1), and the activation of the transsulfuration pathways, which led to the overproduction of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S in the cortex and increased levels of GSH in the cortex and cerebellum at 24 h. In the cortex, the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor subunits NR2A and NR2B were also altered at 24 h. These early effects were not homogeneous among different brain regions and indicate early neurotoxic alterations in the cortex and cerebellum.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Brain Imaging Methods section | New and Recent Articles: The Myelin Water Fraction Serves as a Marker for Age-Related Myelin Alterations in the Cerebral White Matter – A Multiparametric MRI Aging Study</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00136</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Quantitative MRI modalities, such as diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) or magnetization transfer imaging (MTI) are sensitive to the neuronal effects of aging of the cerebral white matter (WM), but lack the specificity for myelin content. Myelin water imaging (MWI) is highly specific for myelin and may be more sensitive for the detection of changes in myelin content inside the cerebral WM microstructure. In this multiparametric imaging study, we evaluated the performance of myelin water fraction (MWF) estimates as a marker for myelin alterations during normal-aging. Multiparametric MRI data derived from DTI, MTI and a novel, recently-proposed MWF-map processing and reconstruction algorithm were acquired from 54 healthy subjects (aged 18–79 years) and region-based multivariate regression analysis was performed. MWFs significantly decreased with age in most WM regions (except corticospinal tract) and changes of MWFs were associated with changes of radial diffusivity, indicating either substantial alterations or preservation of myelin content in these regions. Decreases of fractional anisotropy and magnetization transfer ratio were associated with lower MWFs in commissural fiber tracts only. Mean diffusivity had no regional effects on MWF. We conclude that MWF estimates are sensitive for the assessment of age-related myelin alterations in the cerebral WM of normal-aging brains.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25707?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We aimed to determine the association between striatal dopaminergic depletion, cerebral β‐amyloid deposition, and cognitive dysfunction in Lewy body disease (LBD).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This cross‐sectional study recruited 48 LBD patients (30 with dementia, 18 with mild cognitive impairment) and 15 control subjects from a university‐based hospital. We measured the striatal dopamine transporter (DAT) activity and regional β‐amyloid burden using &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;‐(3‐[&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]fluoropropyl)‐2β‐carbon ethoxy‐3β‐(4‐iodophenyl) nortropane (FP‐CIT) positron emission tomography (PET) and &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F‐florbetaben (FBB) PET, respectively. The relationship between striatal FP‐CIT uptake, regional cortical FBB uptake, and cognitive function scores was evaluated using path analyses. We also investigated the effects of striatal FP‐CIT uptake and cortical FBB uptake on the interval between motor symptom and dementia onset.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reduced striatal FP‐CIT uptake was associated with increased FBB uptake in the posterior cortical regions, most prominently in the occipital cortices. Reduced FP‐CIT uptake in the anterior putamen was associated with visuospatial dysfunction with mediation of increased occipital FBB uptake. Reduced FP‐CIT uptake in the posterior putamen and an increased parietal FBB uptake were independently associated with memory dysfunction. Reduced striatal FP‐CIT uptake was associated with attention, language, and frontal/executive dysfunction, independent of amyloid deposition. Increased FBB uptake, especially in the parietal cortex, was associated with earlier onset of dementia.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our results suggest that occipital β‐amyloid deposition may contribute to the association between striatal dopaminergic depletion and visuospatial dysfunction in LBD patients. Although the effects of reduced DAT activity are more prominent than those of β‐amyloid burden on cognitive dysfunction, the latter affects the onset of cognitive dysfunction.

	<content:encoded>Background&lt;p&gt;To compare the efficacies of univariate and radiomics analyses of amide proton transfer weighted (APT&lt;sub&gt;W&lt;/sub&gt;) imaging in predicting isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) mutation of grade II/III gliomas.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;Fifty-nine grade II/III glioma patients with known IDH1 mutation status were prospectively included (IDH1 wild type, 16; IDH1 mutation, 43). A total of 1044 quantitative radiomics features were extracted from APT&lt;sub&gt;W&lt;/sub&gt; images. The efficacies of univariate and radiomics analyses in predicting IDH1 mutation were compared. Feature values were compared between two groups with independent t-test and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was applied to evaluate the predicting efficacy of each feature. Cases were randomly assigned to either the training (n = 49) or test cohort (n = 10) for the radiomics analysis. Support vector machine with recursive feature elimination (SVM-RFE) was adopted to select the optimal feature subset. The adverse impact of the imbalance dataset in the training cohort was solved by synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE). Subsequently, the performance of SVM model was assessed on both training and test cohort.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;As for univariate analysis, 18 features were significantly different between IDH1 wild-type and mutant groups (P &amp;lt; 0.05). Among these parameters, High Gray Level Run Emphasis All Direction offset 8 SD achieved the biggest area under the curve (AUC) (0.769) with the accuracy of 0.799. As for radiomics analysis, SVM model was established using 19 features selected with SVM-RFE. The AUC and accuracy for IDH1 mutation on training set were 0.892 and 0.952, while on the testing set were 0.7 and 0.84, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;Radiomics strategy based on APT image features is potentially useful for preoperative estimating IDH1 mutation status.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00140</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Olfaction is a sense involved in a complex set of tasks, influencing eating behavior, increasing awareness of environmental hazards and affecting social communication. Surprisingly, smell disorders are very frequent, especially in the elderly population. Several recent studies conducted mostly in older subjects have demonstrated a strong association between olfactory impairment and overall mortality risk, with anosmia being even more predictive of 5 years mortality risk than cardiovascular disease. Presently, the underlying pathophysiology linking olfactory impairment to mortality remains unknown and only putative mechanisms are suggested. This review aims to examine the link between olfactory impairment and mortality and to discuss existing ideas on underlying existing mechanisms including, (1) the effect of olfactory loss on nutrition, life-threatening situations and social interactions, (2) associated neurodegenerative diseases, (3) accelerated brain aging, and (4) reflection of general health status being reflected in olfactory function.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Introduction&lt;p&gt;The Hereditary Spastic Paraplegia (HSP) is a heterogeneous group of neurodegenerative disorders characterized by progressive spasticity and lower limbs (LL) weakness. There is no treatment to cure or halt the disease, except for symptomatic therapy. The use of botulinum toxin type A (BoNT-A) is one of the primary treatment for focal spasticity. Physiotherapy (PT) can help in maintaining residual functioning. We performed a retrospective study to evaluate the effect of the combined BoNT-A and intensive PT in patients with HSP.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;Eighteen adult patients (50% females) with clinical diagnosis of HSP were recruited. Eleven patients had a genetic diagnosis of SPG4, 5, 7, 8, 11, 72. Patients were all autonomously deambulant or needed support. BoNT-A was injected in 36 LL in different spastic muscles under electromyographic guidance and followed by intensive PT sessions. Outcome measures included disease severity, motor functional measures, perceived pain self-report and quality of life. Assessments occurred at baseline, 1 and 3 months after BoNT-A injection.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Most inoculated muscles were hamstrings, rectus femoris and gastrocnemius. We observed an improvement in muscle tone, in the gait velocity and distance length. Spastic Paraplegia Rating Scale was significantly reduced after treatment, in addition to improving pain and quality of life. These results were riconfirmed in 3 months time.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;Our study indicates that combined treatment of BoNT-A and PT can lead to improvement of spasticity and quality of life in patients with HSP.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Neurodegeneration section | New and Recent Articles: FAIM Opposes Aggregation of Mutant SOD1 That Typifies Some Forms of Familial Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00110</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive neurodegenerative illness that is unremittingly fatal and for which no effective treatment exists. All forms of ALS are characterized by protein aggregation. In familial forms of ALS, specific and heritable aggregation-prone proteins have been identified, such as mutant superoxide dismutase (SOD1). It has been suggested that a factor capable of preventing mutant SOD1 protein aggregation and/or disassembling mutant SOD1 protein aggregates would ameliorate SOD1-associated forms of familial ALS. Here we identify Fas Apoptosis Inhibitory Molecule (FAIM), a highly evolutionarily conserved 20 kDa protein, as an agent with this activity. We show FAIM counteracts intracellular accumulation of mutant SOD1 protein aggregates, which is increased in the absence of FAIM, as determined by pulse-shape analysis and filter trap assays. In a cell-free system, FAIM inhibits aggregation of mutant SOD1, and further disassembles and solubilizes established mutant SOD1 protein aggregates, as determined by thioflavin T (ThT), filter trap, and sedimentation assays. In sum, we report here a previously unknown activity of FAIM that opposes ALS disease-related protein aggregation and promotes proteostasis of an aggregation-prone ALS protein.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00027</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Biomedical imaging Is an important source of information in cancer research. Characterizations of cancer morphology at onset, progression, and in response to treatment provide complementary information to that gleaned from genomics and clinical data. Accurate extraction and classification of both visual and latent image features Is an increasingly complex challenge due to the increased complexity and resolution of biomedical image data. In this paper, we present four deep learning-based image analysis methods from the Computational Precision Medicine (CPM) satellite event of the 21st International Medical Image Computing and Computer Assisted Intervention (MICCAI 2018) conference. One method Is a segmentation method designed to segment nuclei in whole slide tissue images (WSIs) of adult diffuse glioma cases. It achieved a Dice similarity coefficient of 0.868 with the CPM challenge datasets. Three methods are classification methods developed to categorize adult diffuse glioma cases into oligodendroglioma and astrocytoma classes using radiographic and histologic image data. These methods achieved accuracy values of 0.75, 0.80, and 0.90, measured as the ratio of the number of correct classifications to the number of total cases, with the challenge datasets. The evaluations of the four methods indicate that (1) carefully constructed deep learning algorithms are able to produce high accuracy in the analysis of biomedical image data and (2) the combination of radiographic with histologic image information improves classification performance.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: ROOTS: An Algorithm to Generate Biologically Realistic Cortical Axons and an Application to Electroceutical Modeling</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2020.00013</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Advances in computation and neuronal modeling have enabled the study of entire neural tissue systems with an impressive degree of biological realism. These efforts have focused largely on modeling dendrites and somas while largely neglecting axons. The need for biologically realistic explicit axonal models is particularly clear for applications involving clinical and therapeutic electrical stimulation because axons are generally more excitable than other neuroanatomical subunits. While many modeling efforts can rely on existing repositories of reconstructed dendritic/somatic morphologies to study real cells or to estimate parameters for a generative model, such datasets for axons are scarce and incomplete. Those that do exist may still be insufficient to build accurate models because the increased geometric variability of axons demands a proportional increase in data. To address this need, a Ruled-Optimum Ordered Tree System (ROOTS) was developed that extends the capability of neuronal morphology generative methods to include highly branched cortical axon terminal arbors. Further, this study presents and explores a clear use-case for such models in the prediction of cortical tissue response to externally applied electric fields. The results presented herein comprise (i) a quantitative and qualitative analysis of the generative algorithm proposed, (ii) a comparison of generated fibers with those observed in histological studies, (iii) a study of the requisite spatial and morphological complexity of axonal arbors for accurate prediction of neuronal response to extracellular electrical stimulation, and (iv) an extracellular electrical stimulation strength–duration analysis to explore probable thresholds of excitation of the dentate perforant path under controlled conditions. ROOTS demonstrates a superior ability to capture biological realism in model fibers, allowing improved accuracy in predicting the impact that microscale structures and branching patterns have on spatiotemporal patterns of activity in the presence of extracellular electric fields.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Antidepressant Paroxetine Exerts Developmental Neurotoxicity in an iPSC-Derived 3D Human Brain Model</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00025</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are frequently used to treat depression during pregnancy. Various concerns have been raised about the possible effects of these drugs on fetal development. Current developmental neurotoxicity (DNT) testing conducted in rodents is expensive, time-consuming, and does not necessarily represent human pathophysiology. A human, in vitro testing battery to cover key events of brain development, could potentially overcome these challenges. In this study, we assess the DNT of paroxetine—a widely used SSRI which has shown contradictory evidence regarding effects on human brain development using a versatile, organotypic human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived brain model (BrainSpheres). At therapeutic blood concentrations, which lie between 20 and 60 ng/ml, Paroxetine led to an 80% decrease in the expression of synaptic markers, a 60% decrease in neurite outgrowth and a 40–75% decrease in the overall oligodendrocyte cell population, compared to controls. These results were consistently shown in two different iPSC lines and indicate that relevant therapeutic concentrations of Paroxetine induce brain cell development abnormalities which could lead to adverse effects.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Mechanotransduction Activity Facilitates Hair Cell Toxicity Caused by the Heavy Metal Cadmium</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00037</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Hair cells are sensitive to many insults including environmental toxins such as heavy metals. We show here that cadmium can consistently kill hair cells of the zebrafish lateral line. Disrupting hair cell mechanotransduction genetically or pharmacologically significantly reduces the amount of hair cell death seen in response to cadmium, suggesting a role for mechanotransduction in this cell death process, possibly as a means for cadmium uptake into the cells. Likewise, when looking at multiple cilia-associated gene mutants that have previously been shown to be resistant to aminoglycoside-induced hair cell death, resistance to cadmium-induced hair cell death is only seen in those with mechanotransduction defects. In contrast to what was seen with mechanotransduction, significant protection was not consistently seen from other ions previously shown to compete for cadmium uptake into cells or tissue including zinc and copper. These results show that functional mechanotransduction activity is playing a significant role in cadmium-induced hair cell death.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Filling the Gaps – A Call for Comprehensive Analysis of Extracellular Matrix of the Glial Scar in Region- and Injury-Specific Contexts</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00032</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Central nervous system (CNS) injury results in chronic scar formation that interferes with function and inhibits repair. Extracellular matrix (ECM) is prominent in the scar and potently regulates cell behavior. However, comprehensive information about the ECM proteome is largely lacking, and region- as well as injury-specific differences are often not taken into account. These aspects are the focus of our perspective on injury and scar formation. To highlight the importance of such comprehensive proteome analysis we include data obtained with novel analysis tools of the ECM composition in the scar and show the contribution of monocytes to the ECM composition after traumatic brain injury (TBI). Monocyte invasion was reduced using the CCR2-/- mouse line and step-wise de-cellularization and proteomics allowed determining monocyte-dependent ECM composition and architecture of the glial scar. We find significant reduction in the ECM proteins Tgm1, Itih (1,2, and 3), and Ftl in the absence of monocyte invasion. We also describe the scar ECM comprising zones with distinctive composition and show a subacute signature upon comparison to proteome obtained at earlier times after TBI. These results are discussed in light of injury-, region- and time-specific regulation of scar formation highlighting the urgent need to differentiate injury conditions and CNS-regions using comprehensive ECM analysis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroanatomy | New and Recent Articles: Mapping of Morphine-Induced OPRM1 Gene Expression Pattern in the Adult Zebrafish Brain</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnana.2020.00005</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Morphine is a potent analgesic opiate commonly used in treating pain, and it is also a substance of abuse and highly addictive. Hence, it is vital to discover the action sites of morphine in the brain to increase its efficacy of treatment. In the present study, we aimed at identifying comprehensive neuroanatomical locations that are sensitive to morphine in the adult zebrafish (Danio rerio). We performed in situ hybridization to localize the mu opioid receptor (oprm1) gene and to map the morphine sensitive brain areas using neuronal PAS domain-containing protein 4a (npas4a), an early gene marker. Real-time PCR was used to detect changes in mRNA levels of oprm1 and npas4a in control and acute morphine treated fish (2 mg/L; 20 min). Intense positive oprm1 signals were seen in the telencephalon, preoptic area, habenula, hypothalamic area and periventricular gray zone of the optic tectum. Acute morphine exposure significantly increased oprm1 and npas4a mRNA levels in the medial zone of dorsal telencephalon (Dm), ventral region of the ventral telencephalon (Vv), preoptic area, and in the hypothalamus but a decrease in oprm1 and npas4a signals in the dorsal habenula. This study provides a detailed map of oprm1 localization in the brain, which includes previously unreported oprm1 in the habenula of teleost. Presence of oprm1 in multiple brain sites implies multiple action targets of morphine and potential brain functions which could include reward, cognitive and negative emotions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clinical trials in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) continue to rely on survival or functional scales as endpoints, despite the emergence of quantitative biomarkers. Neuroimaging‐based biomarkers in ALS have been shown to detect ALS‐associated pathology in vivo, although anatomical patterns of disease spread are poorly characterized. The objective of this study is to simulate disease propagation using network analyses of cerebral magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data to predict disease progression.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using brain networks of ALS patients (n = 208) and matched controls across longitudinal time points, network‐based statistics unraveled progressive network degeneration originating from the motor cortex and expanding in a spatiotemporal manner. We applied a computational model to the MRI scan of patients to simulate this progressive network degeneration. Simulated aggregation levels at the group and individual level were validated with empirical impairment observed at later time points of white matter and clinical decline using both internal and external datasets.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We observe that computer‐simulated aggregation levels mimic true disease patterns in ALS patients. Simulated patterns of involvement across cortical areas show significant overlap with the patterns of empirically impaired brain regions on later scans, at both group and individual levels. These findings are validated using an external longitudinal dataset of 30 patients.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our results are in accordance with established pathological staging systems and may have implications for patient stratification in future clinical trials. Our results demonstrate the utility of computational models in ALS to predict disease progression and underscore their potential as a prognostic biomarker. ANN NEUROL 2020&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Passive Coping Strategies During Repeated Social Defeat Are Associated With Long-Lasting Changes in Sleep in Rats</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2020.00006</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Exposure to severe stress has immediate and prolonged neuropsychiatric consequences and increases the risk of developing Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). Importantly, PTSD develops in only a subset of individuals after exposure to a traumatic event, with the understanding of this selective vulnerability being very limited. Individuals who go on to develop PTSD after a traumatic experience typically demonstrate sleep disturbances including persistent insomnia and recurrent trauma-related nightmares. We previously established a repeated social defeat paradigm in which rats segregate into either passively or actively coping subpopulations, and we found that this distinction correlates with measures of vulnerability or resilience to stress. In this study, we examined differences between these two behavioral phenotypes in sleep changes resulting from repeated social defeat stress. Our data indicate that, compared to control and actively coping rats, passively coping rats have less slow-wave sleep (SWS) for at least 2 weeks after the end of a series of exposures to social defeat. Furthermore, resilient rats show less exaggerated motor activation at awakenings from rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and less fragmentation of REM sleep compared to control and passively coping rats. Together, these data associate a passive coping strategy in response to repeated social defeat stress with persisting sleep disturbances. Conversely, an active coping strategy may be associated with resilience to sleep disturbances. These findings may have both prognostic and therapeutic applications to stress-associated neuropsychiatric disorders, including PTSD.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Neural Technology section | New and Recent Articles: Long-Term Home-Use of Sensory-Motor-Integrated Bidirectional Bionic Prosthetic Arms Promotes Functional, Perceptual, and Cognitive Changes</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00120</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Cutaneous sensation is vital to controlling our hands and upper limbs. It helps close the motor control loop by informing adjustments of grasping forces during object manipulations and provides much of the information the brain requires to perceive our limbs as a part of our bodies. This sensory information is absent to upper-limb prosthesis users. Although robotic prostheses are becoming increasingly sophisticated, the absence of feedback imposes a reliance on open-loop control and limits the functional potential as an integrated part of the body. Experimental systems to restore physiologically relevant sensory information to prosthesis users are beginning to emerge. However, the impact of their long-term use on functional abilities, body image, and neural adaptation processes remains unclear. Understanding these effects is essential to transition sensate prostheses from sophisticated assistive tools to integrated replacement limbs. We recruited three participants with high-level upper-limb amputation who previously received targeted reinnervation surgery. Each participant was fit with a neural-machine-interface prosthesis that allowed participants to operate their device by thinking about moving their missing limb. Additionally, we fit a sensory feedback system that allowed participants to experience touch to the prosthesis as touch on their missing limb. All three participants performed a long-term take-home trial. Two participants used their neural-machine-interface systems with touch feedback and one control participant used his prescribed, insensate prosthesis. A series of functional outcome metrics and psychophysical evaluations were performed using sensate neural-machine-interface prostheses before and after the take-home period to capture changes in functional abilities, limb embodiment, and neural adaptation. Our results demonstrated that the relationship between users and sensate neural-machine-interface prostheses is dynamic and changes with long-term use. The presence of touch sensation had a near-immediate impact on how the users operated their prostheses. In the multiple independent measures of users’ functional abilities employed, we observed a spectrum of performance changes following long-term use. Furthermore, after the take-home period, participants more appropriately integrated their prostheses into their body images and psychophysical tests provided strong evidence that neural and cortical adaptation occurred.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;This paper presents a wireless distributed Functional Electrical Stimulation (FES) architecture. It is based on a set of, potentially heterogeneous, distributed stimulation and measurement units managed by a wearable controller.

We show the guaranteed time performances over the network through the control of quadriceps and hamstrings stimulation parameters based on the monitoring of the knee joint angle. Our solution intends to be a tool for researchers and therapists to develop closed-loop control algorithms and strategies for rehabilitation, allowing the design of wearable systems for a daily use context.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Hyposmia has been described as an early symptom that can precede cognitive and motor deficits by decades. Certain regions within the olfactory system, such as the anterior olfactory nucleus, display the neuropathological markers tau and amyloid-β or α-synuclein from the earliest stages of disease progression in a preferential manner. Specific neuronal subpopulations, namely those expressing somatostatin (SST), are preferentially affected throughout the olfactory and limbic systems. SST is a neuropeptide present in a subpopulation of GABAergic interneurons throughout the brain and its main function is to inhibit principal neurons and/or other interneurons. It has been reported that SST expression is reduced by 50% in Alzheimer’s disease and that it is related to the formation of Aβ oligomers. The mechanisms underlying the preferential vulnerability of SST-expressing neurons in Alzheimer’s disease (and, to a minor extent, in Parkinson’s disease) are not known but analysis of the available data could shed light on their etiology. This short review aims to update the knowledge of functional features of somatostatin within the olfactory system and its role in olfactory deficits during neurodegeneration.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Perspectives on Cannabis-Based Therapy of Multiple Sclerosis: A Mini-Review</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00034</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The consistency, efficacy, and safety of cannabis-based medicines have been demonstrated in humans, leading to the approval of the first cannabis-based therapy to alleviate spasticity and pain associated with multiple sclerosis (MS). Indeed, the evidence supporting the therapeutic potential of cannabinoids for the management of pathological events related to this disease is ever increasing. Different mechanisms of action have been proposed for cannabis-based treatments in mouse models of demyelination, such as Experimental Autoimmune Encephalomyelitis (EAE) and Theiler’s Murine Encephalomyelitis Virus-Induced Demyelinating Disease (TMEV-IDD). Cells in the immune and nervous system express the machinery to synthesize and degrade endocannabinoids, as well as their CB1 and CB2 receptors, each mediating different intracellular pathways upon activation. Hence, the effects of cannabinoids on cells of the immune system, on the blood-brain barrier (BBB), microglia, astrocytes, oligodendrocytes and neurons, potentially open the way for a plethora of therapeutic actions on different targets that could aid the management of MS. As such, cannabinoids could have an important impact on the outcome of MS in terms of the resolution of inflammation or the potentiation of endogenous repair in the central nervous system (CNS), as witnessed in the EAE, TMEV-IDD and toxic demyelination models, and through other in vitro approaches. In this mini review article, we summarize what is currently known about the peripheral and central effects of cannabinoids in relation to the neuroinflammation coupled to MS. We pay special attention to their effects on remyelination and axon preservation within the CNS, considering the major questions raised in the field and future research directions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Chaperone Mediated Autophagy Degrades TDP-43 Protein and Is Affected by TDP-43 Aggregation</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2020.00019</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;TAR DNA binding protein 43 kDa (TDP-43) is a ribonuclear protein regulating many aspects of RNA metabolism. Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) and Frontotemporal Lobar Degeneration (FTLD) are fatal neurodegenerative diseases with the presence of TDP-43 aggregates in neuronal cells. Chaperone Mediated Autophagy (CMA) is a lysosomal degradation pathway participating in the proteostasis of several cytosolic proteins including neurodegenerative associated proteins. In addition, protein oligomers or aggregates can affect the status of CMA. In this work, we studied the relationship between CMA and the physiological and pathological forms of TDP-43. First, we found that recombinant TDP-43 was specifically degraded by rat liver’s CMA+ lysosomes and that endogenous TDP-43 is localized in rat brain’s CMA+ lysosomes, indicating that TDP-43 can be a CMA substrate in vivo. Next, by using a previously reported TDP-43 aggregation model, we have shown that wild-type and an aggregate-prone form of TDP-43 are detected in CMA+ lysosomes isolated from cell cultures. In addition, their protein levels increased in cells displaying CMA down-regulation, indicating that these two TDP-43 forms are CMA substrates in vitro. Finally, we observed that the aggregate-prone form of TDP-43 is able to interact with Hsc70, to co-localize with Lamp2A, and to up-regulate the levels of these molecular components of CMA. The latter was followed by an up-regulation of the CMA activity and lysosomal damage. Altogether our data shows that: (i) TDP-43 is a CMA substrate; (ii) CMA can contribute to control the turnover of physiological and pathological forms of TDP-43; and (iii) TDP-43 aggregation can affect CMA performance. Overall, this work contributes to understanding how a dysregulation between CMA and TDP-43 would participate in neuropathological mechanisms associated with TDP-43 aggregation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Integrative Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Diverse Autonomic Nervous System Stress Response Patterns in Childhood Sensory Modulation</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnint.2020.00006</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The specific role of the autonomic nervous system (ANS) in emotional and behavioral regulation—particularly in relation to automatic processes—has gained increased attention in the sensory modulation literature. This mini-review article summarizes current knowledge about the role of the ANS in sensory modulation, with a focus on the integrated functions of the ANS and the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and their measurement. Research from the past decade illustrates that sympathetic and parasympathetic interactions are more complex than previously assumed. Patterns of ANS activation vary across individuals, with distinct physiological response profiles influencing the reactivity underlying automatic behavioral responses. This review article advances a deeper understanding of stress and the complex stress patterns within the ANS and HPA axis that contribute to allostatic load (AL). We argue that using multiple physiological measurements to capture individual ANS response variation is critical for effectively treating children with sensory modulation disorder (SMD) and sensory differences. We consider the relative contributions of automatic vs. deliberately controlled processes across large-scale neural networks in the development of sensorimotor function and their associated links with arousal patterns and sensory over- and under-responsivity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Integrative Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: A Tactile Virtual Reality for the Study of Active Somatosensation</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnint.2020.00005</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Natural exploration of textures involves active sensing, i.e., voluntary movements of tactile sensors (e.g., human fingertips or rodent whiskers) across a target surface. Somatosensory input during moving tactile sensors varies according to both the movement and the surface texture. Combining motor and sensory information, the brain is capable of extracting textural features of the explored surface. Despite the ecological relevance of active sensing, psychophysical studies on active touch are largely missing. One reason for the lack of informative studies investigating active touch is the considerable challenge of assembling an appropriate experimental setup. A possible solution might be in the realm of virtual tactile reality that provides tactile finger stimulation depending on the position of the hand and the simulated texture of a target surface. In addition to rigorous behavioral studies, the investigation of the neuronal mechanisms of active tactile sensing in humans is highly warranted, requiring neurophysiological experiments using electroencephalography (EEG), magnetoencephalography (MEG) and/or functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). However, current neuroimaging techniques impose specific requirements on the tactile stimulus delivery equipment in terms of compatibility with the neurophysiological methods being used. Here, we present a user-friendly, MEG compatible, tactile virtual reality simulator. The simulator consists of a piezo-electric tactile stimulator capable of independently protruding 16 plastic pistons of 1 mm diameter arranged in a 4 × 4 matrix. The stimulator delivers a spatial pattern of tactile stimuli to the tip of a finger depending on the position of the finger moving across a 2-dimensional plane. In order to demonstrate the functionality of the tactile virtual reality, we determined participants’ detection thresholds in active and passive touch conditions. Thresholds in both conditions were higher than reported in the literature. It could well be that the processing of the piston-related stimulation was masked by the sensory input generated by placing the finger on the scanning probe. More so, the thresholds for both the active and passive tasks did not differ significantly. In further studies, the noise introduced by the stimulator in neuromagnetic recordings was quantified and somatosensory evoked fields for active and passive touch were recorded. Due to the compatibility of the stimulator with neuroimaging techniques such as MEG, and based on the feasibility to record somatosensory-related neuromagnetic brain activity the apparatus has immense potential for the exploration of the neural underpinnings of active tactile perception.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Integrative Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Limitations of Standard Accessible Captioning of Sounds and Music for Deaf and Hard of Hearing People: An EEG Study</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnint.2020.00001</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Captioning is the process of transcribing speech and acoustical information into text to help deaf and hard of hearing people accessing to the auditory track of audiovisual media. In addition to the verbal transcription, it includes information such as sound effects, speaker identification, or music tagging. However, it just takes into account a limited spectrum of the whole acoustic information available in the soundtrack, and hence, an important amount of emotional information is lost when attending just to the normative compliant captions. In this article, it is shown, by means of behavioral and EEG measurements, how emotional information related to sounds and music used by the creator in the audiovisual work is perceived differently by normal hearing group and hearing disabled group when applying standard captioning. Audio and captions activate similar processing areas, respectively, in each group, although not with the same intensity. Moreover, captions require higher activation of voluntary attentional circuits, as well as language-related areas. Captions transcribing musical information increase attentional activity, instead of emotional processing.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Brain Imaging Methods section | New and Recent Articles: Assessing Time-Resolved fNIRS for Brain-Computer Interface Applications of Mental Communication</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00105</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) are becoming increasingly popular as a tool to improve the quality of life of patients with disabilities. Recently, time-resolved functional near-infrared spectroscopy (TR-fNIRS) based BCIs are gaining traction because of their enhanced depth sensitivity leading to lower signal contamination from the extracerebral layers. This study presents the first account of TR-fNIRS based BCI for “mental communication” on healthy participants. Twenty-one (21) participants were recruited and were repeatedly asked a series of questions where they were instructed to imagine playing tennis for “yes” and to stay relaxed for “no.” The change in the mean time-of-flight of photons was used to calculate the change in concentrations of oxy- and deoxyhemoglobin since it provides a good compromise between depth sensitivity and signal-to-noise ratio. Features were extracted from the average oxyhemoglobin signals to classify them as “yes” or “no” responses. Linear-discriminant analysis (LDA) and support vector machine (SVM) classifiers were used to classify the responses using the leave-one-out cross-validation method. The overall accuracies achieved for all participants were 75% and 76%, using LDA and SVM, respectively. The results also reveal that there is no significant difference in accuracy between questions. In addition, physiological parameters [heart rate (HR) and mean arterial pressure (MAP)] were recorded on seven of the 21 participants during motor imagery (MI) and rest to investigate changes in these parameters between conditions. No significant difference in these parameters was found between conditions. These findings suggest that TR-fNIRS could be suitable as a BCI for patients with brain injuries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Brain Imaging Methods section | New and Recent Articles: Functional Integration and Segregation in Multiplex Brain Networks for Alzheimer's Disease</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00051</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Growing evidence links impairment of brain functions in Alzheimer's disease (AD) with disruptions of brain functional connectivity. However, whether the AD brain shows similar changes from a dynamic or cross-frequency view remains poorly explored. This paper provides an effective framework to investigate the properties of multiplex brain networks in AD considering inter-frequency and temporal dynamics. Using resting-state EEG signals, two types of multiplex networks were reconstructed separately considering the network interactions between different frequency bands or time points. We further applied multiplex network features to characterize functional integration and segregation of the cross-frequency or time-varying networks. Finally, machine learning methods were employed to evaluate the performance of multiplex-network-based indexes for detection of AD. Results revealed that the brain networks of AD patients are disrupted with reduced segregation particularly in the left occipital area for both cross-frequency and time-varying networks. However, the alteration of integration differs among brain regions and may show an increasing trend in the frontal area of AD brain. By combining the features of integration and segregation in time-varying networks, the best classification performance was achieved with an accuracy of 92.5%. These findings suggest that our multiplex framework can be applied to explore functional integration and segregation of brain networks and characterize the abnormalities of brain function. This may shed new light on the brain network analysis and extend our understanding of brain function in patients with neurological diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Developments of new strategies to restore vision and improving on current strategies by harnessing new advancements in material and electrical sciences, and biological and genetic-based technologies are of upmost health priorities around the world. Federal and private entities are spending billions of dollars on visual prosthetics technologies. This review describes the most current and state-of-the-art bioengineering technologies to restore vision. This includes a thorough description of traditional electrode-based visual prosthetics that have improved substantially since early prototypes. Recent advances in molecular and synthetic biology have transformed vision-assisted technologies; For example, optogenetic technologies that introduce light-responsive proteins offer excellent resolution but cortical applications are restricted by fiber implantation and tissue damage. Other stimulation modalities, such as magnetic fields, have been explored to achieve non-invasive neuromodulation. Miniature magnetic coils are currently being developed to activate select groups of neurons. Magnetically-responsive nanoparticles or exogenous proteins can significantly enhance the coupling between external electromagnetic devices and any neurons affiliated with these modifications. The need to minimize cytotoxic effects for nanoparticle-based therapies will likely restrict the number of usable materials. Nevertheless, advances in identifying and utilizing proteins that respond to magnetic fields may lead to non-invasive, cell-specific stimulation and may overcome many of the limitations that currently exist with other methods. Finally, sensory substitution systems also serve as viable visual prostheses by converting visual input to auditory and somatosensory stimuli. This review also discusses major challenges in the field and offers bioengineering strategies to overcome those.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Adaptive Tuning Curve Widths Improve Sample Efficient Learning</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2020.00012</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Natural brains perform miraculously well in learning new tasks from a small number of samples, whereas sample efficient learning is still a major open problem in the field of machine learning. Here, we raise the question, how the neural coding scheme affects sample efficiency, and make first progress on this question by proposing and analyzing a learning algorithm that uses a simple reinforce-type plasticity mechanism and does not require any gradients to learn low dimensional mappings. It harnesses three bio-plausible mechanisms, namely, population codes with bell shaped tuning curves, continous attractor mechanisms and probabilistic synapses, to achieve sample efficient learning. We show both theoretically and by simulations that population codes with broadly tuned neurons lead to high sample efficiency, whereas codes with sharply tuned neurons account for high final precision. Moreover, a dynamic adaptation of the tuning width during learning gives rise to both, high sample efficiency and high final precision. We prove a sample efficiency guarantee for our algorithm that lies within a logarithmic factor from the information theoretical optimum. Our simulations show that for low dimensional mappings, our learning algorithm achieves comparable sample efficiency to multi-layer perceptrons trained by gradient descent, although it does not use any gradients. Furthermore, it achieves competitive sample efficiency in low dimensional reinforcement learning tasks. From a machine learning perspective, these findings may inspire novel approaches to improve sample efficiency. From a neuroscience perspective, these findings suggest sample efficiency as a yet unstudied functional role of adaptive tuning curve width.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Resonance in the Mouse Ventral Tegmental Area Dopaminergic Network Induced by Regular and Poisson Distributed Optogenetic Stimulation in-vitro</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2020.00011</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Neurons in many brain regions exhibit spontaneous, intrinsic rhythmic firing activity. This rhythmic firing activity may determine the way in which these neurons respond to extrinsic synaptic inputs. We hypothesized that neurons should be most responsive to inputs at the frequency of the intrinsic oscillation frequency. We addressed this question in the ventral tegmental area (VTA), a dopaminergic nucleus in the midbrain. VTA neurons have a unique propensity to exhibit spontaneous intrinsic rhythmic activity in the 1–5 Hz frequency range, which persists in the in-vitro brain slice, and form a network of weakly coupled oscillators. Here, we combine in-vitro simultaneous recording of action potentials from a 60 channel multi-electrode-array with cell-type-specific optogenetic stimulation of the VTA dopamine neurons. We investigated how VTA neurons respond to wide-band stochastic (Poisson input) as well as regular laser pulses. Strong synchrony was induced between the laser input and the spike timing of the neurons, both for regular pulse trains and Poisson pulse trains. For rhythmically pulsed input, the neurons demonstrated resonant behavior with the strongest phase locking at their intrinsic oscillation frequency, but also at half and double the intrinsic oscillation frequency. Stochastic Poisson pulse stimulation provided a more effective stimulation of the entire population, yet we observed resonance at lower frequencies (approximately half the oscillation frequency) than the neurons' intrinsic oscillation frequency. The non-linear filter characteristics of dopamine neurons could allow the VTA to predict precisely timed future rewards based on past sensory inputs, a crucial component of reward prediction error signaling. In addition, these filter characteristics could contribute to a pacemaker role for the VTA in synchronizing activity with other regions like the prefrontal cortex and the hippocampus.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: A Novel Approach for Fully Automatic Intra-Tumor Segmentation With 3D U-Net Architecture for Gliomas</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2020.00010</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Purpose: Gliomas are the most common primary brain malignancies, with varying degrees of aggressiveness and prognosis. Understanding of tumor biology and intra-tumor heterogeneity is necessary for planning personalized therapy and predicting response to therapy. Accurate tumoral and intra-tumoral segmentation on MRI is the first step toward understanding the tumor biology through computational methods. The purpose of this study was to design a segmentation algorithm and evaluate its performance on pre-treatment brain MRIs obtained from patients with gliomas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Materials and Methods: In this study, we have designed a novel 3D U-Net architecture that segments various radiologically identifiable sub-regions like edema, enhancing tumor, and necrosis. Weighted patch extraction scheme from the tumor border regions is proposed to address the problem of class imbalance between tumor and non-tumorous patches. The architecture consists of a contracting path to capture context and the symmetric expanding path that enables precise localization. The Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN) based architecture is trained on 285 patients, validated on 66 patients and tested on 191 patients with Glioma from Brain Tumor Segmentation (BraTS) 2018 challenge dataset. Three dimensional patches are extracted from multi-channel BraTS training dataset to train 3D U-Net architecture. The efficacy of the proposed approach is also tested on an independent dataset of 40 patients with High Grade Glioma from our tertiary cancer center. Segmentation results are assessed in terms of Dice Score, Sensitivity, Specificity, and Hausdorff 95 distance (ITCN intra-tumoral classification network).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Result: Our proposed architecture achieved Dice scores of 0.88, 0.83, and 0.75 for the whole tumor, tumor core and enhancing tumor, respectively, on BraTS validation dataset and 0.85, 0.77, 0.67 on test dataset. The results were similar on the independent patients' dataset from our hospital, achieving Dice scores of 0.92, 0.90, and 0.81 for the whole tumor, tumor core and enhancing tumor, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: The results of this study show the potential of patch-based 3D U-Net for the accurate intra-tumor segmentation. From experiments, it is observed that the weighted patch-based segmentation approach gives comparable performance with the pixel-based approach when there is a thin boundary between tumor subparts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bicaudal D cargo adaptor 2 (BICD2) gene encodes a conserved cargo adapter protein required for dynein‐mediated transport. Inherited and &lt;i&gt;de novo&lt;/i&gt; variants in &lt;i&gt;BICD2&lt;/i&gt; cause spinal muscular atrophy, lower extremity dominant 2 (SMALED2), and a subset have recently been reported to cause severe, often lethal disease. However, a true genotype‐phenotype correlation for &lt;i&gt;BICD2&lt;/i&gt; has not been performed, and cases described to date are scattered among at least 14 publications. In this review, we identify the characteristics of disease‐causing variants in &lt;i&gt;BICD2&lt;/i&gt; that distinguish them from benign variation, and perform genotype‐phenotype correlations for 99 &lt;i&gt;BICD2&lt;/i&gt; variant carriers from 35 families.&lt;/p&gt;

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Tau hyperphosphorylation is an early step in tau‐mediated neurodegeneration and is associated with intracellular aggregation of tau as neurofibrillary tangles, neuronal and synaptic loss, and eventual cognitive dysfunction in Alzheimer disease. Sleep loss increases the cerebrospinal fluid concentration of amyloid‐β and tau. Using mass spectrometry, we measured tau and phosphorylated tau concentrations in serial samples of cerebrospinal fluid collected from participants who were sleep‐deprived, treated with sodium oxybate, or allowed to sleep normally. We found that sleep loss affected phosphorylated tau differently depending on the modified site. These findings suggest a mechanism for sleep loss to increase risk of Alzheimer disease.

	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Novel, highly effective disease‐modifying therapies have revolutionized multiple sclerosis (MS) care. However, evidence from large comparative studies on important safety outcomes, such as cancer, is still lacking.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this nationwide register‐based cohort study, we linked data from the Swedish MS register to the Swedish Cancer Register and other national health care and census registers. We included 4,187 first‐ever initiations of rituximab, 1,620 of fingolimod, and 1,670 of natalizumab in 6,136 MS patients matched for age, sex, and location to 37,801 non‐MS general population subjects. Primary outcome was time to first invasive cancer.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We identified 78 invasive cancers among treated patients: rituximab 33 (incidence rate [IR] per 10,000 person‐years = 34.4, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 23.7–48.3), fingolimod 28 (IR = 44.0, 95% CI = 29.2–63.5), and natalizumab 17 (IR = 26.0, 95% CI = 15.1–41.6). The general population IR was 31.0 (95% CI = 27.8–34.4). Adjusting for baseline characteristics, we found no difference in risk of invasive cancer between rituximab, natalizumab, and the general population but a possibly higher risk with fingolimod compared to the general population (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.53, 95% CI = 0.98–2.38) and rituximab (HR = 1.68, 95% CI = 1.00–2.84).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this first large comparative study of 3 highly effective MS disease‐modifying therapies, no increased risk of invasive cancer was seen with rituximab and natalizumab, compared to the general population. However, there was a borderline‐significant increased risk with fingolimod, compared to both the general population and rituximab. It was not possible to attribute this increased risk to any specific type of cancer, and further studies are warranted to validate these findings. ANN NEUROL 2020&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: Validation of Rapid Magnetic Resonance Myelin Imaging in Multiple Sclerosis</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25705?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is essential for multiple sclerosis diagnostics but is conventionally not specific to demyelination. Myelin imaging is often hampered by long scanning times, complex postprocessing, or lack of clinical approval. This study aimed to assess the specificity, robustness, and clinical value of Rapid Estimation of Myelin for Diagnostic Imaging, a new myelin imaging technique based on time‐efficient simultaneous T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;/T&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; relaxometry and proton density mapping in multiple sclerosis.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rapid myelin imaging was applied using 3T MRI ex vivo in 3 multiple sclerosis brain samples and in vivo in a prospective cohort of 71 multiple sclerosis patients and 21 age/sex‐matched healthy controls, with scan–rescan repeatability in a subcohort. Disability in patients was assessed by the Expanded Disability Status Scale and the Symbol Digit Modalities Test at baseline and 2‐year follow‐up.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rapid myelin imaging correlated with myelin‐related stains (proteolipid protein immunostaining and Luxol fast blue) and demonstrated good precision. Multiple sclerosis patients had, relative to controls, lower normalized whole‐brain and normal‐appearing white matter myelin fractions, which correlated with baseline cognitive and physical disability. Longitudinally, these myelin fractions correlated with follow‐up physical disability, even with correction for baseline disability.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rapid Estimation of Myelin for Diagnostic Imaging provides robust myelin quantification that detects diffuse demyelination in normal‐appearing tissue in multiple sclerosis, which is associated with both cognitive and clinical disability. Because the technique is fast, with automatic postprocessing and US Food and Drug Administration/CE clinical approval, it can be a clinically feasible biomarker that may be suitable to monitor myelin dynamics and evaluate treatments aiming at remyelination.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Monosynaptically-restricted transsynaptic tracing using deletion-mutant rabies virus (RV) has become a widely used technique in neuroscience, allowing identification, imaging, and manipulation of neurons directly presynaptic to a starting neuronal population. Its most common implementation is to use Cre mouse lines in combination with Cre-dependent “helper” adeno-associated viral vectors (AAVs) to supply the required genes to the targeted population before subsequent injection of a first-generation (ΔG) rabies viral vector. Here we show that the efficiency of transsynaptic spread and the degree of nonspecific labeling in wild-type control animals depend strongly on the concentrations of these helper AAVs. Our results suggest practical guidelines for achieving good results.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Peripheral Delta Opioid Receptors Mediate Formoterol Anti-allodynic Effect in a Mouse Model of Neuropathic Pain</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2019.00324</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Neuropathic pain is a challenging condition for which current therapies often remain unsatisfactory. Chronic administration of β2 adrenergic agonists, including formoterol currently used to treat asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, alleviates mechanical allodynia in the sciatic nerve cuff model of neuropathic pain. The limited clinical data currently available also suggest that formoterol would be a suitable candidate for drug repurposing. The antiallodynic action of β2 adrenergic agonists is known to require activation of the delta-opioid (DOP) receptor but better knowledge of the molecular mechanisms involved is necessary. Using a mouse line in which DOP receptors were selectively ablated in neurons expressing Nav1.8 sodium channels (DOP cKO), we showed that these DOP peripheral receptors were necessary for the antiallodynic action of the β2 adrenergic agonist formoterol in the cuff model. Using a knock-in mouse line expressing a fluorescent version of the DOP receptor fused with the enhanced green fluorescent protein (DOPeGFP), we established in a previous study, that mechanical allodynia is associated with a smaller percentage of DOPeGFP positive small peptidergic sensory neurons in dorsal root ganglia (DRG), with a reduced density of DOPeGFP positive free nerve endings in the skin and with increased DOPeGFP expression at the cell surface. Here, we showed that the density of DOPeGFP positive free nerve endings in the skin is partially restored and no increase in DOPeGFP translocation to the plasma membrane is observed in mice in which mechanical pain is alleviated upon chronic oral administration of formoterol. This study, therefore, extends our previous results by confirming that changes in the mechanical threshold are associated with changes in peripheral DOP profile. It also highlights the common impact on DOP receptors between serotonin noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors such as duloxetine and the β2 mimetic formoterol.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Integrative Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Predicting Empathy From Resting State Brain Connectivity: A Multivariate Approach</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnint.2020.00003</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Recent task fMRI studies suggest that individual differences in trait empathy and empathic concern are mediated by patterns of connectivity between self-other resonance and top-down control networks that are stable across task demands. An untested implication of this hypothesis is that these stable patterns of connectivity should be visible even in the absence of empathy tasks. Using machine learning, we demonstrate that patterns of resting state fMRI connectivity (i.e. the degree of synchronous BOLD activity across multiple cortical areas in the absence of explicit task demands) of resonance and control networks predict trait empathic concern (n = 58). Empathic concern was also predicted by connectivity patterns within the somatomotor network. These findings further support the role of resonance-control network interactions and of somatomotor function in our vicariously driven concern for others. Furthermore, a practical implication of these results is that it is possible to assess empathic predispositions in individuals without needing to perform conventional empathy assessments.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Brain Imaging Methods section | New and Recent Articles: Using Mobile EEG to Investigate Alpha and Beta Asymmetries During Hand and Foot Use</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00109</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The Edinburgh Handedness Inventory (EHI) and the Waterloo Footedness Questionnaire (WFQ) are two of the most widely used questionnaires to assess lateralized everyday behavior in human participants. However, it is unclear to what extent the specific behavior assessed in these questionnaires elicit lateralized neural activity when performed in real-life situations. To illuminate this unresolved issue, we assessed EEG alpha and beta asymmetries during real-life performance of the behaviors assessed in the EHI and WFQ using a mobile EEG system. This methodology provides high ecological validity for studying neural correlates of motor behavior under more naturalistic conditions. Our results indicate that behavioral performance of items of both the EHI and WFQ differentiate between left- and right-handers and left- and right-footers on the neural level, especially in the alpha frequency band. These results were unaffected by movement parameters. Furthermore, we could demonstrate that neural activity elicited specifically during left-sided task performance provides predictive power for the EHI or WFQ score of the participants. Overall, our results show that these prominent questionnaires not only distinguish between different motor preferences on the behavioral level, but also on the neurophysiological level. Furthermore, we could show that mobile EEG systems are a powerful tool to investigate motor asymmetries in ecologically valid situations outside of the laboratory setting. Future research should focus on other lateralized behavioral phenotypes in real-life settings to provide more insights into lateralized motor functions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fninf.2020.00006</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The main hypothesis of this work is that the time of delay in reaction to an unexpected event can be predicted on the basis of the brain activity recorded prior to that event. Such mental activity can be represented by electroencephalographic data. To test this hypothesis, we conducted a novel experiment involving 19 participants that took part in a 2-h long session of simulated aircraft flights. An EEG signal processing pipeline is proposed that consists of signal preprocessing, extracting bandpass features, and using regression to predict the reaction times. The prediction algorithms that are used in this study are the Least Absolute Shrinkage Operator and its Least Angle Regression modification, as well as Kernel Ridge and Radial Basis Support Vector Machine regression. The average Mean Absolute Error obtained across the 19 subjects was 114 ms. The present study demonstrates, for the first time, that it is possible to predict reaction times on the basis of EEG data. The presented solution can serve as a foundation for a system that can, in the future, increase the safety of air traffic.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Segmenting Brain Tumor Using Cascaded V-Nets in Multimodal MR Images</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2020.00009</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In this work, we propose a novel cascaded V-Nets method to segment brain tumor substructures in multimodal brain magnetic resonance imaging. Although V-Net has been successfully used in many segmentation tasks, we demonstrate that its performance could be further enhanced by using a cascaded structure and ensemble strategy. Briefly, our baseline V-Net consists of four levels with encoding and decoding paths and intra- and inter-path skip connections. Focal loss is chosen to improve performance on hard samples as well as balance the positive and negative samples. We further propose three preprocessing pipelines for multimodal magnetic resonance images to train different models. By ensembling the segmentation probability maps obtained from these models, segmentation result is further improved. In other hand, we propose to segment the whole tumor first, and then divide it into tumor necrosis, edema, and enhancing tumor. Experimental results on BraTS 2018 online validation set achieve average Dice scores of 0.9048, 0.8364, and 0.7748 for whole tumor, tumor core and enhancing tumor, respectively. The corresponding values for BraTS 2018 online testing set are 0.8761, 0.7953, and 0.7364, respectively. We also evaluate the proposed method in two additional data sets from local hospitals comprising of 28 and 28 subjects, and the best results are 0.8635, 0.8036, and 0.7217, respectively. We further make a prediction of patient overall survival by ensembling multiple classifiers for long, mid and short groups, and achieve accuracy of 0.519, mean square error of 367240 and Spearman correlation coefficient of 0.168 for BraTS 2018 online testing set.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25700?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is not known whether patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) with ischemic stroke despite oral anticoagulant therapy are at increased risk for further recurrent strokes or how ongoing secondary prevention should be managed.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We conducted an individual patient data pooled analysis of 7 prospective cohort studies that recruited patients with AF and recent cerebral ischemia. We compared patients taking oral anticoagulants (vitamin K antagonists [VKA] or direct oral anticoagulants [DOAC]) prior to index event (OAC&lt;sub&gt;prior&lt;/sub&gt;) with those without prior oral anticoagulation (OAC&lt;sub&gt;naive&lt;/sub&gt;). We further compared those who changed the type (ie, from VKA or DOAC, vice versa, or DOAC to DOAC) of anticoagulation (OAC&lt;sub&gt;changed&lt;/sub&gt;) with those who continued the same anticoagulation as secondary prevention (OAC&lt;sub&gt;unchanged&lt;/sub&gt;). Time to recurrent acute ischemic stroke (AIS) was analyzed using multivariate competing risk Fine–Gray models to calculate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We included 5,413 patients (median age = 78 years [interquartile range (IQR) = 71–84 years]; 5,136 [96.7%] had ischemic stroke as the index event, median National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale on admission = 6 [IQR = 2–12]). The median CHA&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;DS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;‐Vasc score (congestive heart failure, hypertension, age≥ 75 years, diabetes mellitus, stroke/transient ischemic attack, vascular disease, age 65–74 years, sex category) was 5 (IQR = 4–6) and was similar for OAC&lt;sub&gt;prior&lt;/sub&gt; (n = 1,195) and OAC&lt;sub&gt;naive&lt;/sub&gt; (n = 4,119, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.103). During 6,128 patient‐years of follow‐up, 289 patients had AIS (4.7% per year, 95% CI = 4.2–5.3%). OAC&lt;sub&gt;prior&lt;/sub&gt; was associated with an increased risk of AIS (HR = 1.6, 95% CI = 1.2–2.3, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.005). OAC&lt;sub&gt;changed&lt;/sub&gt; (n = 307) was not associated with decreased risk of AIS (HR = 1.2, 95% CI = 0.7–2.1, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.415) compared with OAC&lt;sub&gt;unchanged&lt;/sub&gt; (n = 585).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patients with AF who have an ischemic stroke despite previous oral anticoagulation are at a higher risk for recurrent ischemic stroke despite a CHA&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;DS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;‐Vasc score similar to those without prior oral anticoagulation. Better prevention strategies are needed for this high‐risk patient group. ANN NEUROL 2020&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25699?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Antibodies against neuronal N‐methyl‐D‐aspartate receptors (NMDARs) in patients with anti‐NMDAR encephalitis alter neuronal synaptic function and plasticity, but the effects on other cells of the nervous system are unknown.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients with anti‐NMDAR encephalitis (preabsorbed or not with GluN1) and a human NMDAR‐specific monoclonal antibody (SSM5) derived from plasma cells of a patient, along the corresponding controls, were used in the studies. To evaluate the activity of oligodendrocyte NMDARs and α‐amino‐3‐hydroxy‐5‐methyl‐4‐isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptors in vitro after exposure to patients' CSF antibodies or SSM5, we used a functional assay based on cytosolic Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; imaging. Expression of the glucose transporter (GLUT1) in oligodendrocytes was assessed by immunocytochemistry.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NMDAR agonist responses were robustly reduced after preincubation of oligodendrocytes with patients' CSF or SSM5 but remained largely unaltered with the corresponding controls. These effects were NMDAR specific, as patients' CSF did not alter responses to AMPA receptor agonists and was abrogated by preabsorption of CSF with HEK cells expressing GluN1 subunit. Patients' CSF also reduced oligodendrocyte expression of glucose transporter GLUT1 induced by NMDAR activity.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Antibodies from patients with anti‐NMDAR encephalitis specifically alter the function of NMDARs in oligodendrocytes, causing a decrease of expression of GLUT1. Considering that normal GLUT1 expression in oligodendrocytes and myelin is needed to metabolically support axonal function, the findings suggest a link between antibody‐mediated dysfunction of NMDARs in oligodendrocytes and the white matter alterations reported in patients with this disorder.
