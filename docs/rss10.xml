Quantum computing, a computational paradigm exploiting the unique properties of quantum mechanical analogs of classical bits, seeks to address many of these challenges. We discuss the potential for quantum computing to aid in the merging of insights across different areas of biological sciences.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/nmeth/rss/current/~4/j-6G3qZlPac&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>The Cerebellum: Post-symptomatic Delivery of Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) Ameliorates Spinocerebellar Ataxia Type 1 (SCA1) Pathogenesis</title>

	<content:encoded>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1) is a fatal neurodegenerative disease caused by an abnormal expansion of CAG repeats in the &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Ataxin1&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;ATXN1&lt;/em&gt;) gene. SCA1 is characterized by motor deficits, cerebellar neurodegeneration, and gliosis and gene expression changes. Expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), growth factor important for the survival and function of cerebellar neurons, is decreased in &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;ATXN1[82Q]&lt;/em&gt; mice, the Purkinje neuron specific transgenic mouse model of SCA1. As this decrease in BDNF expression may contribute to cerebellar neurodegeneration, we tested whether delivery of extrinsic human BDNF via osmotic ALZET pumps has a beneficial effect on disease severity in this mouse model of SCA1. Additionally, to test the effects of BDNF on established and progressing cerebellar pathogenesis and motor deficits, we delivered BDNF post-symptomatically. We have found that post-symptomatic delivery of extrinsic BDNF ameliorated motor deficits and cerebellar pathology (i.e., dendritic atrophy of Purkinje cells, and astrogliosis) indicating therapeutic potential of BDNF even after the onset of symptoms in SCA1. However, BDNF did not alter Purkinje cell gene expression changes indicating that certain aspects of disease pathogenesis cannot be ameliorated/slowed down with BDNF and that combinational therapies may be needed.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Interactions among cellular components forming a mesoscopic scale brain network (microcircuit) display characteristic neural dynamics. Analysis of microcircuits provides a system-level understanding of the neurobiology of health and disease. Causal discovery aims to detect causal relationships among variables based on observational data. A key barrier in causal discovery is the high dimensionality of the variable space. A method called Causal Inference for Microcircuits (CAIM) is proposed to reconstruct causal networks from calcium imaging or electrophysiology time series. CAIM combines neural recording, Bayesian network modeling, and neuron clustering. Validation experiments based on simulated data and a real-world reaching task dataset demonstrated that CAIM accurately revealed causal relationships among neural clusters.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Patients with early-onset Parkinson’s disease (EOPD) often suffer from more frequent depression than those with late-onset Parkinson’s disease (LOPD). However, the clinical characteristics of suicidal ideation (SI) in EOPD remains unknown. This study aimed to explore the prevalence, related factors, and predictive factors of SI in EOPD patients as well as comparison of the prevalence in LOPD patients.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec2&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Methods&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;We conducted a case–control, cross-sectional, and longitudinal study. Propensity score matching (PSM) was used to balance the characteristics between EOPD (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;N&lt;/em&gt; = 577) and LOPD patients (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;N&lt;/em&gt; = 2973). The diagnosis of SI was based on the assessment of the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). EOPD patients with a disease duration &amp;lt; 5 years (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;N&lt;/em&gt; = 96) were prospectively followed-up for exploring the predictors for the development of SI. Two forward binary logistic regression models were respectively used to explore the associated and predictive factors of SI.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec3&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;After PSM, EOPD patients showed significantly higher prevalence of SI than LOPD patients (22.0 vs. 13.3%, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001). Twenty EOPD patients (20.8%) developed SI and none of them reported suicidal behaviors after a median of 2.7 (IQR = 1.6–4.1) years. Depression, dyskinesia, non-smoking, lower education, and higher Non-Motor Symptoms Scale (NMSS) score were independently associated with the presence of SI. Depression at baseline was the only independent risk factor for the future occurrence of SI.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;

	<title>Experimental Brain Research: A priming study on naming real versus pictures of tools</title>
	<link>http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s00221-020-06015-2</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;There is a growing body of literature demonstrating the relationship between the activation of sensorimotor processes in object recognition. It is unclear, however, if these processes are influenced by the differences in how real (3D) tools and two-dimensional (2D) images of tools are processed by the brain. Here, we examined if these differences could influence the naming of tools. Participants were presented with a prime stimulus that was either a picture of a tool, or a real tool, followed by a target stimulus that was always a real tool. They were then required to name each tool as they appeared. The functional use action required by the target tool was either the same (i.e., squeegee–paint roller) or different (i.e. knife–whisk) to the prime. We found that the format in which the prime tool was presented (i.e., a picture or real tool) had no influence on the participants’ response times to naming the target tool. Furthermore, participants were faster at naming target tools relative to prime tools when the exact same tool was presented as both the prime and target. There was no difference in response times to naming the target tool relative to the prime when they were different tools, regardless of whether the tools’ functional actions were the same or different. We also found more errors in naming target tools relative to the primes when different tools had a different functional action compared to when the same tool was presented as both the prime and the target. Taken together, our results highlight that the functional actions associated with tools do not facilitate or interfere with the recognition of tools for the purposes of naming. The theoretical implications of these results are discussed.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Experimental Brain Research: Dual-tDCS over the right prefrontal cortex does not modulate stop-signal task performance</title>
	<link>http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s00221-020-05995-5</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Stopping an already initiated action is crucial for human everyday behavior and empirical evidence points toward the prefrontal cortex playing a key role in response inhibition. Two regions that have been consistently implicated in response inhibition are the right inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) and the more superior region of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). The present study targets both regions with non-invasive brain stimulation to investigate their role in response inhibition. Thus dual-prefrontal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) was applied to both IFG and DLPFC in a repeated measures design and compared to sham tDCS. Specifically, 9 cm&lt;sup class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; electrodes were positioned over both IFG and DLPFC in all groups. The active stimulation groups received off-line, anodal or cathodal tDCS over the IFG and opposite polarity tDCS of the DLPFC, while the sham stimulation group received short stimulation at the start, middle and end of the supposed 20-min stimulation period. Before and after tDCS, subjects’ inhibition capabilities were probed using the stop-signal task (SST). In a final sample of &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;N&lt;/em&gt; = 45, participants were randomly split into three groups and received three different stimulation protocols. Results indicated that dual-frontal tDCS did not influence performance as compared to sham stimulation. This null result was confirmed using Bayesian analysis. This result is discussed against the background of the limitations of the present study as well as the potential theoretical implications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: Malaria parasites use a soluble RhopH complex for erythrocyte invasion and an integral form for nutrient uptake</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/65282</link>
	<content:encoded>Malaria parasites use the RhopH complex for erythrocyte invasion and channel-mediated nutrient uptake. As the member proteins are unique to &lt;i&gt;Plasmodium &lt;/i&gt;spp., how they interact and traffic through subcellular sites to serve these essential functions is unknown. We show that RhopH is synthesized as a soluble complex of CLAG3, RhopH2, and RhopH3 with 1:1:1 stoichiometry. After transfer to a new host cell, the complex crosses a vacuolar membrane surrounding the intracellular parasite and becomes integral to the erythrocyte membrane through a PTEX translocon-dependent process. We present a 2.9 Å single-particle cryo-electron microscopy structure of the trafficking complex, revealing that CLAG3 interacts with the other subunits over large surface areas. This soluble complex is tightly assembled with extensive disulfide bonding and predicted transmembrane helices shielded. We propose a large protein complex stabilized for trafficking but poised for host membrane insertion through large-scale rearrangements, paralleling smaller two-state pore-forming proteins in other organisms.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: The vascular niche controls Drosophila hematopoiesis via fibroblast growth factor signaling</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/64672</link>
	<content:encoded>In adult mammals, hematopoiesis, the production of blood cells from hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs), is tightly regulated by extrinsic signals from the microenvironment called ‘niche’. Bone marrow HSPCs are heterogeneous and controlled by both endosteal and vascular niches. The Drosophila hematopoietic lymph gland is located along the cardiac tube which corresponds to the vascular system. In the lymph gland, the niche called Posterior Signaling Center controls only a subset of the heterogeneous hematopoietic progenitor population indicating that additional signals are necessary. Here we report that the vascular system acts as a second niche to control lymph gland homeostasis. The FGF ligand Branchless produced by vascular cells activates the FGF pathway in hematopoietic progenitors. By regulating intracellular calcium levels, FGF signaling maintains progenitor pools and prevents blood cell differentiation. This study reveals that two niches contribute to the control &lt;i&gt;of&lt;/i&gt;Drosophila blood cell homeostasis through their differential regulation of progenitors.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: SARS-CoV-2 entry into human airway organoids is serine protease-mediated and facilitated by the multibasic cleavage site</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/64508</link>
	<content:encoded>Coronavirus entry is mediated by the spike protein which binds the receptor and mediates fusion after cleavage by host proteases. The proteases that mediate entry differ between cell lines and it is currently unclear which proteases are relevant &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. A remarkable feature of the SARS-CoV-2 spike is the presence of a multibasic cleavage site (MBCS), which is absent in the SARS-CoV spike. Here, we report that the SARS-CoV-2 spike MBCS increases infectivity on human airway organoids (hAOs). Compared with SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 entered faster into Calu-3 cells, and more frequently formed syncytia in hAOs. Moreover, the MBCS increased entry speed and plasma membrane serine protease usage relative to cathepsin-mediated endosomal entry. Blocking serine proteases, but not cathepsins, effectively inhibited SARS-CoV-2 entry and replication in hAOs. Our findings demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 enters relevant airway cells using serine proteases, and suggest that the MBCS is an adaptation to this viral entry strategy.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/63907</link>
	<content:encoded>Retinal structure and function have been studied in many vertebrate orders, but molecular characterization has been largely confined to mammals. We used single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to generate a cell atlas of the chick retina. We identified 136 cell types plus 14 positional or developmental intermediates distributed among the six classes conserved across vertebrates – photoreceptor, horizontal, bipolar, amacrine, retinal ganglion and glial cells. To assess morphology of molecularly defined types, we adapted a method for CRISPR-based integration of reporters into selectively expressed genes. For Müller glia, we found that transcriptionally distinct cells were regionally localized along the anterior-posterior, dorsal-ventral and central-peripheral retinal axes. We also identified immature photoreceptor, horizontal cell and oligodendrocyte types that persist into late embryonic stages. Finally, we analyzed relationships among chick, mouse and primate retinal cell classes and types. Our results provide a foundation for anatomical, physiological, evolutionary, and developmental studies of the avian visual system.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: Dentate gyrus development requires a cortical hem-derived astrocytic scaffold</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/63904</link>
	<content:encoded>During embryonic development, radial glial cells give rise to neurons, then to astrocytes following the gliogenic switch. Timely regulation of the switch, operated by several transcription factors, is fundamental for allowing coordinated interactions between neurons and glia. We deleted the gene for one such factor, SOX9&lt;i&gt;,&lt;/i&gt; early during mouse brain development and observed a significantly compromised dentate gyrus (DG). We dissected the origin of the defect, targeting embryonic &lt;i&gt;Sox9&lt;/i&gt; deletion to either the DG neuronal progenitor domain or the adjacent cortical hem (CH). We identified in the latter previously uncharacterized ALDH1L1+ astrocytic progenitors, which form a fimbrial-specific glial scaffold necessary for neuronal progenitor migration towards the developing DG. Our results highlight an early crucial role of SOX9 for DG development through regulation of astroglial potential acquisition in the CH. Moreover, we illustrate how formation of a local network, amidst astrocytic and neuronal progenitors originating from adjacent domains, underlays brain morphogenesis.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: Rapid adaptation to malaria facilitated by admixture in the human population of Cabo Verde</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/63177</link>
	<content:encoded>Humans have undergone large migrations over the past hundreds to thousands of years, exposing ourselves to new environments and selective pressures. Yet, evidence of ongoing or recent selection in humans is difficult to detect. Many of these migrations also resulted in gene flow between previously separated populations. These recently admixed populations provide unique opportunities to study rapid evolution in humans. Developing methods based on distributions of local ancestry, we demonstrate that this sort of genetic exchange has facilitated detectable adaptation to a malaria parasite in the admixed population of Cabo Verde within the last ~20 generations. We estimate the selection coefficient is approximately 0.08, one of the highest inferred in humans. Notably, we show that this strong selection at a single locus has likely affected patterns of ancestry genome-wide, potentially biasing demographic inference. Our study provides evidence of adaptation in a human population on historical timescales.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/62810</link>
	<content:encoded>Human oral soft tissues provide the first barrier of defence against chronic inflammatory disease and hold a remarkable scarless wounding phenotype. Tissue homeostasis requires coordinated actions of epithelial, mesenchymal, and immune cells. However, the extent of heterogeneity within the human oral mucosa and how tissue cell types are affected during the course of disease progression is unknown. Using single-cell transcriptome profiling we reveal a striking remodelling of the epithelial and mesenchymal niches with a decrease in functional populations that are linked to the aetiology of the disease. Analysis of ligand–receptor interaction pairs identify potential intercellular hubs driving the inflammatory component of the disease. Our work establishes a reference map of the human oral mucosa in health and disease, and a framework for the development of new therapeutic strategies.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: Reconsidering the evidence for learning in single cells</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/61907</link>
	<content:encoded>The question of whether single cells can learn led to much debate in the early 20th century. The view prevailed that they were capable of non-associative learning but not of associative learning, such as Pavlovian conditioning. Experiments indicating the contrary were considered either non-reproducible or subject to more acceptable interpretations. Recent developments suggest that the time is right to reconsider this consensus. We exhume the experiments of Beatrice Gelber on Pavlovian conditioning in the ciliate &lt;i&gt;Paramecium aurelia&lt;/i&gt;, and suggest that criticisms of her findings can now be reinterpreted. Gelber was a remarkable scientist whose absence from the historical record testifies to the prevailing orthodoxy that single cells cannot learn. Her work, and more recent studies, suggest that such learning may be evolutionarily more widespread and fundamental to life than previously thought and we discuss the implications for different aspects of biology.</content:encoded>

The canonical model is that 3:3 interactions between SUN and KASH proteins underlie the nucleocytoskeletal linkages provided by the LINC complex. Here, we provide crystallographic and biophysical evidence that SUN-KASH is a constitutive 6:6 complex in which two constituent 3:3 complexes interact head-to-head. A common SUN-KASH topology is achieved through structurally diverse 6:6 interaction mechanisms by distinct KASH proteins, including zinc-coordination by Nesprin-4. The SUN-KASH 6:6 interface provides a molecular mechanism for the establishment of integrative and distributive connections between 3:3 structures within a branched LINC complex network. In this model, SUN-KASH 6:6 complexes act as nodes for force distribution and integration between adjacent SUN and KASH molecules, enabling the coordinated transduction of large forces across the nuclear envelope.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: Human complex exploration strategies are enriched by noradrenaline-modulated heuristics</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/59907</link>
	<content:encoded>An exploration-exploitation trade-off, the arbitration between sampling a lesser-known against a known rich option, is thought to be solved using computationally demanding exploration algorithms. Given known limitations in human cognitive resources, we hypothesised the presence of additional cheaper strategies. We examined for such heuristics in choice behaviour where we show this involves a value-free random exploration, that ignores all prior knowledge, and a novelty exploration that targets novel options alone. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled drug study, assessing contributions of dopamine (400mg amisulpride) and noradrenaline (40mg propranolol), we show that value-free random exploration is attenuated under the influence of propranolol, but not under amisulpride. Our findings demonstrate that humans deploy distinct computationally cheap exploration strategies and where value-free random exploration is under noradrenergic control.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: Epithelial colonies in vitro elongate through collective effects</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/57730</link>
	<content:encoded>Epithelial tissues of the developing embryos elongate by different mechanisms, such as neighbor exchange, cell elongation, and oriented cell division. Since autonomous tissue self-organization is influenced by external cues such as morphogen gradients or neighboring tissues, it is difficult to distinguish intrinsic from directed tissue behavior. The mesoscopic processes leading to the different mechanisms remain elusive. Here, we study the spontaneous elongation behavior of spreading circular epithelial colonies in vitro. By quantifying deformation kinematics at multiple scales, we report that global elongation happens primarily due to cell elongations, and its direction correlates with the anisotropy of the average cell elongation. By imposing an external time-periodic stretch, the axis of this global symmetry breaking can be modified and elongation occurs primarily due to orientated neighbor exchange. These different behaviors are confirmed using a vertex model for collective cell behavior, providing a framework for understanding autonomous tissue elongation and its origins.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a devastating disease. Although rigorous efforts identified the presence of 'cancer stem cells (CSCs)' in PDAC and molecular markers for them, stem cell dynamics &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; have not been clearly demonstrated. Here we focused on Doublecortin-like kinase 1 (Dclk1), known as a CSC marker of PDAC. Using genetic lineage tracing with a dual-recombinase system and live imaging, we showed that Dclk1&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; tumor cells continuously provided progeny cells within pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia, primary and metastatic PDAC and PDAC-derived spheroids &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; and&lt;i&gt; in vitro&lt;/i&gt;. Furthermore, genes associated with CSC and epithelial mesenchymal transition were enriched in mouse Dclk1&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and human DCLK1-high PDAC cells. Thus, we provided direct functional evidence for the stem cell activity of Dclk1&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cells &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;, revealing the essential roles of Dclk1&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cells in expansion of pancreatic neoplasia in all progressive stages.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/54618</link>
	<content:encoded>Skin epithelium can accumulate a high burden of oncogenic mutations without morphological or functional consequences. To investigate the mechanism of oncogenic tolerance, we induced Hras&lt;sup&gt;G12V&lt;/sup&gt; in single murine epidermal cells and followed them long-term. We observed that Hras&lt;sup&gt;G12V&lt;/sup&gt; promotes an early and transient clonal expansion driven by increased progenitor renewal that is replaced with an increase in progenitor differentiation leading to reduced growth. We attribute this dynamic effect to emergence of two populations within oncogenic clones: renewing progenitors along the edge and differentiating ones within the central core. As clone expansion is accompanied by progressive enlargement of the core and diminishment of the edge compartment, the intra-clonal competition between the two populations results in stabilized oncogenic growth. To identify the molecular mechanism of Hras&lt;sup&gt;G12V&lt;/sup&gt;-driven differentiation, we screened known Ras-effector &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;, and identified Rassf5 as a novel regulator of progenitor fate choice that is necessary and sufficient for oncogene-specific differentiation.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.04.425168v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>There are experimental data that mixed anxiety/depression-like state induced by chronic social defeat stress is accompanied by development of anxiety and downregulation of serotonergic gene expression in the midbrain raphe nuclei of male mice. The paper aimed to study the effect of chronic lithium chloride (LiCl) on anxious behaviors and the expression of serotonergic genes (Tph2, Slc6a4, Htr1a, Htr5b) in the midbrain raphe nuclei of defeated mice. Slight anxiolytic effects of LiCl were found on the commucativeness in the partition test, and anxiogenic-like effects, estimated by the elevated plus-maze and social interactions tests. Chronic LiCl treatment induced overexpression of the serotonergic genes in the midbrain raphe nuclei of defeated mice. We can assume that effects of LiCl, rather anxiogenic, may be due to activation of serotonergic system induced by hyperexpression of serotonergic genes. Our findings will allow to understand the factors involved in the positive and side effects of lithium on anxiety and function of serotonergic genes which are involved into mechanisms of depression.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.04.425114v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>In uncertain environments, seeking information about the accuracy of alternative strategies is essential for adapting behaviour to changes in task contingencies. However, information seeking often co-occurs with changes-of-mind about the perceived accuracy of the current strategy, making it difficult to isolate its specific mechanisms. Here we leveraged the fact that genuine information seeking requires instrumental control to study its cognitive signatures in an adaptive decision-making task tested with and without control. We found that changes-of-mind occurring in controllable environments require more evidence against the current strategy, are associated with reduced confidence, but are nevertheless more likely to be confirmed on the next decision. Computational modelling explained these effects of information seeking through a decrease in the perceived volatility of controllable environments, resulting in stronger and more prolonged effects of changes-of-mind on cognition and behaviour. Together, these findings explain the high degree of subjective uncertainty associated with information seeking.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Aversive memories are long-lasting and prone to have adverse effects on our emotional wellbeing and mental health. Yet, how to remedy the maladaptive effects of aversive memories remains elusive. Using memory reactivation and emotional updating manipulations, we investigated how positive and neutral emotion updates aversive memories for reconsolidation in humans. We found that positive updating after reactivation was equivalent to neutral updating in altering true memories of the aversive story, but introduced more false memory. Moreover, an additional 12 hours of sleep reconsolidation did not further enlarge true memory differences, but attenuated the effect of reactivation and updating on false memory. Interestingly, the neutral rather than the positive updating reduced the emotional arousal of the aversive memory 24 hours later. Our findings provide novel insights into real-world therapeutic applications regarding how updating with positive and neutral emotion may reshape aversive memories, especially when taking wake- and sleep-filled reconsolidation into account.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.04.424105v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Locomotion requires neural computations to maintain stable perception of the world despite disturbing consequences of the motor behavior on sensory stability. The developmental establishment of locomotor proficiency is therefore accompanied by a concurrent maturation of gaze-stabilizing motor behaviors. Using developing larval Xenopus, we demonstrate mutual plasticity of predictive spinal locomotor efference copies and multi-sensory motion signals with the aim to constantly ensure dynamically adequate eye movements during swimming. Following simultaneous ontogenetic onsets of locomotion, spino-ocular, optokinetic and otolith-ocular motor behaviors, locomotor efference copy-driven eye movements improve through gradually augmenting influences of semicircular canal signals. Accordingly, neuronal computations change from a predominating cancelation of angular vestibulo-ocular reflexes by locomotor efference copies in young larvae to a summation of these signals in older larvae. The developmental switch occurs in synchrony with a reduced efficacy of the tail-undulatory locomotor pattern generator causing gradually decaying influences on the ocular motor output.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Aberrant Dynamic Functional Connectivity of Default Mode Network in Schizophrenia and Links to Symptom Severity</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.03.425152v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Background: Schizophrenia affects around 1% of the global population. Functional connectivity extracted from resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) has previously been used to study schizophrenia and has great potential to provide novel insights into the disorder. Some studies have shown abnormal functional connectivity in the default mode network of individuals with schizophrenia, and more recent studies have shown abnormal dynamic functional connectivity (dFC) in individuals with schizophrenia. However, DMN dFC and the link between abnormal DMN dFC and symptom severity have not been well characterized. Method: Resting-state fMRI data from subjects with schizophrenia (SZ) and healthy controls (HC) across two datasets were analyzed independently. We captured seven maximally independent subnodes in the DMN by applying group independent component analysis and estimated dFC between subnode time courses using a sliding window approach. A clustering method separated the dFCs into five reoccurring brain states. A feature selection method modeled the difference between SZs and HCs using the state-specific FC features. Finally, we used the transition probability of a hidden Markov model to characterize the link between symptom severity and dFC in SZ subjects. Results: We found decreases in the connectivity of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and increases in the connectivity between the precuneus (PCu) and the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) (i.e., PCu/PCC) of SZ subjects. In SZ, the transition probability from a state with weaker PCu/PCC and stronger ACC connectivity to a state with stronger PCu/PCC and weaker ACC connectivity increased with symptom severity. Conclusions: To our knowledge, this was the first study to investigate DMN dFC and its link to schizophrenia symptom severity. We identified reproducible neural states in a data-driven manner and demonstrated that the strength of connectivity within those states differed between SZs and HCs. Additionally, we identified a relationship between SZ symptom severity and the dynamics of DMN functional connectivity. We validated our results across two datasets. These results support the potential of dFC for use as a biomarker of schizophrenia and shed new light upon the relationship between schizophrenia and DMN dynamics.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.03.425136v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Although prion infections cause cognitive impairment and neuronal death, transcriptional and translational profiling shows progressive derangement within glia but surprisingly little changes within neurons. Here we expressed PrPC selectively in neurons, astrocytes or oligodendrocytes of mice. After prion infection, both astrocyte and neuron-restricted PrPC expression led to copious brain accumulation of PrPSc. As expected, neuron-restricted expression was associated with typical prion disease. However, mice with astrocyte-restricted PrPC expression experienced a normal life span, did not develop clinical disease, and did not show astro- or microgliosis. Besides confirming that PrPSc is innocuous to PrPC-deficient neurons, these results show that astrocyte-born PrPSc does not activate the extreme neuroinflammation that accompanies the onset of prion disease and precedes any molecular changes of neurons. This points to a nonautonomous mechanism by which prion-infected neurons instruct astrocytes and microglia to acquire a specific cellular status that, in turn, drives neural dysfunction.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.03.425122v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>The development of novel techniques for the in vivo, non-invasive visualization and identification of thalamic nuclei has represented a major challenge for human neuroimaging research in the last decades. Thalamic nuclei have important implications in various key aspects of brain physiology and many of them show selective alterations in various neurologic and psychiatric disorders. In addition, both surgical stimulation and ablation of specific thalamic nuclei have been proven to be useful for the treatment of different neuropsychiatric diseases. The present work aimed at describing a novel protocol for histologically-guided delineation of thalamic nuclei based on short-tracks track-density imaging (stTDI), which is an advanced imaging technique that exploits high angular resolution diffusion tractography to obtain super-resolved white matter maps with high anatomical information. We tested this protocol on i) six healthy individual 3T MRI scans from the Human Connectome Project database, and on ii) a group population template reconstructed by averaging 100 unrelated healthy subjects scans from the same repository. We demonstrated that this approach can identify up to 13 distinct thalamic nuclei bilaterally with very high reliability (intraclass correlation coefficient: 0.996, 95% CI: 0.993-0.998; total accumulated overlap: 0.43) and that both subject-based and group-level thalamic parcellation show a fair share of similarity to a recent standard-space histological thalamic atlas. Finally, we showed that stTDI-derived thalamic maps can be successfully employed to study thalamic structural and functional connectivity, and may have potential implications both for basic and translational research, as well as for pre-surgical planning purposes.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Postmortem magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the fixed healthy and diseased human brain facilitates spatial resolutions and image quality that is not achievable with in vivo MRI scans.

The objectives of the present work were (i) to develop a 3D isotropic ultra-high-resolution imaging approach for human whole-brain ex vivo acquisitions working on a standard clinical 3T MRI system, and (ii) to explore the sensitivity and specificity of this concept for specific pathoanatomical features of multiple sclerosis. The reconstructed images demonstrate unprecedented resolution and soft tissue contrast of the diseased human brain at 3T, thus allowing visualization of sub-millimetric lesions in the different cortical layers and in the cerebellar cortex, as well as unique cortical lesion characteristics such as the presence of incomplete / complete iron rims, and patterns of iron accumulation. Further details such as the subpial molecular layer, the line of Gennari, and some intrathalamic nuclei are also well distinguishable.</content:encoded>

We recorded brain activity from 28 individuals with a total of 1,403 intracortical contacts, while they produced faster manual responses to visual targets preceded by non-predictive attentional cues, which engage exogenous spatial attention. Using a novel spatiotemporal clustering approach, we identified three distinct brain networks: an early visual cluster; an intermediate, predominantly right-hemisphere caudal temporoparietal-prefrontal cluster, sensitive to attentional effects; and a late, predominantly left-hemisphere rostral temporoparietal-prefrontal cluster, sensitive to response-requiring targets. Activity in temporoparietal-prefrontal clusters suggested neural integration of temporally close cues and targets, and was closely related to behavioral responses. These results reveal how cortical networks govern the psychological construct of exogenous attention.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.02.425101v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is characterized by loss of control in limiting alcohol intake. This may involve intermittent periods of abstinence followed by alcohol seeking and, consequently, relapse. However, little is understood of the molecular mechanisms underlying the impact of alcohol deprivation on behavior. Using a new Drosophila melanogaster repeated intermittent alcohol exposure model, we sought to identify how ethanol deprivation alters spontaneous behavior, determine the associated neural structures, and reveal correlated changes in brain gene expression. We found that repeated intermittent ethanol exposures followed by ethanol-deprivation dynamically induces behaviors associated with a negative affect state. Although behavioral states broadly mapped to many brain regions, persistent changes in social behaviors mapped to the mushroom body and surrounding neuropil. This occurred concurrently with changes in expression of genes associated with sensory responses, neural plasticity, and immunity. Like social behaviors, immune response genes were upregulated following three-day repeated intermittent ethanol-exposures and persisted with one or two days of ethanol-deprivation, suggesting an enduring change in molecular function. Our study provides a framework for identifying how ethanol deprivation alters behavior with correlated underlying circuit and molecular changes.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.01.02.425096v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Empathic capacity has been shown to be correlated with brain structural variations. This study investigates how this is the case in a group of psychotherapists who have a constant demand to modulate their empathic response. Eighteen psychotherapists and eighteen healthy controls underwent 3 Tesla MRI scanning and completed empathy related psychometric assessments. Cortical thickness (CT) measures were estimated for each participant. We evaluated how these measures differed between groups, and if they were associated with individual empathy scores at a series of regions of interest. Our analysis shows that psychotherapists display a significantly greater CT at the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC; p &amp;lt; 0.05, FDR corrected). Moreover, psychotherapists' CT in this region is correlated with the tendency to feel empathically concerned for others (p &amp;lt; 0.01, FDR corrected). This finding is relevant because this dlPFC region participates importantly in emotion regulation and perspective taking processes. Thus, our findings support the idea that empathic capacity is reflected by brain structural variations, recruiting for the first time a sample of subjects for whom empathic responding is crucial in their jobs</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.31.425014v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Studying the molecular development of the human brain presents unique challenges for selecting the best data analysis approach. The rare and valuable nature of human postmortem brain samples, especially for studies examining development, means that those studies have small sample sizes (n) but often include measurements (p) for a large number of genes or proteins for every sample. Thus, most of those data sets have a structure that is p &amp;gt;&amp;gt; n, which introduces the problem of sparsity. Here we present a guide to analyzing human brain development data by focusing on sparsity-based clustering methods developed for small sample sizes. We test different methods and identify an application of sparse K-means clustering called Robust Sparse K-means Clustering (RSKC) that does a good job revealing clusters of samples that reflect lifespan stages from birth to aging. The algorithm adaptively selects a subset of the genes or proteins that contributes to generating clusters of samples that are spread across the lifespan. This approach addresses a problem in current studies that were unable to identify postnatal clusters. The guide illustrates that careful selection of the clustering method is essential to reveal meaningful aspects of human brain development.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.31.424926v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Human visual systems can parse a scene composed of novel objects and infer their surfaces and occlusion relationships without relying on object-specific shapes or textures. Perceptual grouping can bind together spatially disjoint entities to unite them as one object even when the object is entirely novel, and bind other perceptual properties like color and texture to that object using object-based attention. Border-ownership assignment, the assignment of perceived occlusion boundaries to specific perceived surfaces, is an intermediate representation in the mammalian visual system that facilitates this perceptual grouping. Since objects in a scene can be entirely novel, inferring border ownership requires integrating global figural information, while dynamically postulating what the figure is, a chicken-and egg process that is complicated further by missing or conflicting local evidence regarding the presence of boundaries. Based on neuroscience observations, we introduce a model -- the cloned Markov random field (CMRF)-- that can learn attention-controllable representations for border-ownership. Higher-order contour representations that distinguish border-ownerships emerge as part of learning in this model. When tested with a cluttered scene of novel 2D objects with noisy contour-only evidence, the CMRF model is able to perceptually group them, despite clutter and missing edges. Moreover, the CMRF is able to use occlusion cues to bind disconnected surface elements of novel objects into coherent objects, and able to use top-down attention to assign border ownership to overlapping objects. Our work is a step towards dynamic binding of surface elements into objects, a capability that is crucial for intelligent agents to interact with the world and to form entity-based abstractions.</content:encoded>

                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Objective&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage (sICH) is a common complication of acute ischemic stroke (AIS) associated with limited treatments and poor outcomes. We aimed to identify predictive factors of sICH in patients with AIS following mechanical thrombectomy (MT) in a real-world setting.
      &lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec2&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Methods&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Patients with large vessel occlusion of the anterior circulation treated with MT were consecutively included in a prospective monocentric cohort. Clinical, biological, and radiological parameters were collected to identify pre-procedural predictors for sICH.
      &lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec3&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;637 patients were included in our study. Magnetic resonance imaging was performed on most patients (86.7%). sICH occurred in 55 patients (8.6%). 428 patients (67.2%) were treated with intravenous thrombolysis. After multivariate analysis, prior use of antiplatelet therapies (odd ratio (OR) 1.84, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.01–3.32), high C-reactive protein (OR per standard deviation (SD) increase 1.28, 95% 1.01–1.63), elevated mean arterial blood pressure (OR per 10 mmHg increase 1.22, 95% CI 1.03–1.44), hyperglycemia (OR per one SD-log increase 1.38, 95% CI 1.02–1.87), and low ASPECTS (OR per 1-point decrease 1.42, 95% CI 1.12–1.80) were found to be independent predictive factors of sICH. The pre-procedural predictors did not change when the absence of successful recanalization was considered as a covariate. Patients with strokes of unknown onset time were not especially vulnerable for sICH.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;

                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;sICH after MT was associated with several pre-procedural risk factors: prior use of antiplatelet therapies, high C-reactive protein and hyperglycemia at baseline, elevated mean arterial blood pressure, and low ASPECTS.&lt;/p&gt;

                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Objective&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;To compare the effectiveness of a combined aerobic, strength, and flexibility training program with flexibility alone on disease-specific and health-related symptoms in ambulatory amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) patients.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec2&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Methods&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Thirty-two ambulatory patients with ALS were equally randomized into a combined aerobic-strength intervention group or a stretching control group. The intervention period for both groups was identical, 12 consecutive weeks, two sessions per week. The combined intervention program consisted of aerobic training by recumbent cycling, flexibility achieved by stretching and passive exercises, and strength training via functional exercises. Patients in the control group performed basic stretching exercises of the upper and lower limb at home. Outcome measures included the ALS Functional Rating Scale-Revised (ALSFRS-R), respiratory function, mobility, fatigue, and quality of life and were collected 1-week prior to the intervention, after 6-weeks of training, and at the completion of the intervention.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec3&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Twenty-eight participants (17 males, 11 females); mean age (S.D.) = 58.5 (13.2) years; mean disease duration (S.D.) = 7.3 (12.0) years, completed the study. According to the group X time analysis, significant differences were found in respiratory function, mobility, and the ALSFRS-R in favor of the aerobic-strength group. These patients maintained their abilities, whereas, a significant decrease was observed in the flexibility training group. Scores of the SF-36 categories “physical functioning”, “energy fatigue” and “wellbeing” were higher following the intervention in the aerobic-strength group compared with the stretching control group.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec4&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;A 12-week combined aerobic and strength training program is far superior to flexibility alone in improving respiratory function, mobility, and wellbeing in ambulatory ALS patients.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Journal of Neurology: The changing landscape of optic neuritis: a narrative review</title>
	<link>http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s00415-020-10352-1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Optic neuritis (ON) is an inflammatory optic neuropathy that is often a harbinger of central nervous system (CNS) demyelinating disorders. ON is frequently misdiagnosed in the clinical arena, leading to either inappropriate management or diagnostic delays. As a result, patients may fail to achieve optimal recovery. The treatment response to corticosteroids and long term risk of multiple sclerosis was established in the first clinical trials conducted roughly 30 years ago. Spontaneous resolution was observed in the vast majority of patients and intravenous high-dose corticosteroids hastened recovery; half of the patients eventually developed multiple sclerosis. Over the ensuing decades, the number of inflammatory conditions associated with ON has significantly expanded exposing substantial variability in the prognosis, treatment, and management of ON patients. ON subtypes can frequently be distinguished by distinct clinical, serological, and radiological profiles allowing expedited and specialized treatment. Guided by an increased understanding of the immunopathology underlying optic nerve and associated CNS injuries, novel disease management strategies are emerging to minimize vision loss, improve long-term surveillance strategies, and minimize CNS injury and disability. Knowledge regarding the clinical signs and symptoms of different ON subtypes is essential to guide acute therapy, prognosticate recovery, accurately identify underlying CNS inflammatory disorders, and facilitate study design for the next generation of clinical and translational trials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neurology: Clinical practice guidelines in idiopathic facial paralysis: systematic review using the appraisal of guidelines for research and evaluation (AGREE II) instrument</title>
	<link>http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s00415-020-10345-0</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Bell’s palsy, or idiopathic facial paralysis, is a peripheral facial palsy of unknown cause that presents as sudden, unilateral weakness of the muscles of the face. Prompt treatment of Bell’s palsy is critical in order for patients to achieve complete recovery of facial function. Delays in diagnosis and management can result in permanent facial defects. A number of clinical practice guidelines (CPG) exist to guide clinical decision-making in patients presenting with idiopathic facial paralysis. However, to date, there has been no comprehensive review of the methodological rigor and quality of these CPGs. Thus, the objective of the authors is to appraise the existing CPGs to ensure safe and effective practices. A total of eight guidelines met the inclusion criteria and were appraised. Only two CPGs achieved an overall rating of ‘High’, having five or more quality domains scoring &amp;gt; 60%. Across the CPGs, the domains of rigor of development, stakeholder involvement, and applicability has the lowest overall scores with 48.1%, 43.9%, and 43.1%, respectively. Based on the AGREE II instrument, the methodological rigor and quality of CPGs for Bell’s palsy is low to average. In particular, future guidelines for Bell’s palsy should look to the quality domains of rigor of development, stakeholder involvement, and applicability as the greatest opportunities for improvement.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neurology: Early apixaban therapy after ischemic stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation</title>
	<link>http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s00415-020-10335-2</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec1&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Background&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;The optimal timing of anticoagulation after stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) is unknown. We aimed to objectively assess the rate of radiological hemorrhagic transformation (HT) associated with early anticoagulation.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec2&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Patients and methods&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;A prospective, open label study (NCT04435418) of patients with AF treated with apixaban within 14 days of ischemic stroke/TIA onset was conducted. Baseline and follow-up CT scans were assessed for HT and graded using European Cooperative Acute Stroke Study (ECASS) criteria. The primary endpoint was symptomatic HT. Incident HT rates were assessed as Objective Performance Criteria.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec3&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;One-hundred AF stroke patients, with a mean age of 79 ± 11 years were enrolled. Median infarct volume was 4 (0.5–10.75) ml. Median time from index event onset to apixaban initiation was 2 (1–6) days, and median baseline NIHSS was 4 (1–9). Asymptomatic HT on baseline imaging was present in 15 patients. Infarct volume (OR = 1.1, [1.02–1.12], &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.0001) and NIHSS (OR = 1.11, [1.03–1.20], &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.007) were both associated with baseline HT. No patients developed symptomatic HT or systemic hemorrhage. Incident asymptomatic HT was seen on follow-up CT scan in 3 patients. Patients with incident HT were functionally independent (mRS = 0–2) at 90 days. Recurrent ischemic events occurred within 90 days in 13 patients, 4 of which were associated with severe disability (mRS 3–5) and 4 with death.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec4&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Discussion&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Early apixaban treatment did not precipitate symptomatic HT after stroke. All HT was asymptomatic identified on imaging. Recurrent ischemic events were common and clinically symptomatic.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec5&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Symptomatic HT rates are likely to be low in randomized trials of DOAC initiation post-stroke. Recurrent ischemic stroke may be the major clinical outcome. These data may be used as expected event rates when calculating sample size requirements for future safety/efficacy trials of early versus late DOAC initiation after AF-related stroke.&lt;/p&gt;

                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;To investigate associations of social support to psychological well-being, cognition, and motor functioning in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). Secondarily, we were interested in exploring sex differences in these relationships, based on a bioevolutionary theoretical justification.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec2&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Methods&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Social support was assessed in 185 recently diagnosed patients (RADIEMS cohort), and in an independent validation sample (MEMCONNECT cohort, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 62). Patients also completed a comprehensive neurobehavioral evaluation including measures of mental health, fatigue, quality of life, cognition, and motor function. Correlations tested links between social support and these variables, along with potential gender differences.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec3&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;In both samples, higher social support was associated with better mental health, quality of life, subjective cognitive function, and less fatigue. In the RADIEMS cohort, higher social support was associated with better motor functions, particularly grip strength and gait endurance in women.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec4&quot;&gt;

                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;These findings highlight associations of social support to overall psychological health and motor functioning in persons with MS, underlining the potential opportunity of evaluating and promoting social engagement in novel treatment strategies.&lt;/p&gt;

	<content:encoded>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;The diagnostic criteria for &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;N&lt;/em&gt;-methyl-&lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus emphasis type-small-caps&quot;&gt;d&lt;/span&gt;-aspartate receptor antibody (NMDAR-Ab) encephalitis require the presence of CSF antibodies against the NMDAR, whereas serum antibodies are considered specific only if accompanied by CSF antibodies. Current assays include in-house immunochemistry (IHC), or cell-based assays (CBA) which use live (L-CBA) or fixed cells (F-CBA), and commercially available fixed-cells CBA (C-CBA), but these have not been compared in parallel. We compared the L-CBA with F-CBA, C-CBA, and IHC using sera and CSFs archived from &amp;gt; 30,000 received for testing and previously positive by L-CBA. Referring neurologists, if identified, provided “definite” or “unlikely” diagnoses of NMDAR-Ab encephalitis for 31 paired serum-CSF samples and 53 unpaired sera. There was good concordance between paired sera and CSFs, with 13/16 “definite” pairs positive, and 7/8 “unlikely” pairs negative in all in-house assays. In unpaired “definite” sera, L-CBA was most sensitive. However, 19/24 serum samples from “unlikely” patients were positive by L-CBA, with only 5/24 and 1/24 positive by F-CBA and IHC, respectively. In available samples, C-CBA demonstrated high sensitivity for CSF, but surprisingly low sensitivity for serum. Overall, regardless of the technique, CSF results were accurate and easy to interpret, but if CSF is unavailable, negative serum C-CBA results in cases with suspected NMDAR-Ab encephalitis could be repeated by a more sensitive in-house assay. Although these assays are sensitive, particularly for CSF, referral of sera with low pre-test probability should be avoided to reduce clinically-irrelevant “false positive” results.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Sub-clinical renal impairment is associated with increased likelihood for prodromal PD regardless of genetic status. While the mechanism behind this finding needs further elucidation, it suggests that kidney function might play a role in PD pathogenesis.&lt;/p&gt;

                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Background&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;The significance of neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) has been explored in different diseases. Few studies addressed its role in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS), with promising results regarding its association with disease activity or disability.
      &lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec2&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Objectives&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;We aimed at confirming the role of NLR as a marker of neuro-inflammation in a cohort of newly diagnosed MS and clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) patients. Furthermore, we compared the validity of NLR with established markers of neuro-inflammation, such as serum neurofilament light chain (Nfl), CSF microvesicles (CSF-MVs) and CSF IgG indices.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec3&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Methods&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;We retrospectively selected, from a prospectively collected cohort of newly diagnosed MS/CIS patients hospitalized for diagnostic work-up, 121 patients who underwent CSF examination, brain MRI and blood cell count within the time of hospitalization and did not receive steroid treatment before sample collection. Patients were grouped according to presence of gadolinium enhancement at brain MRI.
      &lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec4&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;No association was found between NLR and disease activity, nor with other clinical measures. Nfl, CSF-MVs, Link and Tourtellotte indices were significantly higher in patients with brain MRI activity.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;

                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Our negative results do not support the use of NLR as a marker of disease activity and disability in patients with MS.&lt;/p&gt;

                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Objective&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Superficial siderosis of the central nervous system is a rare intractable disease induced by chronic subarachnoid hemorrhage. Neurological deficits, such as cerebellar ataxia and hearing difficulties, gradually progress if left undiagnosed. Hemosiderin deposition is irreversible because standard medical treatment has not yet been established. Interventions at the source of bleeding may be the key to a preferable outcome of treatment for chronic subarachnoid hemorrhage; however, the source is not clear in many cases.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec2&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Methods&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Among the consecutive cases diagnosed with a spontaneous cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak, cases of superficial siderosis associated with a CSF leak due to a ventral dural defect were retrospectively analyzed.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec3&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Among 77 cases of a CSF leak, 7 cases (9%) of superficial siderosis were identified (median age of 59 years, male, 4 cases). Defects were diagnosed on 1-mm sliced fast imaging employing steady-state acquisition MRI (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 5), conventional myelographic CT (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 1), or dynamic myelographic CT (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 1) at high thoracic levels (T1–T4). All defects were repaired by direct neurosurgery. During surgery, continuous bleeding from the epidural veins of the internal vertebral venous plexus was identified as the source of subarachnoid hemorrhage. Epidural CSF pulsations through the defect prevented clot formation by the epidural veins. Dural repair stopped free communication between the subarachnoid and epidural spaces, leading to the disappearance of chronic subarachnoid hemorrhage.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec4&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Bleeding from the epidural venous plexus may be the cause of superficial siderosis associated with ventral dural defects. Neurosurgical repair may stop the progression of this condition.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Experimental Brain Research: Talking with hands: body representation in British Sign Language users</title>
	<link>http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s00221-020-06013-4</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Body representation (BR) refers to the mental representation of motor, sensory, emotional and semantic information about the physical body. This cognitive representation is used in our everyday life, continuously, even though most of the time we do not appreciate it consciously. In some cases, BR is vital to be able to communicate. A crucial feature of signed languages (SLs), for instance, is that body parts such as hands are used to communicate. Nevertheless, little is known about BR in SL: is the communicative function of the body overwriting the physical constraints? Here, we explored this question by comparing twelve British Sign Language (BSL) learners to seventeen tango dancers (body expertise but not for communication) and fourteen control subjects (no special body expertise). We administered the Body Esteem Scale (BES), the Hand Laterality Task (HLT) and the Mental Motor Chronometry (MMC). To control for visual imagery, we administered ad hoc control tasks. We did not identify parameters able to differentiate between SL users and the other groups, whereas the more implicit parameters distinguished clearly tango dancers from controls. Importantly, neither tasks on visual imagery nor the BES revealed differences. Our findings offer initial evidence that linguistic use of the body not necessarily influences the cognitive components we explored of body representation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Experimental Brain Research: Does exposure to startle impact voluntary reaching movements in individuals with severe-to-moderate stroke?</title>
	<link>http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s00221-020-06005-4</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;When movements of individuals with stroke (iwS) are elicited by startling acoustic stimulus (SAS), reaching movements are faster, further, and directed away from the body. However, these startle-evoked movements also elicit task-inappropriate flexor activity, raising concerns that chronic exposure to startle might also induce heightened flexor activity during voluntarily elicited movement. The objective of this study is to evaluate the impact of startle exposure on voluntary movements during point-to-point reaching in individuals with moderate and severe stroke. We hypothesize that startle exposure will increase task-inappropriate activity in flexor muscles, which will be associated with worse voluntarily initiated reaching performance (e.g. decreased distance, displacement, and final accuracy). Eleven individuals with moderate-to-severe stroke (UEFM = 8–41/66 and MAS = 0–4/4) performed voluntary point-to-point reaching with 1/3 of trials elicited by an SAS. We used electromyography to measure activity in brachioradialis (BR), biceps (BIC), triceps lateral head (TRI), pectoralis (PEC), anterior deltoid (AD), and posterior deltoid (PD). Conversely to our hypothesis, exposure to startle did not increase abnormal flexion but rather antagonist activity in the elbow flexors and shoulder horizontal adductors decreased, suggesting that abnormal flexor/extensor co-contraction was reduced. This reduction of flexion led to increased reaching distance (18.2% farther), movement onset (8.6% faster), and final accuracy (16.1% more accurate) by the end of the session. This study offers the first evidence that exposure to startle in iwS does not negatively impact voluntary movement; moreover, exposure may improve volitionally activated reaching movements by decreasing abnormal flexion activity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Experimental Brain Research: Position sense at the human forearm over a range of elbow angles</title>

	<content:encoded>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Ten adult participants carried out two experiments on position sense at the forearm, one a two-arm matching task, the other a one-arm pointing task. For matching, both forearms were strapped to paddles which moved in the vertical plane between 0° and 90°. At the start of each trial, the arms were conditioned with a contraction sequence to control for the thixotropic property of muscle and muscle spindles. In the matching task, the blindfolded participant moved their indicator arm from 45° into flexion or extension to match the position of the reference arm placed at one of five test angles, between 5° and 85°. In the pointing task, only the reference arm was strapped to a paddle and conditioned. Participants indicated the position of the arm, hidden by a screen, by moving a pointer paddle or choosing one of a series of trajectory lines drawn on the screen. In matching, where test angles were in the direction of flexion of 45°, errors were small; in the direction of extension larger errors were made, up to 8° into flexion. In pointing trials, except at the most extended position, all errors lay in the direction of extension. It is argued that position sense by matching is concerned with the relative positions of the body and its parts, position sense by pointing gives information about position of the body and limbs in external space.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Neurone firing behaviour is a result of complex interaction between synaptic inputs and cellular intrinsic properties. Intriguing firing behaviour, delayed spiking, was shown in some neurones, in particular, in cat neocortical neurones and rat pyramidal hippocampal neurones. In contrast, the similar spiking mode was not reported for animal spinal motoneurones. In the present study, an attempt was made to look for possible evidence of delayed spiking in human motoneurones firing within the low-frequency, sub-primary range, characteristic for voluntary muscle contractions and postural tasks. Forty-seven firing motor units (MUs) were analyzed in ten experiments on three muscles (the flexor carpi ulnaris, the tibialis anterior, and the abductor pollicis brevis) in four healthy humans. Single MUs were activated by gentle voluntary muscle contractions. MU peri-stimulus time histograms, durations of inter-spike intervals, and motoneurone excitability changes within a target interspike interval were analyzed. It was found that during testing the firing motoneurone excitability by small, transient excitatory Ia afferent volley, depending firstly on volley timing within a target interspike interval and excitatory volley strength, the same motoneurone displayed either the direct short-latency response (the H-reflex) or the delayed response (with prolonged and variable latency). Thus, the findings, for the first time, provide evidence for a possibility of two modes of spiking in firing motoneurones. Methods of the estimation of delayed responses and their possible functional significance are discussed. It is emphasized that, for understanding of this issue, the integration of data from studies on experimental animals and humans is desirable.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Experimental Brain Research: Voluntary exercise ameliorates the good limb training effect in a mouse model of stroke</title>

	<content:encoded>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Stroke is the leading cause of long-term disability in the United States, making research on rehabilitation imperative. Stroke rehabilitation typically focuses on recovery of the impaired limb, although this process is tedious. Compensatory use of the intact limb after stroke is more efficient, but it is known to negatively impact the impaired limb. Exercise may help with this problem; research has shown that exercise promotes neuronal growth and prevents cell death. This study used a mouse model to investigate if post-stroke exercise could prevent deterioration of the function of the impaired limb despite compensatory training of the intact limb. Results showed that mice that exercised, in combination with intact limb training, demonstrated improved functional outcome compared to mice that received no training or compensatory limb training only. These findings suggest that exercise can prevent the deterioration of impaired limb functional outcome that is typically seen with intact limb use.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;We investigated monocular information for the continuous online guidance of reaches-to-grasp and present a dynamical control model thereof. We defined an information variable using optical texture projected from a support surface (i.e. a table) over which the participants reached-to-grasp target objects sitting on the table surface at different distances. Using either binocular or monocular vision in the dark, participants rapidly reached-to-grasp a phosphorescent square target object with visibly phosphorescent thumb and index finger. Targets were one of three sizes. The target either sat flat on the support surface or was suspended a few centimeters above the surface at a slant. The later condition perturbed the visible relation of the target to the support surface. The support surface was either invisible in the dark or covered with a visible phosphorescent checkerboard texture. Reach-to-grasp trajectories were recorded and Maximum Grasp Apertures (MGA), Movement Times (MT), Time of MGA (TMGA), and Time of Peak Velocities (TPV) were analyzed. These measures were selected as most indicative of the participant’s certainty about the relation of hand to target object during the reaches. The findings were that, in general, especially monocular reaches were less certain (slower, earlier TMGA and TPV) than binocular reaches except with the target flat on the visible support surface where performance with monocular and binocular vision was equivalent. The hypothesized information was the difference in image width of optical texture (equivalent to density of optical texture) at the hand versus the target. A control dynamic equation was formulated representing proportional rate control of the reaches-to-grasp (akin to the model using binocular disparity formulated by Anderson and Bingham (Exp Brain Res 205: 291–306, 2010). Simulations were performed and presented using this model. Simulated performance was compared to actual performance and found to replicate it. To our knowledge, this is the first study of monocular information used for continuous online guidance of reaches-to-grasp, complete with a control dynamic model.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Synchronous neural activity is a feature of normal brain function, and altered synchronization is observed in several neurological diseases. Dysfunction in hypothalamic pathways leads to obesity, suggesting that hypothalamic neural synchrony is critical for energy homeostasis. The lateral hypothalamic orexin neurons are extensively interconnected with other brain structures and are important for energy balance. Earlier studies show that rats with higher orexin sensitivity are obesity resistant. Similarly, topiramate, an anti-epileptic drug, has been shown to reduce weight in humans. Since orexin enhances neuronal excitation, we hypothesized that obesity-resistant rats with higher orexin sensitivity may exhibit enhanced hypothalamic synchronization. We further hypothesized that anti-obesity agents such as orexin and topiramate will enhance hypothalamic synchronization. To test this, we examined neural synchronicity in primary embryonic hypothalamic cell cultures, obtained from embryonic day 18 (E18) obesity-susceptible Sprague–Dawley (SD) and obesity-resistant rats. Hypothalamic tissue was cultured in multielectrode  array (MEA), and recordings were performed twice weekly, from 4th to 32nd day in vitro (DIV). Next, we tested the effects of orexin and topiramate application on neural synchronicity of hypothalamic cultures obtained from SD rat embryos. Signals were analyzed for synchronization using cross correlation. Our results showed that (1) obesity-resistant hypothalamus exhibits significantly higher synchronization compared to obesity-sensitive hypothalamus; and (2) orexin and topiramate enhance hypothalamic synchronization. These results support that enhanced orexin sensitivity is associated with greater neural synchronization, and that anti-obesity treatments enhance network synchronization, thus constrain variability in hypothalamic output signals, to extrahypothalamic structures involved in energy homeostasis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>In this study we show a reproduction of the dress-ambiguity phenomenon in a real scene and we report quantitative measurements of the corresponding colour perceptions. The original, real dress, known from #thedress-illusion, was illuminated by combined short- and longwavelength broadband lights from two slide projectors. Test subjects viewing the dress reported to perceive the dress fabric and lace colours as blue &amp;amp; black, white &amp;amp; gold or light blue &amp;amp; brown; their corresponding perceptual matches were distributed along the blue/yellow cardinal axis, and exhibited a variability comparable to the ambiguity of the dress photograph. It is particularly noteworthy that the colour ambiguity emerged despite explicit knowledge of the observers about the direction of the light source. Manipulating the background of the real dress (change in chromaticity and luminance, or masking) revealed significant differences between the perceptual groups regarding lightness and colour of the dress. Our findings suggest that observer specific differences in the perceptual organisation of the visual scene are responsible for the colour ambiguity observed for the real dress; in particular, we conclude that colour computations of white &amp;amp; gold viewers focused onto the local region of the dress, whereas the colour processes of blue &amp;amp; black and light-blue &amp;amp; brown viewers were strongly influenced by contextual computations including the background. Our segmentation hypothesis extends existing explanations for the dress ambiguity and proposes image based (in the case of the real scene) and high level (in the case of the photograph) neural processes which control the spatial reach of contextual colour computations. The relation between the ambiguity in our real scene and the dress photograph is discussed.</content:encoded>

One such issue concerns the relationship between two latent cognitive modes during creative thinking, i.e., deliberate goal-directed cognition and spontaneous thought generation. Although an interplay between deliberate and spontaneous thinking is often indirectly implicated in the creativity literature (e.g., dual-process models), a bottom-up data-driven validation of the cognitive processes associated with creative thinking is still lacking. Here, we attempted to capture the latent modes of creative thinking by utilizing a data-driven approach on a novel continuous multitask paradigm (CMP) that widely sampled a hypothetical two-dimensional cognitive plane of deliberate and spontaneous thinking in a single fMRI session. The CMP consisted of eight task blocks ranging from undirected mind wandering to goal-directed working memory task, while also including two of the widely used creativity tasks, i.e., alternate uses task (AUT) and remote association task (RAT). Using data-driven eigen-connectivity (EC) analysis on the multitask whole-brain functional connectivity (FC) patterns, we embedded the multitask FCs into a low-dimensional latent space. The first two latent components, as revealed by the EC analysis, broadly mapped onto the two cognitive modes of deliberate and spontaneous thinking, respectively. Further, in this low-dimensional space, both creativity tasks were located in the upper right corner of high deliberate and spontaneous thinking (creative cognitive space). Neuroanatomically, the creative cognitive space was represented by not only increased intra-network connectivity within executive control and default mode networks, but also by a higher inter-network coupling between the two. Further, individual differences reflected in the low-dimensional connectivity embeddings were related to differences in deliberate and spontaneous thinking abilities. Altogether, using a continuous multitask paradigm and data-driven approach, we provide direct empirical evidence for the contribution of both deliberate and spontaneous modes of cognition during creative thinking.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Huntington disease (HD), a rare neurodegenerative disorder, is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner, and caused by a pathological trinucleotide expansion at exon1 of the HTT locus. Previous studies have described the haplogroups at the HTT locus that can explain the differences in prevalence of HD. We have selected three informative SNPs (rs762855, rs3856973 and rs4690073) to study these haplogroups in an Indian sample. Our results show that the genotype frequencies are significantly different between cases and controls for these SNPs. More than 90% of both cases and controls belong to Haplogroup A which is the predominant European haplogroup.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Disrupted dynamic functional network connectivity among cognitive control networks in the progression of Alzheimer's disease</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.31.424877v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Background: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common age-related dementia that promotes a decline in memory, thinking, and social skills. The initial stages of dementia can be associated with mild symptoms, and symptom progression to a more severe state is heterogeneous across patients. Recent work has demonstrated the potential for functional network mapping to assist in the prediction of symptomatic progression. However, this work has primarily used static functional connectivity (sFC) from rs-fMRI. Recently, dynamic functional connectivity (dFC) has been recognized as a powerful advance in functional connectivity methodology to differentiate brain network dynamics between healthy and diseased populations. Methods: Group independent component analysis was applied to extract 17 components within the cognitive control network (CCN) from 1385 individuals across varying stages of AD symptomology. We estimated dFC among 17 components within the CCN, followed by clustering the dFCs into 3 recurring brain states and then estimated a hidden Markov model and the occupancy rate for each subject. Finally, we investigated the link between CCN dFC connectivity features with AD progression. Results: Progression of AD symptoms were associated with increases in connectivity within the middle frontal gyrus. Also, the AD with mild and severer symptoms showed less connectivity within the inferior parietal lobule and between this region with the rest of CCN. Finally, comparing with mild dementia, we found that the normal brain spends significantly more time in a state with lower within middle frontal gyrus connectivity and higher connectivity between the hippocampus and the rest of CCN, highlighting the importance of assessing the dynamics of brain connectivity in this disease. Conclusion: Our results suggest that AD progress not only alters the CCN connectivity strength but also changes the temporal properties in this brain network. This suggests the temporal and spatial pattern of CCN as a biomarker that differentiates different stages of AD. Impact Statement: By assuming that functional connectivity is static over time, many of previous studies have ignored the brain dynamic in Alzheimer's disease progression. Here, a longitudinal resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data are used to explore the temporal changes of functional connectivity in the cognitive control network in Alzheimer's disease progression. The result of this study would increase our understanding about the underlying mechanisms of Alzheimer's Disease and help in finding future treatment of this neurological disorder.</content:encoded>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Neuro‐ophthalmological findings in early Fatal Familial Insomnia</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.26008?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Fatal familial insomnia (FFI) is a rare inherited prion disease characterized by sleep, autonomic and motor disturbances. Neuro‐ophthalmological abnormalities have been reported at the onset of disease, though not further characterized. We analyzed video recordings of eye movements of six FFI patients from three unrelated kindreds, seen within six months from the onset of illness. Excessive saccadic intrusions was the most prominent finding. In patients with severe insomnia, striking saccadic intrusions are an early diagnostic clue for FFI. The fact that the thalamus is the first structure affected in FFI also suggests its role in the control of steady fixation.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Annals of Neurology: The effect of SMN gene dosage on ALS risk and disease severity</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.26009?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The role of &lt;i&gt;Survival of Motor Neuron&lt;/i&gt; gene (&lt;i&gt;SMN&lt;/i&gt;) in Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is unclear, with several conflicting reports. A decisive result on this topic is needed, given that treatment options are available now for &lt;i&gt;SMN&lt;/i&gt; deficiency.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this largest multicentre case control study to evaluate the effect of &lt;i&gt;SMN1&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;SMN2&lt;/i&gt; copy numbers in ALS, we used whole genome sequencing data from Project MinE data freeze 2. &lt;i&gt;SMN&lt;/i&gt; copy numbers of 6375 ALS patients and 2412 controls were called from whole genome sequencing data, and the reliability of the calls was tested with multiplex ligation‐dependent probe amplification data.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The copy number distribution of &lt;i&gt;SMN1&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;SMN2&lt;/i&gt; between cases and controls did not show any statistical differences (binomial multivariate logistic regression &lt;i&gt;SMN1&lt;/i&gt; p=0.54; &lt;i&gt;SMN2&lt;/i&gt; p=0.49). In addition, the copy number of &lt;i&gt;SMN&lt;/i&gt; did not associate with patient survival (Royston‐Parmar; &lt;i&gt;SMN1&lt;/i&gt; p=0.78; &lt;i&gt;SMN2&lt;/i&gt; p=0.23) or age at onset (Royston‐Parmar; &lt;i&gt;SMN1&lt;/i&gt; p=0.75; &lt;i&gt;SMN2&lt;/i&gt; p=0.63).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our well‐powered study there was no association of SMN1 or SMN2 copy numbers with the risk of ALS or ALS disease severity. This suggests that changing SMN protein levels in the physiological range may not modify ALS disease course. This is an important finding in the light of emerging therapies targeted at SMN deficiencies.&lt;/p&gt;

	<content:encoded>&lt;img alt=&quot;A novel telencephalon‐opto‐hypothalamic morphogenetic domain coexpressing Foxg1 and Otp produces most of the glutamatergic neurons of the medial extended amygdala&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/eee1a997-56b9-4f36-b252-3f7d7bc9b790/cne25103-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study shows that most glutamatergic neurons of the mouse medial extended amygdala originate in a novel telencephalo‐opto‐hypothalamic embryonic domain (TOH), which produces Otp‐lineage neurons expressing the telencephalic marker Foxg1 during development. These glutamatergic cells include a subpopulation of projection neurons, which activation has been previously shown to promote autistic‐like behavior. Our data open new venues for studying the implication of these neurons in neurodevelopmental disorders producing social deficits.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deficits in social cognition and behavior are a hallmark of many psychiatric disorders. The medial extended amygdala, including the medial amygdala and the medial bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, is a key component of functional networks involved in sociality. However, this nuclear complex is highly heterogeneous and contains numerous GABAergic and glutamatergic neuron subpopulations. Deciphering the connections of different neurons is essential in order to understand how this structure regulates different aspects of sociality, and it is necessary to evaluate their differential implication in distinct mental disorders. Developmental studies in different vertebrates are offering new venues to understand neuronal diversity of the medial extended amygdala, and are helping to establish a relation between the embryonic origin and molecular signature of distinct neurons with the functional subcircuits in which they are engaged. These studies have provided many details on the distinct GABAergic neurons of the medial extended amygdala, but information on the glutamatergic neurons is still scarce. Using an Otp‐eGFP transgenic mouse and multiple fluorescent labeling, we show that most glutamatergic neurons of the medial extended amygdala originate in a distinct telencephalo‐opto‐hypothalamic embryonic domain (TOH), located at the transition between telencephalon and hypothalamus, which produces Otp‐lineage neurons expressing the telencephalic marker Foxg1 but not Nkx2.1 during development. These glutamatergic cells include a subpopulation of projection neurons of the medial amygdala, which activation has been previously shown to promote autistic‐like behavior. Our data open new venues for studying the implication of this neuron subtype in neurodevelopmental disorders producing social deficits.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>The Cerebellum: Simultaneous Brg1 Knockout and MYCN Overexpression in Cerebellar Granule Neuron Precursors Is Insufficient to Drive Tumor Formation but Temporarily Enhances their Proliferation and Delays their Migration</title>

	<content:encoded>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Medulloblastoma (MB) is the most common malignant brain tumor in childhood. According to the World Health Organization (WHO) classification of central nervous system (CNS) tumors, this embryonal tumor is divided into a wingless (WNT)-activated, Sonic hedgehog (SHH)-activated, and non-WNT/non-SHH entity. The latter is poorly defined but frequently carries mutations in &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Brahma-related gene 1&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;BRG1&lt;/em&gt;) or amplifications of &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;MYCN&lt;/em&gt;. Here, we investigated whether a combination of a &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Brg1&lt;/em&gt; knockout and an overexpression of &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;MYCN&lt;/em&gt; in cerebellar granule neuron precursors or multipotent neural stem cells is sufficient to drive brain tumor formation in mice. To this end, we generated &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Math1-creER&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;T2&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;::Brg1&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;fl/fl&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;::lslMYCN&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;hGFAP-cre::Brg1&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;fl/fl&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;::lslMYCN&lt;/em&gt; mice, respectively. We did not observe brain tumor formation in any of these models. &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;hGFAP-cre::Brg1&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;fl/fl&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;::lslMYCN&lt;/em&gt; mice revealed severe CNS abnormalities with short survival, similar to the situation with a sole loss of &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Brg1&lt;/em&gt;, as we previously described. Investigation of &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Math1-creER&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;T2&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;::Brg1&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;fl/fl&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;::lslMYCN&lt;/em&gt; mice with a tamoxifen induction at postnatal day 3 revealed a regular survival but significant increase in cerebellar granule neuron precursor proliferation, followed by a delayed inward migration of these cells. This is in stark contrast to the hypoplastic cerebellum that we previously observed after embryonic deletion of &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Brg1&lt;/em&gt; in &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Math1&lt;/em&gt; positive cerebellar granule neurons. Our results indicate a time-specific function of &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Brg1&lt;/em&gt; in cerebellar granule neuron precursors. Yet, the exact temporal and spatial origin of non-WNT/non-SHH MB remains unclear.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Neuroinformatics: Generating Longitudinal Atrophy Evaluation Datasets on Brain Magnetic Resonance Images Using Convolutional Neural Networks and Segmentation Priors</title>
	<link>http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s12021-020-09499-z</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Brain atrophy quantification plays a fundamental role in neuroinformatics since it permits studying brain development and neurological disorders. However, the lack of a ground truth prevents testing the accuracy of longitudinal atrophy quantification methods. We propose a deep learning framework to generate longitudinal datasets by deforming T1-w brain magnetic resonance imaging scans as requested through segmentation maps. Our proposal incorporates a cascaded multi-path U-Net optimised with a multi-objective loss which allows its paths to generate different brain regions accurately. We provided our model with baseline scans and real follow-up segmentation maps from two longitudinal datasets, ADNI and OASIS, and observed that our framework could produce synthetic follow-up scans that matched the real ones (Total scans= 584; Median absolute error: 0.03 ± 0.02; Structural similarity index: 0.98 ± 0.02; Dice similarity coefficient: 0.95 ± 0.02; Percentage of brain volume change: 0.24 ± 0.16; Jacobian integration: 1.13 ± 0.05). Compared to two relevant works generating brain lesions using U-Nets and conditional generative adversarial networks (CGAN), our proposal outperformed them significantly in most cases (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.01), except in the delineation of brain edges where the CGAN took the lead (Jacobian integration: Ours - 1.13 ± 0.05 vs CGAN - 1.00 ± 0.02; &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.01). We examined whether changes induced with our framework were detected by FAST, SPM, SIENA, SIENAX, and the Jacobian integration method. We observed that induced and detected changes were highly correlated (Adj. &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;R&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;gt; 0.86). Our preliminary results on harmonised datasets showed the potential of our framework to be applied to various data collections without further adjustment.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Subtyping relapsing–remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) patients may help predict disease progression and triage patients for treatment. We aimed to subtype RRMS patients by structural MRI and investigate their clinical significances.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;

                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;155 relapse-remitting MS (RRMS) and 210 healthy controls (HC) were retrospectively enrolled with structural 3DT1, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and resting-state functional MRI. &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Z&lt;/em&gt; scores of cortical and deep gray matter volumes (CGMV and DGMV) and white matter fractional anisotropy (WM-FA) in RRMS patients were calculated based on means and standard deviations of HC. We defined RRMS as “normal” (− 2 &amp;lt; &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;z&lt;/em&gt; scores of both GMV and WM-FA), DGM (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;z&lt;/em&gt; scores of DGMV &amp;lt; − 2), and DGM-plus types (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;z&lt;/em&gt; scores of DGMV and [CGMV or WM-FA] &amp;lt; − 2) according to combinations of &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;z&lt;/em&gt; scores compared to HC. Expanded disability status scale (EDSS), cognitive and functional MRI measurements, and conversion rate to secondary progressive MS (SPMS) at 5-year follow-up were compared between subtypes.&lt;/p&gt;

                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;77 (49.7%) patients were “normal” type, 37 (23.9%) patients were DGM type and 34 (21.9%) patients were DGM-plus type. 7 (4.5%) patients who were not categorized into the above types were excluded. DGM-plus type had the highest EDSS. Both DGM and DGM-plus types had more severe cognitive impairment than “normal” type. Only DGM-plus type showed decreased functional MRI measures compared to HC. A higher conversion ratio to SPMS in DGM-plus type (55%) was identified compared to “normal” type (14%, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001) and DGM type (20%, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.005).&lt;/p&gt;

	<content:encoded>The ability to generalize rapidly across specific experiences is vital for robust recognition of new patterns, especially in speech perception considering acoustic-phonetic pattern variability. Behavioral research has demonstrated that listeners are rapidly able to generalize their experience with a talkers speech and quickly improve understanding of a difficult-to-understand talker without prolonged practice, e.g., even after a single training session. Here, we examine the differences in neural responses to generalized versus rote learning in auditory cortical processing by training listeners to understand a novel synthetic talker using a Pretest-Posttest design with electroencephalography (EEG). Participants were trained using either (1) a large inventory of words where no words repeated across the experiment (generalized learning) or (2) a small inventory of words where words repeated (rote learning). Analysis of long-latency auditory evoked potentials at Pretest and Posttest revealed that while rote and generalized learning both produce rapid changes in auditory processing, the nature of these changes differed. In the context of adapting to a talker, generalized learning is marked by an amplitude reduction in the N1-P2 complex and by the presence of a late-negative (LN) wave in the auditory evoked potential following training. Rote learning, however, is marked only by temporally later source configuration changes. The early N1-P2 change, found only for generalized learning, suggests that generalized learning relies on the attentional system to reorganize the way acoustic features are selectively processed. This change in relatively early sensory processing (i.e. during the first 250ms) is consistent with an active processing account of speech perception, which proposes that the ability to rapidly adjust to the specific vocal characteristics of a new talker (for which rote learning is rare) relies on attentional mechanisms to adaptively tune early auditory processing sensitivity.

Statement of SignificancePrevious research on perceptual learning has typically examined neural responses during rote learning: training and testing is carried out with the same stimuli. As a result, it is not clear that findings from these studies can explain learning that generalizes to novel patterns, which is critical in speech perception. Are neural responses to generalized learning in auditory processing different from neural responses to rote learning? Results indicate rote learning of a particular talkers speech involves brain regions focused on the memory encoding and retrieving of specific learned patterns, whereas generalized learning involves brain regions involved in reorganizing attention during early sensory processing. In learning speech from a novel talker, only generalized learning is marked by changes in the N1-P2 complex (reflective of secondary auditory cortical processing). The results are consistent with the view that robust speech perception relies on the fast adjustment of attention mechanisms to adaptively tune auditory sensitivity to cope with acoustic variability.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Stabilized Supralinear Network: Model of Layer 2/3 of the Primary Visual Cortex</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.30.424892v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Electrophysiological recording in the primary visual cortex (V1) of mammals have revealed a number of complex interactions between the center and surround. Understanding the underlying circuit mechanisms is crucial to understanding fundamental brain computations. In this paper we address the following phenomena that have been observed in V1 of animals with orientation maps: 1) surround suppression that is accompanied by a decrease in the excitatory and inhibitory currents that the cell receives as the stimulus size increases beyond the cells summation field; 2) surround tuning to the center orientation, in which the strongest suppression arises when the surround orientation matches that of the center stimulus; and 3) feature-specific suppression, in which a surround stimulus of a given orientation specifically suppresses that orientations component of the response to a center plaid stimulus. We show that a stabilized supralinear network that has biologically plausible connectivity and synaptic efficacies that depend on cortical distance and orientation difference between neurons can consistently reproduce all the above phenomena. We explain the mechanism behind each result, and argue that feature-specific suppression and surround tuning to the center orientation are independent phenomena. Specifically, if we remove some aspects of the connectivity from the model it will still produce feature-specific suppression but not surround tuning to the center orientation. We also show that in the model the activity decay time constant is similar to the cortical activity decay time constant reported in mouse V1. Our model indicates that if the surround activates neurons that fall within the reach of the horizontal projections in V1, the above mentioned phenomena can be generated by V1 alone without the need of cortico-cortical feedback. Finally, we show that these results hold both in networks with rate-based units and with conductance-based spiking units. This demonstrates that the stabilized supra-linear network mechanism can be achieved in the more biological context of spiking networks.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.30.424888v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Self-sustaining dynamics maintained through recurrent connections are of fundamental importance to cortical function. We show that Up-states--an example of self-sustained network dynamics--autonomously emerge in cortical circuits across three weeks of ex vivo development, establishing the presence of unsupervised synaptic learning rules that lead to globally stable emergent dynamics. Computational models of excitatory-inhibitory networks have established that four sets of weights (WE[&amp;lt;-]E, WE[&amp;lt;-]E, WI[&amp;lt;-]E, WI[&amp;lt;-]I) cooperate to generate stable self-sustained dynamics, but have not addressed how a family of learning rules can operate in parallel at all four weight classes to achieve self-sustained inhibition-stabilized regimes. Using numerical and analytical methods we show that standard homeostatic rules cannot account for the emergence of self-sustained dynamics due to the paradoxical effect. We derived a novel family of homeostatic learning rules that operate in parallel at all four synaptic classes, which robustly lead to the emergence of Up-states and balanced excitation-inhibition.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.30.424873v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Hippocampal place cells form a map of an animals environment. When the animal moves to a new environment, place field locations and firing rates change, a phenomenon known as remapping. Different animals can have different remapping responses to the same environments. This variability across animals in remapping behavior is not well understood. In this work, we analyzed electrophysiological recordings from Alme et al. (2014), in which five male rats were exposed to 11 different environments. To compare the hippocampal maps in two rooms, we computed average rate map correlation coefficients. We discovered that the heterogeneity in animals remapping behavior is structured: animals remapping behavior is consistent across a range of independent comparisons. Our findings highlight that remapping behavior between repeated environments depends on animal-specific factors.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Recording neuronal group activity across the cortical hemispheres from awake, behaving mice is essential for understanding information flow across cerebral networks. Video recordings of cerebral function comes with challenges, including optical and movement-associated vessel artifacts, and limited references for time series extraction. Here we present a data-driven workflow that isolates artifacts from calcium activity patterns, and segments independent functional units across the cortical surface. Independent Component Analysis utilizes the statistical interdependence of pixel activation to completely unmix signals from background noise, given sufficient spatial and temporal samples. We also utilize isolated signal components to produce segmentations of the cortical surface, unique to each individual's functional patterning. Time series extraction from these maps maximally represent the underlying signal in a highly compressed format. These improved techniques for data pre-processing, spatial segmentation, and time series extraction result in optimal signals for further analysis.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Variability of the Surface Area of the V1, V2, and V3 Maps in a Large Sample of Human Observers</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.30.424856v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>How variable is the functionally-defined structure of early visual areas in human cortex and how much variability is shared between twins? Here we quantify individual differences in the best understood functionally-defined regions of cortex: V1, V2, V3. The Human Connectome Project includes retinotopic measurements from 181 subjects, most of whom are twins. We trained four &quot;anatomists&quot; to manually define V1-V3 using retinotopic features. These definitions were more accurate than automated anatomical templates and showed that surface areas for these maps varied more than three-fold across individuals. The cortical magnification function also differed substantially among individuals: the relative amount of cortex devoted to central vision varied by more than a factor of 2. Whereas our twin sample sizes were too small to make precise heritability estimates (50 monozygotic pairs, 34 dizygotic), they nonetheless reveal high correlations, consistent with strong effects of the combination of shared genes and environment on visual area size. In V1, intraclass correlations of surface area between twin pairs were 84% and 68% for monozygotic and dizygotic pairs, respectively. The correlations were also high for V2 (81%, 73%) and V3 (75%, 43%). A trend for higher monozygotic than dizygotic size correlations, as well as greater similarity in map properties amongst monozygotic twins, suggest that visual area size and topography are partly genetically determined. Collectively, these results comprise the most accurate account of individual variability in visual area structure to date, and provide a robust population benchmark against which new individuals and developmental and clinical populations can be compared.

Significance StatementAreas V1, V2, and V3 are among the best studied functionally-defined regions in human cortex. Using the largest retinotopy dataset to date, we characterized the variability of these regions across individuals and the similarity between twin pairs. We find that the size of visual areas varies dramatically (up to 3.5x) across healthy young adults, far more than the variability of the cerebral cortex size as a whole. Much of this variability appears to arise from inherited factors, as we find very high correlations in visual area size between monozygotic twin-pairs, and lower but still substantial correlations between dizygotic twin pairs. These results provide the most robust assessment of how functionally defined visual cortex varies across the population.</content:encoded>

&lt;p&gt;Campaniform sensilla are a sensory system in insects that detect deformations of the exoskeleton. The comparison of front, middle, and hindleg sensilla reveals robust locations with a small amount of interindividual variability.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sensory systems provide input to motor networks on the state of the body and environment. One such sensory system in insects is the campaniform sensilla (CS), which detect deformations of the exoskeleton arising from resisted movements or external perturbations. When physical strain is applied to the cuticle, CS external structures are compressed, leading to transduction in an internal sensory neuron. In &lt;i&gt;Drosophila melanogaster&lt;/i&gt;, the distribution of CS on the exoskeleton has not been comprehensively described. To investigate CS number, location, spatial arrangement, and potential differences between individuals, we compared the front, middle, and hind legs of multiple flies using scanning electron microscopy. Additionally, we imaged the entire body surface to confirm known CS locations. On the legs, the number and relative arrangement of CS varied between individuals, and single CS of corresponding segments showed characteristic differences between legs. This knowledge is fundamental for studying the relevance of cuticular strain information within the complex neuromuscular networks controlling posture and movement. This comprehensive account of all &lt;i&gt;D. melanogaster&lt;/i&gt; CS helps set the stage for experimental investigations into their responsivity, sensitivity, and roles in sensory acquisition and motor control in a light‐weight model organism.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

&lt;p&gt;Bidirectional tracer injections in macaque monkey entorhinal cortex (EC), amygdala (AMY), and dorsal premotor cortex (PMC) reveal distinct distributions across the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). We show that EC and PMC connections are segregated across ventral (A25, A24a) and dorsal (A24b,c) ACC, while AMY connections are evenly distributed. These distinct ACC networks are likely important for temporal integration and affective, contextual, and motor processing in flexible goal‐directed behavior.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) is important for decision‐making as it integrates motor plans with affective and contextual limbic information. Disruptions in these networks have been observed in depression, bipolar disorder, and post‐traumatic stress disorder. Yet, overlap of limbic and motor connections within subdivisions of the ACC is not well understood. Hence, we administered a combination of retrograde and anterograde tracers into structures important for contextual memories (entorhinal cortex), affective processing (amygdala), and motor planning (dorsal premotor cortex) to assess overlap of labeled projection neurons from (outputs) and axon terminals to (inputs) the ACC of adult rhesus monkeys (&lt;i&gt;Macaca mulatta&lt;/i&gt;). Our data show that entorhinal and dorsal premotor cortical (dPMC) connections are segregated across ventral (A25, A24a) and dorsal (A24b,c) subregions of the ACC, while amygdalar connections are more evenly distributed across subregions. Among all areas, the rostral ACC (A32) had the lowest relative density of connections with all three regions. In the ventral ACC, entorhinal and amygdalar connections strongly overlap across all layers, especially in A25. In the dorsal ACC, outputs to dPMC and the amygdala strongly overlap in deep layers. However, dPMC input to the dorsal ACC was densest in deep layers, while amygdalar inputs predominantly localized in upper layers. These connection patterns are consistent with diverse roles of the dorsal ACC in motor evaluation and the ventral ACC in affective and contextual memory. Further, distinct laminar circuits suggest unique interactions within specific ACC compartments that are likely important for the temporal integration of motor and limbic information during flexible goal‐directed behavior.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

&lt;p&gt;We identified the afferent projections to the brainstem expiratory oscillator located in the lateral parafacial region (pF&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;). We combined retrograde viruses with RNAScope and immunofluorescence to identify the neurochemical phenotype of neurons. pF&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; neurons receive extensive excitatory and inhibitory inputs that contribute to the modulation of the conditional pF&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; oscillator.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lateral parafacial region (pF&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;; which encompasses the parafacial respiratory group, pFRG) is a conditional oscillator that drives active expiration during periods of high respiratory demand, and increases ventilation through the recruitment of expiratory muscles. The pF&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; activity is highly modulated, and systematic analysis of its afferent projections is required to understand its connectivity and modulatory control. We combined a viral retrograde tracing approach to map direct brainstem projections to the putative location of pF&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;, with RNAScope and immunofluorescence to identify the neurochemical phenotype of the projecting neurons. Within the medulla, retrogradely‐labeled, glutamatergic, glycinergic and GABAergic neurons were found in the ventral respiratory column (Bötzinger and preBötzinger Complex [preBötC], ventral respiratory group, ventral parafacial region [pF&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;] and pF&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;), nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS), reticular formation (RF), pontine and midbrain vestibular nuclei, and medullary raphe. In the pons and midbrain, retrogradely‐labeled neurons of the same phenotypes were found in the Kölliker‐Fuse and parabrachial nuclei, periaqueductal gray, pedunculopontine nucleus (PPT) and laterodorsal tegmentum (LDT). We also identified somatostatin‐expressing neurons in the preBötC and PHOX2B immunopositive cells in the pF&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;, NTS, and part of the RF. Surprisingly, we found no catecholaminergic neurons in the NTS, A5 or &lt;i&gt;Locus Coeruleus&lt;/i&gt;, no serotoninergic raphe neurons nor any cholinergic neurons in the PPT and LDT that projected to the pF&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;. Our results indicate that pF&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; neurons receive extensive excitatory and inhibitory inputs from several respiratory and nonrespiratory related brainstem regions that could contribute to the complex modulation of the conditional pF&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; oscillator for active expiration.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

&lt;p&gt;Projections from hippocampal fields CA1 and the subiculum to the entorhinal cortex are topographically organized. Projections from the presubiculum preferentially distribute to the caudal half of the entorhinal cortex and thus provides a potential indicator for a primate homologue of the medial entorhinal cortex as defined in rodents.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The organization of projections from the macaque monkey hippocampus, subiculum, presubiculum, and parasubiculum to the entorhinal cortex was analyzed using anterograde and retrograde tracing techniques. Projections exclusively originate in the CA1 field of the hippocampus and in the subiculum, presubiculum, and parasubiculum. The CA1 and subicular projections terminate most densely in Layers V and VI of the entorhinal cortex, with sparser innervation of the deep portion of Layers III and II. Entorhinal projections from CA1 and the subiculum are topographically organized such that a rostrocaudal axis of origin is related to a medial‐to‐lateral axis of termination. A proximodistal axis of origin in CA1 and distoproximal axis in subiculum are related to a rostrocaudal axis of termination in the entorhinal cortex. The presubiculum sends a dense, bilateral projection to caudal parts of the entorhinal cortex. This projection terminates most densely in Layer III with sparser termination in Layers I, II, and V. The same parts of entorhinal cortex receive a dense projection from the parasubiculum. This projection terminates in Layers III and II. Both presubicular and parasubicular projections demonstrate the same longitudinal topographic organization as the projections from CA1 and the subiculum. These studies demonstrate that: (a) hippocampal and subicular inputs to the entorhinal cortex in the monkey are organized similar to those described in nonprimate species; (b) the topographic organization of the projections from the hippocampus and subicular areas matches that of the reciprocal projections from the entorhinal cortex to the hippocampus and the subicular areas.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Discrete neural regions express the glycan, including the nucleus of solitary tract, Sp5C, A1 region (a) and dorsal horn and lateral horn (b) where choline acetyltransferase positive sympathetic preganglionic neurons are often coated with polySia (c–e).

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Polysialic acid (polySia), a homopolymer of α2,8‐linked glycans, is a posttranslational modification on a few glycoproteins, most commonly in the brain, on the neural cell adhesion molecule. Most research in the adult central nervous system has focused on its expression in higher brain regions, where its distribution coincides with regions known to exhibit high levels of synaptic plasticity. In contrast, scant attention has been paid to the expression of polySia in the hindbrain. The main aims of the study were to examine the distribution of polySia immunoreactivity in the brainstem and thoracolumbar spinal cord, to compare the distribution of polySia revealed by two commercial antibodies commonly used for its investigation, and to compare labeling in the rat and mouse. We present a comprehensive atlas of polySia immunoreactivity: we report that polySia labeling is particularly dense in the dorsal tegmentum, medial vestibular nuclei and lateral parabrachial nucleus, and in brainstem regions associated with autonomic function, including the dorsal vagal complex, A5, rostral ventral medulla, A1, and midline raphe, as well as sympathetic preganglionic neurons in the spinal cord and central targets of primary sensory afferents (nucleus of the solitary tract, spinal trigeminal nucleus, and dorsal horn [DH]). Ultrastructural examination showed labeling was present predominantly on the plasma membrane/within the extracellular space/in or on astrocytes. Labeling throughout the brainstem and spinal cord were very similar for the two antibodies and was eliminated by the polySia‐specific sialidase, Endo‐NF. Similar patterns of distribution were found in rat and mouse brainstem with differences evident in DH.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

&lt;p&gt;We engrafted RFP‐expressing astrocytes differentiated from hiPSCs into the cortex of immunodeficient mice neonatally. Nine months post engraftment, the human astrocytes in the superficial cortex developed into interlaminar astrocytes that mimicked the interlaminar astrocytes architecture of the adult human cortex. This chimeric mouse model will enable the study of human‐specific interlaminar astrocytes in vivo.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Astrocytes, a highly heterogeneous population of glial cells, serve as essential regulators of brain development and homeostasis. The heterogeneity of astrocyte populations underlies the diversity in their functions. In addition to the typical mammalian astrocyte architecture, the cerebral cortex of humans exhibits a radial distribution of interlaminar astrocytes in the supragranular layers. These primate‐specific interlaminar astrocytes are located in the superficial layer and project long processes traversing multiple layers of the cerebral cortex. However, due to the lack of accessible experimental models, their functional properties and their role in regulating neuronal circuits remain unclear. Here we modeled human interlaminar astrocytes in humanized glial chimeric mice by engrafting astrocytes differentiated from human‐induced pluripotent stem cells into the mouse cortex. This model provides a novel platform for understanding neuron‐glial interaction and its alterations in neurological diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sex steroid hormones such as 17β‐estradiol (estradiol) regulate neuronal function by binding to estrogen receptors (ERs), including ERα and GPER1, and through differential production via the enzyme aromatase. ERs and aromatase are expressed across the nervous system, including in the striatal brain regions. These regions, comprising the nucleus accumbens core, shell, and caudate–putamen, are instrumental for a wide‐range of functions and disorders that show sex differences in phenotype and/or incidence. Sex‐specific estrogen action is an integral component for generating these sex differences. A distinctive feature of the striatal regions is that in adulthood neurons exclusively express membrane but not nuclear ERs. This long‐standing finding dominates models of estrogen action in striatal regions. However, the developmental etiology of ER and aromatase cellular expression in female and male striatum is unknown. This omission in knowledge is important to address, as developmental stage influences cellular estrogenic mechanisms. Thus, ERα, GPER1, and aromatase cellular immunoreactivity was assessed in perinatal, prepubertal, and adult female and male rats. We tested the hypothesis that ERα, GPER1, and aromatase exhibits sex, region, and age‐specific differences, including nuclear expression. ERα exhibits nuclear expression in all three striatal regions before adulthood and disappears in a region‐ and sex‐specific time‐course. Cellular GPER1 expression decreases during development in a region‐ but not sex‐specific time‐course, resulting in extranuclear expression by adulthood. Somatic aromatase expression presents at prepuberty and increases by adulthood in a region‐ but not sex‐specific time‐course. These data indicate that developmental period exerts critical sex‐specific influences on striatal cellular estrogenic mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/cne.24977?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;img alt=&quot;Light sheet microscopy of the gerbil cochlea&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/04c97804-9e20-4bf7-9cce-0c113bd8df54/cne24977-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Light sheet microcopy is used to map frequency along the basilar membrane within intact cochleae, retaining spatial orientation and relationships with internal and external structural landmarks. Three‐dimensional measures of how frequency domains relate to one another gives insight into how the geometric organization of the cochlea may influence its physiology.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Light sheet fluorescence microscopy (LSFM) provides a rapid and complete three‐dimensional image of the cochlea. The method retains anatomical relationships—on a micrometer scale—between internal structures such as hair cells, basilar membrane (BM), and modiolus with external surface structures such as the round and oval windows. Immunolabeled hair cells were used to visualize the spiraling BM in the intact cochlea without time intensive dissections or additional histological processing; yet material prepared for LSFM could be rehydrated, the BM dissected out and reimaged at higher resolution with the confocal microscope. In immersion‐fixed material, details of the cochlear vasculature were seen throughout the cochlea. Hair cell counts (both inner and outer) as well as frequency maps of the BM were comparable to those obtained by other methods, but with the added dimension of depth. The material provided measures of angular, linear, and vector distance between characteristic frequency regions along the BM. Thus, LSFM provides a unique ability to rapidly image the entire cochlea in a manner applicable to model and interpret physiological results. Furthermore, the three‐dimensional organization of the cochlea can be studied at the organ and cellular level with LSFM, and this same material can be taken to the confocal microscope for detailed analysis at the subcellular level.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

&lt;p&gt;Design‐based stereological methods allow the estimation of basic morphological parameters in representative samples of the sectioned central nervous system. Point probes can be used to estimate volume (illustrated for the Area Fraction Fractionator), line probes can be used to estimate surface area (illustrated for a vertical sections design), area probes can be used to estimate length (illustrated for the Spaceball probe), and volume probes must be used to estimate number (illustrated for the Disector). This review provides an introduction to how these methods solve problems associated with other quantitative approaches, how they are applied to histological material, how a sampling scheme can be designed and evaluated, and which practical problems need to be solved to generate the numbers that we will need to come to an understanding of central nervous system function.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generating numbers has become an almost inevitable task associated with studies of the morphology of the nervous system. Numbers serve a desire for clarity and objectivity in the presentation of results and are a prerequisite for the statistical evaluation of experimental outcomes. Clarity, objectivity, and statistics make demands on the quality of the numbers that are not met by many methods. This review provides a refresher of problems associated with generating numbers that describe the nervous system in terms of the volumes, surfaces, lengths, and numbers of its components. An important aim is to provide comprehensible descriptions of the methods that address these problems. Collectively known as design‐based stereology, these methods share two features critical to their application. First, they are firmly based in mathematics and its proofs. Second and critically underemphasized, an understanding of their mathematical background is not necessary for their informed and productive application. Understanding and applying estimators of volume, surface, length or number does not require more of an organizational mastermind than an immunohistochemical protocol. And when it comes to calculations, square roots are the gravest challenges to overcome. Sampling strategies that are combined with stereological probes are efficient and allow a rational assessment if the numbers that have been generated are “good enough.” Much may be unfamiliar, but very little is difficult. These methods can no longer be scapegoats for discrepant results but faithfully produce numbers on the material that is assessed. They also faithfully reflect problems that associated with the histological material and the anatomically informed decisions needed to generate numbers that are not only valid in theory. It is within reach to generate practically useful numbers that must integrate with qualitative knowledge to understand the function of neural systems.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

&lt;p&gt;The parabrachial nucleus surrounds the superior cerebellar peduncle at the midbrain‐hindbrain junction. Its glutamatergic neurons form subpopulations with distinct genetic identities, two of which express &lt;i&gt;Foxp2&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Pdyn&lt;/i&gt;. Here, we detail the location of &lt;i&gt;Foxp2&lt;/i&gt;‐ and &lt;i&gt;Pdyn&lt;/i&gt;‐expressing neurons within the larger &lt;i&gt;Vglut2&lt;/i&gt;‐expressing population. We then use Cre‐conditional expression of synaptophysin‐mCherry to map the efferent projections of each population. Salient findings include the identification of glutamatergic output from the parabrachial nucleus to the rostral entorhinal cortex and lateral superior colliculus, plus an absence of &lt;i&gt;Foxp2&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;Pdyn&lt;/i&gt; output to the cerebral cortex, basal forebrain, and amygdala.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The parabrachial nucleus (PB) is a complex structure located at the junction of the midbrain and hindbrain. Its neurons have diverse genetic profiles and influence a variety of homeostatic functions. While its cytoarchitecture and overall efferent projections are known, we lack comprehensive information on the projection patterns of specific neuronal subtypes in the PB. In this study, we compared the projection patterns of glutamatergic neurons here with a subpopulation expressing the transcription factor &lt;i&gt;Foxp2&lt;/i&gt; and a further subpopulation expressing the neuropeptide &lt;i&gt;Pdyn&lt;/i&gt;. To do this, we injected an AAV into the PB region to deliver a Cre‐dependent anterograde tracer (synaptophysin‐mCherry) in three different strains of Cre‐driver mice. We then analyzed 147 neuroanatomical regions for labeled boutons in every brain (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 11). Overall, glutamatergic neurons in the PB region project to a wide variety of sites in the cerebral cortex, basal forebrain, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, amygdala, diencephalon, and brainstem. &lt;i&gt;Foxp2&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Pdyn&lt;/i&gt; subpopulations project heavily to the hypothalamus, but not to the cortex, basal forebrain, or amygdala. Among the few differences between &lt;i&gt;Foxp2&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Pdyn&lt;/i&gt; cases was a notable lack of &lt;i&gt;Pdyn&lt;/i&gt; projections to the ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus. Our results indicate that genetic identity determines connectivity (and therefore, function), providing a framework for mapping all PB output projections based on the genetic identity of its neurons. Using genetic markers to systematically classify PB neurons and their efferent projections will enhance the translation of research findings from experimental animals to humans.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

&lt;p&gt;iTBS has a stronger decision promoting effect than 20 Hz, which can be used as an effective way to alter choice and presents an improvement on standard rTMS protocols.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Traditional repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation can only produce a significant but weak effect on the cortex while theta burst stimulation (TBS), a patterned accelerated form of stimulation, can produce a stronger poststimulation effect, which may improve decision‐making abilities. We designed a comparative assessment of the effect of intermittent TBS (iTBS), 20 Hz, in two risk decision‐making tasks on healthy controls. Participants were randomized and assigned to the iTBS (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 29), 20 Hz (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 29), or sham (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 29) groups. The effects of the different methods of left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex stimulation on risk decision‐making functions were compared based on subjects’ performance in the Game of Dice Task (GDT) and Risky Gains Task (RGT). The main indicators were positive and negative feedback utilization rates of GDT and RGT. Both iTBS and 20 Hz stimulation resulted in significant improvements upon negative feedback in the GDT, with increases in safe options and reductions in risky options; iTBS stimulation increased subjects’ use of positive feedback in the GDT and RGT (all &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05). Furthermore, the iTBS group had a stronger feedback risk reduction effect than the 20 Hz or sham group following RGT negative feedback (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05). Individuals would integrate positive and negative information more efficiently, leading to them making rational choices after excitatory transcranial magnetic stimulation. Moreover, iTBS has a stronger risk reduction effect following negative feedback than the 20Hz stimulation did. In summary, iTBS might have clinical value in decision promotion.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2012.15854</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In order to understand the complex cognitive functions of the human brain, it
is essential to study the structural connectome, i.e., the wiring of different
brain regions to each other through axonal pathways. However, the high degree
of plasticity and cross-population variability in human brains makes it
difficult to relate structure to function, motivating a search for invariant
patterns in the connectivity. At the same time, variability within a population
can provide information about generative mechanisms. In this paper we analyze
the connection topology and link-weight distribution of human structural
connectomes obtained from a database comprising 196 subjects. By demonstrating
a correspondence between the occurrence frequency of individual links and their
average weight across the population, we show that the process by which the
brain is wired is not independent of the process by which the link weights of
the connectome are determined. Furthermore, using the specific distribution of
the weights associated with each link over the entire population, we show that
a single parameter that is specific to a link can account for its frequency of
occurrence, as well as, the variation in its weight across different subjects.
This parameter provides a basis for ``rescaling'' the link weights in each
connectome, allowing us to obtain a generic network representative of the human
brain, distinct from a simple average over the connectomes. We obtain
functional connectomes by implementing a neural mass model on each of the
vertices of the corresponding structural connectomes. By comparing with the
empirical functional brain networks, we demonstrate that the rescaling
procedure yields a closer structure-function correspondence. Finally, we show
that the representative network can be decomposed into a basal component that
is stable across the population and a highly variable superstructure.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2012.15750</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;We develop an analytic model of the mammalian cochlea. We use a mixed
physical-phenomenological approach by utilizing existing work on the physics of
classical box-representations of the cochlea, and behavior of recent
data-derived wavenumber estimates. Spatial variation is incorporated through a
single independent variable that combines space and frequency. We arrive at
closed-form expressions for the organ of Corti velocity, its impedance, the
pressure difference across the organ of Corti, and its wavenumber. We perform
model tests using real and imaginary parts of chinchilla data from multiple
locations and for multiple variables. The model also predicts impedances that
are qualitatively consistent with current literature. For implementation, the
model can leverage existing efforts for both filter bank and filter cascade
models that target improved algorithmic or analog circuit efficiencies. The
simplicity of the cochlear model, its small number of model constants, its
ability to capture the variation of tuning, its closed-form expressions for
physically-interrelated variables, and the form of these expressions that
allows for easily determining one variable from another make the model
appropriate for analytic and digital auditory filter implementations as
discussed here, as well as for extracting macromechanical insights regarding
how the cochlea works.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A freely walking fly visits roughly 100 stereotyped states in a strongly

of the information bottleneck method, compressing the large number of
behavioral states into a more compact description that maximally preserves the
correlations between successive states. Surprisingly, preserving these short
time correlations with a compression into just two states captures the long
ranged correlations seen in the raw data. Having reduced the behavior to a
binary sequence, we describe the distribution of these sequences by an Ising
model with pairwise interactions, which is the maximum entropy model that
matches the two-point correlations. Matching the correlation function at longer
and longer times drives the resulting model toward the Ising model with inverse
square interactions and near zero magnetic field. The emergence of this
statistical physics problem from the analysis real data on animal behavior is
unexpected.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;With large quantities of data typically available nowadays, forecasting
models that are trained across sets of time series, known as Global Forecasting
Models (GFM), are regularly outperforming traditional univariate forecasting
models that work on isolated series. As GFMs usually share the same set of
parameters across all time series, they often have the problem of not being
localised enough to a particular series, especially in situations where
datasets are heterogeneous. We study how ensembling techniques can be used with
generic GFMs and univariate models to solve this issue. Our work systematises
and compares relevant current approaches, namely clustering series and training
separate submodels per cluster, the so-called ensemble of specialists approach,
and building heterogeneous ensembles of global and local models. We fill some
gaps in the approaches and generalise them to different underlying GFM model
types. We then propose a new methodology of clustered ensembles where we train
multiple GFMs on different clusters of series, obtained by changing the number
of clusters and cluster seeds. Using Feed-forward Neural Networks, Recurrent
Neural Networks, and Pooled Regression models as the underlying GFMs, in our
evaluation on six publicly available datasets, the proposed models are able to
achieve significantly higher accuracy than baseline GFM models and univariate
forecasting methods.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Many concepts have been proposed for meta learning with neural networks
(NNs), e.g., NNs that learn to control fast weights, hyper networks, learned
learning rules, and meta recurrent neural networks (Meta RNNs). Our Variable
Shared Meta Learning (VS-ML) unifies the above and demonstrates that simple
weight-sharing and sparsity in an NN is sufficient to express powerful learning
algorithms. A simple implementation of VS-ML called Variable Shared Meta RNN
allows for implementing the backpropagation learning algorithm solely by
running an RNN in forward-mode. It can even meta-learn new learning algorithms
that improve upon backpropagation, generalizing to different datasets without
explicit gradient calculation.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2012.14601</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A key aspect of human intelligence is the ability to infer abstract rules
directly from high-dimensional sensory data, and to do so given only a limited
amount of training experience. Deep neural network algorithms have proven to be
a powerful tool for learning directly from high-dimensional data, but currently
lack this capacity for data-efficient induction of abstract rules, leading some
to argue that symbol-processing mechanisms will be necessary to account for
this capacity. In this work, we take a step toward bridging this gap by
introducing the Emergent Symbol Binding Network (ESBN), a recurrent network
augmented with an external memory that enables a form of variable-binding and
indirection. This binding mechanism allows symbol-like representations to
emerge through the learning process without the need to explicitly incorporate
symbol-processing machinery, enabling the ESBN to learn rules in a manner that
is abstracted away from the particular entities to which those rules apply.
Across a series of tasks, we show that this architecture displays nearly
perfect generalization of learned rules to novel entities given only a limited
number of training examples, and outperforms a number of other competitive
neural network architectures.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The hippocampus is often attributed to episodic memory formation and storage
in the mammalian brain; in particular, Alme et al. showed that hippocampal area
CA3 forms statistically independent representations across a large number of

of overlap between spatial maps indicates the large capacity of the CA3
circuitry. In this paper, we support the argument for the large capacity of the
CA3 network. To do so, we replicate the key findings of Alme et al. and extend
the results by perturbing the neural activity encodings with noise and
conducting representation similarity analysis (RSA). We find that the
correlations between firing rates are partially resistant to noise, and that
the spatial representations across cells show similar patterns, even across
different environments. Finally, we discuss some theoretical and practical
implications of our results.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Artificial spiking neural networks have found applications in areas where the
temporal nature of activation offers an advantage, such as time series
prediction and signal processing. To improve their efficiency, spiking
architectures often run on custom-designed neuromorphic hardware, but, despite
their attractive properties, these implementations have been limited to digital
systems. We describe an artificial quantum spiking neuron that relies on the
dynamical evolution of two easy to implement Hamiltonians and subsequent local
measurements. The architecture allows exploiting complex amplitudes and
back-action from measurements to influence the input. This approach to learning
protocols is advantageous in the case where the input and output of the system
are both quantum states. We demonstrate this through the classification of Bell
pairs which can be seen as a certification protocol. Stacking the introduced
elementary building blocks into larger networks combines the spatiotemporal
features of a spiking neural network with the non-local quantum correlations
across the graph.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1906.05890</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In this paper, we study the implicit regularization of the gradient descent
algorithm in homogeneous neural networks, including fully-connected and
convolutional neural networks with ReLU or LeakyReLU activations. In
particular, we study the gradient descent or gradient flow (i.e., gradient
descent with infinitesimal step size) optimizing the logistic loss or
cross-entropy loss of any homogeneous model (possibly non-smooth), and show
that if the training loss decreases below a certain threshold, then we can
define a smoothed version of the normalized margin which increases over time.
We also formulate a natural constrained optimization problem related to margin
maximization, and prove that both the normalized margin and its smoothed
version converge to the objective value at a KKT point of the optimization
problem. Our results generalize the previous results for logistic regression
with one-layer or multi-layer linear networks, and provide more quantitative
convergence results with weaker assumptions than previous results for
homogeneous smooth neural networks. We conduct several experiments to justify
our theoretical finding on MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets. Finally, as margin is
closely related to robustness, we discuss potential benefits of training longer
for improving the robustness of the model.

	<content:encoded>The cerebellum consists of parallel parasagittal modules that contribute to diverse behaviors, spanning motor to cognitive. Recent work illustrating a role for the anterior interposed nucleus (IntA) in reach control in mice raised questions of its anatomical organization that could confer functional specificity. We employed intersectional cell- and projection- specific labeling methods to map IntA inputs and outputs. In contrast to long-standing dogma of primarily excitatory outputs and restricted inferior olive targeting inhibitory output, we found that inhibitory IntA neurons ramified widely within the brainstem, targeting both motor- and sensory-related nuclei, suggesting potential functional roles in disinhibitory control or predictive sensory cancellation. Using monosynaptic rabies tracing, we then found that excitatory output neurons receive fewer and more precisely organized inputs than inhibitory neurons, which may set them up for distinct computations. Together these data suggest IntA contains at least two distinct output circuits and promise advances in identifying parallel computations of the cerebellum.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Fear extinction is an adaptive behavioral process critical for organisms survival, but deficiency in extinction may lead to PTSD. While the amygdala and its neural circuits are critical for fear extinction, the molecular identity and organizational logic of cell types that lie at the core of these circuits remain unclear. Here we report that mice deficient for amygdala-enriched gastrin-releasing peptide gene (Grp-/-) exhibit enhanced neuronal activity in the basolateral amygdala (BLA) and stronger fear conditioning, as well as deficient extinction in stress-enhanced fear learning (SEFL). rAAV2-retro-based tracing combined with visualization of the GFP knocked in the Grp gene showed that BLA receives GRPergic or conditioned stimulus projections from the indirect auditory thalamus-to-auditory cortex pathway, ventral hippocampus and ventral tegmental area. Transcription of dopamine-related genes was decreased in BLA of Grp-/- mice following SEFL extinction recall, suggesting that the GRP may mediate fear extinction regulation by dopamine.

Impact statementMice deficient for the amygdala-enriched gastrin-releasing peptide gene are susceptible to stress-enhanced fear, a behavioral protocol with relevance to PTSD, and show a decrease in dopamine-related gene transcription.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: The growing topology of the C. elegans connectome</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.31.424985v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Probing the developing neural circuitry in Caenorhabditis elegans has enhanced our understanding of nervous systems. The C. elegans connectome, like those of other species, is characterized by a rich club of densely connected neurons embedded within a small-world architecture. This organization of neuronal connections, captured by quantitative network statistics, provides insight into the systems capacity to perform integrative computations. Yet these network measures are limited in their ability to detect weakly connected motifs, such as topological cavities, that may support the systems capacity to perform segregated computations. We address this limitation by using persistent homology to track the evolution of topological cavities in the growing C. elegans connectome throughout neural development, and assess the degree to which the growing connec-tomes topology is resistant to biological noise. We show that the developing connectome topology is both relatively robust to changes in neuron birth times and not captured by similar growth models. Additionally, we quantify the consequence of a neurons specific birth time and ask if this metric tracks other biological properties of neurons. Our results suggest that the connectomes growing topology is a robust feature of the developing con-nectome that is distinct from other network properties, and that the growing topology is particularly sensitive to the exact birth times of a small set of predominantly motor neurons. By utilizing novel measurements that track biological features, we anticipate that our study will be helpful in the construction of more accurate models of neuronal development in C. elegans.

Author SummaryNetwork analyses have identified several local and global properties of the C. elegans connectome that are relevant to the organisms function and its capacity for information processing. Recent work has extended those investigations by focusing on the connectomes growth, in an effort to uncover potential drivers of connectome formation. Here we investigate connectome growth from the perspective of applied algebraic topology, by tracking both changing and persistent homology. In doing so, we are able to measure the resilience of the growth process to perturbations, and assess spatial variations in that resilience throughout the organisms body. Our findings provide new insights regarding the development of this simple natural connectome, as we have determined the existence of a robust and topologically simple network feature that is unexplained by the presence of other notable features of the connectome.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Sociality is classified as one of the major transitions in evolution, with the largest number of eusocial species found in the insect order Hymenoptera, including the Apini (honey bees) and the Bombini (bumble bees). Bumble bees and honey bees not only differ in their social organization and foraging strategies, but comparative analyses of their genomes demonstrated that bumble bees have a slightly less diverse family of olfactory receptors than honeybees, suggesting that their olfactory abilities have adapted to different social and/or ecological conditions. However, unfortunately, no precise comparison of olfactory coding has been performed so far between honey bees and bumble bees, and little is known about the rules underlying olfactory coding in the bumble bee brain. In this study, we used in vivo calcium imaging to study olfactory coding of a panel of floral odorants in the antennal lobe (AL) of the bumble bee Bombus terrestris. Our results show that odorants evoke consistent neuronal activity in the bumble bee antennal lobe. Each odorant evokes a different glomerular activity pattern revealing this molecules chemical structure, i.e. its carbon chain length and functional group. Response intensity as well as odor-similarity relationships were highly correlated to those measured in honey bees. This study thus suggests that bumble bees, like honey bees, are equipped to respond to odorants according to their chemical features.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Disinhibition is an obligatory initial step in the remodeling of cortical circuits by sensory experience, yet the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Our investigation of mechanisms for disinhibition in the classical model of ocular dominance plasticity (ODP) uncovered an unexpected novel form of experience-dependent circuit plasticity. In layer 2/3 of mouse visual cortex monocular deprivation triggers an &quot;all-or-none&quot; elimination of approximately half the connections from local pyramidal cells onto parvalbumin-positive interneurons (Pyr[-&amp;gt;]PV), without affecting the strength of the remaining connections. This loss of Pyr[-&amp;gt;]PV connections is transient, lasting one day only, has a critical period commensurate with the ODP critical period, and is contingent on a reduction of neuropentraxin2 (NPTX2), which normally stabilizes Pyr[-&amp;gt;]PV connections. Bidirectional manipulations of NPTX2 functionality that prevent/promote the elimination Pyr[-&amp;gt;]PV connections also promote/prevent ODP. We surmise, therefore, that this rapid and reversible loss of local Pyr[-&amp;gt;]PV circuitry gates experience-dependent cortical plasticity.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.12.30.424858v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>The hippocampus is implicated in episodic memory and allocentric spatial navigation. However, spatial selectivity is insufficient to navigate; one needs information about the distance and direction to the reward on a specific journey. The nature of these representations, whether they are expressed in an episodic-like sequence, and their relationship with navigational performance are unknown. We recorded single units from dorsal CA1 of the hippocampus while rats navigated to an unmarked reward zone defined solely by distal visual cues, similar to the classic water maze. The allocentric spatial selectivity was substantially weaker than in typical real world tasks, despite excellent navigational performance. Instead, the majority of cells encoded path distance from the start of trials. Cells also encoded the rats allocentric position and head angle. Often the same cells multiplexed and encoded path distance, head direction and allocentric position in a sequence, thus encoding a journey-specific episode. The strength of neural activity and tuning strongly correlated with performance, with a temporal relationship indicating neural responses influencing behavior and vice versa. Consistent with computational models of associative Hebbian learning, neural responses showed increasing clustering and became better predictors of behaviorally relevant variables, with neurometric curves exceeding and converging to psychometric curves. These findings demonstrate that hippocampal neurons multiplex and exhibit highly plastic, task- and experience-dependent tuning to path-centric and allocentric variables to form an episode, which could mediate navigation.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25981?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study used childhood cancer survivors as a novel model to study whether children who experience central nervous system (CNS) injury are at higher risk for neurocognitive impairment associated with subsequent late onset chronic health conditions (CHCs).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adult survivors of childhood cancer (n = 2,859, ≥10 years from diagnosis, ≥18 years old) completed a comprehensive neurocognitive battery and clinical examination. Neurocognitive impairment was defined as age‐adjusted &lt;i&gt;z&lt;/i&gt; score &amp;lt; 10th percentile. Participants impaired on ≥3 tests had global impairment. CHCs were graded using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v4.3 (grade 1, mild; 2, moderate; 3, severe/disabling; 4, life‐threatening) and were combined into a severity/burden score by frequency and grade (none/low, medium, high, and very high). A total of 1,598 survivors received CNS‐directed therapy including cranial radiation, intrathecal methotrexate, or neurosurgery. Logistic regression estimated the odds of neurocognitive impairment associated with severity/burden score and grade 2 to 4 conditions, stratified by CNS treatment.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CNS‐treated survivors performed worse than non–CNS‐treated survivors on all neurocognitive tests and were more likely to have global neurocognitive impairment (46.9% vs 35.3%, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001). After adjusting for demographic and treatment factors, there was a dose–response association between severity/burden score and global neurocognitive impairment, but only among CNS‐treated survivors (high odds ratio [OR] = 2.24, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.42–3.53; very high OR = 4.07, 95% CI = 2.30–7.17). Cardiovascular and pulmonary conditions were associated with processing speed, executive function, and memory impairments in CNS‐treated but not non–CNS‐treated survivors who were impacted by neurologic conditions.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reduced cognitive/brain reserve associated with CNS‐directed therapy during childhood may make survivors vulnerable to adverse cognitive effects of cardiopulmonary conditions during adulthood. ANN NEUROL 2020&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

The spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus poses serious threats to the global public health and leads to worldwide crisis. No effective drug or vaccine is readily available. The viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) is a promising therapeutic target. A hybrid drug screening procedure was proposed and applied to identify potential drug candidates targeting RdRp from 1906 approved drugs. Among the four selected market available drug candidates, Pralatrexate and Azithromycin were confirmed to effectively inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; with EC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; values of 0.008μM and 9.453 μM, respectively. For the first time, our study discovered that Pralatrexate is able to potently inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication with a stronger inhibitory activity than Remdesivir within the same experimental conditions. The paper demonstrates the feasibility of fast and accurate anti-viral drug screening for inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 and provides potential therapeutic agents against COVID-19.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/FAnRCMxpaFQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

The distribution of scholarly content today happens in the context of an immense deluge of information found on the internet. As a result, researchers face serious challenges when archiving and finding information that relates to their work. Library science principles provide a framework for navigating information ecosystems in order to help researchers improve findability of their professional output. Here, we describe the information ecosystem which consists of users, context, and content, all 3 of which must be addressed to make information findable and usable. We provide a set of tips that can help researchers evaluate who their users are, how to archive their research outputs to encourage findability, and how to leverage structural elements of software to make it easier to find information within and beyond their publications. As scholars evaluate their research communication strategies, they can use these steps to improve how their research is discovered and reused.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/ocC72s4QDbc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Chimpanzees (&lt;i&gt;Pan troglodytes&lt;/i&gt;) are, along with bonobos, humans’ closest living relatives. The advent of diffusion MRI tractography in recent years has allowed a resurgence of comparative neuroanatomical studies in humans and other primate species. Here we offer, in comparative perspective, the first chimpanzee white matter atlas, constructed from in vivo chimpanzee diffusion-weighted scans. Comparative white matter atlases provide a useful tool for identifying neuroanatomical differences and similarities between humans and other primate species. Until now, comprehensive fascicular atlases have been created for humans (&lt;i&gt;Homo sapiens&lt;/i&gt;), rhesus macaques (&lt;i&gt;Macaca mulatta)&lt;/i&gt;, and several other nonhuman primate species, but never in a nonhuman ape. Information on chimpanzee neuroanatomy is essential for understanding the anatomical specializations of white matter organization that are unique to the human lineage.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/EVgDQ5MfDv4&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Correlative light, electron, and ion microscopy (CLEIM) offers huge potential to track the intracellular fate of antibiotics, with organelle-level resolution. However, a correlative approach that enables subcellular antibiotic visualisation in pathogen-infected tissue is lacking. Here, we developed correlative light, electron, and ion microscopy in tissue (CLEIMiT) and used it to identify the cell type–specific accumulation of an antibiotic in lung lesions of mice infected with &lt;i&gt;Mycobacterium tuberculosis&lt;/i&gt;. Using CLEIMiT, we found that the anti-tuberculosis (TB) drug bedaquiline (BDQ) is localised not only in foamy macrophages in the lungs during infection but also accumulate in polymorphonuclear (PMN) cells.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/C4fV-xZSuXI&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

&lt;p&gt;Serial section immuno‐electron microscopy of gamma protocadherins (Pcdh‐γs), a subset of clustered protocadherins, at synapses in CA1. We characterized synaptic diameter and perforation status for synapses labeled with antibodies to Pcdh‐γs and found that they were larger with more frequent perforations. Results were confirmed by light level imaging of immunolabeled synapses. The results suggest that clustered protocadherins may mediate a late event in synaptic development. Bar = 500 nm.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clustered protocadherins (Pcdhs) are a family of ~60 cadherin‐like proteins (divided into subclasses α, β, γ) that regulate dendrite morphology and neural connectivity. Their expression is controlled through epigenetic regulation at a gene cluster encoding the molecules. During neural development, Pcdhs mediate dendrite self‐avoidance in some neuronal types through an uncharacterized anti‐adhesive mechanism. Pcdhs are also important for dendritic complexity in cortical neurons likely through a pro‐adhesive mechanism. Pcdhs have also been postulated to participate in synaptogenesis and connectivity. Some synaptic defects were noted in knockout animals, including synaptic number and physiology, but the role of these molecules in synaptic development is not understood. The effect of Pcdh knockout on dendritic patterning may present a confound to studying synaptogenesis. We showed previously that Pcdh‐γs are highly enriched in intracellular compartments in dendrites and spines with localization at only a few synaptic clefts. To gain insight into how Pcdh‐γs might affect synapses, we compared synapses that harbored Pcdh‐γs versus those that did not for parameters of synaptic maturation including pre‐ and postsynaptic size, postsynaptic perforations, and spine morphology by light microscopy in cultured hippocampal neurons and by serial section immuno‐electron microscopy in hippocampal CA1. In mature neurons, synapses immunopositive for Pcdh‐γs were larger in diameter with more frequent perforations. Analysis of spines in cultured neurons revealed that mushroom spines were more frequently immunopositive for Pcdh‐γs at their tips than thin spines. These results suggest that Pcdh‐γ function at the synapse may be related to promotion of synaptic maturation and stabilization.&lt;/p&gt;

	<content:encoded>The spatiotemporal proteome of the intervertebral disc (IVD) underpins its integrity and function. We present DIPPER, a deep and comprehensive IVD proteomic resource comprising 94 genome-wide profiles from 17 individuals. To begin with, protein modules defining key directional trends spanning the lateral and anteroposterior axes were derived from high-resolution spatial proteomes of intact young cadaveric lumbar IVDs. They revealed novel region-specific profiles of regulatory activities, and displayed potential paths of deconstruction in the level- and location-matched aged cadaveric discs. Machine learning methods predicted a 'hydration matrisome' that connects extracellular matrix with MRI intensity. Importantly, the static proteome used as point-references can be integrated with dynamic proteome (SILAC/degradome) and transcriptome data from multiple clinical samples, enhancing robustness and clinical relevance. The data, findings and methodology, available on a web interface (www.sbms.hku.hk/dclab/DIPPER), will be valuable references in the field of IVD biology and proteomic analytics.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is the commonest cause of congenital infection (cCMVi) and particularly so among infants born to HIV-infected women. Studies of cCMVi pathogenesis are complicated by the presence of multiple infecting maternal CMV strains, especially in HIV-positive women, and the large, recombinant CMV genome. Using newly developed tools to reconstruct CMV haplotypes, we demonstrate anatomic CMV compartmentalization in five HIV-infected mothers and identify the possibility of congenitally transmitted genotypes in three of their infants. A single CMV strain was transmitted in each congenitally infected case, and all were closely related to those that predominate in the cognate maternal cervix. Compared to non-transmitted strains, these congenitally transmitted CMV strains showed statistically significant similarities in 19 genes associated with tissue-tropism and immunomodulation. In all infants, incident superinfections with distinct strains from breast milk were captured during follow-up. The results represent potentially important new insights into the virologic determinants of early CMV infection.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/62114</link>
	<content:encoded>The relationship between AD pathology and cognitive decline is an important topic in the aging research field. Recent studies suggest that memory deficits are more susceptible to phosphorylated tau (Ptau), than amyloid-beta. However, little is known regarding the neurocognitive mechanisms linking Ptau and memory related decline. Here, we extracted data from ADNI participants with CSF (cerebrospinal fluid) Ptau collected at baseline, diffusion tensor imaging measure twice, two-year apart, and longitudinal memory data over five years. We defined three age- and education-matched groups: Ptau negative cognitively unimpaired, Ptau positive cognitively unimpaired, and Ptau positive individuals with mild cognitive impairment. We found the presence of CSF Ptau at baseline was related to a loss of structural stability in medial temporal lobe connectivity in a way that matched proposed disease progression, and this loss of stability in connections known to be important for memory moderated the relationship between Ptau accumulation and memory decline.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/58343</link>
	<content:encoded>Eutherian mammals have characteristic lengths of gestation that are key for reproductive success, but relatively little is known about the processes that determine the timing of parturition, the process of birth, and how they are coordinated with fetal developmental programs. This issue remains one of biology's great unsolved mysteries and has significant clinical relevance because preterm birth is the leading cause of infant and under 5 year old child mortality worldwide. Here, we consider the evolutionary influences and potential signaling mechanisms that maintain or end pregnancy in eutherian mammals and use this knowledge to formulate general theoretical evolutionary models. These models can be tested through evolutionary species comparisons, studies of experimental manipulation of gestation period and birth timing, and human clinical studies. Understanding how gestation time and parturition are determined will shed light on this fundamental biological process and improve human health through the development of therapies to prevent preterm birth.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/56551</link>
	<content:encoded>Defective primary cilia cause a range of diseases known as ciliopathies, including hearing loss. The etiology of hearing loss in ciliopathies, however, remains unclear. We analyzed cochleae from three ciliopathy mouse models exhibiting different ciliogenesis defects: &lt;i&gt;Intraflagellar transport 88&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;Ift88&lt;/i&gt;), &lt;i&gt;Tbc1d32 &lt;/i&gt;(a.k.a.&lt;i&gt; bromi&lt;/i&gt;), and &lt;i&gt;Cilk1 &lt;/i&gt;(a.k.a.&lt;i&gt; Ick&lt;/i&gt;) mutants. These mutants showed multiple developmental defects including shortened cochlear duct and abnormal apical patterning of the organ of Corti. Although ciliogenic defects in cochlear hair cells such as misalignment of the kinocilium are often associated with the planar cell polarity pathway, our results showed that inner ear defects in these mutants are primarily due to loss of sonic hedgehog signaling. Furthermore, an inner ear-specific deletion of &lt;i&gt;Cilk1&lt;/i&gt; elicits low-frequency hearing loss attributable to cellular changes in apical cochlear identity that is dedicated to low-frequency sound detection. This type of hearing loss may account for hearing deficits in some patients with ciliopathies.</content:encoded>

	<title>Hippocampus: Bilateral histone deacetylase 1 and 2 activity and enrichment at unique genes following induction of long‐term potentiation in vivo</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/hipo.23297?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Long‐term potentiation (LTP) is a synaptic plasticity mechanism critical to long‐term memory. LTP induced in vivo is characterized by altered transcriptional activity, including a period of upregulation of gene expression which is followed by a later dominant downregulation. This temporal shift to downregulated gene expression is predicted to be partly mediated by epigenetic inhibitors of gene expression, such as histone deacetylases (HDACs). Further, pharmacological inhibitors of HDAC activity have previously been shown to enhance LTP persistence in vitro. To explore the contribution of HDACs to the persistence of LTP in vivo, we examined HDAC1 and HDAC2 activity over a 24 hr period following unilateral LTP induction in the dentate gyrus of freely moving rats. Surprisingly, we found significant changes in HDAC1 and HDAC2 activity in both the stimulated as well as the unstimulated hemispheres, with the largest increase in activity occurring bilaterally, 20 min after LTP stimulation. During this time point of heightened activity, chromatin immunoprecipitation assays showed that both HDAC1 and HDAC2 were enriched at distinct sets of genes within each hemispheres. Further, the HDAC inhibitor Trichostatin A enhanced an intermediate phase of LTP lasting days, which has not previously been associated with altered transcription. The inhibitor had no effect on the persistence of LTP lasting weeks. Together, these data suggest that HDAC activity early after the induction of LTP may negatively regulate plasticity‐related gene expression that is involved in the initial stabilization of LTP, but not its long‐term maintenance.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Computational methods that predict protein stability changes induced by missense mutations have made a lot of progress over the past decades. Most of the available methods however have very limited accuracy in predicting stabilizing mutations because existing experimental sets are dominated by mutations reducing protein stability. Moreover, few approaches could consistently perform well across different test cases. To address these issues, we developed a new computational method PremPS to more accurately evaluate the effects of missense mutations on protein stability. The PremPS method is composed of only ten evolutionary- and structure-based features and parameterized on a balanced dataset with an equal number of stabilizing and destabilizing mutations. A comprehensive comparison of the predictive performance of PremPS with other available methods on nine benchmark datasets confirms that our approach consistently outperforms other methods and shows considerable improvement in estimating the impacts of stabilizing mutations. A protein could have multiple structures available, and if another structure of the same protein is used, the predicted change in stability for structure-based methods might be different. Thus, we further estimated the impact of using different structures on prediction accuracy, and demonstrate that our method performs well across different types of structures except for low-resolution structures and models built based on templates with low sequence identity. PremPS can be used for finding functionally important variants, revealing the molecular mechanisms of functional influences and protein design. PremPS is freely available at https://lilab.jysw.suda.edu.cn/research/PremPS/, which allows to do large-scale mutational scanning and takes about four minutes to perform calculations for a single mutation per protein with ~ 300 residues and requires ~ 0.4 seconds for each additional mutation.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/viIv2OJ1OX8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) has multiple applications in molecular biology, including developing new targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) panels. We present NGS-PrimerPlex, an efficient and versatile command-line application that designs primers for different refined types of amplicon-based genome target enrichment. It supports nested and anchored multiplex PCR, redistribution among multiplex reactions of primers constructed earlier, and extension of existing NGS-panels. The primer design process takes into consideration the formation of secondary structures, non-target amplicons between all primers of a pool, primers and high-frequent genome single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) overlapping. Moreover, users of NGS-PrimerPlex are free from manually defining input genome regions, because it can be done automatically from a list of genes or their parts like exon or codon numbers. Using the program, the NGS-panel for sequencing the &lt;i&gt;LRRK2&lt;/i&gt; gene coding regions was created, and 354 DNA samples were studied successfully with a median coverage of 97.4% of target regions by at least 30 reads. To show that NGS-PrimerPlex can also be applied for bacterial genomes, we designed primers to detect foodborne pathogens &lt;i&gt;Salmonella enterica&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; O157:H7, &lt;i&gt;Listeria monocytogenes&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;Staphylococcus aureus&lt;/i&gt; considering variable positions of the genomes.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/bkjkub_e2Oc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

The Golgi cells are the main inhibitory interneurons of the cerebellar granular layer. Although recent works have highlighted the complexity of their dendritic organization and synaptic inputs, the mechanisms through which these neurons integrate complex input patterns remained unknown. Here we have used 8 detailed morphological reconstructions to develop multicompartmental models of Golgi cells, in which Na, Ca, and K channels were distributed along dendrites, soma, axonal initial segment and axon. The models faithfully reproduced a rich pattern of electrophysiological and pharmacological properties and predicted the operating mechanisms of these neurons. Basal dendrites turned out to be more tightly electrically coupled to the axon initial segment than apical dendrites. During synaptic transmission, parallel fibers caused slow Ca-dependent depolarizations in apical dendrites that boosted the axon initial segment encoder and Na-spike backpropagation into basal dendrites, while inhibitory synapses effectively shunted backpropagating currents. This oriented dendritic processing set up a coincidence detector controlling voltage-dependent NMDA receptor unblock in basal dendrites, which, by regulating local calcium influx, may provide the basis for spike-timing dependent plasticity anticipated by theory.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/iSwcVllqU1A&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

The development of next generation sequencing (NGS) platform-based single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) techniques has tremendously changed biological researches, while there are still many questions that cannot be addressed by them due to their short read lengths. We developed a novel scRNA-seq technology based on third-generation sequencing (TGS) platform (single-cell amplification and sequencing of full-length RNAs by Nanopore platform, SCAN-seq). SCAN-seq exhibited high sensitivity and accuracy comparable to NGS platform-based scRNA-seq methods. Moreover, we captured thousands of unannotated transcripts of diverse types, with high verification rate by reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR)–coupled Sanger sequencing in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs). Then, we used SCAN-seq to analyze the mouse preimplantation embryos. We could clearly distinguish cells at different developmental stages, and a total of 27,250 unannotated transcripts from 9,338 genes were identified, with many of which showed developmental stage-specific expression patterns. Finally, we showed that SCAN-seq exhibited high accuracy on determining allele-specific gene expression patterns within an individual cell. SCAN-seq makes a major breakthrough for single-cell transcriptome analysis field.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/V_5xMmYS08U&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Clustering of the enteropathogenic &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; (EPEC) type III secretion system (T3SS) effector translocated intimin receptor (Tir) by intimin leads to actin polymerisation and pyroptotic cell death in macrophages. The effect of Tir clustering on the viability of EPEC-infected intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) is unknown. We show that EPEC induces pyroptosis in IECs in a Tir-dependent but actin polymerisation-independent manner, which was enhanced by priming with interferon gamma (IFNγ). Mechanistically, Tir clustering triggers rapid Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; influx, which induces lipopolysaccharide (LPS) internalisation, followed by activation of caspase-4 and pyroptosis. Knockdown of caspase-4 or gasdermin D (GSDMD), translocation of NleF, which blocks caspase-4 or chelation of extracellular Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, inhibited EPEC-induced cell death. IEC lines with low endogenous abundance of GSDMD were resistant to Tir-induced cell death. Conversely, ATP-induced extracellular Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; influx enhanced cell death, which confirmed the key regulatory role of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; in EPEC-induced pyroptosis. We reveal a novel mechanism through which infection with an extracellular pathogen leads to pyroptosis in IECs.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/ZvVuJydp7VI&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The purpose of this study was to investigate the significance of circulating micro RNAs (miRNAs) in the pathogenesis of reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome (RCVS).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We prospectively recruited 3 independent cohorts of patients with RCVS and age‐matched and sex‐matched controls in a single medical center. Next‐generation small RNA sequencing followed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to identify and validate differentially expressed miRNAs, which was cross‐validated in migraine patients in ictal stage or interictal stage. Computational analysis was used to predict the target genes of miRNAs, followed by in vitro functional analysis.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We identified a panel of miRNAs including miR‐130a‐3p, miR‐130b‐3p, let‐7a‐5p, let‐7b‐5p, and let‐7f‐5p that well differentiated patients with RCVS from controls (area under the receiver operating characteristics curve [AUC] was 0.906, 0.890, and 0.867 in the 3 cohorts, respectively). The abundance of let‐7a‐5p, let‐7b‐5p, and let‐7f‐5p, but not miR‐130a‐3p nor miR‐130b‐3p, was significantly higher in patients with ictal migraine compared with that of controls and patients with interictal migraine. Target prediction and pathway enrichment analysis suggested that the transforming growth factor‐β signaling pathway and endothelin‐1 responsible for vasomotor control might link these miRNAs to RCVS pathogenesis, which was confirmed in vitro by transfecting miRNAs mimics or incubating the patients’ cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in 3 different vascular endothelial cells. Moreover, miR‐130a‐3p was associated with imaging‐proven disruption of the blood‐brain barrier (BBB) in patients with RCVS and its overexpression led to reduced transendothelial electrical resistance (ie, increased permeability) in in vitro human BBB model.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We identified the circulating miRNA signatures associated with RCVS, which may be functionally linked to its headache, BBB integrity, and vasomotor function. ANN NEUROL 2020&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

&lt;p&gt;A multidisciplinary approach was applied to assign the expression of different visual opsin classes to specific photoreceptor subtypes in &lt;i&gt;Geotria australis&lt;/i&gt;. Five discrete photoreceptor subtypes were identified in the retina, each containing one of five classes of visual opsin. This suggests that &lt;i&gt;G&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;australis&lt;/i&gt; has the potential for complex color vision.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lampreys are extant members of the agnathan (jawless) vertebrates that diverged ~500 million years ago, during a critical stage of vertebrate evolution when image‐forming eyes first emerged. Among lamprey species assessed thus far, the retina of the southern hemisphere pouched lamprey, &lt;i&gt;Geotria australis&lt;/i&gt;, is unique, in that it possesses morphologically distinct photoreceptors and expresses five visual photopigments. This study focused on determining the number of different photoreceptors present in the retina of &lt;i&gt;G&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;australis&lt;/i&gt; and whether each cell type expresses a single opsin class. Five photoreceptor subtypes were identified based on ultrastructure and differential expression of one of each of the five different visual opsin classes (&lt;i&gt;lws&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;sws1&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;sws2&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;rh1&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;rh2&lt;/i&gt;) known to be expressed in the retina. This suggests, therefore, that the retina of &lt;i&gt;G&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;australis&lt;/i&gt; possesses five spectrally and morphologically distinct photoreceptors, with the potential for complex color vision. Each photoreceptor subtype was shown to have a specific spatial distribution in the retina, which is potentially associated with changes in spectral radiance across different lines of sight. These results suggest that there have been strong selection pressures for &lt;i&gt;G&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;australis&lt;/i&gt; to maintain broad spectral sensitivity for the brightly lit surface waters that this species inhabits during its marine phase. These findings provide important insights into the functional anatomy of the early vertebrate retina and the selection pressures that may have led to the evolution of complex color vision.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

&lt;p&gt;The Superficial Interneurons (SINs) of the zebrafish tectum comprise a diverse population. Here we demonstrate that despite their wide range of reported tuning properties and morphology, most SINs respond to light offset and possess large receptive fields. SINs were previously thought to be solely inhibitory, yet we report that a subset express glutamatergic markers. Finally, these cells are unlikely to be intrinsically photosensitive as removal of retinal input, eliminated nearly all light on and off responses in SINs.  (Image: Eva Laurell)

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The superficial interneurons, SINs, of the zebrafish tectum, have been implicated in a range of visual functions, including size discrimination, directional selectivity, and looming‐evoked escape. This raises the question if SIN subpopulations, despite their morphological similarities and shared anatomical position in the retinotectal processing stream, carry out diverse, task‐specific functions in visual processing, or if they have simple tuning properties in common. Here we have further characterized the SINs through functional imaging, electrophysiological recordings, and neurotransmitter typing in two transgenic lines, the widely used Gal4s1156t and the recently reported LCRRH2‐RH2‐2:GFP. We found that about a third of the SINs strongly responded to changes in whole‐field light levels, with a strong preference for OFF over ON stimuli. Interestingly, individual SINs were selectively tuned to a diverse range of narrow luminance decrements. Overall responses to whole‐field luminance steps did not vary with the position of the SIN cell body along the depth of the tectal neuropil or with the orientation of its neurites. We ruled out the possibility that intrinsic photosensitivity of Gal4s1156t+ SINs contribute to the measured visual responses. We found that, while most SINs express GABAergic markers, a substantial minority express an excitatory neuronal marker, the vesicular glutamate transporter, expanding the possible roles of SIN function in the tectal circuitry. In conclusion, SINs represent a molecularly, morphologically, and functionally heterogeneous class of interneurons, with subpopulations that detect a range of specific visual features, to which we have now added narrow luminance decrements.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Serum neurofilament light chain (sNfL) is a specific biomarker of neuronal injury.

After adjusting for neurological comorbidities and age, sNfL were higher in patients with COVID‐19 versus both comparator groups. Higher sNfL levels were associated with unfavorable short‐term outcome indicating that neuronal injury is common and pronounced in critically ill patients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cetacean visual system is a product of selection pressures favoring underwater vision, yet relatively little is known about it across taxa. Previous studies report several mutations in the opsin genetic sequence in cetaceans, suggesting the evolutionary complete or partial loss of retinal cone photoreceptor function in mysticete and odontocete lineages, respectively. Despite this, limited anatomical evidence suggests cone structures are partially maintained but with absent outer and inner segments in the bowhead retina. The functional consequence and anatomical distributions associated with these unique cone morphologies remain unclear. The current study further investigates the morphology and distribution of cone photoreceptors in the bowhead whale and beluga retina and evaluates the potential functional capacity of these cells’ alternative to photoreception. Refined histological and advanced microscopic techniques revealed two additional cone morphologies in the bowhead and beluga retina that have not been previously described. Two proteins involved in magnetosensation were present in these cone structures suggesting the possibility for an alternative functional role in responding to changes in geomagnetic fields. These findings highlight a revised understanding of the unique evolution of cone and gross retinal anatomy in cetaceans, and provide prefatory evidence of potential functional re‐assignment of these cells.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>eLife: Tissue-autonomous immune response regulates stress signalling during hypertrophy</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/64919</link>
	<content:encoded>Postmitotic tissues are incapable of replacing damaged cells through proliferation, but need to rely on buffering mechanisms to prevent tissue disintegration. By constitutively activating the Ras/MAPK-pathway via &lt;i&gt;Ras&lt;sup&gt;V12&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt;-overexpression in the postmitotic salivary glands of &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; larvae, we overrode the glands adaptability to growth signals and induced hypertrophy. The accompanied loss of tissue integrity, recognition by cellular immunity and cell death are all buffered by blocking stress signalling through a genuine tissue-autonomous immune response. This novel, spatio-temporally tightly regulated mechanism relies on the inhibition of a feedback-loop in the JNK-pathway by the immune effector and antimicrobial peptide Drosomycin. While this interaction might allow growing salivary glands to cope with temporary stress, continuous Drosomycin expression in &lt;i&gt;Ras&lt;sup&gt;V12&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt;-glands favors unrestricted hypertrophy. These findings indicate the necessity to refine therapeutic approaches that stimulate immune responses by acknowledging their possible, detrimental effects in damaged or stressed tissues.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/61866</link>
	<content:encoded>Loss of ESCRT function in &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; imaginal discs is known to cause neoplastic overgrowth fuelled by mis-regulation of signalling pathways. Its impact on junctional integrity, however, remains obscure. To dissect the events leading to neoplasia, we used transmission electron microscopy (TEM) on wing imaginal discs temporally depleted of the ESCRT-III core component Shrub. We find a specific requirement for Shrub in maintaining Septate Junction (SJ) integrity by transporting the Claudin Megatrachea (Mega) to the SJ. In absence of Shrub function, Mega is lost from the SJ and becomes trapped on endosomes coated with the endosomal retrieval machinery Retromer. We show that ESCRT function is required for apical localization and mobility of Retromer positive carrier vesicles, which mediate the biosynthetic delivery of Mega to the SJ. Accordingly, loss of Retromer function impairs the anterograde transport of several SJ core components, revealing a novel physiological role for this ancient endosomal agent.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: chTOG is a conserved mitotic error correction factor</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/61773</link>
	<content:encoded>Accurate chromosome segregation requires kinetochores on duplicated chromatids to biorient by attaching to dynamic microtubules from opposite spindle poles, which exerts forces to bring kinetochores under tension. However, kinetochores initially bind to microtubules indiscriminately, resulting in errors that must be corrected. While the Aurora B protein kinase destabilizes low-tension attachments by phosphorylating kinetochores, low-tension attachments are intrinsically less stable than those under higher tension in vitro independent of Aurora activity. Intrinsic tension-sensitive behavior requires the microtubule regulator Stu2 (budding yeast Dis1/XMAP215 ortholog), which we demonstrate here is likely a conserved function for the TOG protein family. The human TOG protein, chTOG, localizes to kinetochores independent of microtubules by interacting with Hec1. We identify a chTOG mutant that regulates microtubule dynamics but accumulates erroneous kinetochore-microtubule attachments that are not destabilized by Aurora B. Thus, TOG proteins confer a unique, intrinsic error correction activity to kinetochores that ensures accurate chromosome segregation.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/61510</link>
	<content:encoded>The insect Central Complex (CX) is thought to underlie goal-oriented navigation but its functional organization is not fully understood. We recorded from genetically-identified CX cell types in &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; and presented directional visual, olfactory, and airflow cues known to elicit orienting behavior. We found that a group of neurons targeting the ventral fan-shaped body (ventral P-FNs) are robustly tuned for airflow direction. Ventral P-FNs did not generate a 'map' of airflow direction. Instead, cells in each hemisphere were tuned to 45° ipsilateral, forming a pair of orthogonal bases. Imaging experiments suggest that ventral P-FNs inherit their airflow tuning from neurons that provide input from the lateral accessory lobe (LAL) to the noduli (NO). Silencing ventral P-FNs prevented flies from selecting appropriate corrective turns following changes in airflow direction. Our results identify a group of central complex neurons that robustly encode airflow direction and are required for proper orientation to this stimulus.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/60432</link>
	<content:encoded>Each hair cell (HC) precursor of zebrafish neuromasts divides to form two daughter HCs of opposite hair bundle orientations. Previously, we showed that transcription factor Emx2, expressed in only one of the daughter HCs, generates this bidirectional HC pattern (Jiang et al., 2017). Here, we asked whether Emx2 mediates this effect by changing location of hair bundle establishment or positions of HCs since daughter HCs are known to switch positions with each other. We showed this HC rearrangement, redefined as two processes named Rock &amp;amp; Roll, is required for positional acquisition of HCs. Apical protrusion formation of nascent HCs and planar polarity signaling are both important for the Rock &amp;amp; Roll. Emx2 facilitates Rock &amp;amp; Roll by delaying apical protrusion of its nascent HCs but it does not determine HCs' ultimate positions, indicating that Emx2 mediates bidirectional HC pattern by changing the location where hair bundle is established in HCs.</content:encoded>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Short‐Term Cessation of Dabigatran Causes a Paradoxical Prothrombotic State</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25964?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is unclear if stopping treatment with dabigatran, a new oral anticoagulant (NOAC), induces a paradoxical rebound prothrombotic state. We investigated if short‐term (1–3 days) dabigatran cessation is associated with a higher thrombus volume than expected from a simple reversal of the anticoagulant effect.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ten‐week‐old C57Bl/6 mice (n = 338) received one of the following oral treatments: phosphate‐buffered saline (PBS), dabigatran for 7 days with or without 1 to 4 day cessation, and aspirin in either a single dose or daily for 7 days. Some of the animals that ceased dabigatran for 1 to 3 days received single‐dose aspirin. Thereafter, we induced FeCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;‐mediated carotid thrombosis in 130 mice, after which we performed micro computed tomography thrombus imaging. The other 208 mice underwent coagulation assays or platelet function tests. As an explorative pilot study, we reviewed the medical records of 18 consecutive patients with NOAC cessation‐related cerebral infarction in a large acute stroke cohort.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We observed a ~ 40% higher volume of carotid thrombus after dabigatran cessation at 1 to 3 days than after vehicle treatment and showed that this effect could be prevented by single‐dose aspirin pretreatment. Dabigatran cessation unduly increased platelet aggregability for 2 days after drug cessation, an effect mediated through thrombin or arachidonic acid, which effect was significantly attenuated by single‐dose aspirin pretreatment. In patients, short‐term (≤ 3 days) cessation of NOAC therapy, compared with longer‐term (≥ 5 days) cessation, tended to be associated with relatively high stroke severity.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We provide the first preclinical evidence that a rebound prothrombotic state follows short‐term cessation of dabigatran therapy. ANN NEUROL 2020&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/64588</link>
	<content:encoded>Changes in available nutrients are inevitable events for most living organisms. Upon nutritional stress, several signaling pathways cooperate to change the transcription program through chromatin regulation to rewire cellular metabolism. In budding yeast, histone H3 threonine 11 phosphorylation (H3pT11) acts as a marker of low glucose stress and regulates the transcription of nutritional stress responsive genes. Understanding how this histone modification 'senses' external glucose changes remains elusive. Here, we show that Tda1, the yeast orthologue of human Nuak1, is a direct kinase for H3pT11 upon low glucose stress. Yeast AMPK directly phosphorylates Tda1 to govern Tda1 activity, while CK2 regulates Tda1 nuclear localization. Collectively, AMPK and CK2 signaling converge on histone kinase Tda1 to link external low glucose stress to chromatin regulation.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>While memories are often thought of as flashbacks to a previous experience, they do not simply conserve veridical representations of the past but must continually integrate new information to ensure survival in dynamic environments. Therefore, ‘drift’ in neural firing patterns, typically construed as disruptive ‘instability’ or an undesirable consequence of noise, may actually be useful for updating memories. In our view, continual modifications in memory representations reconcile classical theories of stable memory traces with neural drift. Here we review how memory representations are updated through dynamic recruitment of neuronal ensembles on the basis of excitability and functional connectivity at the time of learning. Overall, we emphasize the importance of considering memories not as static entities, but instead as flexible network states that reactivate and evolve across time and experience.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/63493</link>
	<content:encoded>Animals vocalize only in certain behavioral contexts, but the circuits and synapses through which forebrain neurons trigger or suppress vocalization remain unknown. Here we used transsynaptic tracing to identify two populations of inhibitory neurons that lie upstream of neurons in the periaqueductal gray that gate the production of ultrasonic vocalizations in mice (i.e., PAG-USV neurons). Activating PAG-projecting neurons in the preoptic hypothalamus (POA&lt;sub&gt;PAG &lt;/sub&gt;neurons) elicited USV production in the absence of social cues. In contrast, activating PAG-projecting neurons in the central-medial boundary zone of the amygdala (Amg&lt;sub&gt;C/M-PAG &lt;/sub&gt;neurons) transiently suppressed USV production without disrupting non-vocal social behavior. Optogenetics-assisted circuit mapping in brain slices revealed that POA&lt;sub&gt;PAG&lt;/sub&gt; neurons directly inhibit PAG interneurons, which in turn inhibit PAG-USV neurons, whereas Amg&lt;sub&gt;C/M-PAG&lt;/sub&gt; neurons directly inhibit PAG-USV neurons. These experiments identify two major forebrain inputs to the PAG that trigger and suppress vocalization, respectively, while also establishing the synaptic mechanisms through which these neurons exert opposing behavioral effects.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/62963</link>
	<content:encoded>We demonstrate how RNA binding protein FOX-1 functions as a dose-dependent X-signal element to communicate X-chromosome number and thereby determine nematode sex. FOX-1, an RNA recognition motif protein, triggers hermaphrodite development in XX embryos by causing non-productive alternative pre-mRNA splicing of &lt;i&gt;xol-1&lt;/i&gt;, the master sex-determination switch gene that triggers male development in XO embryos. RNA binding experiments together with genome editing demonstrate that FOX-1 binds to multiple GCAUG and GCACG motifs in a &lt;i&gt;xol-1&lt;/i&gt; intron, causing intron retention or partial exon deletion, thereby eliminating male-determining XOL-1 protein. Transforming all motifs to GCAUG or GCACG permits accurate alternative splicing, demonstrating efficacy of both motifs. Mutating subsets of both motifs partially alleviates non-productive splicing. Mutating all motifs blocks it, as does transforming them to low-affinity GCUUG motifs. Combining multiple high-affinity binding sites with the two-fold change in FOX-1 concentration between XX and XO embryos achieves dose-sensitivity in splicing regulation to determine sex.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>A common misconception is that evolution is a linear 'march of progress', where each organism along a line of descent is more fit than all those that came before it. Rejecting this misconception implies that evolution is nontransitive: a series of adaptive events will, on occasion, produce organisms that are less fit compared to a distant ancestor. Here we identify a nontransitive evolutionary sequence in a 1,000-generation yeast evolution experiment. We show that nontransitivity arises due to adaptation in the yeast nuclear genome combined with the stepwise deterioration of an intracellular virus, which provides an advantage over viral competitors within host cells. Extending our analysis, we find that nearly half of our ~140 populations experience multilevel selection, fixing adaptive mutations in both the nuclear and viral genomes. Our results provide a mechanistic case-study for the adaptive evolution of nontransitivity due to multilevel selection in a 1,000-generation host/virus evolution experiment.</content:encoded>

We present Metage2Metabo (M2M) a resource that meets the need for de-novo functional screening of genome-scale metabolic networks (GSMNs) at the scale of a metagenome, and the identification of critical species with respect to metabolic cooperation. M2M comprises a flexible pipeline for the characterisation of individual metabolisms and collective metabolic complementarity. In addition, M2M identifies key species, that are meaningful members of the community for functions of interest. We demonstrate that M2M is applicable to collections of genomes as well as metagenome-assembled genomes, permits an efficient GSMN reconstruction with Pathway Tools, and assesses the cooperation potential between species. M2M identifies key organisms by reducing the complexity of a large-scale microbiota into minimal communities with equivalent properties, suitable for further analyses.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/60376</link>
	<content:encoded>Studies in different animal model systems have revealed the impact of odors on immune cells, however, any understanding on why and how odors control cellular immunity remained unclear. We find that &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; employ an olfactory-immune cross-talk to tune a specific cell type, the lamellocytes, from hematopoietic-progenitor cells. We show that neuronally released GABA derived upon olfactory stimulation, is utilized by blood-progenitor cells as a metabolite and through its catabolism, these cells stabilize Sima/HIFα protein. Sima capacitates blood-progenitor cells with the ability to initiate lamellocyte differentiation. This systemic axis becomes relevant for larvae dwelling in wasp-infested environments where chances of infection are high. By co-opting the olfactory route, the pre-conditioned animals elevate their systemic GABA levels leading to the up-regulation of blood-progenitor cell Sima expression. This elevates their immune-potential and primes them to respond rapidly when infected with parasitic wasps. The present work highlights the importance of the olfaction in immunity and shows how odor detection during animal development is utilized to establish a long-range axis in the control of blood-progenitor competency and immune-priming.</content:encoded>

Reasoning about the factors underlying habitat connectivity and the inter-habitat movement of species is essential to many areas of biological inquiry. In order to better describe and understand the ways in which the landscape may support species movement, an increasing amount of research has focused on identification of paths or corridors that may be important in providing connectivity among habitat. The least-cost path problem has proven to be an instrumental analytical tool in this sense. A complicating aspect of such path identification methods is how to best reconcile and integrate the array of criteria or objectives that species may consider in traversal of a landscape. In cases where habitat connectivity is thought to be influenced or guided by multiple objectives, numerous solutions to least-cost path problems can exist, representing tradeoffs between the objectives. In practice though, identification of these solutions can be very challenging and as such, only a small proportion of them are typically examined leading to a weak characterization of habitat connectivity. To address this computational challenge, a multiobjective optimization framework is proposed. A generalizable multiobjective least-cost path model is first detailed. A non-inferior set estimation (MONISE) algorithm for identifying supported efficient solutions to the multiobjective least-cost path model is then described. However, it is well known that unsupported efficient solutions (which are equally important) can also exist, but are typically ignored given that they are more difficult to identify. Thus, to enable the identification of the full set of efficient solutions (supported and unsupported) to the multiobjective model, a multi-criteria labeling algorithm is then proposed. The developed framework is applied to assess different conceptualizations of habitat connectivity supporting amphibian movement in a wetland system. The results highlight the range of tradeoffs in characterizations of connectivity that can exist when multiple objectives are thought to contribute to movement decisions and that the number of unsupported efficient solutions (which are typically ignored) can vastly outweigh that of the supported efficient solutions.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/ei-KBrK73DI&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Combinatorial therapies are required to treat patients with advanced cancers that have become resistant to monotherapies through rewiring of redundant pathways. Due to a massive number of potential drug combinations, there is a need for systematic approaches to identify safe and effective combinations for each patient, using cost-effective methods. Here, we developed an exact multiobjective optimization method for identifying pairwise or higher-order combinations that show maximal cancer-selectivity. The prioritization of patient-specific combinations is based on Pareto-optimization in the search space spanned by the therapeutic and nonselective effects of combinations. We demonstrate the performance of the method in the context of BRAF-V600E melanoma treatment, where the optimal solutions predicted a number of co-inhibition partners for vemurafenib, a selective BRAF-V600E inhibitor, approved for advanced melanoma. We experimentally validated many of the predictions in BRAF-V600E melanoma cell line, and the results suggest that one can improve selective inhibition of BRAF-V600E melanoma cells by combinatorial targeting of MAPK/ERK and other compensatory pathways using pairwise and third-order drug combinations. Our mechanism-agnostic optimization method is widely applicable to various cancer types, and it takes as input only measurements of a subset of pairwise drug combinations, without requiring target information or genomic profiles. Such data-driven approaches may become useful for functional precision oncology applications that go beyond the cancer genetic dependency paradigm to optimize cancer-selective combinatorial treatments.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/tQFi8d3CAl4&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Characterizing the relation between weight structure and input/output statistics is fundamental for understanding the computational capabilities of neural circuits. In this work, I study the problem of storing associations between analog signals in the presence of correlations, using methods from statistical mechanics. I characterize the typical learning performance in terms of the power spectrum of random input and output processes. I show that optimal synaptic weight configurations reach a capacity of 0.5 for any fraction of excitatory to inhibitory weights and have a peculiar synaptic distribution with a finite fraction of silent synapses. I further provide a link between typical learning performance and principal components analysis in single cases. These results may shed light on the synaptic profile of brain circuits, such as cerebellar structures, that are thought to engage in processing time-dependent signals and performing on-line prediction.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/k5UZKwtwElo&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Information transfer, measured by transfer entropy, is a key component of distributed computation. It is therefore important to understand the pattern of information transfer in order to unravel the distributed computational algorithms of a system. Since in many natural systems distributed computation is thought to rely on rhythmic processes a frequency resolved measure of information transfer is highly desirable. Here, we present a novel algorithm, and its efficient implementation, to identify separately frequencies sending and receiving information in a network. Our approach relies on the invertible maximum overlap discrete wavelet transform (MODWT) for the creation of surrogate data in the computation of transfer entropy and entirely avoids filtering of the original signals. The approach thereby avoids well-known problems due to phase shifts or the ineffectiveness of filtering in the information theoretic setting. We also show that measuring frequency-resolved information transfer is a partial information decomposition problem that cannot be fully resolved to date and discuss the implications of this issue. Last, we evaluate the performance of our algorithm on simulated data and apply it to human magnetoencephalography (MEG) recordings and to local field potential recordings in the ferret. In human MEG we demonstrate top-down information flow in temporal cortex from very high frequencies (above 100Hz) to both similarly high frequencies and to frequencies around 20Hz, i.e. a complex spectral configuration of cortical information transmission that has not been described before. In the ferret we show that the prefrontal cortex sends information at low frequencies (4-8 Hz) to early visual cortex (V1), while V1 receives the information at high frequencies (&amp;gt; 125 Hz).&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/yvPcW6Al6VQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Systems biology predicts that fibrosis in tuberculous granulomas may arise through macrophage-to-myofibroblast transformation</title>

&lt;i&gt;Mycobacterium tuberculosis&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;Mtb&lt;/i&gt;) infection causes tuberculosis (TB), a disease characterized by development of granulomas. Granulomas consist of activated immune cells that cluster together to limit bacterial growth and restrict dissemination. Control of the TB epidemic has been limited by lengthy drug regimens, antibiotic resistance, and lack of a robustly efficacious vaccine. Fibrosis commonly occurs during treatment and is associated with both positive and negative disease outcomes in TB but little is known about the processes that initiate fibrosis in granulomas. Human and nonhuman primate granulomas undergoing fibrosis can have spindle-shaped macrophages with fibroblast-like morphologies suggesting a relationship between macrophages, fibroblasts, and granuloma fibrosis. This relationship has been difficult to investigate because of the limited availability of human pathology samples, the time scale involved in human TB, and overlap between fibroblast and myeloid cell markers in tissues. To better understand the origins of fibrosis in TB, we used a computational model of TB granuloma biology to identify factors that drive fibrosis over the course of local disease progression. We validated the model with granulomas from nonhuman primates to delineate myeloid cells and lung-resident fibroblasts. Our results suggest that peripheral granuloma fibrosis, which is commonly observed, can arise through macrophage-to-myofibroblast transformation (MMT). Further, we hypothesize that MMT is induced in M1 macrophages through a sequential combination of inflammatory and anti-inflammatory signaling in granuloma macrophages. We predict that MMT may be a mechanism underlying granuloma-associated fibrosis and warrants further investigation into myeloid cells as drivers of fibrotic disease.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/i4DJnTeQ8vU&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Musculoskeletal simulations are used in many different applications, ranging from the design of wearable robots that interact with humans to the analysis of patients with impaired movement. Here, we introduce OpenSim Moco, a software toolkit for optimizing the motion and control of musculoskeletal models built in the OpenSim modeling and simulation package. OpenSim Moco uses the direct collocation method, which is often faster and can handle more diverse problems than other methods for musculoskeletal simulation. Moco frees researchers from implementing direct collocation themselves—which typically requires extensive technical expertise—and allows them to focus on their scientific questions. The software can handle a wide range of problems that interest biomechanists, including motion tracking, motion prediction, parameter optimization, model fitting, electromyography-driven simulation, and device design. Moco is the first musculoskeletal direct collocation tool to handle kinematic constraints, which enable modeling of kinematic loops (e.g., cycling models) and complex anatomy (e.g., patellar motion). To show the abilities of Moco, we first solved for muscle activity that produced an observed walking motion while minimizing squared muscle excitations and knee joint loading. Next, we predicted how muscle weakness may cause deviations from a normal walking motion. Lastly, we predicted a squat-to-stand motion and optimized the stiffness of an assistive device placed at the knee. We designed Moco to be easy to use, customizable, and extensible, thereby accelerating the use of simulations to understand the movement of humans and other animals.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/MfhXqWduoys&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Abhishek Mallela, Maulik K. Nariya, Eric J. Deeds&lt;/p&gt;

Protein turnover is vital to cellular homeostasis. Many proteins are degraded efficiently only after they have been post-translationally “tagged” with a polyubiquitin chain. Ubiquitylation is a form of Post-Translational Modification (PTM): addition of a ubiquitin to the chain is catalyzed by E3 ligases, and removal of ubiquitin is catalyzed by a De-UBiquitylating enzyme (DUB). Nearly four decades ago, Goldbeter and Koshland discovered that reversible PTM cycles function like on-off switches when the substrates are at saturating concentrations. Although this finding has had profound implications for the understanding of switch-like behavior in biochemical networks, the general behavior of PTM cycles subject to synthesis and degradation has not been studied. Using a mathematical modeling approach, we found that simply introducing protein turnover to a standard modification cycle has profound effects, including significantly reducing the switch-like nature of the response. Our findings suggest that many classic results on PTM cycles may not hold &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; where protein turnover is ubiquitous. We also found that proteins sharing an E3 ligase can have closely related changes in their expression levels. These results imply that it may be difficult to interpret experimental results obtained from either overexpressing or knocking down protein levels, since changes in protein expression can be coupled via E3 ligase crosstalk. Understanding crosstalk and competition for E3 ligases will be key in ultimately developing a global picture of protein homeostasis.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/RCq5WNuC9-M&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

NF-Y is a trimeric Transcription Factor -TF- which binds with high selectivity to the conserved CCAAT element. Individual ChIP-seq analysis as well as ENCODE have progressively identified locations shared by other TFs. Here, we have analyzed data introduced by ENCODE over the last five years in K562, HeLa-S3 and GM12878, including several chromatin features, as well RNA-seq profiling of HeLa-S3 cells after NF-Y inactivation. We double the number of sequence-specific TFs and co-factors reported. We catalogue them in 4 classes based on co-association criteria, infer target genes categorizations, identify positional bias of binding sites and gene expression changes. Larger and novel co-associations emerge, specifically concerning subunits of repressive complexes as well as RNA-binding proteins. On the one hand, these data better define NF-Y association with single members of major classes of TFs, on the other, they suggest that it might have a wider role in the control of mRNA production.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/N0A940Gb8G4&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

In January 2020, a COVID-19 outbreak was detected in Sichuan Province of China. Six weeks later, the outbreak was successfully contained. The aim of this work is to characterize the epidemiology of the Sichuan outbreak and estimate the impact of interventions in limiting SARS-CoV-2 transmission. We analyzed patient records for all laboratory-confirmed cases reported in the province for the period of January 21 to March 16, 2020. To estimate the basic and daily reproduction numbers, we used a Bayesian framework. In addition, we estimate the number of cases averted by the implemented control strategies. The outbreak resulted in 539 confirmed cases, lasted less than two months, and no further local transmission was detected after February 27. The median age of local cases was 8 years older than that of imported cases. We estimated R&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; at 2.4 (95% CI: 1.6–3.7). The epidemic was self-sustained for about 3 weeks before going below the epidemic threshold 3 days after the declaration of a public health emergency by Sichuan authorities. Our findings indicate that, were the control measures be adopted four weeks later, the epidemic could have lasted 49 days longer (95% CI: 31–68 days), causing 9,216 more cases (95% CI: 1,317–25,545).&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/gLmm_TU9SSs&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Which suggestions for behavioral modifications, based on mathematical models, are most likely to be followed in the real world? We address this question in the context of human circadian rhythms. Jet lag is a consequence of the misalignment of the body’s internal circadian (~24-hour) clock during an adjustment to a new schedule. Light is the clock’s primary synchronizer. Previous research has used mathematical models to compute light schedules that shift the circadian clock to a new time zone as quickly as possible. How users adjust their behavior when provided with these optimal schedules remains an open question. Here, we report data collected by wearables from more than 100 travelers as they cross time zones using a smartphone app, &lt;i&gt;Entrain&lt;/i&gt;. We find that people rarely follow the optimal schedules generated through mathematical modeling entirely, but travelers who better followed the optimal schedules reported more positive moods after their trips. Using the data collected, we improve the optimal schedule predictions to accommodate real-world constraints. We also develop a scheduling algorithm that allows for the computation of approximately optimal schedules &quot;on-the-fly&quot; in response to disruptions. User burnout may not be critically important as long as the first parts of a schedule are followed. These results represent a crucial improvement in making the theoretical results of past work viable for practical use and show how theoretical predictions based on known human physiology can be efficiently used in real-world settings.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/ZT_k6uA95ic&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

&lt;i&gt;In vivo&lt;/i&gt; imaging of cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) killing activity revealed that infected cells have a higher observed probability of dying after multiple contacts with CTLs. We developed a three-dimensional agent-based model to discriminate different hypotheses about how infected cells get killed based on quantitative 2-photon &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; observations. We compared a constant CTL killing probability with mechanisms of signal integration in CTL or infected cells. The most likely scenario implied increased susceptibility of infected cells with increasing number of CTL contacts where the total number of contacts was a critical factor. However, when allowing &lt;i&gt;in silico&lt;/i&gt; T cells to initiate new interactions with apoptotic target cells (zombie contacts), a contact history independent killing mechanism was also in agreement with experimental datasets. The comparison of observed datasets to simulation results, revealed limitations in interpreting 2-photon data, and provided readouts to distinguish CTL killing models.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/9anFAnynf2o&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

&lt;i&gt;Bacillus anthracis&lt;/i&gt;, a spore-forming gram-positive bacterium, causes anthrax. The external surface of the exosporium is coated with glycosylated proteins. The sugar additions are capped with the unique monosaccharide anthrose. The West African Group (WAG) &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;anthracis&lt;/i&gt; have mutations rendering them anthrose deficient. Through genome sequencing, we identified 2 different large chromosomal deletions within the anthrose biosynthetic operon of &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;anthracis&lt;/i&gt; strains from Chile and Poland. In silico analysis identified an anthrose-deficient strain in the anthrax outbreak among European heroin users. Anthrose-deficient strains are no longer restricted to West Africa so the role of anthrose in physiology and pathogenesis was investigated in &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;anthracis&lt;/i&gt; Sterne. Loss of anthrose delayed spore germination and enhanced sporulation. Spores without anthrose were phagocytized at higher rates than spores with anthrose, indicating that anthrose may serve an antiphagocytic function on the spore surface. The anthrose mutant had half the LD&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; and decreased time to death (TTD) of wild type and complement &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;anthracis&lt;/i&gt; Sterne in the A/J mouse model. Following infection, anthrose mutant bacteria were more abundant in the spleen, indicating enhanced dissemination of Sterne anthrose mutant. At low sample sizes in the A/J mouse model, the mortality of Δ&lt;i&gt;antC&lt;/i&gt;-infected mice challenged by intranasal or subcutaneous routes was 20% greater than wild type. Competitive index (CI) studies indicated that spores without anthrose disseminated to organs more extensively than a complemented mutant. Death process modeling using mouse mortality dynamics suggested that larger sample sizes would lead to significantly higher deaths in anthrose-negative infected animals. The model was tested by infecting &lt;i&gt;Galleria mellonella&lt;/i&gt; with spores and confirmed the anthrose mutant was significantly more lethal. Vaccination studies in the A/J mouse model showed that the human vaccine protected against high-dose challenges of the nonencapsulated Sterne-based anthrose mutant. This work begins to identify the physiologic and pathogenic consequences of convergent anthrose mutations in &lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;anthracis&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/xLHjWAFmZzo&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Albert Zhang, Ziqiang Guan, Kyle Ockerman, Pengyuan Dong, Jiansheng Guo, Zhiping Wang, Dong Yan&lt;/p&gt;

Coordination of cell growth is essential for the development of the brain, but the molecular mechanisms underlying the regulation of glial and neuronal size are poorly understood. To investigate the mechanisms involved in glial size regulation, we used &lt;i&gt;Caenorhabditis elegans&lt;/i&gt; amphid sheath (AMsh) glia as a model and show that a conserved &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt;-Golgi membrane protein &lt;i&gt;eas-1/GOLT1B&lt;/i&gt; negatively regulates glial growth. We found that &lt;i&gt;eas-1&lt;/i&gt; inhibits a conserved E3 ubiquitin ligase &lt;i&gt;rnf-145&lt;/i&gt;/RNF145, which, in turn, promotes nuclear activation of &lt;i&gt;sbp-1/&lt;/i&gt; SREBP, a key regulator of sterol and fatty acid synthesis, to restrict cell growth. At early developmental stages, &lt;i&gt;rnf-145&lt;/i&gt; in the &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt;-Golgi network inhibits &lt;i&gt;sbp-1&lt;/i&gt; activation to promote the growth of glia, and when animals reach the adult stage, this inhibition is released through an &lt;i&gt;eas-1-&lt;/i&gt;dependent shuttling of &lt;i&gt;rnf-145&lt;/i&gt; from the &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt;-Golgi to the &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;-Golgi network to stop glial growth. Furthermore, we identified long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC-PUFAs), especially eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), as downstream products of the &lt;i&gt;eas-1-rnf-145-sbp-1&lt;/i&gt; pathway that functions to prevent the overgrowth of glia. Together, our findings reveal a novel and potentially conserved mechanism underlying glial size control.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/lnZqLcygP-Q&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Host–pathogen conflicts leave genetic signatures in genes that are critical for host defense functions. Using these “molecular scars” as a guide to discover gene functions, we discovered a vertebrate-specific MItochondrial STress Response (MISTR) circuit. MISTR proteins are associated with electron transport chain (ETC) factors and activated by stress signals such as interferon gamma (IFNγ) and hypoxia. Upon stress, ultraconserved microRNAs (miRNAs) down-regulate MISTR1(NDUFA4) followed by replacement with paralogs MItochondrial STress Response AntiViral (MISTRAV) and/or MItochondrial STress Response Hypoxia (MISTRH). While cells lacking MISTR1(NDUFA4) are more sensitive to chemical and viral apoptotic triggers, cells lacking MISTRAV or expressing the squirrelpox virus-encoded vMISTRAV exhibit resistance to the same insults. Rapid evolution signatures across primate genomes for &lt;i&gt;MISTR1(NDUFA4)&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;MISTRAV&lt;/i&gt; indicate recent and ongoing conflicts with pathogens. MISTR homologs are also found in plants, yeasts, a fish virus, and an algal virus indicating ancient origins and suggesting diverse means of altering mitochondrial function under stress. The discovery of MISTR circuitry highlights the use of evolution-guided studies to reveal fundamental biological processes.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/Lko71xOFkvE&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Biology: CEP290 is essential for the initiation of ciliary transition zone assembly</title>

Cilia play critical roles during embryonic development and adult homeostasis. Dysfunction of cilia leads to various human genetic diseases, including many caused by defects in transition zones (TZs), the “gates” of cilia. The evolutionarily conserved TZ component centrosomal protein 290 (CEP290) is the most frequently mutated human ciliopathy gene, but its roles in ciliogenesis are not completely understood. Here, we report that CEP290 plays an essential role in the initiation of TZ assembly in &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt;. Mechanistically, the N-terminus of CEP290 directly recruits DAZ interacting zinc finger protein 1 (DZIP1), which then recruits Chibby (CBY) and Rab8 to promote early ciliary membrane formation. Complete deletion of CEP290 blocks ciliogenesis at the initiation stage of TZ assembly, which can be mimicked by DZIP1 deletion mutants. Remarkably, expression of the N-terminus of CEP290 alone restores the TZ localization of DZIP1 and subsequently ameliorates the defects in TZ assembly initiation in &lt;i&gt;cep290&lt;/i&gt; mutants. Our results link CEP290 to DZIP1-CBY/Rab8 module and uncover a previously uncharacterized important function of CEP290 in the coordination of early ciliary membrane formation and TZ assembly.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/aG3YmgUwtug&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Biology: Structural analyses of the PKA RIIβ holoenzyme containing the oncogenic DnaJB1-PKAc fusion protein reveal protomer asymmetry and fusion-induced allosteric perturbations in fibrolamellar hepatocellular carcinoma</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~3/SxEStF5xD4g/article</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Tsan-Wen Lu, Phillip C. Aoto, Jui-Hung Weng, Cole Nielsen, Jennifer N. Cash, James Hall, Ping Zhang, Sanford M. Simon, Michael A. Cianfrocco, Susan S. Taylor&lt;/p&gt;

When the J-domain of the heat shock protein DnaJB1 is fused to the catalytic (C) subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA), replacing exon 1, this fusion protein, J-C subunit (J-C), becomes the driver of fibrolamellar hepatocellular carcinoma (FL-HCC). Here, we use cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) to characterize J-C bound to RIIβ, the major PKA regulatory (R) subunit in liver, thus reporting the first cryo-EM structure of any PKA holoenzyme. We report several differences in both structure and dynamics that could not be captured by the conventional crystallography approaches used to obtain prior structures. Most striking is the asymmetry caused by the absence of the second cyclic nucleotide binding (CNB) domain and the J-domain in one of the RIIβ:J-C protomers. Using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, we discovered that this asymmetry is already present in the wild-type (WT) RIIβ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; but had been masked in the previous crystal structure. This asymmetry may link to the intrinsic allosteric regulation of all PKA holoenzymes and could also explain why most disease mutations in PKA regulatory subunits are dominant negative. The cryo-EM structure, combined with small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), also allowed us to predict the general position of the Dimerization/Docking (D/D) domain, which is essential for localization and interacting with membrane-anchored A-Kinase-Anchoring Proteins (AKAPs). This position provides a multivalent mechanism for interaction of the RIIβ holoenzyme with membranes and would be perturbed in the oncogenic fusion protein. The J-domain also alters several biochemical properties of the RIIβ holoenzyme: It is easier to activate with cAMP, and the cooperativity is reduced. These results provide new insights into how the finely tuned allosteric PKA signaling network is disrupted by the oncogenic J-C subunit, ultimately leading to the development of FL-HCC.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/SxEStF5xD4g&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Biology: Long-term experimental evolution of HIV-1 reveals effects of environment and mutational history</title>

An often-returning question for not only HIV-1, but also other organisms, is how predictable evolutionary paths are. The environment, mutational history, and random processes can all impact the exact evolutionary paths, but to which extent these factors contribute to the evolutionary dynamics of a particular system is an open question. Especially in a virus like HIV-1, with a large mutation rate and large population sizes, evolution is expected to be highly predictable if the impact of environment and history is low, and evolution is not neutral. We investigated the effect of environment and mutational history by analyzing sequences from a long-term evolution experiment, in which HIV-1 was passaged on 2 different cell types in 8 independent evolutionary lines and 8 derived lines, 4 of which involved a switch of the environment. The experiments lasted for 240–300 passages, corresponding to approximately 400–600 generations or almost 3 years. The sequences show signs of extensive parallel evolution—the majority of mutations that are shared between independent lines appear in both cell types, but we also find that both environment and mutational history significantly impact the evolutionary paths. We conclude that HIV-1 evolution is robust to small changes in the environment, similar to a transmission event in the absence of an immune response or drug pressure. We also find that the fitness landscape of HIV-1 is largely smooth, although we find some evidence for both positive and negative epistatic interactions between mutations.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/4erFhbSb4yI&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Biology: Increased prostaglandin-D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in male STAT3-deficient hearts shifts cardiac progenitor cells from endothelial to white adipocyte differentiation</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~3/bZIPnUYRK2w/article</link>

Cardiac levels of the signal transducer and activator of transcription factor-3 (STAT3) decline with age, and male but not female mice with a cardiomyocyte-specific STAT3 deficiency conditional knockout (CKO) display premature age-related heart failure associated with reduced cardiac capillary density. In the present study, isolated male and female CKO-cardiomyocytes exhibit increased prostaglandin (PG)-generating cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression. The PG-degrading hydroxyprostaglandin-dehydrogenase-15 (HPGD) expression is only reduced in male cardiomyocytes, which is associated with increased prostaglandin D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (PGD&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) secretion from isolated male but not female CKO-cardiomyocytes. Reduced HPGD expression in male cardiomyocytes derive from impaired androgen receptor (AR)–signaling due to loss of its cofactor STAT3. Elevated PGD&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; secretion in males is associated with increased white adipocyte accumulation in aged male but not female hearts. Adipocyte differentiation is enhanced in isolated stem cell antigen-1 (SCA-1)&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cardiac progenitor cells (CPC) from young male CKO-mice compared with the adipocyte differentiation of male wild-type (WT)-CPC and CPC isolated from female mice. Epigenetic analysis in freshly isolated male CKO-CPC display hypermethylation in pro-angiogenic genes (&lt;i&gt;Fgfr2&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Epas1&lt;/i&gt;) and hypomethylation in the white adipocyte differentiation gene &lt;i&gt;Zfp423&lt;/i&gt; associated with up-regulated ZFP423 expression and a shift from endothelial to white adipocyte differentiation compared with WT-CPC. The expression of the histone-methyltransferase EZH2 is reduced in male CKO-CPC compared with male WT-CPC, whereas no differences in the EZH2 expression in female CPC were observed. Clonally expanded CPC can differentiate into endothelial cells or into adipocytes depending on the differentiation conditions. ZFP423 overexpression is sufficient to induce white adipocyte differentiation of clonal CPC. In isolated WT-CPC, PGD&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; stimulation reduces the expression of EZH2, thereby up-regulating ZFP423 expression and promoting white adipocyte differentiation. The treatment of young male CKO mice with the COX inhibitor Ibuprofen or the PGD&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; receptor (DP)2 receptor antagonist BAY-u 3405 in vivo increased EZH2 expression and reduced ZFP423 expression and adipocyte differentiation in CKO-CPC. Thus, cardiomyocyte STAT3 deficiency leads to age-related and sex-specific cardiac remodeling and failure in part due to sex-specific alterations in PGD&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; secretion and subsequent epigenetic impairment of the differentiation potential of CPC. Causally involved is the impaired AR signaling in absence of STAT3, which reduces the expression of the PG-degrading enzyme HPGD.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/bZIPnUYRK2w&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Biology: Delineating reef fish trophic guilds with global gut content data synthesis and phylogeny</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~3/gkLuvPEX4Ak/article</link>

Understanding species’ roles in food webs requires an accurate assessment of their trophic niche. However, it is challenging to delineate potential trophic interactions across an ecosystem, and a paucity of empirical information often leads to inconsistent definitions of trophic guilds based on expert opinion, especially when applied to hyperdiverse ecosystems. Using coral reef fishes as a model group, we show that experts disagree on the assignment of broad trophic guilds for more than 20% of species, which hampers comparability across studies. Here, we propose a quantitative, unbiased, and reproducible approach to define trophic guilds and apply recent advances in machine learning to predict probabilities of pairwise trophic interactions with high accuracy. We synthesize data from community-wide gut content analyses of tropical coral reef fishes worldwide, resulting in diet information from 13,961 individuals belonging to 615 reef fish. We then use network analysis to identify 8 trophic guilds and Bayesian phylogenetic modeling to show that trophic guilds can be predicted based on phylogeny and maximum body size. Finally, we use machine learning to test whether pairwise trophic interactions can be predicted with accuracy. Our models achieved a misclassification error of less than 5%, indicating that our approach results in a quantitative and reproducible trophic categorization scheme, as well as high-resolution probabilities of trophic interactions. By applying our framework to the most diverse vertebrate consumer group, we show that it can be applied to other organismal groups to advance reproducibility in trait-based ecology. Our work thus provides a viable approach to account for the complexity of predator–prey interactions in highly diverse ecosystems.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/gkLuvPEX4Ak&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Photodynamic therapy (PDT) has recently gained attention as an alternative treatment of malignant gliomas. Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most prevalent within tumors of the central nervous system (CNS). Conventional treatments for this CNS tumor include surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy. Surgery is still being considered as the treatment of choice. Even so, the poor prognosis and/or recurrence of the disease after applying any of these treatments highlight the urgency of exploring new therapies and/or improving existing ones to achieve the definitive eradication of tumor masses and remaining cells. PDT is a therapeutic modality that involves the destruction of tumor cells by reactive oxygen species induced by light, which were previously treated with a photosensitizing agent. However, in recent years, its experimental application has expanded to other effects that could improve overall performance against GBM. In the current review, we revisit the main advances of PDT for GBM management and also, the recent mechanistic insights about cellular and molecular aspects related to tumoral resistance to PDT of GBM.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: CD8+ T‐lymphocyte driven limbic encephalitis results in temporal lobe epilepsy</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.26000?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Limbic encephalitis (LE) comprises a spectrum of inflammatory changes in affected brain structures including the presence of autoantibodies and lymphoid cells. Still, the potential of distinct lymphocyte subsets alone to elicit key clinico‐pathological sequelae of LE potentially inducing temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) with chronic spontaneous seizures and hippocampal sclerosis (HS) is unresolved.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, we scrutinized pathogenic consequences emerging from CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T‐cells targeting hippocampal neurons by recombinant adeno‐associated virus‐mediated expression of the model‐autoantigen Ovalbumin (OVA) in CA1 neurons of OT‐I/RAG1&lt;sup&gt;‐/‐&lt;/sup&gt; mice (termed ‘OVA‐CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; LE model’).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Viral‐mediated antigen transfer caused dense CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T‐cell infiltrates confined to the hippocampal formation starting on day five after virus transduction. Flow cytometry indicated priming of CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T‐cells in brain‐draining lymph nodes to precede hippocampal invasion. At the acute model stage, the inflammatory process was accompanied by frequent seizure activity and impairment of hippocampal memory skills. MRI‐scans at day seven of the OVA‐CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; LE model revealed hippocampal edema and blood‐brain‐barrier disruption that converted into atrophy until day 40. CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T‐cells specifically targeted OVA‐expressing, SIINFEKL‐H‐2K&lt;sup&gt;b&lt;/sup&gt; positive CA1 neurons and caused segmental apoptotic neurodegeneration, astrogliosis and microglial activation. At the chronic model stage, mice exhibited spontaneous recurrent seizures and persisting memory deficits, whilst the sclerotic hippocampus was populated with CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T‐cells escorted by NK‐cells.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These data indicate that a CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T‐cell initiated attack of distinct hippocampal neurons is sufficient to induce LE converting into TLE‐HS. Intriguingly, the role of CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T‐cells exceeds neurotoxic effects and points to their major pathogenic role in TLE following LE.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We accomplished visualization and reconstruction of noradrenergic neurons projecting to the olfactory bulb (OB) by infection of adeno‐associated viruses into the locus coeruleus of dopamine beta hydroxylase‐Cre mice. An individual noradrenergic axon traveled while forming several branches and was distributed in multiple glomeruli that were located in different areas of the glomerular layer in the OB.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Olfactory input is processed in the glomerulus of the main olfactory bulb (OB) and relayed to higher centers in the brain by projection neurons. Conversely, centrifugal inputs from other brain regions project to the OB. We have previously analyzed centrifugal inputs into the OB from several brain regions using single‐neuron labeling. In this study, we analyzed the centrifugal noradrenergic (NA) fibers derived from the locus coeruleus (LC), because their projection pathways and synaptic connections in the OB have not been clarified in detail. We analyzed the NA centrifugal projections by single‐neuron labeling and immunoelectron microscopy. Individual NA neurons labeled by viral infection were three‐dimensionally traced using Neurolucida software to visualize the projection pathway from the LC to the OB. Also, centrifugal NA fibers were visualized using an antibody for noradrenaline transporter (NET). NET immunoreactive (‐ir) fibers contained many varicosities and synaptic vesicles. Furthermore, electron tomography demonstrated that NET‐ir fibers formed asymmetrical synapses of varied morphology. Although these synapses were present at varicosities, the density of synapses was relatively low throughout the OB. The maximal density of synapses was found in the external plexiform layer; about 17% of all observed varicosities contained synapses. These results strongly suggest that NA‐containing fibers in the OB release NA from both varicosities and synapses to influence the activities of OB neurons. The present study provides a morphological basis for olfactory modulation by centrifugal NA fibers derived from the LC.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

&lt;p&gt;By observing the behavior of mice in their home cage environment, using the powerful PhenoTyper tracking system, we demonstrate that mice display dramatic reductions in movement and exploration when isolated from their cage mates, an instantaneous effect that escalates over the next 5 days, which is reversible upon re‐pairing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The effects of social isolation on an individual's behavior is an important field of research, especially as public health officials encourage social distancing to prevent the spread of pandemic disease. In this study we evaluate the effects of social isolation on physical activity in mice. Utilizing a pixel‐based tracking system, we continuously monitored the movement of isolated mice compared with paired cage mates in the home cage environment. We demonstrate that mice that are socially isolated dramatically decrease their movement when separated from their cage mate, and especially in the dark cycle, when mice are normally most active. When isolated mice are re‐paired with their original cage mate, this effect is reversed, and mice return to their prior levels of activity. These findings suggest a close link between social isolation and physical activity, and are of particular interest in the wake of coronavirus disease 2019, when many are forced into isolation. Social isolation may affect an individual's overall activity levels in humans too, which may have unintended effects on health that deserve further consideration.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

&lt;p&gt;Axonal mitochondrial size correlates with &lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt;‐ratio during homeostasis in multiple species and during advanced remyelination. But not during early remyelination. Oligodendrocyte mitochondria function influence myelin thickness which influence axonal mitochondria size.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Demyelinating pathology is common in many neurological diseases such as multiple sclerosis, stroke, and Alzheimer's disease and results in axonal energy deficiency, dysfunctional axonal propagation, and neurodegeneration. During myelin repair and also during myelin homeostasis, mutual regulative processes between axons and myelin sheaths are known to be essential. However, proficient tools are lacking to characterize axon‐myelin interdependence during (re)myelination. Thus, we herein investigated adaptions in myelin sheath &lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt;‐ratio as a proxy for myelin thickness and axon metabolic status during homeostasis and myelin repair, by using axonal mitochondrial size as a proxy for axonal metabolic status. We found that axons with thinner myelin sheaths had larger axonal mitochondria; this was true for across different central nervous system tracts as well as across species, including humans. The link between myelin sheath thickness and mitochondrial size was temporarily absent during demyelination but reestablished during advanced remyelination, as shown in two commonly used animal models of toxic demyelination. By further exploring this association in mice with either genetically induced mitochondrial or myelin dysfunction, we show that axonal mitochondrial size adjusts in response to the thickness of the myelin sheath but not &lt;i&gt;vice versa&lt;/i&gt;. This pinpoints the relevance of mitochondrial adaptation upon myelin repair and might open a new therapeutic window for remyelinating therapies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;img alt=&quot;Defining VDR expression in the brain using a novel VDRCre mouse&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/615ae6fd-ceeb-40df-be7c-4f1ded9a7edd/cne25100-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We generated a novel vitamin D receptor (VDR) VDR&lt;sup&gt;Cre&lt;/sup&gt; knockin mouse for the interrogation of VDR anatomy in the brain. In this paper, we demonstrate through immunohistochemistry that VDR&lt;sup&gt;Cre&lt;/sup&gt;‐driven reporter expression colocalizes with VDR mRNA throughout the brain. Additionally, we demonstrate that tdTomato (+) neurons respond rapidly to vitamin D, which does not occur in tdTomato (‐) neurons.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vitamin D action has been linked to several diseases regulated by the brain including obesity, diabetes, autism, and Parkinson’s. However, the location of the vitamin D receptor (VDR) in the brain is not clear due to conflicting reports. We found that two antibodies previously published as specific in peripheral tissues are not specific in the brain. We thus created a new knockin mouse with cre recombinase expression under the control of the endogenous VDR promoter (VDR&lt;sup&gt;Cre&lt;/sup&gt;). We demonstrated that the cre activity in the VDR&lt;sup&gt;Cre&lt;/sup&gt; mouse brain (as reported by a cre‐dependent tdTomato expression) is highly overlapping with endogenous VDR mRNAs. These VDR‐expressing cells were enriched in multiple brain regions including the cortex, amygdala, caudate putamen, and hypothalamus among others. In the hypothalamus, VDR partially colocalized with vasopressin, oxytocin, estrogen receptor α, and β‐endorphin to various degrees. We further functionally validated our model by demonstrating that the endogenous VDR agonist 1,25‐dihydroxyvitamin D activated all tested tdTomato+ neurons in the paraventricular hypothalamus but had no effect on neurons without tdTomato fluorescence. Thus, we have generated a new mouse tool that allows us to visualize VDR‐expressing cells and to characterize their functions.&lt;/p&gt;

	<content:encoded>&lt;img alt=&quot;Identification and Localization of a Gonadotropin Releasing Hormone (GnRH) Related Neuropeptide in Biomphalaria, an Intermediate Host for Schistosomiasis&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/f3da04bd-e198-4f6b-81d2-c4d0155bc303/cne25099-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Histological methods were used to localize a neuropeptide related to gonadotrophin releasing hormone (GnRH) in the central nervous system and periphery of &lt;i&gt;Biomphalaria glabrata&lt;/i&gt;, an intermediate host for intestinal schistosomiasis.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Freshwater snails of the genus &lt;i&gt;Biomphalaria&lt;/i&gt; serve as obligatory hosts for the digenetic trematode &lt;i&gt;Schistosoma mansoni&lt;/i&gt;, the causative agent for the most widespread form of intestinal schistosomiasis. Within &lt;i&gt;Biomphalaria&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;S. mansoni&lt;/i&gt; larvae multiply and transform into the cercariae form that can infect humans. Trematode development and proliferation is thought to be facilitated by modifications of host behavior and physiological processes, including a reduction of reproduction known as ‘parasitic castration’. As neuropeptides participate in the control of reproduction across phylogeny, a neural transcriptomics approach was undertaken to identify peptides that could regulate &lt;i&gt;Biomphalaria&lt;/i&gt; reproductive physiology. The present study identified a transcript in &lt;i&gt;Biomphalaria alexandrina&lt;/i&gt; that encodes a peptide belonging to the gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) superfamily. The precursor and the predicted mature peptide, pQIHFTPDWGNN‐NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (designated &lt;i&gt;Biom&lt;/i&gt;‐GnRH), share features with peptides identified in other molluscan species, including panpulmonates, opisthobranchs, and cephalopods. An antibody generated against &lt;i&gt;Biom&lt;/i&gt;‐GnRH labeled neurons in the cerebral, pedal, and visceral ganglia of &lt;i&gt;B. glabrata&lt;/i&gt;. GnRH‐like immunoreactive (GnRHli) fiber systems projected to all central ganglia. In the periphery, immunoreactive material was detected in the ovotestis, oviduct, albumen gland, and nidamental gland. As these structures serve crucial roles in the production, transport, nourishment, and encapsulation of eggs, disruption of the GnRH system of &lt;i&gt;Biomphalaria&lt;/i&gt; could contribute to reduced reproductive activity in infected snails.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Characterization of the GABRB2‐Associated Neurodevelopmental Disorders</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25985?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We aimed to characterize the phenotypic spectrum and functional consequences associated with variants in the gene &lt;i&gt;GABRB2&lt;/i&gt;, coding for the γ‐aminobutyric acid type A (GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;) receptor subunit β2.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We recruited and systematically evaluated 25 individuals with variants in &lt;i&gt;GABRB2&lt;/i&gt;, 17 of whom are newly described and 8 previously reported with additional clinical data. Functional analysis was performed using a &lt;i&gt;Xenopus laevis&lt;/i&gt; oocyte model system.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our cohort of 25 individuals from 22 families with variants in &lt;i&gt;GABRB2&lt;/i&gt; demonstrated a range of epilepsy phenotypes from genetic generalized epilepsy to developmental and epileptic encephalopathy. Fifty‐eight percent of individuals had pharmacoresistant epilepsy; response to medications targeting the GABAergic pathway was inconsistent. Developmental disability (present in 84%) ranged from mild intellectual disability to severe global disability; movement disorders (present in 44%) included choreoathetosis, dystonia, and ataxia. Disease‐associated variants cluster in the extracellular N‐terminus and transmembrane domains 1–3, with more severe phenotypes seen in association with variants in transmembrane domains 1 and 2 and the allosteric binding site between transmembrane domains 2 and 3. Functional analysis of 4 variants in transmembrane domains 1 or 2 (p.Ile246Thr, p.Pro252Leu, p.Ile288Ser, p.Val282Ala) revealed strongly reduced amplitudes of GABA‐evoked anionic currents.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;GABRB2&lt;/i&gt;‐related epilepsy ranges broadly in severity from genetic generalized epilepsy to developmental and epileptic encephalopathies. Developmental disability and movement disorder are key features. The phenotypic spectrum is comparable to other GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptor‐encoding genes. Phenotypic severity varies by protein domain. Experimental evidence supports loss of GABAergic inhibition as the mechanism underlying &lt;i&gt;GABRB2&lt;/i&gt;‐associated neurodevelopmental disorders. ANN NEUROL 2020&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Covert speech comprehension predicts recovery from acute unresponsive states</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25995?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patients with traumatic brain injury who fail to obey commands after sedation‐washout pose one of the most significant challenges for neurological prognostication. Reducing prognostic uncertainty will lead to more appropriate care decisions and ensure provision of limited rehabilitation resources to those most likely to benefit. Bedside‐markers of covert residual cognition, including speech comprehension, may reduce this uncertainty.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We recruited 28 patients with acute traumatic brain injury who were 2‐7‐days sedation‐free and failed to obey commands. Patients heard streams of isochronous monosyllabic words that built meaningful phrases and sentences while their brain activity via electroencephalography (EEG) was recorded. In healthy individuals, EEG activity only synchronises with the rhythm of phrases and sentences when listeners consciously comprehend the speech. This approach therefore provides a measure of residual speech comprehension in unresponsive patients.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;17‐ and 16‐patients were available for assessment with the Glasgow Outcome Scale Extended at three‐ and six‐months, respectively. Outcome significantly correlated with the strength of patients’ acute cortical tracking of phrases and sentences (r&amp;gt;.6, p&amp;lt;.007), quantified by inter‐trial phase coherence. Linear regressions revealed that the strength of this comprehension response (beta=.603, p=.006) significantly improved the accuracy of prognoses relative to clinical characteristics alone (e.g. Glasgow Coma Scale, Computer Tomography (CT) grade).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A simple, passive, auditory EEG protocol improves prognostic accuracy in a critical period of clinical decision‐making. Unlike other approaches to probing covert cognition for prognostication, this approach is entirely passive and therefore less susceptible to cognitive deficits, increasing the number of patients who may benefit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Acute exposure to THC significantly decreases CB&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; receptors at inhibitory terminals and mitochondria.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The use and abuse of cannabis can be associated with significant pathophysiology, however it remains unclear whether 1) acute administration of Δ‐9‐tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) during early adulthood alters the cannabinoid type 1 (CB&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) receptor localization and expression in cells of the brain, and 2) THC produces structural brain changes. Here we use electron microscopy and a highly sensitive pre‐embedding immunogold method to examine CB&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; receptors in the hippocampus cornu ammonis subfield 1 (CA1) 30 min after male mice were exposed to a single THC injection (5 mg/kg). The findings show that acute exposure to THC can significantly decrease the percentage of CB&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; receptor immunopositive terminals making symmetric synapses, mitochondria and astrocytes. The percentage of CB&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; receptor‐labeled terminals forming asymmetric synapses was unaffected. Lastly, CB&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; receptor expression was significantly lower at terminals of symmetric and asymmetric synapses as well as in mitochondria.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Structurally, CA1 dendrites were significantly larger, and contained more spines and mitochondria following acute THC administration. The area of the dendritic spines, synaptic terminals, mitochondria and astrocytes decreased significantly following acute THC exposure. Altogether, these results indicate that even a single THC exposure can have a significant impact on CB&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; receptor expression, and can alter CA1 ultrastructure, within 30 min of drug exposure. These changes may contribute to the behavioral alterations experienced by young individuals shortly after cannabis intoxication.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Within the tumor microenvironment, macrophages exist in an immunosuppressive state, preventing T cells from eliminating the tumor. Due to this, research is focusing on immunotherapies that specifically target macrophages in order to reduce their immunosuppressive capabilities and promote T cell function. In this study, we develop an agent-based model consisting of the interactions between macrophages, T cells, and tumor cells to determine how the immune response changes due to three macrophage-based immunotherapeutic strategies: macrophage depletion, recruitment inhibition, and macrophage reeducation. We find that reeducation, which converts the macrophages into an immune promoting phenotype, is the most effective strategy and that the macrophage recruitment rate and tumor proliferation rate (tumor-specific properties) have large impacts on therapy efficacy. We also employ a novel method of using a neural network to reduce the computational complexity of an intracellular signaling mechanistic model.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/itGbDRPWJ0A&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Insulin resistance (IR) precedes the development of type 2 diabetes (T2D) and increases cardiovascular disease risk. Although genome wide association studies (GWAS) have uncovered new loci associated with T2D, their contribution to explain the mechanisms leading to decreased insulin sensitivity has been very limited. Thus, new approaches are necessary to explore the genetic architecture of insulin resistance. To that end, we generated an iPSC library across the spectrum of insulin sensitivity in humans. RNA-seq based analysis of 310 induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) clones derived from 100 individuals allowed us to identify differentially expressed genes between insulin resistant and sensitive iPSC lines. Analysis of the co-expression architecture uncovered several insulin sensitivity-relevant gene sub-networks, and predictive network modeling identified a set of key driver genes that regulate these co-expression modules. Functional validation in human adipocytes and skeletal muscle cells (SKMCs) confirmed the relevance of the key driver candidate genes for insulin responsiveness.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/xm2yv54rgnU&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

The fate of scientific hypotheses often relies on the ability of a computational model to explain the data, quantified in modern statistical approaches by the likelihood function. The log-likelihood is the key element for parameter estimation and model evaluation. However, the log-likelihood of complex models in fields such as computational biology and neuroscience is often intractable to compute analytically or numerically. In those cases, researchers can often only estimate the log-likelihood by comparing observed data with synthetic observations generated by model simulations. Standard techniques to approximate the likelihood via simulation either use summary statistics of the data or are at risk of producing substantial biases in the estimate. Here, we explore another method, inverse binomial sampling (IBS), which can estimate the log-likelihood of an entire data set efficiently and without bias. For each observation, IBS draws samples from the simulator model until one matches the observation. The log-likelihood estimate is then a function of the number of samples drawn. The variance of this estimator is uniformly bounded, achieves the minimum variance for an unbiased estimator, and we can compute calibrated estimates of the variance. We provide theoretical arguments in favor of IBS and an empirical assessment of the method for maximum-likelihood estimation with simulation-based models. As case studies, we take three model-fitting problems of increasing complexity from computational and cognitive neuroscience. In all problems, IBS generally produces lower error in the estimated parameters and maximum log-likelihood values than alternative sampling methods with the same average number of samples. Our results demonstrate the potential of IBS as a practical, robust, and easy to implement method for log-likelihood evaluation when exact techniques are not available.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/OsIhzQozl6c&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Fluorescence reconstruction microscopy (FRM) describes a class of techniques where transmitted light images are passed into a convolutional neural network that then outputs predicted epifluorescence images. This approach enables many benefits including reduced phototoxicity, freeing up of fluorescence channels, simplified sample preparation, and the ability to re-process legacy data for new insights. However, FRM can be complex to implement, and current FRM benchmarks are abstractions that are difficult to relate to how valuable or trustworthy a reconstruction is. Here, we relate the conventional benchmarks and demonstrations to practical and familiar cell biology analyses to demonstrate that FRM should be judged in context. We further demonstrate that it performs remarkably well even with lower-magnification microscopy data, as are often collected in screening and high content imaging. Specifically, we present promising results for nuclei, cell-cell junctions, and fine feature reconstruction; provide data-driven experimental design guidelines; and provide researcher-friendly code, complete sample data, and a researcher manual to enable more widespread adoption of FRM.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/wf9Ho97_a2o&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

By modifying and calibrating an active vertex model to experiments, we have simulated numerically a confluent cellular monolayer spreading on an empty space and the collision of two monolayers of different cells in an antagonistic migration assay. Cells are subject to inertial forces and to active forces that try to align their velocities with those of neighboring ones. In agreement with experiments in the literature, the spreading test exhibits formation of fingers in the moving interfaces, there appear swirls in the velocity field, and the polar order parameter and the correlation and swirl lengths increase with time. Numerical simulations show that cells inside the tissue have smaller area than those at the interface, which has been observed in recent experiments. In the antagonistic migration assay, a population of fluidlike Ras cells invades a population of wild type solidlike cells having shape parameters above and below the geometric critical value, respectively. Cell mixing or segregation depends on the junction tensions between different cells. We reproduce the experimentally observed antagonistic migration assays by assuming that a fraction of cells favor mixing, the others segregation, and that these cells are randomly distributed in space. To characterize and compare the structure of interfaces between cell types or of interfaces of spreading cellular monolayers in an automatic manner, we apply topological data analysis to experimental data and to results of our numerical simulations. We use time series of data generated by numerical simulations to automatically group, track and classify the advancing interfaces of cellular aggregates by means of bottleneck or Wasserstein distances of persistent homologies. These techniques of topological data analysis are scalable and could be used in studies involving large amounts of data. Besides applications to wound healing and metastatic cancer, these studies are relevant for tissue engineering, biological effects of materials, tissue and organ regeneration.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/FpOKxraLPNY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Classification and phylogeny for the annotation of novel eukaryotic GNAT acetyltransferases</title>

The enzymes of the GCN5-related N-acetyltransferase (GNAT) superfamily count more than 870 000 members through all kingdoms of life and share the same structural fold. GNAT enzymes transfer an acyl moiety from acyl coenzyme A to a wide range of substrates including aminoglycosides, serotonin, glucosamine-6-phosphate, protein N-termini and lysine residues of histones and other proteins. The GNAT subtype of protein N-terminal acetyltransferases (NATs) alone targets a majority of all eukaryotic proteins stressing the omnipresence of the GNAT enzymes. Despite the highly conserved GNAT fold, sequence similarity is quite low between members of this superfamily even when substrates are similar. Furthermore, this superfamily is phylogenetically not well characterized. Thus functional annotation based on sequence similarity is unreliable and strongly hampered for thousands of GNAT members that remain biochemically uncharacterized. Here we used sequence similarity networks to map the sequence space and propose a new classification for eukaryotic GNAT acetyltransferases. Using the new classification, we built a phylogenetic tree, representing the entire GNAT acetyltransferase superfamily. Our results show that protein NATs have evolved more than once on the GNAT acetylation scaffold. We use our classification to predict the function of uncharacterized sequences and verify by &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; protein assays that two fungal genes encode NAT enzymes targeting specific protein N-terminal sequences, showing that even slight changes on the GNAT fold can lead to change in substrate specificity. In addition to providing a new map of the relationship between eukaryotic acetyltransferases the classification proposed constitutes a tool to improve functional annotation of GNAT acetyltransferases.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/PEKlfRJLvyY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Biology: Glycosylation generates an efficacious and immunogenic vaccine against H7N9 influenza virus</title>

Zoonotic avian influenza viruses pose severe health threats to humans. Of several viral subtypes reported, the low pathogenic avian influenza H7N9 virus has since February 2013 caused more than 1,500 cases of human infection with an almost 40% case-fatality rate. Vaccination of poultry appears to reduce human infections. However, the emergence of highly pathogenic strains has increased concerns about H7N9 pandemics. To develop an efficacious H7N9 human vaccine, we designed vaccine viruses by changing the patterns of &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-linked glycosylation (NLG) on the viral hemagglutinin (HA) protein based on evolutionary patterns of H7 HA NLG changes. Notably, a virus in which 2 NLG modifications were added to HA showed higher growth rates in cell culture and elicited more cross-reactive antibodies than did other vaccine viruses with no change in the viral antigenicity. Developed into an inactivated vaccine formulation, the vaccine virus with 2 HA NLG additions exhibited much better protective efficacy against lethal viral challenge in mice than did a vaccine candidate with wild-type (WT) HA by reducing viral replication in the lungs. In a ferret model, the 2 NLG-added vaccine viruses also induced hemagglutination-inhibiting antibodies and significantly suppressed viral replication in the upper and lower respiratory tracts compared with the WT HA vaccines. In a mode of action study, the HA NLG modification appeared to increase HA protein contents incorporated into viral particles, which would be successfully translated to improve vaccine efficacy. These results suggest the strong potential of HA NLG modifications in designing avian influenza vaccines.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/tD-eDoOH63s&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Nucleocytoplasmic transport (NCT) defects have been implicated in neurodegenerative diseases such as &lt;i&gt;C9ORF72&lt;/i&gt;-associated amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal dementia (C9-ALS/FTD). Here, we identify a neuroprotective pathway of like-Sm protein 12 (&lt;i&gt;LSM12&lt;/i&gt;) and exchange protein directly activated by cyclic AMP 1 (&lt;i&gt;EPAC1&lt;/i&gt;) that sustains the nucleocytoplasmic RAN gradient and thereby suppresses NCT dysfunction by the &lt;i&gt;C9ORF72&lt;/i&gt;-derived poly(glycine-arginine) protein. LSM12 depletion in human neuroblastoma cells aggravated poly(GR)-induced impairment of NCT and nuclear integrity while promoting the nuclear accumulation of poly(GR) granules. In fact, &lt;i&gt;LSM12&lt;/i&gt; posttranscriptionally up-regulated &lt;i&gt;EPAC1&lt;/i&gt; expression, whereas EPAC1 overexpression rescued the RAN gradient and NCT defects in &lt;i&gt;LSM12&lt;/i&gt;-deleted cells. C9-ALS patient-derived neurons differentiated from induced pluripotent stem cells (C9-ALS iPSNs) displayed low expression of &lt;i&gt;LSM12&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;EPAC1&lt;/i&gt;. Lentiviral overexpression of LSM12 or EPAC1 indeed restored the RAN gradient, mitigated the pathogenic mislocalization of TDP-43, and suppressed caspase-3 activation for apoptosis in C9-ALS iPSNs. EPAC1 depletion biochemically dissociated RAN-importin β1 from the cytoplasmic nuclear pore complex, thereby dissipating the nucleocytoplasmic RAN gradient essential for NCT. These findings define the &lt;i&gt;LSM12&lt;/i&gt;-&lt;i&gt;EPAC1&lt;/i&gt; pathway as an important suppressor of the NCT-related pathologies in C9-ALS/FTD.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/PGYGt4CxIDM&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Histone variants expand chromatin functions in eukaryote genomes. &lt;i&gt;H2A&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt; genes are testis-expressed short histone H2A variants that arose in placental mammals. Their biological functions remain largely unknown. To investigate their function, we generated a knockout (KO) model that disrupts all 3 &lt;i&gt;H2A&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt; genes in mice. We show that &lt;i&gt;H2A&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt; KO males have globally altered chromatin structure in postmeiotic germ cells. Yet, they do not show impaired spermatogenesis or testis function. Instead, we find that &lt;i&gt;H2A&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt; plays a crucial role postfertilization. Crosses between &lt;i&gt;H2A&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt; KO males and females yield embryos with lower viability and reduced size. Using a series of genetic crosses that separate parental and zygotic contributions, we show that the &lt;i&gt;H2A&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt; status of both the father and mother, but not of the zygote, affects embryonic viability and growth during gestation. We conclude that &lt;i&gt;H2A&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;i&gt;B&lt;/i&gt; is a novel parental-effect gene, establishing a role for short H2A histone variants in mammalian development. We posit that parental antagonism over embryonic growth drove the origin and ongoing diversification of short histone H2A variants in placental mammals.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/38O2OT1oGoc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

&lt;p&gt;The brain activity of the four brain regions during visuo‐guided grip force tracking tasks were detected by functional near‐infrared spectroscopy. Pearson's correlation method, partial correlation method, and a pairwise maximum entropy model were used to get a more comprehensive and accurate functional connectivity for precise grip force control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The functional connectivity (FC) between multiple brain regions during tasks is currently gradually being explored with functional near‐infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). However, the FC present during grip force tracking tasks performed under visual feedback remains unclear. In the present study, we used fNIRS to measure brain activity during resting states and grip force tracking tasks at 25%, 50%, and 75% of maximum voluntary contraction (MVC) in 11 healthy subjects, and the activity was measured from four target brain regions: the left prefrontal cortex (lPFC), right prefrontal cortex (rPFC), left sensorimotor cortex (lSMC), and right sensorimotor cortex (rSMC). We determined the FC between these regions utilizing three different methods: Pearson's correlation method, partial correlation method, and a pairwise maximum entropy model (MEM). The results showed that the FC of lSMC‐rSMC and lPFC‐rPFC (interhemispheric homologous pairs) were significantly stronger than those of other brain region pairs. Moreover, FC of lPFC‐rPFC was strengthened during the 75% MVC task compared to the other task states and the resting states. The FC of lSMC‐lPFC and rSMC‐rPFC (intrahemispheric region pairs) strengthened with a higher task load. The results provided new insights into the FC between brain regions during visuo‐guided grip force tracking tasks.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

&lt;p&gt;N‐cadherin is involved in the formation and maintenance of synapses. It was mainly detected in type II cells and nerve fibers in taste buds. Immunoelectron microscopy detected N‐cadherin symmetrically in the membranes of contact sites between afferent fibers (N) and type II cells (II), including synapses. Arrowheads: atypical mitochondria.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taste buds, the receptor organs for taste, contain 50–100 taste bud cells. Although these cells undergo continuous turnover, the structural and functional integrity of taste buds is maintained. The molecular mechanisms by which synaptic connectivity between taste buds and afferent fibers is formed and maintained remain ambiguous. In the present study, we examined the localization of N‐cadherin in the taste buds of the mouse circumvallate papillae because N‐cadherin, one of the classical cadherins, is important for the formation and maintenance of synapses. At the light microscopic level, N‐cadherin was predominantly detected in type II cells and nerve fibers in the connective tissues in and around the vallate papillae. At the ultrastructural level, N‐cadherin immunoreactivity appears along the cell membrane and in the intracellular vesicles of type II cells. N‐cadherin immunoreactivity also is evident in the membranes of afferent terminals at the contact sites to N‐cadherin‐positive type II cells. At channel type synapses between type II cells and nerve fibers, N‐cadherin is present surrounding, but not within, the presumed neurotransmitter release zone, identified by large mitochondria apposed to the taste cells. The present results suggest that N‐cadherin is important for the formation or maintenance of type II cell afferent synapses in taste buds.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Synaptic Neuroscience: Endocannabinoid-Like Lipid Neuromodulators in the Regulation of Dopamine Signaling: Relevance for Drug Addiction</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsyn.2020.588660</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The family of lipid neuromodulators has been rapidly growing, as the use of different -omics techniques led to the discovery of a large number of naturally occurring N-acylethanolamines (NAEs) and N-acyl amino acids belonging to the complex lipid signaling system termed endocannabinoidome. These molecules exert a variety of biological activities in the central nervous system, as they modulate physiological processes in neurons and glial cells and are involved in the pathophysiology of neurological and psychiatric disorders. Their effects on dopamine cells have attracted attention, as dysfunctions of dopamine systems characterize a range of psychiatric disorders, i.e., schizophrenia and substance use disorders (SUD). While canonical endocannabinoids are known to regulate excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs impinging on dopamine cells and modulate several dopamine-mediated behaviors, such as reward and addiction, the effects of other lipid neuromodulators are far less clear. Here, we review the emerging role of endocannabinoid-like neuromodulators in dopamine signaling, with a focus on non-cannabinoid N-acylethanolamines and their receptors. Mounting evidence suggests that these neuromodulators contribute to modulate synaptic transmission in dopamine regions and might represent a target for novel medications in alcohol and nicotine use disorder.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Target Molecules of STIM Proteins in the Central Nervous System</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2020.617422</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Stromal interaction molecules (STIMs), including STIM1 and STIM2, are single-pass transmembrane proteins that are located predominantly in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). They serve as calcium ion (Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;) sensors within the ER. In the central nervous system (CNS), they are involved mainly in Orai-mediated store-operated Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; entry (SOCE). The key molecular components of the SOCE pathway are well-characterized, but the molecular mechanisms that underlie the regulation of this pathway need further investigation. Numerous intracellular target proteins that are located in the plasma membrane, ER, cytoskeleton, and cytoplasm have been reported to play essential roles in concert with STIMs, such as conformational changes in STIMs, their translocation, the stabilization of their interactions with Orai, and the activation of other channels. The present review focuses on numerous regulators, such as Homer, SOCE-associated regulatory factor (SARAF), septin, synaptopodin, golli proteins, partner of STIM1 (POST), and transcription factors and proteasome inhibitors that regulate STIM-Orai interactions in the CNS. Further we describe novel roles of STIMs in mediating Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; influx via other than Orai pathways, including TRPC channels, VGCCs, AMPA and NMDA receptors, and group I metabotropic glutamate receptors. This review also summarizes recent findings on additional molecular targets of STIM proteins including SERCA, IP&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Rs, end-binding proteins (EB), presenilin, and CaMKII. Dysregulation of the SOCE-associated toolkit, including STIMs, contributes to the development of neurodegenerative disorders (e.g., Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and Huntington's disease), traumatic brain injury, epilepsy, and stroke. Emerging evidence points to the role of STIM proteins and several of their molecular effectors and regulators in neuronal and glial physiology and pathology, suggesting their potential application for future therapeutic strategies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Recent Developments in Data Independent Acquisition (DIA) Mass Spectrometry: Application of Quantitative Analysis of the Brain Proteome</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2020.564446</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Mass spectrometry is the driving force behind current brain proteome analysis. In a typical proteomics approach, a protein isolate is digested into tryptic peptides and then analyzed by liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry. The recent advancements in data independent acquisition (DIA) mass spectrometry provide higher sensitivity and protein coverage than the classic data dependent acquisition. DIA cycles through a pre-defined set of peptide precursor isolation windows stepping through 400–1,200 m/z across the whole liquid chromatography gradient. All peptides within an isolation window are fragmented simultaneously and detected by tandem mass spectrometry. Peptides are identified by matching the ion peaks in a mass spectrum to a spectral library that contains information of the peptide fragment ions' pattern and its chromatography elution time. Currently, there are several reports on DIA in brain research, in particular the quantitative analysis of cellular and synaptic proteomes to reveal the spatial and/or temporal changes of proteins that underlie neuronal plasticity and disease mechanisms. Protocols in DIA are continuously improving in both acquisition and data analysis. The depth of analysis is currently approaching proteome-wide coverage, while maintaining high reproducibility in a stable and standardisable MS environment. DIA can be positioned as the method of choice for routine proteome analysis in basic brain research and clinical applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Frontal Functional Network Disruption Associated with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis: An fNIRS-Based Minimum Spanning Tree Analysis</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.613990</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Recent evidence increasingly associates network disruption in brain organization with multiple neurodegenerative diseases, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), a rare terminal disease. However, the comparability of brain network characteristics across different studies remains a challenge for conventional graph theoretical methods. One suggested method to address this issue is minimum spanning tree (MST) analysis, which provides a less biased comparison. Here, we assessed the novel application of MST network analysis to hemodynamic responses recorded by functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) neuroimaging modality, during an activity-based paradigm to investigate hypothetical disruptions in frontal functional brain network topology as a marker of the executive dysfunction, one of the most prevalent cognitive deficit reported across ALS studies. We analyzed data recorded from nine participants with ALS and ten age-matched healthy controls by first estimating functional connectivity, using phase-locking value (PLV) analysis, and then constructing the corresponding individual and group MSTs. Our results showed significant between-group differences in several MST topological properties, including leaf fraction, maximum degree, diameter, eccentricity, and degree divergence. We further observed a global shift toward more centralized frontal network organizations in the ALS group, interpreted as a more random or dysregulated network in this cohort. Moreover, the similarity analysis demonstrated marginally significantly increased overlap in the individual MSTs from the control group, implying a reference network with lower topological variation in the healthy cohort. Our nodal analysis characterized the main local hubs in healthy controls as distributed more evenly over the frontal cortex, with slightly higher occurrence in the left prefrontal cortex (PFC), while in the ALS group, the most frequent hubs were asymmetrical, observed primarily in the right prefrontal cortex. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that the global PLV (gPLV) synchronization metric is associated with disease progression, and a few topological properties, including leaf fraction and tree hierarchy, are linked to disease duration. These results suggest that dysregulation, centralization, and asymmetry of the hemodynamic-based frontal functional network during activity are potential neuro-topological markers of ALS pathogenesis. Our findings can possibly support new bedside assessments of the functional status of ALS’ brain network and could hypothetically extend to applications in other neurodegenerative diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: MiR-128-3p Alleviates Spinal Cord Ischemia/Reperfusion Injury Associated Neuroinflammation and Cellular Apoptosis via SP1 Suppression in Rat</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.609613</link>
	<content:encoded>Background&lt;p&gt;Neuroinflammation and cellular apoptosis caused by spinal cord ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury result in neurological dysfunction. MicroRNAs (miRs) have crucial functions in spinal cord I/R injury pathogenesis according to previous evidences. Herein, whether miR-128-3p contributes to spinal cord I/R injury by regulating specificity protein 1 (SP1) was assessed.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;A rat model of spinal cord I/R injury was established by occluding the aortic arch for 14 min. Then, miR-128-3p’s interaction with SP1 was detected by dual-luciferase reporter assays. Next, miR-128-3p mimic and inhibitor, as well as adenovirus-delivered shRNA specific for SP1 were injected intrathecally for assessing the effects of miR-128-3p and SP1 on rats with spinal cord I/R injury. SP1, Bax and Bcl-2 expression levels in I/R injured spinal cord tissues were evaluated by Western blotting, while IL-1β, TNF-α, and IL-6 were quantitated by ELISA. Tarlov scores were obtained to detect hind-limb motor function. Evans blue (EB) dye extravasation was utilized to examine blood–spinal cord barrier (BSCB) permeability. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining was performed for neuronal apoptosis assessment.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;MiR-128-3p expression was decreased, while SP1 amounts were increased in rat spinal cord tissue specimens following I/R. SP1 was identified as a miR-128-3p target and downregulated by miR-128-3p. MiR-128-3p overexpression or SP1 silencing alleviated I/R-induced neuroinflammation and cell apoptosis, and improved Tarlov scores, whereas pretreatment with miR-128-3p inhibitor aggravated the above injuries.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;Overexpression of miR-128-3p protects neurons from neuroinflammation and apoptosis during spinal cord I/R injury partially by downregulating SP1.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Improving Accuracy of Brainstem MRI Volumetry: Effects of Age and Sex, and Normalization Strategies</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.609422</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Background: Brainstem-mediated functions are impaired in neurodegenerative diseases and aging. Atrophy can be visualized by MRI. This study investigates extrinsic sources of brainstem volume variability, intrinsic sources of anatomical variability, and the influence of age and sex on the brainstem volumes in healthy subjects. We aimed to develop efficient normalization strategies to reduce the effects of intrinsic anatomic variability on brainstem volumetry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Brainstem segmentation was performed from MPRAGE data using our deep-learning-based brainstem segmentation algorithm MD-GRU. The extrinsic variability of brainstem volume assessments across scanners and protocols was investigated in two groups comprising 11 (median age 33.3 years, 7 women) and 22 healthy subjects (median age 27.6 years, 50% women) scanned twice and compared using Dice scores. Intrinsic anatomical inter-individual variability and age and sex effects on brainstem volumes were assessed in segmentations of 110 healthy subjects (median age 30.9 years, range 18–72 years, 53.6% women) acquired on 1.5T (45%) and 3T (55%) scanners. The association between brainstem volumes and predefined anatomical covariates was studied using Pearson correlations. Anatomical variables with associations of |r| &amp;gt; 0.30 as well as the variables age and sex were used to construct normalization models using backward selection. The effect of the resulting normalization models was assessed by % relative standard deviation reduction and by comparing the inter-individual variability of the normalized brainstem volumes to the non-normalized values using paired t- tests with Bonferroni correction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: The extrinsic variability of brainstem volumetry across different field strengths and imaging protocols was low (Dice scores &amp;gt; 0.94). Mean inter-individual variability/SD of total brainstem volumes was 9.8%/7.36. A normalization based on either total intracranial volume (TICV), TICV and age, or v-scale significantly reduced the inter-individual variability of total brainstem volumes compared to non-normalized volumes and similarly reduced the relative standard deviation by about 35%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: The extrinsic variability of the novel brainstem segmentation method MD-GRU across different scanners and imaging protocols is very low. Anatomic inter-individual variability of brainstem volumes is substantial. This study presents efficient normalization models for variability reduction in brainstem volumetry in healthy subjects.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Network Diffusion Modeling Explains Longitudinal Tau PET Data</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.566876</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer's disease is associated with the cerebral accumulation of neurofibrillary tangles of hyperphosphorylated tau protein. The progressive occurrence of tau aggregates in different brain regions is closely related to neurodegeneration and cognitive impairment. However, our current understanding of tau propagation relies almost exclusively on postmortem histopathology, and the precise propagation dynamics of misfolded tau in the living brain remain poorly understood. Here we combine longitudinal positron emission tomography and dynamic network modeling to test the hypothesis that misfolded tau propagates preferably along neuronal connections. We follow 46 subjects for three or four annual positron emission tomography scans and compare their pathological tau profiles against brain network models of intracellular and extracellular spreading. For each subject, we identify a personalized set of model parameters that characterizes the individual progression of pathological tau. Across all subjects, the mean protein production rate was 0.21 ± 0.15 and the intracellular diffusion coefficient was 0.34 ± 0.43. Our network diffusion model can serve as a tool to detect non-clinical symptoms at an earlier stage and make informed predictions about the timeline of neurodegeneration on an individual personalized basis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroinformatics: NeuroRA: A Python Toolbox of Representational Analysis From Multi-Modal Neural Data</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fninf.2020.563669</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In studies of cognitive neuroscience, multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) is widely used as it offers richer information than traditional univariate analysis. Representational similarity analysis (RSA), as one method of MVPA, has become an effective decoding method based on neural data by calculating the similarity between different representations in the brain under different conditions. Moreover, RSA is suitable for researchers to compare data from different modalities and even bridge data from different species. However, previous toolboxes have been made to fit specific datasets. Here, we develop NeuroRA, a novel and easy-to-use toolbox for representational analysis. Our toolbox aims at conducting cross-modal data analysis from multi-modal neural data (e.g., EEG, MEG, fNIRS, fMRI, and other sources of neruroelectrophysiological data), behavioral data, and computer-simulated data. Compared with previous software packages, our toolbox is more comprehensive and powerful. Using NeuroRA, users can not only calculate the representational dissimilarity matrix (RDM), which reflects the representational similarity among different task conditions and conduct a representational analysis among different RDMs to achieve a cross-modal comparison. Besides, users can calculate neural pattern similarity (NPS), spatiotemporal pattern similarity (STPS), and inter-subject correlation (ISC) with this toolbox. NeuroRA also provides users with functions performing statistical analysis, storage, and visualization of results. We introduce the structure, modules, features, and algorithms of NeuroRA in this paper, as well as examples applying the toolbox in published datasets.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Increased Phase Cone Turnover in 80–250 Hz Bands Occurs in the Epileptogenic Zone During Interictal Periods</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.615744</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;We found that phase cone clustering patterns in EEG ripple bands demonstrate an increased turnover rate in epileptogenic zones compared to adjacent regions. We employed 256 channel EEG data collected in four adult subjects with refractory epilepsy. The analysis was performed in the 80–150 and 150–250 Hz ranges. Ictal onsets were documented with intracranial EEG recordings. Interictal scalp recordings, free of epileptiform patterns, of 240-s duration, were selected for analysis for each subject. The data was filtered, and the instantaneous phase was extracted after the Hilbert transformation. Spatiotemporal contour plots of the unwrapped instantaneous phase with 1.0 ms intervals were constructed using a montage layout of the 256 electrode positions. Stable phase cone patterns were selected based on criteria that the sign of spatial gradient did not change for a minimum of three consecutive time samples and the frame velocity was consistent with known propagation velocities of cortical axons. These plots exhibited increased dynamical formation and dissolution of phase cones in the ictal onset zones, compared to surrounding cortical regions, in all four patients. We believe that these findings represent markers of abnormally increased cortical excitability. They are potential tools that may assist in localizing the epileptogenic zone.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.606684</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Modulating connectivity measures in EEG-based neurofeedback studies is assumed to be a promising therapeutic and training tool. However, little is known so far about its effects and trainability. In the present study, we investigated the effects of up- and down-regulating SMR (12–15 Hz) coherence by means of neurofeedback training on EEG activity and memory functions. Twenty adults performed 10 neurofeedback training sessions in which half of them tried to increase EEG coherence between Cz and CPz in the SMR frequency range, while the other half tried to down-regulate coherence. Up-regulation of SMR coherence led to between- and within-session changes in EEG coherence. SMR power increased across neurofeedback training sessions but not within training sessions. Cross-over training effects on baseline EEG measures were also observed in this group. Up-regulation of SMR coherence was also associated with improvements in memory functions when comparing pre- and post-test results. Participants were not able to down-regulate SMR coherence. This group did not show any changes in baseline EEG measures or memory functions comparing pre- and post-test. Our results provide insights in the trainability and effects of connectivity-based neurofeedback training and indications for its practical application.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.598435</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Background: Magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) is a neuroimaging technique that may be useful for non-invasive mapping of brain temperature (i.e., thermometry) over a large brain volume. To date, intra-subject reproducibility of MRSI-based brain temperature (MRSI-t) has not been investigated. The objective of this repeated measures MRSI-t study was to establish intra-subject reproducibility and repeatability of brain temperature, as well as typical brain temperature range.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Healthy participants aged 23–46 years (N = 18; 7 females) were scanned at two time points ~12-weeks apart. Volumetric MRSI data were processed by reconstructing metabolite and water images using parametric spectral analysis. Brain temperature was derived using the frequency difference between water and creatine (T&lt;sub&gt;CRE&lt;/sub&gt;) for 47 regions of interest (ROIs) delineated by the modified Automated Anatomical Labeling (AAL) atlas. Reproducibility was measured using the coefficient of variation for repeated measures (COVrep), and repeatability was determined using the standard error of measurement (SEM). For each region, the upper and lower bounds of Minimal Detectable Change (MDC) were established to characterize the typical range of T&lt;sub&gt;CRE&lt;/sub&gt; values.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: The mean global brain temperature over all subjects was 37.2°C with spatial variations across ROIs. There was a significant main effect for time [F&lt;sub&gt;(1, 1,591)&lt;/sub&gt; = 37.0, p &amp;lt; 0.0001] and for brain region [F&lt;sub&gt;(46, 1,591)&lt;/sub&gt; = 2.66, p &amp;lt; 0.0001]. The time&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;brain region interaction was not significant [F&lt;sub&gt;(46, 1,591)&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.80, p = 0.83]. Participants' T&lt;sub&gt;CRE&lt;/sub&gt; was stable for each ROI across both time points, with ROIs' COVrep ranging from 0.81 to 3.08% (mean COVrep = 1.92%); majority of ROIs had a COVrep &amp;lt;2.0%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: Brain temperature measurements were highly consistent between both time points, indicating high reproducibility and repeatability of MRSI-t. MRSI-t may be a promising diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic tool for non-invasively monitoring brain temperature changes in health and disease. However, further studies of healthy participants with larger sample size(s) and numerous repeated acquisitions are imperative for establishing a reference range of typical brain T&lt;sub&gt;CRE&lt;/sub&gt;, as well as the threshold above which T&lt;sub&gt;CRE&lt;/sub&gt; is likely pathological.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Working Memory in Aphasia: The Role of Temporal Information Processing</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.589802</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Aphasia is an acquired impairment of language functions resulting from a brain lesion. It is usually accompanied by deficits in non-linguistic cognitive processes. This study aimed to investigate in patients with aphasia the complex interrelationships between selected cognitive functions: auditory speech comprehension, working memory (WM), and temporal information processing (TIP) in the millisecond time range. Thirty right-handed subjects (20 males) aged from 27 to 82 years suffering from post-stroke aphasia participated in the study. Verbal working memory (VWM) and spatial working memory (SWM) were assessed with: (1) a receptive verbal test and (2) the Corsi Block-Tapping Test, respectively. Both these WM tests used the forward tasks (mainly engaging maintenance processes, i.e., storing, monitoring, and matching information) and backward tasks (engaging both maintenance and manipulation processes, i.e., reordering and updating information). Auditory comprehension was assessed by receptive language tests, and TIP efficiency was assessed by auditory perception of temporal order in the millisecond time range. We observed better performance of forward WM tasks than backward ones, independently of the type of material used. Furthermore, the severity of auditory comprehension impairment correlated with the efficiency on both forward and backward VWM tasks and the backward SWM task. Further analysis revealed that TIP plays a crucial role only in the latter task. These results indicate the divergent pattern of interactions between WM and TIP depending on the type of WM tasks. Level of verbal competency appeared to play an important role in both VWM tasks, whereas TIP (which is associated with manipulation processes) appeared to be important for SWM, but only on the backward task.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Adaptation can optimize information processing by allowing the visual system to always adjust to the environment. However, only a few studies have investigated how the visual system makes adjustments to repeatedly occurring changes in the input, still less about the related neural mechanism. Our previous study found that contrast adaptation attenuated after multiple daily sessions of repeated adaptation, which was explained by the habituation of either the adapter’s effective strength or the adaptation mechanisms. To examine the former hypothesis, in the present study we used the frequency tagging technique to measure the adapter-elicited steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP) amplitudes. Participants repeatedly adapted to the same contrast adapter in a top-up manner for six continuous days, which was called training of adaptation. The behavioral adaptation effect and SSVEP response to the trained adapter and an untrained control adapter were measured before and after training. The psychophysical results showed that the effect of adaptation in the trained condition significantly reduced after training, replicating our previous finding. Contradicting the prediction of the hypothesis that repeated adaptation attenuated the effective strength of the adapter, the SSVEP amplitude was unchanged after training, which was further confirmed by an equivalence test. Taken together, the results challenge the account of habituation of adapter in repeated adaptation, while leaving the account of habituation of adaptation mechanism to be tested.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Involvement of the Right Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex in Numerical Rule Induction: A Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation Study</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.566675</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Numerical inductive reasoning has been considered as one of the most important higher cognitive functions of the human brain. Importantly, previous behavioral studies have consistently reported that one critical component of numerical inductive reasoning is checking, which often occurs when a discrepant element is discovered, and reprocessing is needed to determine whether the discrepancy is an error of the original series. However, less is known about the neural mechanism underlying the checking process. Given that the checking effect involves cognitive control processes, such as the incongruent resolution, that are linked to the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), this study hypothesizes that the right DLPFC may play a specific role in the checking process. To test the hypothesis, this study utilized the transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), a non-invasive brain stimulation method that could modulate cortical excitability, and examined whether and how the stimulation of the right DLPFC via tDCS could modulate the checking effect during a number-series completion problem task. Ninety healthy participants were allocated to one of the anodal, cathodal, and sham groups. Subjects were required to verify whether number sequences formed rule-based series, and checking effect was assessed by the difference in performance between invalid and valid conditions. It was found that significantly longer response times (RTs) were exhibited in invalid condition compared with valid condition in groups of anodal, cathodal, and sham tDCS. Furthermore, the anodal tDCS significantly shortened the checking effect than those of the cathodal and sham groups, whereas no significantly prolonged checking effect was detected in the cathodal group. The current findings indicated that anodal tDCS affected the process of checking, which suggested that the right DLPFC might play a critical role in the checking process of numerical inductive reasoning by inhibiting incongruent response.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience: Dynamic Modulation of a Learned Motor Skill for Its Recruitment</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2020.457682</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Humans learn motor skills (MSs) through practice and experience and may then retain them for recruitment, which is effective as a rapid response for novel contexts. For an MS to be recruited for novel contexts, its recruitment range must be extended. In addressing this issue, we hypothesized that an MS is dynamically modulated according to the feedback context to expand its recruitment range into novel contexts, which do not involve the learning of an MS. The following two sub-issues are considered. We previously demonstrated that the learned MS could be recruited in novel contexts through its modulation, which is driven by dynamically regulating the synergistic redundancy between muscles according to the feedback context. However, this modulation is trained in the dynamics under the MS learning context. Learning an MS in a specific condition naturally causes movement deviation from the desired state when the MS is executed in a novel context. We hypothesized that this deviation can be reduced with the additional modulation of an MS, which tunes the MS-produced muscle activities by using the feedback gain signals driven by the deviation from the desired state. Based on this hypothesis, we propose a feedback gain signal-driven tuning model of a learned MS for its robust recruitment. This model is based on the neurophysiological architecture in the cortico-basal ganglia circuit, in which an MS is plausibly retained as it was learned and is then recruited by tuning its muscle control signals according to the feedback context. In this study, through computational simulation, we show that the proposed model may be used to neurophysiologically describe the recruitment of a learned MS in novel contexts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neural Circuits: Neural Interactions in Developing Rhythmogenic Spinal Networks: Insights From Computational Modeling</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncir.2020.614615</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The mechanisms involved in generation of rhythmic locomotor activity in the mammalian spinal cord remain poorly understood. These mechanisms supposedly rely on both intrinsic properties of constituting neurons and interactions between them. A subset of Shox2 neurons was suggested to contribute to generation of spinal locomotor activity, but the possible cellular basis for rhythmic bursting in these neurons remains unknown. Ha and Dougherty (2018) recently revealed the presence of bidirectional electrical coupling between Shox2 neurons in neonatal spinal cords, which can be critically involved in neuronal synchronization and generation of populational bursting. Gap junctional connections found between functionally-related Shox2 interneurons decrease with age, possibly being replaced by increasing interactions through chemical synapses. Here, we developed a computational model of a heterogeneous population of neurons sparsely connected by electrical or/and chemical synapses and investigated the dependence of frequency of populational bursting on the type and strength of neuronal interconnections. The model proposes a mechanistic explanation that can account for the emergence of a synchronized rhythmic activity in the neuronal population and provides insights into the possible role of gap junctional coupling between Shox2 neurons in the spinal mechanisms for locomotor rhythm generation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: AAV-Mediated GALC Gene Therapy Rescues Alpha-Synucleinopathy in the Spinal Cord of a Leukodystrophic Lysosomal Storage Disease Mouse Model</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.619712</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Krabbe's disease (KD) is primarily a demyelinating disorder, but recent studies have identified the presence of neuronal protein aggregates in the brain, at least partially composed by alpha-synuclein (α-syn). The role of this protein aggregation in the pathogenesis of KD is largely unknown, but it has added KD to a growing list of lysosomal storage diseases that can be also be considered as proteinopathies. While the presence of these protein aggregates within the KD brain is now appreciated, the remainder of the central nervous system (CNS) remains uncharacterized. This study is the first to report the presence of thioflavin-S reactive inclusions throughout the spinal cord of both murine and human spinal tissue. Stereological analysis revealed the temporal and spatial accumulation of these inclusions within the neurons of the ventral spinal cord vs. those located in the dorsal cord. This study also confirmed that these thio-S positive accumulations are present within neuronal populations and are made up at least in part by α-syn in both the twitcher mouse and cord autopsied material from affected human patients. Significantly, neonatal gene therapy for galactosylceramidase, a treatment that strongly improves the survival and health of KD mice, but not bone marrow transplantation prevents the formation of these inclusions in spinal neurons. These results expand the understanding of α-syn protein aggregation within the CNS of individuals afflicted with KD and underlines the tractability of this problem via early gene therapy, with potential impact to other synucleinopathies such as PD.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Chronic Tear Deficiency Sensitizes Transient Receptor Potential Vanilloid 1-Mediated Responses in Corneal Sensory Nerves</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.598678</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Chronic tear deficiency enhances the excitability of corneal cold-sensitive nerves that detect ocular dryness, which can lead to discomfort in patients with dry eye disease (DED). However, changes in corneal nerve excitations through the polymodal nociceptor “transient receptor potential vanilloid 1” (TRPV1) and the potential link between this receptor and symptoms of DED remain unclear. In this study, we examined the firing properties of corneal cold-sensitive nerves expressing TRPV1 and possible contributions of chronic tear deficiency to corneal nerve excitability by TRPV1 activation. The bilateral excision of lacrimal glands in guinea pigs decreased the tear volume and increased the frequency of spontaneous eyeblinks 1–4 weeks after surgery. An analysis of the firing properties of the cold-sensitive nerves was performed by single-unit recordings of corneal preparations 4 weeks after surgery in both the sham-operated and gland-excised groups. Perfusion of the TRPV1 agonist, capsaicin (1 μM), transiently increased the firing frequency in approximately 46–48% of the cold-sensitive nerves characterized by low-background activity and high threshold (LB-HT) cold thermoreceptors in both groups. Gland excision significantly decreased the latency of capsaicin-induced firing in cold-sensitive nerves; however, its magnitude was unchanged. Calcium imaging of cultured trigeminal ganglion neurons from both groups showed that intracellular calcium elevation of corneal neurons induced by a low concentration of capsaicin (0.03 μM) was significantly larger in the gland excision group, regardless of responsiveness to cold. An immunohistochemical study of the trigeminal ganglion revealed that gland excision significantly increased the proportion of corneal neurons enclosed by glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)-immunopositive satellite glial cells. Topical application of the TRPV1 antagonist, A784168 (30 μM), on the ocular surface attenuated eye-blink frequency after gland excision. Furthermore, gland excision enhanced blink behavior induced by a low concentration of capsaicin (0.1 μM). These results suggest that chronic tear deficiency sensitizes the TRPV1-mediated response in the corneal LB-HT cold thermoreceptors and cold-insensitive polymodal nociceptors, which may be linked to dry eye discomfort and hyperalgesia resulting from nociceptive stimuli in aqueous-deficient dry eyes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Chemically Induced Models of Parkinson’s Disease: History and Perspectives for the Involvement of Ferroptosis</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.581191</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Ferroptosis is a newly discovered form of necrotic cell death characterized by its dependency on iron and lipid peroxidation. Ferroptosis has attracted much attention recently in the area of neurodegeneration since the involvement of ferroptosis in Parkinson’s disease (PD), a major neurodegenerative disease, has been indicated using animal models. Although PD is associated with both genetic and environmental factors, sporadic forms of PD account for more than 90% of total PD. Following the importance of environmental factors, various neurotoxins are used as chemical inducers of PD both in vivo and in vitro. In contrast to other neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s and Huntington’s diseases (AD and HD), many of the characteristics of PD can be reproduced in vivo by the use of specific neurotoxins. Given the indication of ferroptosis in PD pathology, several studies have been conducted to examine whether ferroptosis plays role in the loss of dopaminergic neurons in PD. However, there are still few reports showing an authentic form of ferroptosis in neuronal cells during exposure to the neurotoxins used as PD inducers. In this review article, we summarize the history of the uses of chemicals to create PD models in vivo and in vitro. Besides, we also survey recent reports examining the possible involvement of ferroptosis in chemical models of PD.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.617071</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The aging process causes many changes to the brain and is a major risk factor for the development of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Despite an already vast amount of research on AD, a greater understanding of the disease's pathology and therapeutic options are desperately needed. One important distinction that is also in need of further study is the ability to distinguish changes to the brain observed in early stages of AD vs. changes that occur with normal aging. Current FDA-approved therapeutic options for AD patients have proven to be ineffective and indicate the need for alternative therapies. Aging interventions including alterations in diet (such as caloric restriction, fasting, or methionine restriction) have been shown to be effective in mediating increased health and lifespan in mice and other model organisms. Because aging is the greatest risk factor for the development of neurodegenerative diseases, certain dietary interventions should be explored as they have the potential to act as a future treatment option for AD patients.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: The Cognitive Profile of Mild Cognitive Impairment Due to Dementia With Lewy Bodies—An Updated Review</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.597579</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Objective: Dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB) is the second most common type of neurodegenerative dementia. Yet, the domain-specific cognitive impairment of the mild cognitive impairment (MCI) phase of this disease (DLB-MCI) is still not been established. This article gives an updated review on the neuropsychological profile of DLB-MCI, building on the findings from a previous review.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: We performed systematic review and searched five different electronic databases (Scopus, Cochrane, EMBASE, MEDLINE, and PsycINFO) in May 2020 based on a PICO scheme. Our search was then restricted to articles published in 2019 and 2020. Ending up with a total of 90 articles to be reviewed by abstract and/or full text.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: In total four papers were included, whereof only one met our full inclusion criteria. Despite a substantial heterogeneity, our findings indicate that DLB-MCI patients have a pattern of executive, visuospatial, and attentional deficits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: The findings indicate that the neuropsychological profile of DLB-MCI is characterized by executive, visuospatial, and attentional deficits. Furthermore, the shortage of studies clearly underlines the paucity of published research into DLB-MCI and emphasizes the need for well-controlled studies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Recommended dosages vary widely, and first‐ and second‐line agents are designated in only 18 and 2 states, respectively. Given this degree of variability, standardized national EMS guidelines are needed. ANN NEUROL 2020&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Subtype Diagnosis of Sporadic Creutzfeldt–Jakob Disease with Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25983?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sporadic Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease (sCJD) comprises several subtypes as defined by genetic and prion protein characteristics, which are associated with distinct clinical and pathological phenotypes. To date, no clinical test can reliably diagnose the subtype. We established two procedures for the antemortem diagnosis of sCJD subtype using diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MRI of 1,458 patients referred to the National Prion Disease Pathology Surveillance Center were collected through its consultation service. One neuroradiologist blind to the diagnosis scored 12 brain regions and generated a lesion profile for each MRI scan. We selected 487 patients with autopsy‐confirmed diagnosis of “pure” sCJD subtype and at least one positive diffusion MRI examination. We designed and tested two data‐driven procedures for subtype diagnosis: the first procedure—prion subtype classification algorithm with MRI (PriSCA_MRI)—uses only MRI examinations; the second—PriSCA_MRI + Gen—includes knowledge of the prion protein codon 129 genotype, a major determinant of sCJD subtypes. Both procedures were tested on the first MRI and the last MRI follow‐up.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PriSCA_MRI classified the 3 most prevalent subtypes with 82% accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PriSCA_MRI + Gen raised the accuracy to 89% and identified all subtypes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Individually, the 2 most prevalent sCJD subtypes, MM1 and VV2, were diagnosed with sensitivities up to 95 and 97%, respectively. The performances of both procedures did not change in 168 patients with longitudinal MRI studies when the last examination was used.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study provides the first practical algorithms for antemortem diagnosis of sCJD subtypes. MRI diagnosis of subtype is likely to be attainable at early disease stages to prognosticate clinical course and design future therapeutic trials. ANN NEUROL 2020&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell lines are widely used in industry for biological drug production. During cell culture development, considerable effort is invested to understand the factors that greatly impact cell growth, specific productivity and product qualities of the biotherapeutics. While high-throughput omics approaches have been increasingly utilized to reveal cellular mechanisms associated with cell line phenotypes and guide process optimization, comprehensive omics data analysis and management have been a challenge. Here we developed CHOmics, a web-based tool for integrative analysis of CHO cell line omics data that provides an interactive visualization of omics analysis outputs and efficient data management. CHOmics has a built-in comprehensive pipeline for RNA sequencing data processing and multi-layer statistical modules to explore relevant genes or pathways. Moreover, advanced functionalities were provided to enable users to customize their analysis and visualize the output systematically and interactively. The tool was also designed with the flexibility to accommodate other types of omics data and thereby enabling multi-omics comparison and visualization at both gene and pathway levels. Collectively, CHOmics is an integrative platform for data analysis, visualization and management with expectations to promote the broader use of omics in CHO cell research.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/sj7SQ1kIpEI&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Biological measurements frequently involve measuring parameters as a function of time, space, or frequency. Later, during the analysis phase of the study, the researcher splits the recorded data trace into smaller sections, analyzes each section separately by finding a mean or fitting against a specified function, and uses the analysis results in the study. Here, we present the software that allows to analyze these data traces in a manner that ensures repeatability of the analysis and simplifies the application of FAIR (findability, accessibility, interoperability, and reusability) principles in such studies. At the same time, it simplifies the routine data analysis pipeline and gives access to a fast overview of the analysis results. For that, the software supports reading the raw data, processing the data as specified in the protocol, and storing all intermediate results in the laboratory database. The software can be extended by study- or hardware-specific modules to provide the required data import and analysis facilities. To simplify the development of the data entry web interfaces, that can be used to enter data describing the experiments, we released a web framework with an example implementation of such a site. The software is covered by open-source license and is available through several online channels.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/lX_XzerFB6I&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Microbial natural products constitute a wide variety of chemical compounds, many which can have antibiotic, antiviral, or anticancer properties that make them interesting for clinical purposes. Natural product classes include polyketides (PKs), nonribosomal peptides (NRPs), and ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptides (RiPPs). While variants of biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) for known classes of natural products are easy to identify in genome sequences, BGCs for new compound classes escape attention. In particular, evidence is accumulating that for RiPPs, subclasses known thus far may only represent the tip of an iceberg. Here, we present decRiPPter (Data-driven Exploratory Class-independent RiPP TrackER), a RiPP genome mining algorithm aimed at the discovery of novel RiPP classes. DecRiPPter combines a Support Vector Machine (SVM) that identifies candidate RiPP precursors with pan-genomic analyses to identify which of these are encoded within operon-like structures that are part of the accessory genome of a genus. Subsequently, it prioritizes such regions based on the presence of new enzymology and based on patterns of gene cluster and precursor peptide conservation across species. We then applied decRiPPter to mine 1,295 &lt;i&gt;Streptomyces&lt;/i&gt; genomes, which led to the identification of 42 new candidate RiPP families that could not be found by existing programs. One of these was studied further and elucidated as a representative of a novel subfamily of lanthipeptides, which we designate class V. The 2D structure of the new RiPP, which we name pristinin A3 (1), was solved using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) data, and chemical labeling. Two previously unidentified modifying enzymes are proposed to create the hallmark lanthionine bridges. Taken together, our work highlights how novel natural product families can be discovered by methods going beyond sequence similarity searches to integrate multiple pathway discovery criteria.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/bknPhbPA6VM&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Primordial follicle assembly in the mouse occurs during perinatal ages and largely determines the ovarian reserve that will be available to support the reproductive life span. The development of primordial follicles is controlled by a complex network of interactions between oocytes and ovarian somatic cells that remain poorly understood. In the present research, using single-cell RNA sequencing performed over a time series on murine ovaries, coupled with several bioinformatics analyses, the complete dynamic genetic programs of germ and granulosa cells from E16.5 to postnatal day (PD) 3 were reported. Along with confirming the previously reported expression of genes by germ cells and granulosa cells, our analyses identified 5 distinct cell clusters associated with germ cells and 6 with granulosa cells. Consequently, several new genes expressed at significant levels at each investigated stage were assigned. By building single-cell pseudotemporal trajectories, 3 states and 1 branch point of fate transition for the germ cells were revealed, as well as for the granulosa cells. Moreover, Gene Ontology (GO) term enrichment enabled identification of the biological process most represented in germ cells and granulosa cells or common to both cell types at each specific stage, and the interactions of germ cells and granulosa cells basing on known and novel pathway were presented. Finally, by using single-cell regulatory network inference and clustering (SCENIC) algorithm, we were able to establish a network of regulons that can be postulated as likely candidates for sustaining germ cell-specific transcription programs throughout the period of investigation. Above all, this study provides the whole transcriptome landscape of ovarian cells and unearths new insights during primordial follicle assembly in mice.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/iFIJU6CdENw&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Biology: Phosphorylation of seryl-tRNA synthetase by ATM/ATR is essential for hypoxia-induced angiogenesis</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~3/rZ9l5M1hOJk/article</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Yi Shi, Ze Liu, Qian Zhang, Ingrid Vallee, Zhongying Mo, Shuji Kishi, Xiang-Lei Yang&lt;/p&gt;

Hypoxia-induced angiogenesis maintains tissue oxygen supply and protects against ischemia but also enhances tumor progression and malignancy. This is mediated through activation of transcription factors like hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) and c-Myc, yet the impact of hypoxia on negative regulators of angiogenesis is unknown. During vascular development, seryl-tRNA synthetase (SerRS) regulates angiogenesis through a novel mechanism by counteracting c-Myc and transcriptionally repressing vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA) expression. Here, we reveal that the transcriptional repressor role of SerRS is inactivated under hypoxia through phosphorylation by ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) and ataxia telangiectasia mutated and RAD3-related (ATR) at Ser101 and Ser241 to attenuate its DNA binding capacity. In zebrafish, SerRS&lt;sup&gt;S101D/S241D&lt;/sup&gt;, a phosphorylation-mimicry mutant, cannot suppress VEGFA expression to support normal vascular development. Moreover, expression of SerRS&lt;sup&gt;S101A/S241A&lt;/sup&gt;, a phosphorylation-deficient and constitutively active mutant, prevents hypoxia-induced binding of c-Myc and HIF-1 to the &lt;i&gt;VEGFA&lt;/i&gt; promoter, and activation of VEGFA expression. Consistently, SerRS&lt;sup&gt;S101A/S241A&lt;/sup&gt; strongly inhibits normal and tumor-derived angiogenesis in mice. Therefore, we reveal a key step regulating hypoxic angiogenesis and highlight the importance of nuclear SerRS in post-developmental angiogenesis regulation in addition to vascular development. The role of nuclear SerRS in inhibiting both c-Myc and HIF-1 may provide therapeutic opportunities to correct dysregulation of angiogenesis in pathological settings.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/rZ9l5M1hOJk&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Computational protein design is rapidly becoming more powerful, and improving the accuracy of computational methods would greatly streamline protein engineering by eliminating the need for empirical optimization in the laboratory. In this work, we set out to design novel granulopoietic agents using a rescaffolding strategy with the goal of achieving simpler and more stable proteins. All of the 4 experimentally tested designs were folded, monomeric, and stable, while the 2 determined structures agreed with the design models within less than 2.5 Å. Despite the lack of significant topological or sequence similarity to their natural granulopoietic counterpart, 2 designs bound to the granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) receptor and exhibited potent, but delayed, in vitro proliferative activity in a G-CSF-dependent cell line. Interestingly, the designs also induced proliferation and differentiation of primary human hematopoietic stem cells into mature granulocytes, highlighting the utility of our approach to develop highly active therapeutic leads purely based on computational design.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/4g376v1rJ3I&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Biology: Oligodendrocytes support axonal transport and maintenance via exosome secretion</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~3/Ph2iKJtdsn8/article</link>

Neurons extend long axons that require maintenance and are susceptible to degeneration. Long-term integrity of axons depends on intrinsic mechanisms including axonal transport and extrinsic support from adjacent glial cells. The mechanisms of support provided by myelinating oligodendrocytes to underlying axons are only partly understood. Oligodendrocytes release extracellular vesicles (EVs) with properties of exosomes, which upon delivery to neurons improve neuronal viability in vitro. Here, we show that oligodendroglial exosome secretion is impaired in 2 mouse mutants exhibiting secondary axonal degeneration due to oligodendrocyte-specific gene defects. Wild-type oligodendroglial exosomes support neurons by improving the metabolic state and promoting axonal transport in nutrient-deprived neurons. Mutant oligodendrocytes release fewer exosomes, which share a common signature of underrepresented proteins. Notably, mutant exosomes lack the ability to support nutrient-deprived neurons and to promote axonal transport. Together, these findings indicate that glia-to-neuron exosome transfer promotes neuronal long-term maintenance by facilitating axonal transport, providing a novel mechanistic link between myelin diseases and secondary loss of axonal integrity.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/Ph2iKJtdsn8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

&lt;p&gt;Scavenger receptor CD36 contributes significantly to lipid homeostasis, inflammation, and amyloid deposition in the brain. Here, we characterized CD36 gene and protein expression in the brains of young and aged male and female C57BL/6J mice. We found age‐related increases in CD36 mRNA, and CD36 protein differed by region, age, and sex and was primarily expressed intravascularly. These variations may contribute to Aβ deposition and neuroinflammation in Alzheimer's disease.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scavenger receptor CD36 contributes significantly to lipid homeostasis, inflammation, and amyloid deposition, while CD36 deficiency is associated with restored cerebrovascular function in an Alzheimer's disease (AD) mouse model. Yet the distribution of CD36 has not been examined in the brain. Here, we characterized CD36 gene and protein expression in the brains of young, middle aged, aged, and elderly male and female C57BL/6J mice. Age‐related increases in CD36 mRNA expression were observed in the male hippocampus and female midbrain. Additionally, male mice had greater CD36 mRNA expression than females in the striatum, hippocampus, and midbrain. CD36 protein was primarily expressed intravascularly, and this expression differed by region, age, and sex in the mouse brain. Although male mice brains demonstrated an increase in CD36 protein with age in several cortices, basal ganglia, hippocampus, and midbrain, a decrease with age was observed in female mice in the same regions. These data suggest that distinctive age, region, and sex expression of CD36 in the brain may contribute to Aβ deposition and neuroinflammation in AD.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience Research: Cellular and behavioral basis of cannabinioid and opioid interactions: Implications for opioid dependence and withdrawal</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jnr.24770?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The brain's endogenous opioid and endocannabinoid systems are neuromodulatory of synaptic transmission, and play key roles in pain, memory, reward, and addiction. Recent clinical and pre‐clinical evidence suggests that opioid use may be reduced with cannabinoid intake. This suggests the presence of a functional interaction between these two systems. Emerging research indicates that cannabinoids and opioids can functionally interact at different levels. At the cellular level, opioid and cannabinoids can have direct receptor associations, alterations in endogenous opioid peptide or cannabinoid release, or post‐receptor activation interactions via shared signal transduction pathways. At the systems level, the nature of cannabinoid and opioid interaction might differ in brain circuits underlying different behavioral phenomenon, including reward‐seeking or antinociception. Given the rising use of opioid and cannabinoid drugs, a better understanding of how these endogenous signaling systems interact in the brain is of significant interest. This review focuses on the potential relationship of these neural systems in addiction‐related processes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Natural Compounds as Inhibitors of Aβ Peptide Aggregation: Chemical Requirements and Molecular Mechanisms</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.619667</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is one of the most common neurodegenerative disorders, with no cure and preventive therapy. Misfolding and extracellular aggregation of Amyloid-β (Aβ) peptides are recognized as the main cause of AD progression, leading to the formation of toxic Aβ oligomers and to the deposition of β-amyloid plaques in the brain, representing the hallmarks of AD. Given the urgent need to provide alternative therapies, natural products serve as vital resources for novel drugs. In recent years, several natural compounds with different chemical structures, such as polyphenols, alkaloids, terpenes, flavonoids, tannins, saponins and vitamins from plants have received attention for their role against the neurodegenerative pathological processes. However, only for a small subset of them experimental evidences are provided on their mechanism of action. This review focuses on those natural compounds shown to interfere with Aβ aggregation by direct interaction with Aβ peptide and whose inhibitory mechanism has been investigated by means of biophysical and structural biology experimental approaches. In few cases, the combination of approaches offering a macroscopic characterization of the oligomers, such as TEM, AFM, fluorescence, together with high-resolution methods could shed light on the complex mechanism of inhibition. In particular, solution NMR spectroscopy, through peptide-based and ligand-based observation, was successfully employed to investigate the interactions of the natural compounds with both soluble NMR-visible (monomer and low molecular weight oligomers) and NMR-invisible (high molecular weight oligomers and protofibrils) species. The molecular determinants of the interaction of promising natural compounds are here compared to infer the chemical requirements of the inhibitors and the common mechanisms of inhibition. Most of the data converge to indicate that the Aβ regions relevant to perturb the aggregation cascade and regulate the toxicity of the stabilized oligomers, are the N-term and β1 region. The ability of the natural aggregation inhibitors to cross the brain blood barrier, together with the tactics to improve their low bioavailability are discussed. The analysis of the data ensemble can provide a rationale for the selection of natural compounds as molecular scaffolds for the design of new therapeutic strategies against the progression of early and late stages of AD.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Role of Sirtuins in Modulating Neurodegeneration of the Enteric Nervous System and Central Nervous System</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.614331</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Neurodegeneration of the central and enteric nervous systems is a common feature of aging and aging-related diseases, and is accelerated in individuals with metabolic dysfunction including obesity and diabetes. The molecular mechanisms of neurodegeneration in both the CNS and ENS are overlapping. Sirtuins are an important family of histone deacetylases that are important for genome stability, cellular response to stress, and nutrient and hormone sensing. They are activated by calorie restriction (CR) and by the coenzyme, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;). Sirtuins, specifically the nuclear SIRT1 and mitochondrial SIRT3, have been shown to have predominantly neuroprotective roles in the CNS while the cytoplasmic sirtuin, SIRT2 is largely associated with neurodegeneration. A systematic study of sirtuins in the ENS and their effect on enteric neuronal growth and survival has not been conducted. Recent studies, however, also link sirtuins with important hormones such as leptin, ghrelin, melatonin, and serotonin which influence many important processes including satiety, mood, circadian rhythm, and gut homeostasis. In this review, we address emerging roles of sirtuins in modulating the metabolic challenges from aging, obesity, and diabetes that lead to neurodegeneration in the ENS and CNS. We also highlight a novel role for sirtuins along the microbiota-gut-brain axis in modulating neurodegeneration.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: RatLesNetv2: A Fully Convolutional Network for Rodent Brain Lesion Segmentation</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.610239</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;We present a fully convolutional neural network (ConvNet), named RatLesNetv2, for segmenting lesions in rodent magnetic resonance (MR) brain images. RatLesNetv2 architecture resembles an autoencoder and it incorporates residual blocks that facilitate its optimization. RatLesNetv2 is trained end to end on three-dimensional images and it requires no preprocessing. We evaluated RatLesNetv2 on an exceptionally large dataset composed of 916 T2-weighted rat brain MRI scans of 671 rats at nine different lesion stages that were used to study focal cerebral ischemia for drug development. In addition, we compared its performance with three other ConvNets specifically designed for medical image segmentation. RatLesNetv2 obtained similar to higher Dice coefficient values than the other ConvNets and it produced much more realistic and compact segmentations with notably fewer holes and lower Hausdorff distance. The Dice scores of RatLesNetv2 segmentations also exceeded inter-rater agreement of manual segmentations. In conclusion, RatLesNetv2 could be used for automated lesion segmentation, reducing human workload and improving reproducibility. RatLesNetv2 is publicly available at https://github.com/jmlipman/RatLesNetv2.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Auditory Noise Leads to Increased Visual Brain-Computer Interface Performance: A Cross-Modal Study</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.590963</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Noise has been proven to have a beneficial role in non-linear systems, including the human brain, based on the stochastic resonance (SR) theory. Several studies have been implemented on single-modal SR. Cross-modal SR phenomenon has been confirmed in different human sensory systems. In our study, a cross-modal SR enhanced brain–computer interface (BCI) was proposed by applying auditory noise to visual stimuli. Fast Fourier transform and canonical correlation analysis methods were used to evaluate the influence of noise, results of which indicated that a moderate amount of auditory noise could enhance periodic components in visual responses. Directed transfer function was applied to investigate the functional connectivity patterns, and the flow gain value was used to measure the degree of activation of specific brain regions in the information transmission process. The results of flow gain maps showed that moderate intensity of auditory noise activated the brain area to a greater extent. Further analysis by weighted phase-lag index (wPLI) revealed that the phase synchronization between visual and auditory regions under auditory noise was significantly enhanced. Our study confirms the existence of cross-modal SR between visual and auditory regions and achieves a higher accuracy for recognition, along with shorter time window length. Such findings can be used to improve the performance of visual BCIs to a certain extent.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Case Report: Concurrent Resistance and Aerobic Training Regulate Adiponectin Expression and Disease Severity in Multiple Sclerosis: A Case Study</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.567302</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Adapted exercise is an effective non-pharmacological tool to improve functional, cognitive, and psychological parameters in multiple sclerosis (MS), in association with increased quality of life (QoL) and decreased disease severity. Adipose tissue, through the production of different adipokines, is involved in regulating energy metabolism and inflammation. Adiponectin, increased in MS, circulates as oligomers of low (LMW), medium (MMW), and high molecular weight (HMW), the latter mediating the main biological effects. The aim of study was to evaluate the effects of 4 months training at moderate intensity [65% heart rate reserve (HRR)] on BMI, adiponectin, and QoL in a volunteer with secondary progressive MS. The parameters were evaluated before (T0), after 4 months training (T1), and 6 months after the end of training (T2); total serum adiponectin and its oligomeric profile were evaluated. We found a reduction in BMI (−0.9%) and FAT (−2.6%), an improvement in perceived QoL and a reduced expression of total adiponectin and HMW oligomers together with decreased MS disability level at T1 measured by EDSS. Despite the limitations of a case study, this represent a starting point to understand the influence of exercise in MS and the relationship with adiponectin expression.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neural Technology: Semi-Automated and Direct Localization and Labeling of EEG Electrodes Using MR Structural Images for Simultaneous fMRI-EEG</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.558981</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Electroencephalography (EEG) source reconstruction estimates spatial information from the brain’s electrical activity acquired using EEG. This method requires accurate identification of the EEG electrodes in a three-dimensional (3D) space and involves spatial localization and labeling of EEG electrodes. Here, we propose a new approach to tackle this two-step problem based on the simultaneous acquisition of EEG and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). For the step of spatial localization of electrodes, we extract the electrode coordinates from the curvature of the protrusions formed in the high-resolution T1-weighted brain scans. In the next step, we assign labels to each electrode based on the distinguishing feature of the electrode’s distance profile in relation to other electrodes. We then compare the subject’s electrode data with template-based models of prelabeled distance profiles of correctly labeled subjects. Based on this approach, we could localize EEG electrodes in 26 head models with over 90% accuracy in the 3D localization of electrodes. Next, we performed electrode labeling of the subjects’ data with progressive improvements in accuracy: with ∼58% accuracy based on a single EEG-template, with ∼71% accuracy based on 3 EEG-templates, and with ∼76% accuracy using 5 EEG-templates. The proposed semi-automated method provides a simple alternative for the rapid localization and labeling of electrodes without the requirement of any additional equipment than what is already used in an EEG-fMRI setup.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Voluntary and Involuntary Attention in Bistable Visual Perception: A MEG Study</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.597895</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In this study, voluntary and involuntary visual attention focused on different interpretations of a bistable image, were investigated using magnetoencephalography (MEG). A Necker cube with sinusoidally modulated pixels' intensity in the front and rear faces with frequencies 6.67 Hz (60/9) and 8.57 Hz (60/7), respectively, was presented to 12 healthy volunteers, who interpreted the cube as either left- or right-oriented. The tags of these frequencies and their second harmonics were identified in the average Fourier spectra of the MEG data recorded from the visual cortex. In the first part of the experiment, the subjects were asked to voluntarily control their attention by interpreting the cube orientation as either being on the left or right. Accordingly, we observed the dominance of the corresponding spectral component, and voluntary attention performance was measured. In the second part of the experiment, the subjects were asked to focus their gaze on a red marker at the center of the cube image without putting forth effort in its interpretation. The alternation of the dominant spectral energies at the second harmonics of the stimulation frequencies was treated as changes in the cube orientation. Based on the results of the first experimental stage and using a wavelet analysis, we developed a method which allowed us to identify the currently perceived cube orientation. Finally, we characterized involuntary attention using the distribution of dominance times when focusing attention on one of the cube orientations, which was related to voluntary attention performance and brain noise. In particular, we confirmed our hypothesis that higher attention performance is associated with stronger brain noise.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Evidence for [Coronal] Underspecification in Typical and Atypical Phonological Development</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.580697</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The Featurally Underspecified Lexicon (FUL) theory predicts that [coronal] is the language universal default place of articulation for phonemes. This assumption has been consistently supported with adult behavioral and event-related potential (ERP) data; however, this underspecification claim has not been tested in developmental populations. The purpose of this study was to determine whether children demonstrate [coronal] underspecification patterns similar to those of adults. Two English consonants differing in place of articulation, [labial] /b/ and [coronal] /d/, were presented to 24 children (ages 4–6 years) characterized by either a typically developing phonological system (TD) or a phonological disorder (PD). Two syllables, /bɑ/ and /dɑ/, were presented in an ERP oddball paradigm where both syllables served as the standard and deviant stimulus in opposite stimulus sets. Underspecification was examined with three analyses: traditional mean amplitude measurements, cluster-based permutation tests, and single-trial general linear model (GLM) analyses of single-subject data. Contrary to previous adult findings, children with PD demonstrated a large positive mismatch response (PMR) to /bɑ/ while the children with TD exhibited a negative mismatch response (MMN); significant group differences were not observed in the /dɑ/ responses. Moreover, the /bɑ/ deviant ERP response was significantly larger in the TD children than in the children with PD. At the single-subject level, more children demonstrated mismatch responses to /dɑ/ than to /bɑ/, though some children had a /bɑ/ mismatch response and no /dɑ/ mismatch response. While both groups of children demonstrated similar responses to the underspecified /dɑ/, their neural responses to the more specified /bɑ/ varied. These findings are interpreted within a proposed developmental model of phonological underspecification, wherein children with PD are functioning at a developmentally less mature stage of phonological acquisition than their same-aged TD peers. Thus, phonological underspecification is a phenomenon that likely develops over time with experience and exposure to language.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Overground Walking Decreases Alpha Activity and Entrains Eye Movements in Humans</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.561755</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Experiments in animal models have shown that running increases neuronal activity in early visual areas in light as well as in darkness. This suggests that visual processing is influenced by locomotion independent of visual input. Combining mobile electroencephalography, motion- and eye-tracking, we investigated the influence of overground free walking on cortical alpha activity (~10 Hz) and eye movements in healthy humans. Alpha activity has been considered a valuable marker of inhibition of sensory processing and shown to negatively correlate with neuronal firing rates. We found that walking led to a decrease in alpha activity over occipital cortex compared to standing. This decrease was present during walking in darkness as well as during light. Importantly, eye movements could not explain the change in alpha activity. Nevertheless, we found that walking and eye related movements were linked. While the blink rate increased with increasing walking speed independent of light or darkness, saccade rate was only significantly linked to walking speed in the light. Pupil size, on the other hand, was larger during darkness than during light, but only showed a modulation by walking in darkness. Analyzing the effect of walking with respect to the stride cycle, we further found that blinks and saccades preferentially occurred during the double support phase of walking. Alpha power, as shown previously, was lower during the swing phase than during the double support phase. We however could exclude the possibility that the alpha modulation was introduced by a walking movement induced change in electrode impedance. Overall, our work indicates that the human visual system is influenced by the current locomotion state of the body. This influence affects eye movement pattern as well as neuronal activity in sensory areas and might form part of an implicit strategy to optimally extract sensory information during locomotion.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The question of whether artificial beings or machines could become self-aware or conscious has been a philosophical question for centuries. The main problem is that self-awareness cannot be observed from an outside perspective and the distinction of being really self-aware or merely a clever imitation cannot be answered without access to knowledge about the mechanism's inner workings. We investigate common machine learning approaches with respect to their potential ability to become self-aware. We realize that many important algorithmic steps toward machines with a core consciousness have already been taken.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Cellular and Synaptic Mechanisms That Differentiate Mitral Cells and Superficial Tufted Cells Into Parallel Output Channels in the Olfactory Bulb</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.614377</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A common feature of the primary processing structures of sensory systems is the presence of parallel output “channels” that convey different information about a stimulus. In the mammalian olfactory bulb, this is reflected in the mitral cells (MCs) and tufted cells (TCs) that have differing sensitivities to odors, with TCs being more sensitive than MCs. In this study, we examined potential mechanisms underlying the different responses of MCs vs. TCs. For TCs, we focused on superficial TCs (sTCs), which are a population of output TCs that reside in the superficial-most portion of the external plexiform layer, along with external tufted cells (eTCs), which are glutamatergic interneurons in the glomerular layer. Using whole-cell patch-clamp recordings in mouse bulb slices, we first measured excitatory currents in MCs, sTCs, and eTCs following olfactory sensory neuron (OSN) stimulation, separating the responses into a fast, monosynaptic component reflecting direct inputs from OSNs and a prolonged component partially reflecting eTC-mediated feedforward excitation. Responses were measured to a wide range of OSN stimulation intensities, simulating the different levels of OSN activity that would be expected to be produced by varying odor concentrations in vivo. Over a range of stimulation intensities, we found that the monosynaptic current varied significantly between the cell types, in the order of eTC &amp;gt; sTC &amp;gt; MC. The prolonged component was smaller in sTCs vs. both MCs and eTCs. sTCs also had much higher whole-cell input resistances than MCs, reflecting their smaller size and greater membrane resistivity. To evaluate how these different electrophysiological aspects contributed to spiking of the output MCs and sTCs, we used computational modeling. By exchanging the different cell properties in our modeled MCs and sTCs, we could evaluate each property's contribution to spiking differences between these cell types. This analysis suggested that the higher sensitivity of spiking in sTCs vs. MCs reflected both their larger monosynaptic OSN signal as well as their higher input resistance, while their smaller prolonged currents had a modest opposing effect. Taken together, our results indicate that both synaptic and intrinsic cellular features contribute to the production of parallel output channels in the olfactory bulb.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Long Non-coding RNA LINC00320 Inhibits Tumorigenicity of Glioma Cells and Angiogenesis Through Downregulation of NFKB1-Mediated AQP9</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.542552</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The inhibitory effect of long intergenic non-coding RNA 00320 (LINC00320) in glioma cell proliferation has been proposed in a recent study. However, the mechanisms by which LINC00320 regulate aquaporin 9 (AQP9) in glioma require further exploration. Hence, this study aims to investigate effects of LINC00320 on tumorigenicity of glioma cells and angiogenesis of microvascular endothelial cells (MVECs). Expression of LINC00320 and AQP9 in glioma tissues and cells was measured by reverse transcription–quantitative polymerase chain reaction and Western blot analysis. The relationship among LINC00320, nuclear factor κB subunit 1 (NFKB1) and AQP9 was examined by RNA immunoprecipitation, dual-luciferase reporter gene, and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays. The participation of LINC00320 and AQP9 in glioma cell proliferation and MVEC angiogenesis was analyzed using gain- and loss-of-function approaches. Finally, a nude mouse orthotopic xenograft model of glioma was established to investigate the effects of LINC00320 and AQP9 on glioma growth in vivo. LINC00320 was under-expressed and AQP9 was over-expressed in glioma tissues. Further mechanistic investigation showed that LINC00320 downregulated AQP9 by inhibiting the recruitment of NFKB1 to the promoter region of AQP9. LINC00320 overexpression or AQP9 silencing inhibited the proliferation of glioma cells and angiogenesis of MVECs. Also, upregulation of LINC00320 restrained tumor growth and angiogenesis in xenograft mice by downregulating AQP9. Taken together, LINC00320 acts as a tumor suppressor in glioma, thus presenting a novel therapeutic target.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.605317</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;This study aimed to investigate the effect of 12 weeks of dual-task training on cognitive status, physical performance, and brain oscillation of patients with Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Twenty-six AD patients were randomly assigned to two groups, the training group (TG) and control group (CG). TG executed progressive combined exercises with visual stimulation twice a week for 12 weeks. Training included muscle endurance, balance, flexibility, and aerobic exercises with eyes closed and opened. Brain oscillation on electroencephalography (EEG) and a series of physical, cognitive, and mental tests were taken before and post-intervention. There was a significant improvement after training protocol in cognitive function, particularly in short-term and working memory, attention, and executive function (p &amp;lt; 0.01). Besides, there were substantial improvements in depression status (GDS scale), aerobic fitness (6 min walking), flexibility (chair sit and reach) functional ability (chair stand, timed up and go test), strength (knee extensions, preacher biceps curl, handgrip) in TG compared to CG. These signs of progress were associated with a significant increase (p &amp;lt; 0.05) in the frequency of brain oscillation and a decrease in the theta/alpha ratio. In addition to physical performance, the regular combined training with visual stimulation improves brain health as indicated by improving cognitive function and reducing the theta/alpha ratio.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clinical Trial Registration: Iranian Registry of Clinical Trials (IRCT) https://www.irct.ir/, identifier IRCT20190504043468N1—August 5, 2020.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.588958</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Irisin is a PGC-1α-dependent myokine that causes increased energy expenditure by driving the development of white adipose tissue into brown fat-like tissue. Exercise can improve irisin levels and lead to its release into the blood. In ischemic stroke, neurons are always sensitive to energy supply; after a series of pathophysiological processes, reactive oxygen species that are detrimental to cell survival via mitochondrial dysfunction are generated in large quantities. As a protein associated with exercise, irisin can alleviate brain injury in the pathogenesis of ischemic stroke. It is thought that irisin can upregulate the levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), which protects nerve cells from injury during ischemic stroke. Furthermore, the release of irisin into the blood via exercise influences the mitochondrial dynamics crucial to maintaining the normal function of nerve cells. Consequently, we intended to summarize the known effects of irisin during ischemic stroke.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

&lt;p&gt;The mechanisms by which the brain undergoes neuroplasticity during sedentary versus active conditions are important in understanding how a sedentary lifestyle has become the leading cause of death due to modifiable risk factors. Neurons in the rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVLM) regulate ongoing sympathetic vasoconstriction and cardiac function under normal conditions, and their activity appears heightened in models of cardiovascular disease associated with sympathetic overactivity. The current study provides evidence of activity‐related neuroplasticity in the RVLM via increased glutamate levels and increased expression of NMDA receptors in the RVLM of sedentary compared to active rats. These mechanisms produce a complex framework by which RVLM neurons increase their influence on sympathoexcitation in sedentary compared to physically active conditions.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVLM) is a brain region involved in normal regulation of the cardiovascular system and heightened sympathoexcitatory states of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Among major risk factors for CVD, sedentary lifestyles contribute to higher mortality than other modifiable risk factors. Previous studies suggest excessive glutamatergic excitation of presympathetic neurons in the RVLM occurs in sedentary animals. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to examine neuroplasticity in the glutamatergic system in the RVLM of sedentary and physically active rats. We hypothesized that relative to active rats, sedentary rats would exhibit higher expression of glutamate NMDA receptor subunits (GluN), phosphoGluN1 and the excitatory scaffold protein PSD95, while achieving higher glutamate levels. Male Sprague‐Dawley rats (4 wks old) were divided into sedentary and active (running wheel) conditions for 10‐12 weeks. We used retrograde tracing/triple‐labeling techniques; western blotting; and magnetic resonance spectroscopy. We report in sedentary versus physically active rats: 1) fewer bulbospinal non‐C1 neurons positive for GluN1, 2) significantly higher expression of GluN1 and GluN2B but lower levels of phosphoGluN1 (pSer896) and PSD95 and 3) higher levels of glutamate in the RVLM. Higher GluN expression is consistent with enhanced sympathoexcitation in sedentary animals; however, a more complex neuroplasticity occurs within subregions of the ventrolateral medulla. Our results in rodents may also indicate that alterations in glutamatergic excitation of the RVLM contribute to the increased incidence of CVD in humans who lead sedentary lifestyles. Thus, there is a strong need to further pursue mechanisms of inactivity‐related neuroplasticity in the RVLM.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Predictors of long‐term outcome of subthalamic stimulation in Parkinson disease</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25994?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To identify preoperative predictive factors of long‐term motor outcome in a large cohort of consecutive Parkinson's disease (PD) patients with bilateral subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation (STN‐DBS).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All consecutive PD patients who underwent bilateral STN‐DBS at the Grenoble University Hospital (France) from 1993 to 2015 were evaluated before surgery, at 1 year (short‐term) and in the long‐term after surgery. All demographic variables, neuroimaging data and clinical characteristics available were collected. Preoperative predictors of long‐term motor outcome were investigated by performing survival and univariate/multivariate Cox regression analyses. Loss of motor benefit from stimulation in the long‐term was defined as a reduction lower than 25% of the Movement Disorder Society‐UPDRS (MDS‐UPDRS) part‐III scores compared to the baseline off‐medication scores. As secondary objective, potential predictors of short‐term motor outcome after STN‐DBS were assessed by performing univariate and multivariate linear regression analyses.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the long‐term analyses (mean follow‐up: 8.4 ± 6.26 years; median: 10 years, 1–17 range), 138 patients were included. Preoperative higher Frontal Score and off‐medication MDS‐UDPRS part‐III scores predicted a better long‐term motor response to stimulation whereas the presence of vascular changes on neuroimaging predicted a worse motor outcome. In 357 patients available with 1‐year follow‐up, preoperative levodopa response, tremor dominant phenotype, baseline Frontal Score and off‐medication MDS‐UPDRS part‐III scores predicted the short‐term motor outcome.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Frontal lobe dysfunction, disease severity in the off‐medication condition and the presence of vascular changes on neuroimaging represent the main preoperative clinical predictors of long‐term motor STN‐DBS effects.&lt;/p&gt;

The mechanisms underlying synapse loss have been extensively investigated using mouse models expressing genes with human familial Alzheimer's disease mutations. In this review, we summarize how multiphoton in vivo imaging has improved our understanding of synapse loss mechanisms associated with excessive amyloid in the living animal brain. We also discuss evidence obtained from these imaging studies for the role of cell-intrinsic calcium dyshomeostasis and cell-extrinsic activities of microglia, which are the immune cells of the brain, in mediating synapse loss.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Tuberculosis disease is a major global public health concern and the growing prevalence of drug-resistant &lt;i&gt;Mycobacterium tuberculosis&lt;/i&gt; is making disease control more difficult. However, the increasing application of whole-genome sequencing as a diagnostic tool is leading to the profiling of drug resistance to inform clinical practice and treatment decision making. Computational approaches for identifying established and novel resistance-conferring mutations in genomic data include genome-wide association study (GWAS) methodologies, tests for convergent evolution and machine learning techniques. These methods may be confounded by extensive co-occurrent resistance, where statistical models for a drug include unrelated mutations known to be causing resistance to other drugs. Here, we introduce a novel ‘cannibalistic’ elimination algorithm (“Hungry, Hungry SNPos”) that attempts to remove these co-occurrent resistant variants. Using an &lt;i&gt;M. tuberculosis&lt;/i&gt; genomic dataset for the virulent Beijing strain-type (n = 3,574) with phenotypic resistance data across five drugs (isoniazid, rifampicin, ethambutol, pyrazinamide, and streptomycin), we demonstrate that this new approach is considerably more robust than traditional methods and detects resistance-associated variants too rare to be likely picked up by correlation-based techniques like GWAS.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/okdPb6yDxS8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

In this work, we introduce new phenomenological neuronal models (&lt;i&gt;e&lt;/i&gt;LIF and mAdExp) that account for energy supply and demand in the cell as well as the inactivation of spike generation how these interact with subthreshold and spiking dynamics. Including these constraints, the new models reproduce a broad range of biologically-relevant behaviors that are identified to be crucial in many neurological disorders, but were not captured by commonly used phenomenological models. Because of their low dimensionality &lt;i&gt;e&lt;/i&gt;LIF and mAdExp open the possibility of future large-scale simulations for more realistic studies of brain circuits involved in neuronal disorders. The new models enable both more accurate modeling and the possibility to study energy-associated disorders over the whole time-course of disease progression instead of only comparing the initially healthy status with the final diseased state. These models, therefore, provide new theoretical and computational methods to assess the opportunities of early diagnostics and the potential of energy-centered approaches to improve therapies.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/vFKzK1Xrads&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Practical identifiability of Systems Biology models has received a lot of attention in recent scientific research. It addresses the crucial question for models’ predictability: how accurately can the models’ parameters be recovered from available experimental data. The methods based on profile likelihood are among the most reliable methods of practical identification. However, these methods are often computationally demanding or lead to inaccurate estimations of parameters’ confidence intervals. Development of methods, which can accurately produce parameters’ confidence intervals in reasonable computational time, is of utmost importance for Systems Biology and QSP modeling.
We propose an algorithm Confidence Intervals by Constraint Optimization (CICO) based on profile likelihood, designed to speed-up confidence intervals estimation and reduce computational cost. The numerical implementation of the algorithm includes settings to control the accuracy of confidence intervals estimates. The algorithm was tested on a number of Systems Biology models, including Taxol treatment model and STAT5 Dimerization model, discussed in the current article.

Simulations of tissue-specific effects of primary acute viral infections like COVID-19 are essential for understanding disease outcomes and optimizing therapies. Such simulations need to support continuous updating in response to rapid advances in understanding of infection mechanisms, and parallel development of components by multiple groups. We present an open-source platform for multiscale spatiotemporal simulation of an epithelial tissue, viral infection, cellular immune response and tissue damage, specifically designed to be modular and extensible to support continuous updating and parallel development. The base simulation of a simplified patch of epithelial tissue and immune response exhibits distinct patterns of infection dynamics from widespread infection, to recurrence, to clearance. Slower viral internalization and faster immune-cell recruitment slow infection and promote containment. Because antiviral drugs can have side effects and show reduced clinical effectiveness when given later during infection, we studied the effects on progression of treatment potency and time-of-first treatment after infection. In simulations, even a low potency therapy with a drug which reduces the replication rate of viral RNA greatly decreases the total tissue damage and virus burden when given near the beginning of infection. Many combinations of dosage and treatment time lead to stochastic outcomes, with some simulation replicas showing clearance or control (treatment success), while others show rapid infection of all epithelial cells (treatment failure). Thus, while a high potency therapy usually is less effective when given later, treatments at late times are occasionally effective. We illustrate how to extend the platform to model specific virus types (&lt;i&gt;e&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt;., hepatitis C) and add additional cellular mechanisms (tissue recovery and variable cell susceptibility to infection), using our software modules and publicly-available software repository.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/VHQEs_Hqk94&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Estimating individuals’ genetic and non-genetic effects underlying infectious disease transmission from temporal epidemic data</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/QjeuobbTQoc/article</link>

Individuals differ widely in their contribution to the spread of infection within and across populations. Three key epidemiological host traits affect infectious disease spread: susceptibility (propensity to acquire infection), infectivity (propensity to transmit infection to others) and recoverability (propensity to recover quickly). Interventions aiming to reduce disease spread may target improvement in any one of these traits, but the necessary statistical methods for obtaining risk estimates are lacking. In this paper we introduce a novel software tool called SIRE (standing for “Susceptibility, Infectivity and Recoverability Estimation”), which allows for the first time simultaneous estimation of the genetic effect of a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), as well as non-genetic influences on these three unobservable host traits. SIRE implements a flexible Bayesian algorithm which accommodates a wide range of disease surveillance data comprising any combination of recorded individual infection and/or recovery times, or disease diagnostic test results. Different genetic and non-genetic regulations and data scenarios (representing realistic recording schemes) were simulated to validate SIRE and to assess their impact on the precision, accuracy and bias of parameter estimates. This analysis revealed that with few exceptions, SIRE provides unbiased, accurate parameter estimates associated with all three host traits. For most scenarios, SNP effects associated with recoverability can be estimated with highest precision, followed by susceptibility. For infectivity, many epidemics with few individuals give substantially more statistical power to identify SNP effects than the reverse. Importantly, precise estimates of SNP and other effects could be obtained even in the case of incomplete, censored and relatively infrequent measurements of individuals’ infection or survival status, albeit requiring more individuals to yield equivalent precision. SIRE represents a new tool for analysing a wide range of experimental and field disease data with the aim of discovering and validating SNPs and other factors controlling infectious disease transmission.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/QjeuobbTQoc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Biology: Prediction error signaling explains neuronal mismatch responses in the medial prefrontal cortex</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~3/rfwvinIx228/article</link>

The mismatch negativity (MMN) is a key biomarker of automatic deviance detection thought to emerge from 2 cortical sources. First, the auditory cortex (AC) encodes spectral regularities and reports frequency-specific deviances. Then, more abstract representations in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) allow to detect contextual changes of potential behavioral relevance. However, the precise location and time asynchronies between neuronal correlates underlying this frontotemporal network remain unclear and elusive. Our study presented auditory oddball paradigms along with “no-repetition” controls to record mismatch responses in neuronal spiking activity and local field potentials at the rat medial PFC. Whereas mismatch responses in the auditory system are mainly induced by stimulus-dependent effects, we found that auditory responsiveness in the PFC was driven by unpredictability, yielding context-dependent, comparatively delayed, more robust and longer-lasting mismatch responses mostly comprised of prediction error signaling activity. This characteristically different composition discarded that mismatch responses in the PFC could be simply inherited or amplified downstream from the auditory system. Conversely, it is more plausible for the PFC to exert top-down influences on the AC, since the PFC exhibited flexible and potent predictive processing, capable of suppressing redundant input more efficiently than the AC. Remarkably, the time course of the mismatch responses we observed in the spiking activity and local field potentials of the AC and the PFC combined coincided with the time course of the large-scale MMN-like signals reported in the rat brain, thereby linking the microscopic, mesoscopic, and macroscopic levels of automatic deviance detection.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/rfwvinIx228&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

SARS Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in late 2019, leading to the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic that continues to cause significant global mortality in human populations. Given its sequence similarity to SARS-CoV, as well as related coronaviruses circulating in bats, SARS-CoV-2 is thought to have originated in Chiroptera species in China. However, whether the virus spread directly to humans or through an intermediate host is currently unclear, as is the potential for this virus to infect companion animals, livestock, and wildlife that could act as viral reservoirs. Using a combination of surrogate entry assays and live virus, we demonstrate that, in addition to human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the Spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 has a broad host tropism for mammalian ACE2 receptors, despite divergence in the amino acids at the Spike receptor binding site on these proteins. Of the 22 different hosts we investigated, ACE2 proteins from dog, cat, and cattle were the most permissive to SARS-CoV-2, while bat and bird ACE2 proteins were the least efficiently used receptors. The absence of a significant tropism for any of the 3 genetically distinct bat ACE2 proteins we examined indicates that SARS-CoV-2 receptor usage likely shifted during zoonotic transmission from bats into people, possibly in an intermediate reservoir. Comparison of SARS-CoV-2 receptor usage to the related coronaviruses SARS-CoV and RaTG13 identified distinct tropisms, with the 2 human viruses being more closely aligned. Finally, using bioinformatics, structural data, and targeted mutagenesis, we identified amino acid residues within the Spike–ACE2 interface, which may have played a pivotal role in the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in humans. The apparently broad tropism of SARS-CoV-2 at the point of viral entry confirms the potential risk of infection to a wide range of companion animals, livestock, and wildlife.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/m8cpZ3EpcOg&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Coevolution between transposable elements (TEs) and their hosts can be antagonistic, where TEs evolve to avoid silencing and the host responds by reestablishing TE suppression, or mutualistic, where TEs are co-opted to benefit their host. The &lt;i&gt;TART-A&lt;/i&gt; TE functions as an important component of &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; telomeres but has also reportedly inserted into the &lt;i&gt;Drosophila melanogaster&lt;/i&gt; nuclear export factor gene &lt;i&gt;nxf2&lt;/i&gt;. We find that, rather than inserting into &lt;i&gt;nxf2&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;TART-A&lt;/i&gt; has actually captured a portion of &lt;i&gt;nxf2&lt;/i&gt; sequence. We show that &lt;i&gt;TART-A&lt;/i&gt; produces abundant Piwi-interacting small RNAs (piRNAs), some of which are antisense to the &lt;i&gt;nxf2&lt;/i&gt; transcript, and that the &lt;i&gt;TART&lt;/i&gt;-like region of &lt;i&gt;nxf2&lt;/i&gt; is evolving rapidly. Furthermore, in &lt;i&gt;D&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;melanogaster&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;TART-A&lt;/i&gt; is present at higher copy numbers, and &lt;i&gt;nxf2&lt;/i&gt; shows reduced expression, compared to the closely related species &lt;i&gt;Drosophila simulans&lt;/i&gt;. We propose that capturing &lt;i&gt;nxf2&lt;/i&gt; sequence allowed &lt;i&gt;TART-A&lt;/i&gt; to target the &lt;i&gt;nxf2&lt;/i&gt; gene for piRNA-mediated repression and that these 2 elements are engaged in antagonistic coevolution despite the fact that &lt;i&gt;TART-A&lt;/i&gt; is serving a critical role for its host genome.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/VY2O9I8cFrM&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Smallpox is unique among infectious diseases in the degree to which it devastated human populations, its long history of control interventions, and the fact that it has been successfully eradicated. Mortality from smallpox in London, England was carefully documented, weekly, for nearly 300 years, providing a rare and valuable source for the study of ecology and evolution of infectious disease. We describe and analyze smallpox mortality in London from 1664 to 1930. We digitized the weekly records published in the London Bills of Mortality (LBoM) and the Registrar General’s Weekly Returns (RGWRs). We annotated the resulting time series with a sequence of historical events that might have influenced smallpox dynamics in London. We present a spectral analysis that reveals how periodicities in reported smallpox mortality changed over decades and centuries; many of these changes in epidemic patterns are correlated with changes in control interventions and public health policies. We also examine how the seasonality of reported smallpox mortality changed from the 17th to 20th centuries in London.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/jF09DOqV7BQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Multicenter Validation of the max‐ICH Score in Intracerebral Hemorrhage</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25969?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Outcome prognostication unbiased by early care limitations (ECL) is essential for guiding treatment in patients presenting with intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). The aim of this study was to determine whether the max‐ICH (maximally treated ICH) Score provides improved and clinically useful prognostic estimation of functional long‐term outcomes after ICH.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This multicenter validation study compared the prognostication of the max‐ICH Score versus the ICH Score regarding diagnostic accuracy (discrimination and calibration) and clinical utility using decision curve analysis. We performed a joint investigation of individual participant data of consecutive spontaneous ICH patients (n = 4,677) from 2 retrospective German‐wide studies (RETRACE I + II; anticoagulation‐associated ICH only) conducted at 22 participating centers, one German prospective single‐center study (UKER‐ICH; nonanticoagulation‐associated ICH only), and 1 US‐based prospective longitudinal single‐center study (MGH; both anticoagulation‐ and nonanticoagulation‐associated ICH), treated between January 2006 and December 2015.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of 4,677 included ICH patients, 1,017 (21.7%) were affected by ECL (German cohort: 15.6% [440 of 2,377]; MGH: 31.0% [577 of 1,283]). Validation of long‐term functional outcome prognostication by the max‐ICH Score provided good and superior discrimination in patients without ECL compared with the ICH Score (area under the receiver operating curve [AUROC], German cohort: 0.81 [0.78–0.83] vs 0.74 [0.72–0.77], &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.01; MGH: 0.85 [0.81–0.89] vs 0.78 [0.74–0.82], &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.01), and for the entire cohort (AUROC, German cohort: 0.84 [0.82–0.86] vs 0.80 [0.77–0.82], &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.01; MGH: 0.83 [0.81–0.85] vs 0.77 [0.75–0.79], &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.01). Both scores showed no evidence of poor calibration. The clinical utility investigated by decision curve analysis showed, at high threshold probabilities (0.8, aiming to avoid false‐positive poor outcome attribution), that the max‐ICH Score provided a clinical net benefit compared with the ICH Score (14.1 vs 2.1 net predicted poor outcomes per 100 patients).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The max‐ICH Score provides valid and improved prognostication of functional outcome after ICH. The associated clinical net benefit in minimizing false poor outcome attribution might potentially prevent unwarranted care limitations in patients with ICH.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Probabilistic Mapping of Deep Brain Stimulation: Insights from 15 Years of Therapy</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25975?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Deep brain stimulation (DBS) depends on precise delivery of electrical current to target tissues. However, the specific brain structures responsible for best outcome are still debated. We applied probabilistic stimulation mapping to a retrospective, multidisorder DBS dataset assembled over 15 years at our institution (n&lt;sub&gt;total&lt;/sub&gt; = 482 patients; n&lt;sub&gt;Parkinson disease&lt;/sub&gt; = 303; n&lt;sub&gt;dystonia&lt;/sub&gt; = 64; n&lt;sub&gt;tremor&lt;/sub&gt; = 39; n&lt;sub&gt;treatment‐resistant depression/anorexia nervosa&lt;/sub&gt; = 76) to identify the neuroanatomical substrates of optimal clinical response. Using high‐resolution structural magnetic resonance imaging and activation volume modeling, probabilistic stimulation maps (PSMs) that delineated areas of above‐mean and below‐mean response for each patient cohort were generated and defined in terms of their relationships with surrounding anatomical structures. Our results show that overlap between PSMs and individual patients' activation volumes can serve as a guide to predict clinical outcomes, but that this is not the sole determinant of response. In the future, individualized models that incorporate advancements in mapping techniques with patient‐specific clinical variables will likely contribute to the optimization of DBS target selection and improved outcomes for patients.

	<title>Frontiers in Synaptic Neuroscience: Clmp Regulates AMPA and Kainate Receptor Responses in the Neonatal Hippocampal CA3 and Kainate Seizure Susceptibility in Mice</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsyn.2020.567075</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Synaptic adhesion molecules regulate synapse development through trans-synaptic adhesion and assembly of diverse synaptic proteins. Many synaptic adhesion molecules positively regulate synapse development; some, however, exert negative regulation, although such cases are relatively rare. In addition, synaptic adhesion molecules regulate the amplitude of post-synaptic receptor responses, but whether adhesion molecules can regulate the kinetic properties of post-synaptic receptors remains unclear. Here we report that Clmp, a homophilic adhesion molecule of the Ig domain superfamily that is abundantly expressed in the brain, reaches peak expression at a neonatal stage (week 1) and associates with subunits of AMPA receptors (AMPARs) and kainate receptors (KARs). Clmp deletion in mice increased the frequency and amplitude of AMPAR-mediated miniature excitatory post-synaptic currents (mEPSCs) and the frequency, amplitude, and decay time constant of KAR-mediated mEPSCs in hippocampal CA3 neurons. Clmp deletion had minimal impacts on evoked excitatory synaptic currents at mossy fiber-CA3 synapses but increased extrasynaptic KAR, but not AMPAR, currents, suggesting that Clmp distinctly inhibits AMPAR and KAR responses. Behaviorally, Clmp deletion enhanced novel object recognition and susceptibility to kainate-induced seizures, without affecting contextual or auditory cued fear conditioning or pattern completion-based contextual fear conditioning. These results suggest that Clmp negatively regulates hippocampal excitatory synapse development and AMPAR and KAR responses in the neonatal hippocampal CA3 as well as object recognition and kainate seizure susceptibility in mice.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Topological Abnormalities of Functional Brain Network in Early-Stage Parkinson’s Disease Patients With Mild Cognitive Impairment</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.616872</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Recent studies have demonstrated structural and functional alterations in Parkinson’s disease (PD) with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). However, the topological patterns of functional brain networks in newly diagnosed PD patients with MCI are unclear so far. In this study, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and graph theory approaches to explore the functional brain network in 45 PD patients with MCI (PD-MCI), 22 PD patients without MCI (PD-nMCI), and 18 healthy controls (HC). We found that the PD-MCI, PD-nMCI, and HC groups exhibited a small-world architecture in the functional brain network. However, early-stage PD-MCI patients had decreased clustering coefficient, increased characteristic path length, and changed nodal centrality in the default mode network (DMN), control network (CN), somatomotor network (SMN), and visual network (VN), which might contribute to factors for MCI symptoms in PD patients. Our results demonstrated that PD-MCI patients were associated with disrupted topological organization in the functional network, thus providing a topological network insight into the role of information exchange in the underlying development of MCI symptoms in PD patients.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Objective&lt;p&gt;The aim of this study was to evaluate brain white matter (WM) fibers connectivity damage in stroke and traumatic brain injury (TBI) subjects by direct electrophysiological imaging (DELPHI) that analyzes transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS)-evoked potentials (TEPs).&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;The study included 123 participants, out of which 53 subjects with WM-related pathologies (39 stroke, 14 TBI) and 70 healthy age-related controls.

A multidimensional approach was able to classify healthy from unhealthy with a balanced accuracy of 0.81 ± 0.02 and area under the curve (AUC) of 0.88 ± 0.01. Moreover, a multivariant regression model of DELPHI output measures achieved prediction of WM microstructure changes measured by FA with the highest correlations observed for fibers proximal to the stimulation area, such as frontal corpus callosum (r = 0.7 ± 0.02), anterior internal capsule (r = 0.7 ± 0.02), and fronto-occipital fasciculus (r = 0.65 ± 0.03).&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;These results indicate that features of TMS-evoked response are correlated to WM microstructure changes observed in pathological conditions, such as stroke and TBI, and that a multidimensional approach combining these features in supervised learning methods serves as a strong indicator for abnormalities and changes in WM integrity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Neuroprotective and Neurorestorative Effects of Holothuria scabra Extract in the MPTP/MPP+-Induced Mouse and Cellular Models of Parkinson’s Disease</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.575459</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Extracts from Holothuria scabra (HS) have been shown to possess anti-inflammation, anti-oxidant and anti-cancer activities. More recently, it was shown to have neuroprotective potential in Caenorhabditis elegans PD model. Here, we assessed whether HS has neuroprotective and neurorestorative effects on dopaminergic neurons in both mouse and cellular models of PD. We found that both pre-treatment and post-treatment with HS improved motor deficits in PD mouse model induced with 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) as determined by grid walk test. This was likely mediated by HS protective and restorative effects on maintaining the numbers of dopaminergic neurons and fibers in both substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) and striatum. In a cellular model of PD, HS significantly attenuated 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;)-induced apoptosis of DAergic-like neurons differentiated from SH-SY5Y cells by enhancing the expression of Bcl-2, suppressing the expression of cleaved Caspase 3 and preventing depolarization of mitochondrial membrane. In addition, HS could stimulate the expression of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and suppressed the formation of α-synuclein protein. Taken together, our in vivo and in vitro findings suggested that HS is an attractive candidate for the neuroprotection rather than neurorestoration in PD.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: A Feature Tensor-Based Epileptic Detection Model Based on Improved Edge Removal Approach for Directed Brain Networks</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.557095</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Electroencephalograph (EEG) plays a significant role in the diagnostics process of epilepsy, but the detection rate is unsatisfactory when the length of interictal EEG signals is relatively short. Although the deliberate attacking theories for undirected brain network based on node removal method can extract potential network features, the node removal method fails to sufficiently consider the directionality of brain electrical activities. To solve the problems above, this study proposes a feature tensor-based epileptic detection method of directed brain networks. First, a directed functional brain network is constructed by calculating the transfer entropy of EEG signals between different electrodes. Second, the edge removal method is used to imitate the disruptions of brain connectivity, which may be related to the disorder of brain diseases, to obtain a sequence of residual networks. After that, topological features of these residual networks are extracted based on graph theory for constructing a five-way feature tensor. To exploit the inherent interactions among multiple modes of the feature tensor, this study uses the Tucker decomposition method to get a core tensor which is finally reshaped into a vector and input into the support vectors machine (SVM) classifier. Experiment results suggest that the proposed method has better epileptic screening performance for short-term interictal EEG data.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.549772</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;As the global population ages, the prevalence of Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common form of dementia, is also increasing. At present, there are no widely recognized drugs able to ameliorate the cognitive dysfunction caused by AD. The failure of several promising clinical trials in recent years has highlighted the urgent need for novel strategies to both prevent and treat AD. Notably, a growing body of literature supports the efficacy of acupuncture for AD. In this review, we summarize the previously reported mechanisms of acupuncture's beneficial effects in AD, including the ability of acupuncture to modulate Aβ metabolism, tau phosphorylation, neurotransmitters, neurogenesis, synapse and neuron function, autophagy, neuronal apoptosis, neuroinflammation, cerebral glucose metabolism, and brain responses. Taken together, these findings suggest that acupuncture provides therapeutic effects for AD.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Combining Gamma With Alpha and Beta Power Modulation for Enhanced Cortical Mapping in Patients With Focal Epilepsy</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.555054</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;About one third of patients with epilepsy have seizures refractory to the medical treatment. Electrical stimulation mapping (ESM) is the gold standard for the identification of “eloquent” areas prior to resection of epileptogenic tissue. However, it is time-consuming and may cause undesired side effects. Broadband gamma activity (55–200 Hz) recorded with extraoperative electrocorticography (ECoG) during cognitive tasks may be an alternative to ESM but until now has not proven of definitive clinical value. Considering their role in cognition, the alpha (8–12 Hz) and beta (15–25 Hz) bands could further improve the identification of eloquent cortex. We compared gamma, alpha and beta activity, and their combinations for the identification of eloquent cortical areas defined by ESM. Ten patients with intractable focal epilepsy (age: 35.9 ± 9.1 years, range: 22–48, 8 females, 9 right handed) participated in a delayed-match-to-sample task, where syllable sounds were compared to visually presented letters. We used a generalized linear model (GLM) approach to find the optimal weighting of each band for predicting ESM-defined categories and estimated the diagnostic ability by calculating the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. Gamma activity increased more in eloquent than in non-eloquent areas, whereas alpha and beta power decreased more in eloquent areas. Diagnostic ability of each band was close to 0.7 for all bands but depended on multiple factors including the time period of the cognitive task, the location of the electrodes and the patient’s degree of attention to the stimulus. We show that diagnostic ability can be increased by 3–5% by combining gamma and alpha and by 7.5–11% when gamma and beta were combined. We then show how ECoG power modulation from cognitive testing can be used to map the probability of eloquence in individual patients and how this probability map can be used in clinical settings to optimize ESM planning. We conclude that the combination of gamma and beta power modulation during cognitive testing can contribute to the identification of eloquent areas prior to ESM in patients with refractory focal epilepsy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience: Biosignal-Based Attention Monitoring to Support Nuclear Operator Safety-Relevant Tasks</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2020.596531</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In the main control room (MCR) of a nuclear power plant (NPP), the quality of an operator's performance can depend on their level of attention to the task. Insufficient operator attention accounted for more than 26% of the total causes of human errors and is the highest category for errors. It is therefore necessary to check whether operators are sufficiently attentive either as supervisors or peers during reactor operation. Recently, digital control technologies have been introduced to the operating environment of an NPP MCR. These upgrades are expected to enhance plant and operator performance. At the same time, because personal computers are used in the advanced MCR, the operators perform more cognitive works than physical work. However, operators may not consciously check fellow operators' attention in this environment indicating potentially higher importance of the role of operator attention. Therefore, remote measurement of an operator's attention in real time would be a useful tool, providing feedback to supervisors. The objective of this study is to investigate the development of quantitative indicators that can identify an operator's attention, to diagnose or detect a lack of operator attention thus preventing potential human errors in advanced MCRs. To establish a robust baseline of operator attention, this study used two of the widely used biosignals: electroencephalography (EEG) and eye movement. We designed an experiment to collect EEG and eye movements of the subjects who were monitoring and diagnosing nuclear operator safety-relevant tasks. There was a statistically significant difference between biosignals with and without appropriate attention. Furthermore, an average classification accuracy of about 90% was obtained by the k-nearest neighbors and support vector machine classifiers with a few EEG and eye movements features. Potential applications of EEG and eye movement measures in monitoring and diagnosis tasks in an NPP MCR are also discussed.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience: A Connectome-Based, Corticothalamic Model of State- and Stimulation-Dependent Modulation of Rhythmic Neural Activity and Connectivity</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2020.575143</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Rhythmic activity in the brain fluctuates with behaviour and cognitive state, through a combination of coexisting and interacting frequencies. At large spatial scales such as those studied in human M/EEG, measured oscillatory dynamics are believed to arise primarily from a combination of cortical (intracolumnar) and corticothalamic rhythmogenic mechanisms. Whilst considerable progress has been made in characterizing these two types of neural circuit separately, relatively little work has been done that attempts to unify them into a single consistent picture. This is the aim of the present paper. We present and examine a whole-brain, connectome-based neural mass model with detailed long-range cortico-cortical connectivity and strong, recurrent corticothalamic circuitry. This system reproduces a variety of known features of human M/EEG recordings, including spectral peaks at canonical frequencies, and functional connectivity structure that is shaped by the underlying anatomical connectivity. Importantly, our model is able to capture state- (e.g., idling/active) dependent fluctuations in oscillatory activity and the coexistence of multiple oscillatory phenomena, as well as frequency-specific modulation of functional connectivity. We find that increasing the level of sensory drive to the thalamus triggers a suppression of the dominant low frequency rhythms generated by corticothalamic loops, and subsequent disinhibition of higher frequency endogenous rhythmic behaviour of intracolumnar microcircuits. These combine to yield simultaneous decreases in lower frequency and increases in higher frequency components of the M/EEG power spectrum during states of high sensory or cognitive drive. Building on this, we also explored the effect of pulsatile brain stimulation on ongoing oscillatory activity, and evaluated the impact of coexistent frequencies and state-dependent fluctuations on the response of cortical networks. Our results provide new insight into the role played by cortical and corticothalamic circuits in shaping intrinsic brain rhythms, and suggest new directions for brain stimulation therapies aimed at state-and frequency-specific control of oscillatory brain activity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neural Circuits: A Diversity of Intrinsic Timescales Underlie Neural Computations</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncir.2020.615626</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Neural processing occurs across a range of temporal scales. To facilitate this, the brain uses fast-changing representations reflecting momentary sensory input alongside more temporally extended representations, which integrate across both short and long temporal windows. The temporal flexibility of these representations allows animals to behave adaptively. Short temporal windows facilitate adaptive responding in dynamic environments, while longer temporal windows promote the gradual integration of information across time. In the cognitive and motor domains, the brain sets overarching goals to be achieved within a long temporal window, which must be broken down into sequences of actions and precise movement control processed across much shorter temporal windows. Previous human neuroimaging studies and large-scale artificial network models have ascribed different processing timescales to different cortical regions, linking this to each region’s position in an anatomical hierarchy determined by patterns of inter-regional connectivity. However, even within cortical regions, there is variability in responses when studied with single-neuron electrophysiology. Here, we review a series of recent electrophysiology experiments that demonstrate the heterogeneity of temporal receptive fields at the level of single neurons within a cortical region. This heterogeneity appears functionally relevant for the computations that neurons perform during decision-making and working memory. We consider anatomical and biophysical mechanisms that may give rise to a heterogeneity of timescales, including recurrent connectivity, cortical layer distribution, and neurotransmitter receptor expression. Finally, we reflect on the computational relevance of each brain region possessing a heterogeneity of neuronal timescales. We argue that this architecture is of particular importance for sensory, motor, and cognitive computations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neural Circuits: Dynamic Interhemispheric Desynchronization in Marmosets and Humans With Disorders of the Corpus Callosum</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncir.2020.612595</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The corpus callosum, the principal structural avenue for interhemispheric neuronal communication, controls the brain’s lateralization. Developmental malformations of the corpus callosum (CCD) can lead to learning and intellectual disabilities. Currently, there is no clear explanation for these symptoms. Here, we used resting-state functional MRI (rsfMRI) to evaluate the dynamic resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) in both the cingulate cortex (CG) and the sensory areas (S1, S2, A1) in three marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) with spontaneous CCD. We also performed rsfMRI in 10 CCD human subjects (six hypoplasic and four agenesic). We observed no differences in the strength of rsFC between homotopic CG and sensory areas in both species when comparing them to healthy controls. However, in CCD marmosets, we found lower strength of quasi-periodic patterns (QPP) correlation in the posterior interhemispheric sensory areas. We also found a significant lag of interhemispheric communication in the medial CG, suggesting asynchrony between the two hemispheres. Correspondingly, in human subjects, we found that the CG of acallosal subjects had a higher QPP correlation than controls. In comparison, hypoplasic subjects had a lower QPP correlation and a delay of 1.6 s in the sensory regions. These results show that CCD affects the interhemispheric synchrony of both CG and sensory areas and that, in both species, its impact on cortical communication varies along the CC development gradient. Our study shines a light on how CCD misconnects homotopic regions and opens a line of research to explain the causes of the symptoms exhibited by CCD patients and how to mitigate them.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neural Circuits: Recognition of Cognitive Impairment in Adult Moyamoya Disease: A Classifier Based on High-Order Resting-State Functional Connectivity Network</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncir.2020.603208</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Objective: Vascular cognitive impairment (VCI) is a common complication in adult patients with moyamoya disease (MMD), and is reversible by surgical revascularization in its early stage of mild VCI. However, accurate diagnosis of mild VCI is difficult based on neuropsychological examination alone. This study proposed a method of dynamic resting-state functional connectivity (FC) network to recognize global cognitive impairment in MMD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: For MMD, 36 patients with VCI and 43 patients with intact cognition (Non-VCI) were included, as well as 26 normal controls (NCs). Using resting-state fMRI, dynamic low-order FC networks were first constructed with multiple brain regions which were generated through a sliding window approach and correlated in temporal dimension. In order to obtain more information of network interactions along the time, high-order FC networks were established by calculating correlations among each pair of brain regions. Afterwards, a sparse representation-based classifier was constructed to recognize MMD (experiment 1) and its cognitive impairment (experiment 2) with features extracted from both low- and high-order FC networks. Finally, the ten-fold cross-validation strategy was proposed to train and validate the performance of the classifier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: The three groups did not differ significantly in demographic features (p &amp;gt; 0.05), while the VCI group exhibited the lowest MMSE scores (p = 0.001). The Non-VCI and NCs groups did not differ significantly in MMSE scores (p = 0.054). As for the classification between MMD and NCs, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of the classifier reached 90.70, 88.57, 93.67, and 73.08%, respectively. While for the classification between VCI and Non-VCI, the AUC, accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of the classifier reached 91.02, 84.81, 80.56, and 88.37%, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: This study not only develops a promising classifier to recognize VCI in adult MMD in its early stage, but also implies the significance of time-varying properties in dynamic FC networks.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Organotypic Brain Slice Culture Microglia Exhibit Molecular Similarity to Acutely-Isolated Adult Microglia and Provide a Platform to Study Neuroinflammation</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.592005</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Microglia are central nervous system (CNS) resident immune cells that have been implicated in neuroinflammatory pathogenesis of a variety of neurological conditions. Their manifold context-dependent contributions to neuroinflammation are only beginning to be elucidated, which can be attributed in part to the challenges of studying microglia in vivo and the lack of tractable in vitro systems to study microglia function. Organotypic brain slice cultures offer a tissue-relevant context that enables the study of CNS resident cells and the analysis of brain slice microglial phenotypes has provided important insights, in particular into neuroprotective functions. Here we use RNA sequencing, direct digital quantification of gene expression with nCounter® technology and targeted analysis of individual microglial signature genes, to characterize brain slice microglia relative to acutely-isolated counterparts and 2-dimensional (2D) primary microglia cultures, a widely used in vitro surrogate. Analysis using single cell and population-based methods found brain slice microglia exhibited better preservation of canonical microglia markers and overall gene expression with stronger fidelity to acutely-isolated adult microglia, relative to in vitro cells. We characterized the dynamic phenotypic changes of brain slice microglia over time, after plating in culture. Mechanical damage associated with slice preparation prompted an initial period of inflammation, which resolved over time. Based on flow cytometry and gene expression profiling we identified the 2-week timepoint as optimal for investigation of microglia responses to exogenously-applied stimuli as exemplified by treatment-induced neuroinflammatory changes observed in microglia following LPS, TNF and GM-CSF addition to the culture medium. Altogether these findings indicate that brain slice cultures provide an experimental system superior to in vitro culture of microglia as a surrogate to investigate microglia functions, and the impact of soluble factors and cellular context on their physiology.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.587747</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;This study aimed to explore the molecular regulatory network among microRNA-125b (miR-125b), forkhead box Q1 (FOXQ1), prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2 (PTGS2), and cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (CDK5), as well as their effects on cell apoptosis, neurite outgrowth, and inflammation in Alzheimer disease (AD). Rat embryo cerebral cortex neurons and nerve growth factor–stimulated PC12 cells were insulted by Aβ&lt;sub&gt;1−42&lt;/sub&gt; to construct two AD cellular models. Negative control (NC) inhibitor, miR-125b inhibitor, NC siRNA, FOXQ1 siRNA, PTGS2 siRNA, and CDK5 siRNA were transferred into the two AD cellular models alone or combined. Then, cell apoptosis, neurite outgrowth, proinflammatory cytokines, miR-125b, FOXQ1, PTGS2, and CDK5 expressions were detected. MiR-125b inhibition facilitated neurite outgrowth but suppressed cell apoptosis and proinflammatory cytokines (tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin 1β, and interleukin 6); meanwhile, it upregulated FOXQ1 but downregulated PTGS2 and CDK5. Furthermore, FOXQ1 inhibition promoted cell apoptosis and proinflammatory cytokines but repressed neurite outgrowth; PTGS2 inhibition achieved the opposite effects; CDK5 inhibition attenuated cell apoptosis, whereas it less affected neurite outgrowth and inflammation. Notably, FOXQ1 inhibition attenuated, whereas PTGS2 inhibition elevated the effect of miR-125b inhibition on regulating neurite outgrowth, cell apoptosis, and proinflammatory cytokines. As for CDK5 inhibition, it enhanced the effect of miR-125b inhibition on regulating cell apoptosis, but less impacted the neurite outgrowth and proinflammatory cytokines. Additionally, PTGS2 inhibition and CDK5 inhibition both reversed the effect of FOXQ1 inhibition on regulating cell apoptosis, neurite outgrowth, and proinflammatory cytokines. In conclusion, targeting miR-125b alleviates AD progression via blocking PTGS2 and CDK5 in a FOXQ1-dependent way.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Osteoporosis and neurodegenerative diseases are two kinds of common disorders of the elderly, which often co-occur. Previous studies have shown the skeletal and central nervous systems are closely related to pathophysiology. As the main structural scaffold of the body, the bone is also a reservoir for stem cells, a primary lymphoid organ, and an important endocrine organ. It can interact with the brain through various bone-derived cells, mostly the mesenchymal and hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). The bone marrow is also a place for generating immune cells, which could greatly influence brain functions. Finally, the proteins secreted by bones (osteokines) also play important roles in the growth and function of the brain. This article reviews the latest research studying the impact of bone-derived cells, bone-controlled immune system, and bone-secreted proteins on the brain, and evaluates how these factors are implicated in the progress of neurodegenerative diseases and their potential use in the diagnosis and treatment of these diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.604246</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Background: Several vascular risk factors, including hypertension, diabetes, body mass index, and smoking status are found to be associated with cognitive decline and the risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD). We aimed to investigate whether an aggregation of vascular risk factors modulates the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF) in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Forty-three MCI patients and twenty-nine healthy controls (HCs) underwent resting-state functional MRI scans, and spontaneous brain activity was measured by the ALFF technique. The vascular risk profile was represented with the Framingham Heart Study general cardiovascular disease (FHS-CVD) risk score, and each group was further divided into high and low risk subgroups. Two-way ANOVA was performed to explore the main effects of diagnosis and vascular risk and their interaction on ALFF.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: The main effect of diagnosis on ALFF was found in left middle temporal gyrus (LMTG) and left superior parietal gyrus (LSPG), and the main effect of risk on ALFF was detected in left fusiform gyrus (LFFG), left precuneus (LPCUN), and left cerebellum posterior lobe (LCPL). Patients with MCI exhibited increased ALFF in the LMTG and LSPG than HCs, and participants with high vascular risk showed increased ALFF in the LFFG and LCPL, while decreased ALFF in the LPCUN. An interaction between diagnosis (MCI vs. HC) and FHS-CVD risk (high vs. low) regarding ALFF was observed in the left hippocampus (LHIP). HCs with high vascular risk showed significantly increased ALFF in the LHIP than those with low vascular risk, while MCI patients with high vascular risk showed decreased ALFF in the LHIP than HCs with high vascular risk. Interestingly, the mean ALFF of LHIP positively correlated with word recall test in HCs with high vascular risk (rho = 0.630, P = 0.016), while negatively correlated with the same test in MCI patients with high vascular risk (rho = −0.607, P = 0.001).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: This study provides preliminary evidence highlighting that the aggregation of vascular risk factors modulates the spontaneous brain activity in MCI patients, and this may serve as a potential imaging mechanism underlying vascular contribution to AD.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Up-to-date estimates of AD and PD prevalence have not been provided.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Studies that reported the prevalence of AD and PD in China were identified via a systematic database search from 1985 to 2018. Meta-analysis, local polynomial regression and autoregressive integrated moving average model were used for analyses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: A total of 99 studies were included in the study with populations of 385,312 and 227,228, respectively for AD and PD. The overall prevalence of AD and PD following age standardization was 3.20% [95% confidence interval (CI) = 3.17–3.23] and 1.06% (95% CI = 1.02–1.10), respectively in individuals over 60 years old. The rates increased drastically for every 10-years increment of age. The yearly prevalence of AD was predicted to increase from 3.81 to 6.17% in the next 5 years. Significant differences were observed between genders [male to female odds ratio (OR) for AD = 0.57, 95% CI = 0.51–0.64; OR for PD = 1.25, 95% CI = 1.06–1.46], and between education levels (Illiterate to non-illiterate OR for AD = 2.99, 95% CI = 2.38–3.75), but not between urban and rural settings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: Our results provide an updated insight into the epidemiology of AD and PD in China and their associated rates and ratios. The findings may facilitate China policy makers and health professionals mitigate the related health issues.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Face Recognition Deficits in a Patient With Alzheimer's Disease: Amnesia or Agnosia? The Importance of Electrophysiological Markers for Differential Diagnosis</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.580609</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Face recognition deficits are frequently reported in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and often attributed to memory impairment. However, it has been hypothesized that failure in identifying familiar people could also be due to deficits in higher-level perceptual processes, since there is evidence showing a reduced inversion effect for faces but not for cars in AD. To address the involvement of these higher processes, we investigated event-related potential (ERP) neural correlates of faces in a patient with AD showing a face recognition deficit. Eight healthy participants were tested as a control group. Participants performed different tasks following the stimulus presentation. In experiment 1, they should indicate whether the stimulus was either a face or a house or a scrambled image. In experiments 2 and 3, they should discriminate between upright and inverted faces (in experiment 2, stimuli were faces with neutral or fearful expressions, while in experiment 3, stimuli were famous or unfamiliar faces). Electrophysiological results reveal that the typical face-specific modulation of the N170 component, which is thought to reflect the structural encoding of faces, was not present in patient MCG, despite being affected by the emotional content of the face implicitly processed by MCG. Conversely, the N400 component, which is thought to reflect the recruitment of the memory trace of the face identity, was found to be implicitly modulated in MCG. These results may identify a possible role for gnosic processes in face recognition deficits in AD and suggest the importance of adopting an integrated approach to the AD diagnosis while considering electrophysiological markers.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.559603</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Objective: The study aims to detect the potential relationship between iron deposition and the function of the glymphatic system in the normal aging brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: We recruited 213 healthy participants. We evaluated the function of the glymphatic system using the index for diffusivity along the perivascular space (ALPS-index), assessed iron deposition on quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM), and analyzed their relationship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: The mean age of participants was 60.1 ± 7.3, and 107 (50.2%) were female. The mean ALPS-index was 1.4 ± 0.2. The QSM values of the caudate nucleus, putamen, globus pallidus, thalamus, red nucleus, substantia nigra, and dentate nucleus were all related to the ALPS-index (all P &amp;lt; 0.001).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: The main finding of the current study is that the regional brain iron deposition was related to the function of the glymphatic system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Advances in knowledge: We first evaluated the relationship between deposition of brain iron and the dysfunction of the glymphatic system.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Within the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN), estrogen receptor (ER) β and other gonadal hormone receptors play a role in central cardiovascular processes. However, the influence of sex and age on the cellular and subcellular relationships of ERβ with ERα, G‐protein ER (GPER1), as well as progestin and androgen receptors (PR and AR) in the PVN are uncertain. In young (2‐3 month old) females and males, ERβ‐enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) containing neurons were ~4 times greater than ERα‐labeled and PR‐labeled nuclei in the PVN. In subdivisions of the PVN, young females, compared to males, had: 1) more ERβ‐EGFP neurons in neuroendocrine rostral regions; 2) fewer ERα‐labeled nuclei in neuroendocrine and autonomic projecting medial subregions; 3) more ERα‐labeled nuclei in an autonomic projecting caudal region. In contrast, young males, compared to females, had ~20 times more AR‐labeled nuclei which often colocalized with ERβ‐EGFP in neuroendocrine (~70%) and autonomic (~50%) projecting subregions. Ultrastructurally, in soma and dendrites, PVN ERβ‐EGFP colocalized primarily with extranuclear AR (~85% soma) and GPER1 (~70% soma). Aged (12‐24 month‐old) males had more ERβ‐EGFP neurons in a rostral neuroendocrine subregion compared to aged females and females with accelerated ovarian failure (AOF), and in a caudal autonomic subregion compared to post‐AOF females. Late‐aged (18‐24 month‐old) females compared to early‐aged (12‐14 month‐old) females and AOF females had fewer AR‐labeled nuclei in neuroendrocrine and autonomic projecting subregions. These findings indicate that gonadal steroids may directly and indirectly influence PVN neurons via nuclear and extranuclear gonadal hormone receptors in a sex‐specific manner.&lt;/p&gt;

	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mammalian nervous system is a complex network of interconnected cells. We review emerging techniques that use the axonal transport of adeno‐associated virus (AAV) vectors to dissect neural circuits. These intersectional approaches specifically target AAV‐mediated gene expression to discrete neuron populations based on their axonal connectivity, including: (a) neurons with one defined output, (b) neurons with one defined input, (c) neurons with one defined input and one defined output, and (d) neurons with two defined inputs or outputs. The number of labeled neurons can be directly controlled to trace axonal projections and examine cellular morphology. These approaches can precisely target the expression of fluorescent reporters, optogenetic ion channels, chemogenetic receptors, disease‐associated proteins, and other factors to defined neural circuits in mammals ranging from mice to macaques, and thereby provide a powerful new means to understand the structure and function of the nervous system.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jnr.24754?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;img alt=&quot;HCN channels in the mammalian cochlea: Expression pattern, subcellular location, and age‐dependent changes&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/6fec0cc2-5599-446b-97e6-a5a459503c38/jnr24754-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All HCN channel subtypes were located at subcellular level in human and compared with other mammals such as guinea pig, cat, and three mouse strains. Changes in HCN expression levels were quantified in aging mice and murine postnatal development. The widespread expression and distinct localization emphasized the importance of HCN channels for sound coding and electrical stimulation with cochlear implants&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neuronal diversity in the cochlea is largely determined by ion channels. Among voltage‐gated channels, hyperpolarization‐activated cyclic nucleotide‐gated (HCN) channels open with hyperpolarization and depolarize the cell until the resting membrane potential. The functions for hearing are not well elucidated and knowledge about localization is controversial. We created a detailed map of subcellular location and co‐expression of all four HCN subunits across different mammalian species including CBA/J, C57Bl/6N, Ly5.1 mice, guinea pigs, cats, and human subjects. We correlated age‐related hearing deterioration in CBA/J and C57Bl/6N with expression levels of HCN1, −2, and −4 in individual auditory neurons from the same cohort. Spatiotemporal expression during murine postnatal development exposed HCN2 and HCN4 involvement in a critical phase of hair cell innervation. The huge diversity of subunit composition, but lack of relevant heteromeric pairing along the perisomatic membrane and axon initial segments, highlighted an active role for auditory neurons. Neuron clusters were found to be the hot spots of HCN1, −2, and −4 immunostaining. HCN channels were also located in afferent and efferent fibers of the sensory epithelium. Age‐related changes on HCN subtype expression were not uniform among mice and could not be directly correlated with audiometric data. The oldest mice groups revealed HCN channel up‐ or downregulation, depending on the mouse strain. The unexpected involvement of HCN channels in outer hair cell function where HCN3 overlaps prestin location emphasized the importance for auditory function. A better understanding may open up new possibilities to tune neuronal responses evoked through electrical stimulation by cochlear implants.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience Research: Nutritional interventions to improve neurophysiological impairments following traumatic brain injury: A systematic review</title>

	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Traumatic brain injury (TBI) accounts for significant global health burden. Effects of TBI can become chronic even following mild injury. There is a need to develop effective therapies to attenuate the damaging effects of TBI and improve recovery outcomes. This literature review using a priori criteria (PROSPERO; CRD42018100623) summarized 43 studies between January 1998 and July 2019 that investigated nutritional interventions (NUT) delivered with the objective of altering neurophysiological (NP) outcomes following TBI. Risk of bias was assessed for included studies, and NP outcomes recorded. The systematic search resulted in 43 of 3,748 identified studies met inclusion criteria. No studies evaluated the effect of a NUT on NP outcomes of TBI in humans. Biomarkers of morphological changes and apoptosis, oxidative stress, and plasticity, neurogenesis, and neurotransmission were the most evaluated NP outcomes across the 43 studies that used 2,897 animals. The risk of bias was unclear in all reviewed studies due to poorly detailed methodology sections. Taking these limitations into account, anti‐oxidants, branched chain amino acids, and ω‐3 polyunsaturated fatty acids have shown the most promising pre‐clinical results for altering NP outcomes following TBI. Refinement of pre‐clinical methodologies used to evaluate effects of interventions on secondary damage of TBI would improve the likelihood of translation to clinical populations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With global increases in the aging population, the number of patients with dementia is greatly increasing, which has become a big social problem. Many studies have shown strong associations between oral disorders and systemic disorders, such as diabetes, arthritis, sepsis, aspiration pneumonia, arteriosclerosis, bacterial endocarditis, and other cardiovascular diseases. Similarly, numerous cross‐sectional studies showed that patients with dementia usually have poor oral conditions and tooth loss. These have long been considered as a result of difficulty with oral care due to impaired cognitive function, memory, and physical ability in patients with dementia. Indeed, even in patients with mild cognitive impairment, oral care becomes insufficient owing to decreases in spontaneity of grooming and finger dexterity. However, recent studies have shown that tooth loss and occlusal dysfunction may affect brain function and trigger the onset of dementia found in neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's disease. In this review, we highlight the relationships among aging, oral dysfunction, and the development of dementia. Increasing evidence suggests that oral dysfunction is not only a result of dementia in the elderly people, but could also be a causative factor for the onset of dementia.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience Research: Divergent membrane properties of mouse cochlear glial cells around hearing onset</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jnr.24744?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;img alt=&quot;Divergent membrane properties of mouse cochlear glial cells around hearing onset&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/760fab97-8a65-457e-8d4e-1ac80a2c14d7/jnr24744-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mouse cochlear glial cells have region‐specific membrane properties. Within dissociated cultures, satellite glial cells (SGCs) have large weak inwardly rectifying currents, likely mediated by Kir4.1 channels. Presumptive Schwann cells lack these currents. Soon after birth, Kir4.1 subunits appear in both glial subtypes, but become restricted to SGCs around hearing onset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs) are the primary afferent neurons of the auditory system, and together with their attendant glia, form the auditory nerve. Within the cochlea, satellite glial cells (SGCs) encapsulate the cell body of SGNs, whereas Schwann cells (SCs) wrap their peripherally‐ and centrally‐directed neurites. Despite their likely importance in auditory nerve function and homeostasis, the physiological properties of auditory glial cells have evaded description. Here, we characterized the voltage‐activated membrane currents of glial cells from the mouse cochlea. We identified a prominent weak inwardly rectifying current in SGCs within cochlear slice preparations (postnatal day P5‐P6), which was also present in presumptive SGCs within dissociated cultures prepared from the cochleae of hearing mice (P14‐P15). Pharmacological block by Ba&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and desipramine suggested that channels belonging to the Kir4 family mediated the weak inwardly rectifying current, and &lt;i&gt;post hoc&lt;/i&gt; immunofluorescence implicated the involvement of Kir4.1 subunits. Additional electrophysiological profiles were identified for glial cells within dissociated cultures, suggesting that glial subtypes may have specific membrane properties to support distinct physiological roles. Immunofluorescence using fixed cochlear sections revealed that although Kir4.1 is restricted to SGCs after the onset of hearing, these channels are more widely distributed within the glial population earlier in postnatal development (i.e., within both SGCs and SCs). The decrease in Kir4.1 immunofluorescence during SC maturation was coincident with a reduction of Sox2 expression and advancing neurite myelination. The data suggest a diversification of glial properties occurs in preparation for sound‐driven activity in the auditory nerve.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Increased prevalence of pathological mitochondria in astrocytic endfeet of Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH)

Increased prevalence of pathological mitochondria in neuronal terminals of IIH

The mitochondria–ER contact sites distances are reduced in IIH

The postsynaptic density length is reduced in IIH




&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) primarily affects fertile, overweight women, and presents with the symptoms of raised intracranial pressure. The etiology is unknown but has been thought to relate to cerebrospinal fluid disturbance or cerebral venous stenosis. We have previously found evidence that IIH is also a disease of the brain parenchyma, evidenced by alterations at the neurogliovascular interface, including astrogliosis, pathological changes in the basement membrane and pericytes, and alterations of perivascular aquaporin‐4. The aim of this present electron microscopic study was to examine whether mitochondria phenotype was changed in IIH, particularly focusing on perivascular astrocytic endfeet and neurons (soma and pre‐ and postsynaptic terminals). Cortical brain biopsies of nine reference individuals and eight IIH patients were analyzed for subcellular distribution and phenotypical features of mitochondria using transmission electron microscopy. We found significantly increased prevalence of pathological mitochondria and reduced number of normal mitochondria in astrocytic endfeet of IIH patients. The degree of astrogliosis correlated negatively with the number of normal mitochondria in astrocytic endfoot processes. Moreover, we found significantly increased number of pathological mitochondria in pre‐ and postsynaptic neuronal terminals, as well as significantly shortened distance between mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum contacts. Finally, the length of postsynaptic density, a marker of synaptic strength, was on average reduced in IIH. The present data provide evidence of pathological mitochondria in perivascular astrocytes endfeet and neurons of IIH patients, highlighting that impaired metabolism at the neurogliovascular interface may be a facet of IIH.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

&lt;p&gt;Exposure to repetitive head impacts without concussion over one season of competitive men's soccer games was associated with increased resting‐state functional connectivity within networks involved in cognitive functions, analyzing a cohort including nine soccer players and 20 other athletes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soccer, as a contact sport, exposes players to repetitive head impacts, especially through heading the ball. The question of a long‐term brain cumulative effect remains. Our objective was to determine whether exposure to head impacts over one soccer season was associated with changes in functional brain connectivity at rest, using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). In this prospective cohort study, 10 semi‐professional men soccer players, aged 18–25 years, and 20 age‐matched men athletes without a concussion history and who do not practice any contact sport were recruited in Bordeaux (France). Exposure to head impacts per soccer player during competitive games over one season was measured using video analysis. Resting‐state functional magnetic resonance imaging data were acquired for both groups at two times, before and after the season. With a seed‐based analysis, resting‐state networks that have been intimately associated with aspects of cognitive functioning were investigated. The results showed a mean head impacts of 42 (±33) per soccer player over the season, mainly intentional head‐to‐ball impacts and no concussion. No head impact was found among the other athletes. The number of head impacts between the two MRI acquisitions before and after the season was associated with increased connectivity within the default mode network and the cortico‐cerebellar network. In conclusion, our findings suggest that the brain functioning changes over one soccer season in association with exposure to repetitive head impacts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

&lt;p&gt;Individuals who regularly shift their sleep timing, like night and/or shift‐workers suffer from circadian desynchrony and are at risk of developing cardiometabolic diseases and cancer. Also, shift‐work is are suggested to be a risk factor for the development of mood disorders such as the burn out syndrome, anxiety, and depression. Experimental and clinical studies provide evidence that food intake restricted to the normal activity phase is a potent synchronizer for the circadian system and can prevent the detrimental health effects associated with circadian disruption. Here, we explored whether adult male Wistar rats exposed to an experimental model of shift‐work (W‐AL) developed depressive and/or anxiety‐like behaviors and whether this was associated with neuroinflammation in brain areas involved with mood regulation. We also tested whether time‐restricted feeding (TRF) to the active phase could ameliorate circadian disruption and therefore would prevent depressive and anxiety‐like behaviors as well as neuroinflammation. In male Wistar rats, W‐AL induced depressive‐like behavior characterized by hypoactivity and anhedonia and induced increased anxiety‐like behavior in the open field test. This was associated with increased number of glial fibrillary acidic protein and IBA‐1‐positive cells in the prefrontal cortex and basolateral amygdala. Moreover W‐AL caused morphological changes in the microglia in the CA3 area of the hippocampus indicating microglial activation. Importantly, TRF prevented behavioral changes and decreased neuroinflammation markers in the brain. Present results add up evidence about the importance that TRF in synchrony with the light–dark cycle can prevent neuroinflammation leading to healthy mood states in spite of circadian disruptive conditions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;img alt=&quot;Time‐to‐contact perception in the brain&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/002e3a9b-7b2b-4fd4-9d84-01d6d801f614/jnr24740-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What are the brain areas engaged when estimating the time to contact of an approaching ball? Patients undergoing an awake brain surgery performed the task while various areas were stimulated. The performances were assessed compared to a presurgery baseline. Results showed a direct and causal involvement of areas near the intraparietal sulcus, and indirect involvement of areas related to the language. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time‐to‐contact (TTC) perception refers to the ability of an observer to estimate the remaining time before an object reaches a point in the environment, and is of crucial importance in daily life. Noninvasive correlational approaches have identified several brain areas sensitive to TTC information. Here we report the results of two studies, including one during an awake brain surgery, that aimed to identify the specific areas causally engaged in the TTC estimation process. In Study 1, we tested 40 patients with brain tumor in a TTC estimation task. The results showed that four of the six patients with impaired performance had tumors in right upper parietal cortex, although this tumoral location represented only six over 40 patients. In Study 2, 15 patients underwent awake brain surgery electrostimulation mapping to examine the implication of various brain areas in the TTC estimation process. We acquired and normalized to MNI space the coordinates of the functional areas that influenced task performance. Our results seem to demonstrate that the early stage of the TTC estimation process involved specific cortical territories in the ventral region of the right intraparietal sulcus. Downstream processing of TTC could also involve the frontal eye field (middle frontal gyrus) related to ocular search. We also found that deactivating language areas in the left hemisphere interfered with the TTC estimation process. These findings demonstrate a fine grained, cortical representation of TTC processing close to the ventral right intraparietal sulcus and complement those described in other human studies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

&lt;p&gt;Volume of hippocampal subregions (presubiculum/subiculum) are reduced in elderly subjects presenting cortical β‐amyloid deposition and signs of neurodegeneration. In elderly subjects with no neurodegeneration, hippocampal subregional volumes are also reduced in those with cognitive decline (dementia or amnestic mild cognitive impairment) compared to cognitively intact individuals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Changes in hippocampal subfield volumes (HSV) along the Alzheimer's disease (AD) continuum have been scarcely investigated to date in elderly subjects classified based on the presence of β‐amyloid aggregation and signs of neurodegeneration. We classified patients (either sex) with mild dementia compatible with AD (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 35) or amnestic mild cognitive impairment (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 39), and cognitively unimpaired subjects (either sex; &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 26) using [&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;C]PIB‐PET to assess β‐amyloid aggregation (A+) and [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]FDG‐PET to account for neurodegeneration ((N)+). Magnetic resonance imaging‐based automated methods were used for HSV and white matter hyperintensity (WMH) measurements. Significant HSV reductions were found in A+(N)+ subjects in the presubiculum/subiculum complex and molecular layer, related to worse memory performance. In both the A+(N)+ and A+(N)− categories, subicular volumes were inversely correlated with the degree of Aβ deposition. The A−(N)+ subgroup showed reduced HSV relative to the A−(N)− subgroup also in the subiculum/presubiculum. Combining all (N)− subjects, HSV were lower in subjects presenting significant cognitive decline irrespective of A+/A− classification (controlling for WMH load); these between‐group differences were detected again in the presubiculum, but also involved the CA4 and granular layer. These findings demonstrate that differential HSV reductions are detectable both in (N)+ and (N)− categories along the AD continuum, and are directly related to the severity of cognitive deficits. HSV reductions are larger both in A+(N)+ and A+(N)− subjects in direct proportion to the degree of Aβ deposition. The meaningful HSV reductions detected in the A−(N)+ subgroup highlights the strength of biomarker‐based classifications outside of the classical AD continuum.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience Research: Adipose tissue stem cells in peripheral nerve regeneration—In vitro and in vivo</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jnr.24738?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After peripheral nerve injury, Schwann cells (SCs) are crucially involved in several steps of the subsequent regenerative processes, such as the Wallerian degeneration. They promote lysis and phagocytosis of myelin, secrete numbers of neurotrophic factors and cytokines, and recruit macrophages for a biological debridement. However, nerve injuries with a defect size of &amp;gt;1 cm do not show proper tissue regeneration and require a surgical nerve gap reconstruction. To find a sufficient alternative to the current gold standard—the autologous nerve transplant—several cell‐based therapies have been developed and were experimentally investigated. One approach aims on the use of adipose tissue stem cells (ASCs). These are multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells that can differentiate into multiple phenotypes along the mesodermal lineage, such as osteoblasts, chondrocytes, and myocytes. Furthermore, ASCs also possess neurotrophic features, that is, they secrete neurotrophic factors like the nerve growth factor, brain‐derived neurotrophic factor, neurotrophin‐3, ciliary neurotrophic factor, glial cell‐derived neurotrophic factor, and artemin. They can also differentiate into the so‐called Schwann cell‐like cells (SCLCs). These cells share features with naturally occurring SCs, as they also promote nerve regeneration in the periphery. This review gives a comprehensive overview of the use of ASCs in peripheral nerve regeneration and peripheral nerve tissue engineering both &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. While the sustainability of differentiation of ASCs to SCLCs &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; is still questionable, ASCs used with different nerve conduits, such as hydrogels or silk fibers, have been shown to promote nerve regeneration.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adolescent alcohol drinking, primarily in the form of binge‐drinking episodes, is a serious public health concern. Binge drinking in laboratory animals has been modeled by a procedure involving chronic intermittent ethanol (CIE) administration, as compared with chronic intermittent water (CIW). The prolonged effects of adolescent binge alcohol exposure in adults, such as high risk of developing alcohol use disorder, are severe but available treatments in the clinic are limited. One reason is the lack of sufficient understanding about the associated neuronal alterations. The involvement of the insular cortex, particularly the anterior agranular insula (AAI), has emerged as a critical region to explain neuronal mechanisms of substance abuse. This study was designed to evaluate the functional output of the AAI by measuring the intrinsic excitability of pyramidal neurons from male rats 2 or 21 days after adolescent or adult CIE treatment. Decreases in intrinsic excitability in AAI pyramidal neurons were detected 21 days, relative to 2 days, after adolescent CIE. Interestingly, the decreased intrinsic excitability in the AAI pyramidal neurons was observed 2 days after adult CIE, compared to adult CIW, but no difference was found between 2 versus 21 days after adult CIE. These data indicate that, although the AAI is influenced within a limited period after adult but not adolescent CIE, neuronal alterations in AAI are affected during the prolonged period of withdrawal from adolescent but not adult CIE. This may explain the prolonged vulnerability to mental disorders of subjects with an alcohol binge history during their adolescent stage.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

&lt;p&gt;In this research, the potential anti‐relapse efficacy of N‐acetylcysteine (NAC), using the alcohol deprivation effect (ADE) model in long‐term experienced male Wistar rats, has been explored. Two different experiments were performed in order to: (a) test the efficacy of NAC to prevent relapse and (b) discriminate the best administration schedule (intermittent vs. continuous) for the drug. NAC subcutaneously administered, either by continuous infusion or by intermittent injections regimen, was able to block the ADE. The best results were obtained after using 60 mg/kg NAC dose under an intermittent regimen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alcohol use disorders are chronic and highly relapsing disorders, thus alcoholic patients have a high rate of recidivism for drug use even after long periods of abstinence. The literature points to the potential usefulness of N‐acetylcysteine (NAC) in the management of several substance use disorders probably due to its capacity to restore brain homeostasis of the glutamate system disrupted in addiction. However, there is little evidence in the case of alcohol. The aim of this study was to explore the potential anti‐relapse efficacy of NAC using the alcohol deprivation effect (ADE) model in long‐term experienced rats. Two experiments were performed in male Wistar rats to: (a) test the efficacy of NAC to prevent relapse and (b) discriminate the best administration schedule (intermittent vs. continuous) for NAC. In the first experiment, animals were implanted with mini‐osmotic pumps delivering 0 or 1 mg/hr NAC during 14 days. In a second experiment, rats received 0, 60, or 100 mg/kg once daily by subcutaneous injection. The efficacy to prevent ADE was evaluated in both experiments. NAC subcutaneously administered, either by continuous infusion or by intermittent injections regimen, is able to block the ADE. The best results were obtained after using 60 mg/kg NAC dose. Our findings support the hypothesis that NAC may represent a valuable therapy in the management of alcohol relapse.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience Research: Cardiovascular risk factors and APOE‐ε4 status affect memory functioning in aging via changes to temporal stem diffusion</title>

	<content:encoded>&lt;img alt=&quot;Cardiovascular risk factors and APOE‐ε4 status affect memory functioning in aging via changes to temporal stem diffusion&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/6e0c3a18-8f0c-4133-9a72-e3365d1f4272/jnr24734-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 125 healthy older adults we highlighted the importance of routinely accounting for factors that impact cognition both directly as well as indirectly via structural brain changes. Temporal stem diffusion changes demonstrated specificity for explaining the differential impacts of a number of cognitive risk factors on memory performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prior research investigating associations between hypertension, obesity, and apolipoprotein (&lt;i&gt;APOE&lt;/i&gt;) genotype status with memory performance among older adults has yielded inconsistent results. This may reflect, in part, a lack of first accounting for the effects these variables have on structural brain changes, that in turn contribute to age‐related memory impairment. The current study sought to clarify the relationships between these factors via path modeling. We hypothesized that higher body mass index (BMI), hypertension, and being an &lt;i&gt;APOE&lt;/i&gt;‐ε4 allele carrier would predict poorer memory scores, with much of these effects accounted for by indirect effects operating via differences in the integrity of temporal stem white matter. Participants included 125 healthy older adults who underwent neuropsychological assessment and diffusion‐weighted MRI scanning. Direct effects were found for hypertension and demographic variables including age, sex, and education. Importantly, indirect effects were found for BMI, hypertension, &lt;i&gt;APOE&lt;/i&gt;‐ε4 status, age, and sex, where these factors predicted memory scores via their impact on temporal stem diffusion measures. There was also a dual effect of sex, with a direct effect indicating that females had better memory performance overall, and an indirect effect indicating that females with greater temporal stem diffusion had poorer memory performance. Results suggest that changes to the integrity of temporal white matter in aging may underpin reduced memory performance. These results highlight that accounting for variables that not only directly impact cognition, but also for those that indirectly impact cognition via structural brain changes, is crucial for understanding the impact of risk factors on cognition.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

&lt;p&gt;Noradrenaline stimulates β&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;‐adrenoceptor in astrocytes and increases the supply of glutathione from astrocytes to neurons, thereby increasing the intracellular glutathione concentration in neurons and protecting them from H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;‐induced cell death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oxidative stress has been implicated in a variety of neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease. Astrocytes play a significant role in maintaining survival of neurons by supplying antioxidants such as glutathione (GSH) to neurons. Recently, we found that noradrenaline increased the intracellular GSH concentration in astrocytes via β&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;‐adrenoceptor stimulation. These observations suggest that noradrenaline protects neurons from oxidative stress‐induced death by increasing the supply of GSH from astrocytes to neurons via the stimulation of β&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;‐adrenoceptor in astrocytes. In the present study, we examined the protective effect of noradrenaline against H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;‐induced neurotoxicity using two different mixed cultures: the mixed culture of human astrocytoma U‐251 MG cells and human neuroblastoma SH‐SY5Y cells, and the mouse primary cerebrum mixed culture of neurons and astrocytes. H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;‐induced neuronal cell death was significantly attenuated by pretreatment with noradrenaline in both mixed cultures but not in single culture of SH‐SY5Y cells or in mouse cerebrum neuron‐rich culture. The neuroprotective effect of noradrenaline was inhibited by SR59230A, a selective β&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;‐adrenoceptor antagonist, and CL316243, a selective β&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;‐adrenoceptor agonist, mimicked the neuroprotective effect of noradrenaline. DL‐buthionine‐[S,R]‐sulfoximine, a GSH synthesis inhibitor, negated the neuroprotective effect of noradrenaline in both mixed cultures. MK571, which inhibits the export of GSH from astrocytes mediated by multidrug resistance‐associated protein 1, also prevented the neuroprotective effect of noradrenaline. These results suggest that noradrenaline protects neurons against H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;‐induced death by increasing the supply of GSH from astrocytes via β&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;‐adrenoceptor stimulation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

&lt;p&gt;Stress enhances dopamine (DA)‐long‐term potentiation but desipramine (DMI) abolishes this effect. DA‐long‐term depression is not affected unless when stress is followed by DMI. Stress reduces anxiety, an effect abolished by DMI/ketamine while motivation is always promoted. Stress also reduces cFOS expression in the ventral tegmental area in all conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The effect of stress on animal behavior and brain activity has been attracting growing attention in the last decades. Stress dramatically affects several aspects of animal behavior, including motivation and cognitive functioning, and has been used to model human pathologies such as post‐traumatic stress disorder. A key question is whether stress alters the plastic potential of synaptic circuits. In this work, we evaluated if stress affects dopamine (DA)‐dependent synaptic plasticity in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). On male adolescent rats, we characterized anxiety‐ and depressive‐like behaviors using behavioral testing before and after exposure to a mild stress (elevated platform, EP). After the behavioral protocols, we investigated DA‐dependent long‐term potentiation (DA‐LTP) and depression (DA‐LTD) on acute slices of mPFC and evaluated the activation of DA‐producing brain regions by western and dot blot analysis. We show that exposure to the EP stress enhances DA‐LTP and that desipramine (DMI) treatment abolishes this effect. We also found that DA‐LTD is not affected by EP stress unless when this is followed by DMI treatment. In addition, EP stress reduces anxiety, an effect abolished by both DMI and ketamine, while motivation is promoted by previous exposure to EP stress independently of pharmacological treatments. Finally, this form of stress reduces the expression of the early gene cFOS in the ventral tegmental area. These findings support the idea that mild stressors can promote synaptic plasticity in PFC through a dopaminergic mechanism, an effect that might increase the sensitivity of mPFC to subsequent stressful experiences.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to the discovery of Rett Syndrome (RTT) genetic mutations, animal models have been developed. Sleep research in RTT animal models may unravel novel neural mechanisms for this severe neurodevelopmental heritable rare disease. In this systematic literature review we summarize the findings on sleep research of 13 studies in animal models of RTT. We found disturbed efficacy and continuity of sleep in all genetically mutated models of mice, cynomolgus monkeys, and &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt;. Models presented highly fragmented sleep with distinct differences in 24‐hr sleep/wake cyclicity and circadian arrhythmicity. Overall, animal models mimic sleep complaints reported in individuals with RTT. However, contrary to human studies, in mutant mice, attenuated sleep delta waves, and sleep apneas in non‐rapid eye movement sleep were reported. Future studies may focus on sleep structure and EEG alterations, potential central mechanisms involved in sleep fragmentation and the occurrence of sleep apnea across different sleep stages. Given that locomotor dysfunction is characteristic of individuals with RTT, studies may consider to integrate its potential impact on the behavioral analysis of sleep.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jnr.24728?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stroke severely impairs quality of life and has a high mortality rate. On the other hand, dietary docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) prevents neuronal damage. In this review, we describe the effects of dietary DHA on ischemic stroke‐associated neuronal damage and its role in stroke prevention. Recent epidemiological studies have been conducted to analyze stroke prevention through DHA intake. The effects of dietary intake and supply of DHA to neuronal cells, DHA‐mediated inhibition of neuronal damage, and its mechanism, including the effects of the DHA metabolite, neuroprotectin D1 (NPD1), were investigated. These studies revealed that DHA intake was associated with a reduced risk of stroke. Moreover, studies have shown that DHA intake may reduce stroke mortality rates. DHA, which is abundant in fish oil, passes through the blood–brain barrier to accumulate as a constituent of phospholipids in the cell membranes of neuronal cells and astrocytes. Astrocytes supply DHA to neuronal cells, and neuronal DHA, in turn, activates Akt and Raf‐1 to prevent neuronal death or damage. Therefore, DHA indirectly prevents neuronal damage. Furthermore, NDP1 blocks neuronal apoptosis. DHA, together with NPD1, may block neuronal damage and prevent stroke. The inhibitory effect on neuronal damage is achieved through the antioxidant (via inducing the Nrf2/HO‐1 system) and anti‐inflammatory effects (via promoting JNK/AP‐1 signaling) of DHA.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

&lt;p&gt;Internal jugular vein compression, by means of an externally worn neck collar (right side of image), is a potentially viable solution to intervene on the diffusion and anisotropic properties of white matter that change following a season of American tackle football. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The purpose of this clinical trial was to examine whether internal jugular vein compression (JVC)—using an externally worn neck collar—modulated the relationships between differential head impact exposure levels and pre‐ to postseason changes in diffusion tensor imaging (DTI)‐derived diffusivity and anisotropy metrics of white matter following a season of American tackle football. Male high‐school athletes (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 284) were prospectively assigned to a non‐collar group or a collar group. Magnetic resonance imaging data were collected from participants pre‐ and postseason and head impact exposure was monitored by accelerometers during every practice and game throughout the competitive season. Athletes' accumulated head impact exposure was systematically thresholded based on the frequency of impacts of progressively higher magnitudes (10 g intervals between 20 to 150 g) and modeled with pre‐ to postseason changes in DTI measures of white matter as a function of JVC neck collar wear. The findings revealed that the JVC neck collar modulated the relationships between greater high‐magnitude head impact exposure (110 to 140 g) and longitudinal changes to white matter, with each group showing associations that varied in directionality. Results also revealed that the JVC neck collar group partially preserved longitudinal changes in DTI metrics. Collectively, these data indicate that a JVC neck collar can provide a mechanistic response to the diffusion and anisotropic properties of brain white matter following the highly diverse exposure to repetitive head impacts in American tackle football.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Iron Heterogeneity in Early Active Multiple Sclerosis Lesions</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25974?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a heterogeneous inflammatory demyelinating disease. Iron distribution is altered in MS patients' brains, suggesting iron liberation within active lesions amplifies demyelination and neurodegeneration. Whether the amount and distribution of iron are similar or different among different MS immunopatterns is currently unknown.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We used synchrotron X‐ray fluorescence imaging, histology, and immunohistochemistry to compare the iron quantity and distribution between immunopattern II and III early active MS lesions. We analyzed archival autopsy and biopsy tissue from 21 MS patients.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Immunopattern II early active lesions contain 64% more iron (95% confidence interval [CI] = 17–127%, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.004) than immunopattern III lesions, and 30% more iron than the surrounding periplaque white matter (95% CI = 3–64%, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.03). Iron in immunopattern III lesions is 28% lower than in the periplaque white matter (95% CI = −40 to −14%, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001). When normalizing the iron content of early active lesions to that of surrounding periplaque white matter, the ratio is significantly higher in immunopattern II (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001). Microfocused X‐ray fluorescence imaging shows that iron in immunopattern II lesions localizes to macrophages, whereas macrophages in immunopattern III lesions contain little iron.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iron distribution and content are heterogeneous in early active MS lesions. Iron accumulates in macrophages in immunopattern II, but not immunopattern III lesions. This heterogeneity in the two most common MS immunopatterns may be explained by different macrophage polarization, origin, or different demyelination mechanisms, and paves the way for developing new or using existing iron‐sensitive magnetic resonance imaging techniques to differentiate among immunopatterns in the general nonbiopsied MS patient population.

&lt;p&gt;Respiratory motor activity can be modulated by higher brain inputs. We hypothesized that forebrain regions send descending inputs to the respiratory control areas in the midbrain, pons, and medulla. Our data implies that i) volitional motor commands for vocalization are specifically relayed via the midbrain periaqueductal gray; ii) commands to coordinate breathing with other orofacial behaviors (e.g. sniffing, whisking, swallowing) target the pontine Kölliker‐Fuse nucleus, predominantly; iii) limbic or autonomic (interoceptive) systems are connected to broadly distributed downstream brainstem respiratory networks, including the medullary Bötzinger complex (BötC), pre‐Bötzinger complex (pre‐BötC), and caudal raphé nuclei. We provide a neural substrate to explain how volitional, state‐dependent, and emotional modulation of breathing is regulated by the forebrain.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eupnea is generated by neural circuits located in the ponto‐medullary brainstem, but can be modulated by higher brain inputs which contribute to volitional control of breathing and the expression of orofacial behaviors, such as vocalization, sniffing, coughing and swallowing. Surprisingly, the anatomical organization of descending inputs that connect the forebrain with the brainstem respiratory network remains poorly defined. We hypothesized that descending forebrain projections target multiple distributed respiratory control nuclei across the neuroaxis. To test our hypothesis, we made discrete unilateral microinjections of the retrograde tracer Cholera toxin subunit B (CT‐B) in the midbrain periaqueductal gray (PAG), the pontine Kölliker‐Fuse nucleus (KFn), the medullary Bötzinger complex (BötC), pre‐Bötzinger complex (pre‐BötC) or caudal midline raphé nuclei. We quantified the regional distribution of retrogradely‐labeled neurons in the forebrain 12‐14 days post‐injection. Overall, our data reveals that descending inputs from cortical areas predominantly target the PAG and KFn. Differential forebrain regions innervating the PAG (prefrontal, cingulate cortices, and lateral septum) and KFn (rhinal, piriform, and somatosensory cortices) imply that volitional motor commands for vocalization are specifically relayed via the PAG, while the KFn may receive commands to coordinate breathing with other orofacial behaviors (e.g. sniffing, swallowing). Additionally, we observed that the limbic or autonomic (interoceptive) systems are connected to broadly distributed downstream bulbar respiratory networks. Collectively, these data provide a neural substrate to explain how volitional, state‐dependent, and emotional modulation of breathing is regulated by the forebrain.&lt;/p&gt;

	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The chemical synapse is the principal form of contact between neurons of the central nervous system. These synapses are typically configured as presynaptic axon terminations onto postsynaptic dendrites or somata, giving rise to axo‐dendritic and axo‐somatic synapses, respectively. Beyond these common synapse configurations are less‐studied, non‐canonical synapse types that are prevalent throughout the brain and significantly contribute to neural circuit function. Among these are the axo‐axonic synapses, which consist of an axon terminating on another axon or axon terminal. Here, we review evidence for axo‐axonic synapse contributions to neural signaling in the mammalian nervous system and survey functional neural circuit motifs enabled by these synapses. We also detail how recent advances in microscopy, transgenics, and biological sensors may be used to identify and functionally assay axo‐axonic synapses.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Hippocampus: Adult neurogenesis alters response to an aversive distractor in a labyrinth maze without affecting spatial learning or memory</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/hipo.23267?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adult neurogenesis has been implicated in learning and memory of complex spatial environments. However, new neurons also play a role in nonmnemonic behavior, including the stress response and attention shifting. Many commonly used spatial tasks are very simple, and unsuitable for detecting neurogenesis effects, or are aversively motivated, making it difficult to dissociate effects on spatial learning and memory from effects on stress. We have therefore created a novel complex spatial environment, the flex maze, to enable reward‐mediated testing of spatial learning in a flexibly configurable labyrinth. Using a pharmacogenetic method to completely inhibit neurogenesis in adulthood, we found that rats lacking new neurons (TK rats) and wild type controls completed and remembered most mazes equally well. However, control rats were slower to complete peppermint‐scented mazes than other mazes, while neurogenesis‐deficient rats showed no effect of mint on maze behavior, completing these mazes significantly faster than control rats. Additional testing found that wild type and TK rats showed similar detection of, avoidance of, and glucocorticoid response to the mint odor. These results suggest that spatial learning and memory in a labyrinth task is unaffected by the loss of new neurons, but that these cells affect the ability of an aversive stimulus to distract rats from completing the maze.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Hippocampus: Environmental deformations dynamically shift human spatial memory</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/hipo.23265?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Place and grid cells in the hippocampal formation are commonly thought to support a unified and coherent cognitive map of space. This mapping mechanism faces a challenge when a navigator is placed in a familiar environment that has been deformed from its original shape. Under such circumstances, many transformations could plausibly serve to map a navigator's familiar cognitive map to the deformed space. Previous empirical results indicate that the firing fields of rodent place and grid cells stretch or compress in a manner that approximately matches the environmental deformation, and human spatial memory exhibits similar distortions. These effects have been interpreted as evidence that reshaping a familiar environment elicits an analogously reshaped cognitive map. However, recent work has suggested an alternative explanation, whereby deformation‐induced distortions of the grid code are attributable to a mechanism that dynamically anchors grid fields to the most recently experienced boundary, thus causing history‐dependent shifts in grid phase. This interpretation raises the possibility that human spatial memory will exhibit similar history‐dependent dynamics. To test this prediction, we taught participants the locations of objects in a virtual environment and then probed their memory for these locations in deformed versions of this environment. Across three experiments with variable access to visual and vestibular cues, we observed the predicted pattern, whereby the remembered locations of objects were shifted from trial to trial depending on the boundary of origin of the participant's movement trajectory. These results provide evidence for a dynamic anchoring mechanism that governs both neuronal firing and spatial memory.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Hippocampus: Altered structure and functional connectivity of the hippocampus are associated with social and mathematical difficulties in nonverbal learning disability</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/hipo.23264?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hippocampus is known to play a critical role in a variety of complex abilities, including visual‐spatial reasoning, social functioning, and math. Nonverbal learning disability (NVLD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by deficits in visual‐spatial reasoning that are accompanied by impairment in social function or mathematics, as well as motor or executive function skills. Despite the overlap between behaviors supported by the hippocampus and impairments in NVLD, the structure and function of the hippocampus in NVLD has not been studied. To address this gap in the literature, we first compared hippocampal volume and resting‐state functional connectivity in children with NVLD (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 24) and typically developing (TD) children (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 20). We then explored associations between hippocampal structure, connectivity, and performance on measures of spatial, social, and mathematical ability. Relative to TD children, those with NVLD showed significant reductions in left hippocampal volume and greater hippocampal‐cerebellar connectivity. In children with NVLD, reduced hippocampal volume associated with worse mathematical problem solving. Although children with NVLD exhibited more social problems (social responsiveness scale [SRS]) and higher hippocampal‐cerebellar connectivity relative to TD children, greater connectivity was associated with fewer social problems among children with NVLD but not TD children. Such an effect may suggest a compensatory mechanism. These structural and functional alterations of the hippocampus may disrupt its putative role in organizing conceptual frameworks through cognitive mapping, thus contributing to the cross‐domain difficulties that characterize NVLD.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Hippocampus: Chronic activation of fear engrams induces extinction‐like behavior in ethanol‐exposed mice</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/hipo.23263?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alcohol withdrawal directly impacts the brain's stress and memory systems, which may underlie individual susceptibility to persistent drug and alcohol‐seeking behaviors. Numerous studies demonstrate that forced alcohol abstinence, which may lead to withdrawal, can impair fear‐related memory processes in rodents such as extinction learning; however, the underlying neural circuits mediating these impairments remain elusive. Here, we tested an optogenetic strategy aimed at mitigating fear extinction retrieval impairments in male c57BL/6 mice following exposure to alcohol (i.e., ethanol) and forced abstinence. In the first experiment, extensive behavioral extinction training in a fear‐conditioned context was impaired in ethanol‐exposed mice compared to controls. In the second experiment, neuronal ensembles processing a contextual fear memory in the dorsal hippocampus were tagged and optogenetically reactivated repeatedly in a distinct context in ethanol‐exposed and control mice. Chronic activation of these cells resulted in a context‐specific, extinction‐like reduction in fear responses in both control and ethanol‐exposed mice. These findings suggest that while ethanol can impair the retrieval an extinction memory, optogenetic manipulation of a fear engram is sufficient to induce an extinction‐like reduction in fear responses.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Hippocampus: New boundaries and dissociation of the mouse hippocampus along the dorsal‐ventral axis based on glutamatergic, GABAergic and catecholaminergic receptor densities</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/hipo.23262?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In rodents, gene‐expression, neuronal tuning, connectivity and neurogenesis studies have postulated that the dorsal, the intermediate and the ventral hippocampal formation (HF) are distinct entities. These findings are underpinned by behavioral studies showing a dissociable role of dorsal and ventral HF in learning, memory, stress and emotional processing. However, up to now, the molecular basis of such differences in relation to discrete boundaries is largely unknown. Therefore, we analyzed binding site densities for glutamatergic AMPA, NMDA, kainate and mGluR&lt;sub&gt;2/3&lt;/sub&gt;, GABAergic GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; (including benzodiazepine binding sites), GABA&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;, dopaminergic D&lt;sub&gt;1/5&lt;/sub&gt; and noradrenergic α&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and α&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; receptors as key modulators for signal transmission in hippocampal functions, using quantitative in vitro receptor autoradiography along the dorsal‐ventral axis of the mouse HF. Beside general different receptor profiles of the dentate gyrus (DG) and Cornu Ammonis fields (CA1, CA2, CA3, CA4/hilus), we detected substantial differences between dorsal, intermediate and ventral subdivisions and individual layers for all investigated receptor types, except GABA&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;. For example, striking higher densities of α&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; receptors were detected in the ventral DG, while the dorsal DG possesses higher numbers of kainate, NMDA, GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; and D&lt;sub&gt;1/5&lt;/sub&gt; receptors. CA1 dorsal and intermediate subdivisions showed higher AMPA, NMDA, mGluR&lt;sub&gt;2/3&lt;/sub&gt;, GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;, D&lt;sub&gt;1/5&lt;/sub&gt; receptors, while kainate receptors are higher expressed in ventral CA1, and noradrenergic α&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and α&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; receptors in the intermediate region of CA1. CA2 dorsal was distinguished by higher kainate, α&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and α&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; receptors in the intermediate region, while CA3 showed a more complex dissociation. Our findings resulted not only in a clear segmentation of the mouse hippocampus along the dorsal‐ventral axis, but also provides insights into the neurochemical basis and likely associated physiological processes in hippocampal functions. Therein, the presented data has a high impact for future studies modeling and investigating dorsal, intermediate and ventral hippocampal dysfunction in relation to neurodegenerative diseases or psychiatric disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Hippocampus: In the temporal organization of episodic memory, the hippocampus supports the experience of elapsed time</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/hipo.23261?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Space and time are both essential features of episodic memory, for which the hippocampus is critical (Howard &amp;amp; Eichenbaum, 2015). Spatial tasks have been used effectively to study the behavioral relevance of place cells. However, the behavioral paradigms utilized for the study of time cells have not used time duration as a variable that animals need to be aware of to solve the task. Therefore, the behavioral relevance of this cell firing is unclear. In order to directly study the role of the hippocampus in processing elapsed time, we created a novel time duration discrimination task. Rats learned to make a decision to turn left or right depending on the preceding tone duration (10 s, left turn; 20 s, right turn). Once the rats reached criterion performance of 90% correct on two out of three consecutive days, they received either an excitotoxic hippocampal lesion or a sham‐lesion surgery. After recovery, rats were tested to determine hippocampal involvement in discriminating time duration. Rats with hippocampal lesions performed at chance level on their first testing day postlesion, and they were impaired relative to the sham‐lesioned rats. Although the hippocampal‐lesioned rats began discriminating at above chance level, their performance never returned to criterion even with 50 days of postoperative testing. Furthermore, while sham rats showed no difference in the number of errors they made on 10‐ versus 20‐s delay trials, hippocampal lesion rats similarly improved their performance under the 10‐s delay condition, but not under the 20‐s delay condition. Results indicate that hippocampal lesions resulted in a selective impairment in discriminating elapsed time only during the longer delay trials.

	<title>Hippocampus: Reminders activate the prefrontal‐medial temporal cortex and attenuate forgetting of event memory</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/hipo.23260?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Replicas of an aspect of an experienced event can serve as effective reminders, yet little is known about the neural basis of such reminding effects. Here we examined the neural activity underlying the memory‐enhancing effect of reminders 1 week after encoding of naturalistic film clip events. We used fMRI to determine differences in network activity associated with recently reactivated memories relative to comparably aged, non‐reactivated memories. Reminders were effective in facilitating overall retrieval of memory for film clips, in an all‐or‐none fashion. Prefrontal cortex and hippocampus were activated during both reminders and retrieval. Peak activation in ventro‐lateral prefrontal cortex (vPFC) preceded peak activation in the right hippocampus during the reminders. For film clips that were successfully retrieved after 7 days, pre‐retrieval reminders did not enhance the quality of the retrieved memory or the number of details retrieved, nor did they more strongly engage regions of the recollection network than did successful retrieval of a non‐reminded film clip. These results suggest that reminders prior to retrieval are an effective means of boosting retrieval of otherwise inaccessible episodic events, and that the inability to recall certain events after a delay of a week largely reflects a retrieval deficit, rather than a storage deficit for this information. The results extend other evidence that vPFC drives activation of the hippocampus to facilitate memory retrieval and scene construction, and show that this facilitation also occurs when reminder cues precede successful retrieval attempts. The time course of vPFC‐hippocampal activity during the reminder suggests that reminders may first engage schematic information meditated by vPFC followed by a recollection process mediated by the hippocampus.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Hippocampus: Age‐related alterations in functional connectivity along the longitudinal axis of the hippocampus and its subfields</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/hipo.23259?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hippocampal circuit alterations that differentially affect hippocampal subfields are associated with age‐related memory decline. Additionally, functional organization along the longitudinal axis of the hippocampus has revealed distinctions between anterior and posterior (A‐P) connectivity. Here, we examined the functional connectivity (FC) differences between young and older adults at high‐resolution within the medial temporal lobe network (entorhinal, perirhinal, and parahippocampal cortices), allowing us to explore how hippocampal subfield connectivity across the longitudinal axis of the hippocampus changes with age. Overall, we found reliably greater connectivity for younger adults than older adults between the hippocampus and parahippocampal cortex (PHC) and perirhinal cortex (PRC). This drop in functional connectivity was more pronounced in the anterior regions of the hippocampus than the posterior ones, consistent for each of the hippocampal subfields. Further, intra‐hippocampal connectivity also reflected an age‐related decrease in functional connectivity within the anterior hippocampus in older adults that was offset by an increase in posterior hippocampal functional connectivity. Interestingly, the anterior–posterior dysfunction in older adults between hippocampus and PHC was predictive of lure discrimination performance on the Mnemonic similarity task (MST), suggesting a role in memory performance. While age‐related dysfunction within the hippocampal subfields has been well‐documented, these results suggest that the age‐related dysfunction in hippocampal connectivity across the longitudinal axis may also contribute significantly to memory decline in older adults.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsyn.2020.584549</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The structural features of a synapse help determine its function. Synapses are extremely small and tightly packed with vesicles and other organelles. Visualizing synaptic structure requires imaging by electron microscopy, and the features in micrographs must be quantified, a process called morphometry. Three parameters are typically assessed from each specimen: (1) the sizes of individual vesicles and organelles; (2) the absolute number and densities of organelles; and (3) distances between organelles and key features at synapses, such as active zone membranes and dense projections. For data to be meaningful, the analysis must be repeated from hundreds to thousands of images from several biological replicates, a daunting task. Here we report a custom computer program to analyze key structural features of synapses: SynapsEM. In short, we developed ImageJ/Fiji macros to record x,y-coordinates of segmented structures. The coordinates are then exported as text files. Independent investigators can reload the images and text files to reexamine the segmentation using ImageJ. The Matlab program then calculates and reports key synaptic parameters from the coordinates. Since the values are calculated from coordinates, rather than measured from each micrograph, other parameters such as locations of docked vesicles relative to the center of an active zone can be extracted in Matlab by additional scripting. Thus, this program can accelerate the morphometry of synapses and promote a more comprehensive analysis of synaptic ultrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: GABA Measurement in a Neonatal Fragile X Syndrome Mouse Model Using 1H-Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy and Mass Spectrometry</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2020.612685</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the leading monogenetic cause of autism spectrum disorder and inherited cause of intellectual disability that affects approximately one in 7,000 males and one in 11,000 females. In FXS, the Fmr1 gene is silenced and prevents the expression of the fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) that directly targets mRNA transcripts of multiple GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; subunits. Therefore, FMRP loss adversely impacts the neuronal firing of the GABAergic system which creates an imbalance in the excitatory/inhibitory ratio within the brain. Current FXS treatment strategies focus on curing symptoms, such as anxiety or decreased social function. While treating symptoms can be helpful, incorporating non-invasive imaging to evaluate how treatments change the brain’s biology may explain what molecular aberrations are associated with disease pathology. Thus, the GABAergic system is suitable to explore developing novel therapeutic strategies for FXS. To understand how the GABAergic system may be affected by this loss-of-function mutation, GABA concentrations were examined within the frontal cortex and thalamus of 5-day-old wild type and Fmr1 knockout mice using both &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H magnetic resonance imaging (&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H-MRS) and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Our objective was to develop a reliable scanning method for neonatal mice in vivo and evaluate whether &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H-MRS is suitable to capture regional GABA concentration differences at the front end of the critical cortical period where abnormal neurodevelopment occurs due to FMRP loss is first detected. &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H-MRS quantified GABA concentrations in both frontal cortex and thalamus of wild type and Fmr1 knockout mice. To substantiate the results of our &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H-MRS studies, in vitro LC-MS/MS was also performed on brain homogenates from age-matched mice. We found significant changes in GABA concentration between the frontal cortex and thalamus within each mouse from both wild type and Fmr1 knockout mice using &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H-MRS and LC-MS/MS. Significant GABA levels were also detected in these same regions between wild type and Fmr1 knockout mice by LC-MS/MS, validating that FMRP loss directly affects the GABAergic system. Thus, these new findings support the need to develop an effective non-invasive imaging method to monitor novel GABAergic strategies aimed at treating patients with FXS.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.618019</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Vision impairment and blindness in humans are most frequently caused by the degeneration and loss of photoreceptor cells in the outer retina, as is the case for age-related macular degeneration, retinitis pigmentosa, retinal detachment and many other diseases. While inner retinal neurons survive degeneration, they undergo fundamental pathophysiological changes, collectively known as “remodeling.” Inner retinal remodeling downstream to photoreceptor death occurs across mammalian retinas from mice to humans, independently of the cause of degeneration. It results in pervasive spontaneous hyperactivity and membrane hyperpermeability in retinal ganglion cells, which funnel all retinal signals to the brain. Remodeling reduces light detection in vision-impaired patients and precludes meaningful vision restoration in blind individuals. In this review, we summarize current hypotheses proposed to explain remodeling and their potential medical significance highlighting the important role played by retinoic acid and its receptor.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurogenesis: Role of NDE1 in the Development and Evolution of the Gyrified Cortex</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.617513</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;An expanded cortex is a hallmark of human neurodevelopment and endows increased cognitive capabilities. Recent work has shown that the cell cycle-related gene NDE1 is essential for proper cortical development. Patients who have mutations in NDE1 exhibit congenital microcephaly as a primary phenotype. At the cellular level, NDE1 is essential for interkinetic nuclear migration and mitosis of radial glial cells, which translates to an indispensable role in neurodevelopment. The nuclear migration function of NDE1 is well conserved across Opisthokonta. In mammals, multiple isoforms containing alternate terminal exons, which influence the functionality of NDE1, have been reported. It has been noted that the pattern of terminal exon usage mirrors patterns of cortical complexity in mammals. To provide context to these findings, here, we provide a comprehensive review of the literature regarding NDE1, its molecular biology and physiological relevance at the cellular and organismal levels. In particular, we outline the potential roles of NDE1 in progenitor cell behavior and explore the spectrum of NDE1 pathogenic variants. Moreover, we assessed the evolutionary conservation of NDE1 and interrogated whether the usage of alternative terminal exons is characteristic of species with gyrencephalic cortices. We found that gyrencephalic species are more likely to express transcripts that use the human-associated terminal exon, whereas lissencephalic species tend to express transcripts that use the mouse-associated terminal exon. Among gyrencephalic species, the human-associated terminal exon was preferentially expressed by those with a high order of gyrification. These findings underscore phylogenetic relationships between the preferential usage of NDE1 terminal exon and high-order gyrification, which provide insight into cortical evolution underlying high-order brain functions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Investigation of Deep-Learning-Driven Identification of Multiple Sclerosis Patients Based on Susceptibility-Weighted Images Using Relevance Analysis</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.609468</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The diagnosis of multiple sclerosis (MS) is usually based on clinical symptoms and signs of damage to the central nervous system, which is assessed using magnetic resonance imaging. The correct interpretation of these data requires excellent clinical expertise and experience. Deep neural networks aim to assist clinicians in identifying MS using imaging data. However, before such networks can be integrated into clinical workflow, it is crucial to understand their classification strategy. In this study, we propose to use a convolutional neural network to identify MS patients in combination with attribution algorithms to investigate the classification decisions. The network was trained using images acquired with susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI), which is known to be sensitive to the presence of paramagnetic iron components and is routinely applied in imaging protocols for MS patients. Different attribution algorithms were used to the trained network resulting in heatmaps visualizing the contribution of each input voxel to the classification decision. Based on the quantitative image perturbation method, we selected DeepLIFT heatmaps for further investigation. Single-subject analysis revealed veins and adjacent voxels as signs for MS, while the population-based study revealed relevant brain areas common to most subjects in a class. This pattern was found to be stable across different echo times and also for a multi-echo trained network. Intensity analysis of the relevant voxels revealed a group difference, which was found to be primarily based on the T1w magnitude images, which are part of the SWI calculation. This difference was not observed in the phase mask data.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.602508</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer disease (AD) is a devastating neurodegenerative disorder characterized by extracellular accumulation of amyloid-beta and formation of intracellular neurofibrillary tangles. Microglia activation and neuroinflammation play important roles in the pathogenesis of AD; Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)—a key component of the innate immune system—in microglia is also thought to be involved based on the observed association between TLR gene polymorphisms and AD risk. TLR4 has been shown to exert both detrimental and beneficial effects on AD-related pathologies. In preclinical models, experimental manipulations targeting TLR4 were shown to improve learning and memory, which was related to inhibition of pro-inflammatory cytokine release and reduction of oxidative stress. In this review, we summarize the key evidence supporting TLR4 as a promising therapeutic target in AD treatment.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.601402</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Prefrontal cortex (PFC) asymmetry is an important marker in affective neuroscience and has attracted significant interest, having been associated with studies of motivation, eating behavior, empathy, risk propensity, and clinical depression. The data presented in this paper are the result of three different experiments using PFC asymmetry neurofeedback (NF) as a Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) paradigm, rather than a therapeutic mechanism aiming at long-term effects, using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) which is known to be particularly well-suited to the study of PFC asymmetry and is less sensitive to artifacts. From an experimental perspective the BCI context brings more emphasis on individual subjects' baselines, successful and sustained activation during epochs, and minimal training. The subject pool is also drawn from the general population, with less bias toward specific behavioral patterns, and no inclusion of any patient data. We accompany our datasets with a detailed description of data formats, experiment and protocol designs, as well as analysis of the individualized metrics for definitions of success scores based on baseline thresholds as well as reference tasks. The work presented in this paper is the result of several experiments in the domain of BCI where participants are interacting with continuous visual feedback following a real-time NF paradigm, arising from our long-standing research in the field of affective computing. We offer the community access to our fNIRS datasets from these experiments. We specifically provide data drawn from our empirical studies in the field of affective interactions with computer-generated narratives as well as interfacing with algorithms, such as heuristic search, which all provide a mechanism to improve the ability of the participants to engage in active BCI due to their realistic visual feedback. Beyond providing details of the methodologies used where participants received real-time NF of left-asymmetric increase in activation in their dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), we re-establish the need for carefully designing protocols to ensure the benefits of NF paradigm in BCI are enhanced by the ability of the real-time visual feedback to adapt to the individual responses of the participants. Individualized feedback is paramount to the success of NF in BCIs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Background&lt;p&gt;Postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) is a form of long-lasting neuropathic pain that can severely affect patients’ quality of life. Pulsed radiofrequency (PRF) has been proven to be effective in treating PHN, but the optimal radiofrequency parameters are still not well defined. This retrospective study aimed to compare the efficacy and safety of CT-guided PRF at three different voltages for the treatment of PHN patients.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;This study included 109 patients with PHN involving the thoracic dermatome who were treated in the Department of Pain Management of Shengjing Hospital, China Medical University, from January 2017 to May 2019. They were divided into three groups based on the PRF voltage used: group A (45 V), group B (55 V), and group C (65 V). The PRF therapy (voltage 45, 55, and 65 V) was performed in all patients by targeting the thoracic dorsal root ganglion. After surgery, patients were followed at 3 days, 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months. Observation at each follow-up included basic patient characteristics, visual analog scale (VAS), 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) scores, patient satisfaction, complications, and side effects.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Visual analog scale scores decreased and SF-36 scores increased for all patients in the three groups at each post-operative time point (1, 3, 6, and 12 months; all P &amp;lt; 0.01). Pain relief, improvement in quality of life, and overall satisfaction were more significant for patients in group C than for those in groups A and B at the 3-, 6-, and 12-month follow-ups (all P &amp;lt; 0.05). Patients in group B had lower VAS scores and higher overall satisfaction levels than those in group A (both P &amp;lt; 0.01). A small number of patients from each group (n ≤ 3) experienced mild intraoperative and post-operative complications, which bore no relationship with group assignment (all P &amp;gt; 0.05). At post-operative day 3, patients in group C had skin numbness affecting a larger area than patients in the other two groups (both P &amp;lt; 0.05), but the differences were no longer statistically significant at day 30 after the operation. All patients experienced a drop in numbness area of more than 30% after surgery.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;Compared with PFR at 45 and 55 V, PFR at 65 V had superior efficacy in treating PNH, with a favorable safety profile.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Sensorimotor Functional Connectivity: A Neurophysiological Factor Related to BCI Performance</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.575081</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) are systems that allow users to control devices using brain activity alone. However, the ability of participants to command BCIs varies from subject to subject. About 20% of potential users of sensorimotor BCIs do not gain reliable control of the system. The inefficiency to decode user's intentions requires the identification of neurophysiological factors determining “good” and “poor” BCI performers. One of the important neurophysiological aspects in BCI research is that the neuronal oscillations, used to control these systems, show a rich repertoire of spatial sensorimotor interactions. Considering this, we hypothesized that neuronal connectivity in sensorimotor areas would define BCI performance. Analyses for this study were performed on a large dataset of 80 inexperienced participants. They took part in a calibration and an online feedback session recorded on the same day. Undirected functional connectivity was computed over sensorimotor areas by means of the imaginary part of coherency. The results show that post- as well as pre-stimulus connectivity in the calibration recording is significantly correlated to online feedback performance in μ and feedback frequency bands. Importantly, the significance of the correlation between connectivity and BCI feedback accuracy was not due to the signal-to-noise ratio of the oscillations in the corresponding post and pre-stimulus intervals. Thus, this study demonstrates that BCI performance is not only dependent on the amplitude of sensorimotor oscillations as shown previously, but that it also relates to sensorimotor connectivity measured during the preceding training session. The presence of such connectivity between motor and somatosensory systems is likely to facilitate motor imagery, which in turn is associated with the generation of a more pronounced modulation of sensorimotor oscillations (manifested in ERD/ERS) required for the adequate BCI performance. We also discuss strategies for the up-regulation of such connectivity in order to enhance BCI performance.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: The Effect of Bilingualism on Cue-Based vs. Memory-Based Task Switching in Older Adults</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.610548</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Findings suggest a positive impact of bilingualism on cognition, including the later onset of dementia. However, it is not clear to what extent these effects are influenced by variations in attentional control demands in response to specific task requirements. In this study, 20 bilingual and 20 monolingual older adults performed a task-switching task under explicit task-cuing vs. memory-based switching conditions. In the cued condition, task switches occurred in random order and a visual cue signaled the next task to be performed. In the memory-based condition, the task alternated after every second trial in a predictable sequence without presenting a cue. The performance of bilinguals did not vary across experimental conditions, whereas monolinguals experienced a pronounced increase in response latencies and error rates in the cued condition. Both groups produced similar switch costs (difference in performance on switch trials as opposed to repeating trials within the mixed-task block) and mixing costs (difference in performance on repeat trials of a mixed-task block as opposed to trials of a single-task block), but bilinguals produced them with lower response latencies. The cognitive benefits of bilingualism seem not to apply to executive functions per se but to affect specific cognitive processes that involve task-relevant context processing. The present results suggest that lifelong bilingualism could promote in older adults a flexible adjustment to environmental cues, but only with increased task demands. However, due to the small sample size, the results should be interpreted with caution.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Signal-Space Projection Suppresses the tACS Artifact in EEG Recordings</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.536070</link>
	<content:encoded>Background&lt;p&gt;To probe the functional role of brain oscillations, transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) has proven to be a useful neuroscientific tool. Because of the excessive tACS-caused artifact at the stimulation frequency in electroencephalography (EEG) signals, tACS + EEG studies have been mostly limited to compare brain activity between recordings before and after concurrent tACS. Critically, attempts to suppress the artifact in the data cannot assure that the entire artifact is removed while brain activity is preserved. The current study aims to evaluate the feasibility of specific artifact correction techniques to clean tACS-contaminated EEG data.&lt;/p&gt;New Method&lt;p&gt;In the first experiment, we used a phantom head to have full control over the signal to be analyzed. Driving pre-recorded human brain-oscillation signals through a dipolar current source within the phantom, we simultaneously applied tACS and compared the performance of different artifact-correction techniques: sine subtraction, template subtraction, and signal-space projection (SSP). In the second experiment, we combined tACS and EEG on one human subject to demonstrate the best-performing data-correction approach in a proof of principle.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;The tACS artifact was highly attenuated by SSP in the phantom and the human EEG; thus, we were able to recover the amplitude and phase of the oscillatory activity. In the human experiment, event-related desynchronization could be restored after correcting the artifact.&lt;/p&gt;Comparison With Existing Methods&lt;p&gt;The best results were achieved with SSP, which outperformed sine subtraction and template subtraction.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;Our results demonstrate the feasibility of SSP by applying it to a phantom measurement with pre-recorded signal and one human tACS + EEG dataset. For a full validation of SSP, more data are needed.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: The Ion Channel and GPCR Toolkit of Brain Capillary Pericytes</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.601324</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Brain pericytes reside on the abluminal surface of capillaries, and their processes cover ~90% of the length of the capillary bed. These cells were first described almost 150 years ago (Eberth, 1871; Rouget, 1873) and have been the subject of intense experimental scrutiny in recent years, but their physiological roles remain uncertain and little is known of the complement of signaling elements that they employ to carry out their functions. In this review, we synthesize functional data with single-cell RNAseq screens to explore the ion channel and G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) toolkit of mesh and thin-strand pericytes of the brain, with the aim of providing a framework for deeper explorations of the molecular mechanisms that govern pericyte physiology. We argue that their complement of channels and receptors ideally positions capillary pericytes to play a central role in adapting blood flow to meet the challenge of satisfying neuronal energy requirements from deep within the capillary bed, by enabling dynamic regulation of their membrane potential to influence the electrical output of the cell. In particular, we outline how genetic and functional evidence suggest an important role for G&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;-coupled GPCRs and ATP-sensitive potassium (K&lt;sub&gt;ATP&lt;/sub&gt;) channels in this context. We put forth a predictive model for long-range hyperpolarizing electrical signaling from pericytes to upstream arterioles, and detail the TRP and Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; channels and G&lt;sub&gt;q&lt;/sub&gt;, G&lt;sub&gt;i/o&lt;/sub&gt;, and G&lt;sub&gt;12/13&lt;/sub&gt; signaling processes that counterbalance this. We underscore critical questions that need to be addressed to further advance our understanding of the signaling topology of capillary pericytes, and how this contributes to their physiological roles and their dysfunction in disease.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Pregnancy Changes the Response of the Vomeronasal and Olfactory Systems to Pups in Mice</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.593309</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Motherhood entails changes in behavior with increased motivation for pups, induced in part by pregnancy hormones acting upon the brain. This work explores whether this alters sensory processing of pup-derived chemosignals. To do so, we analyse the expression of immediate early genes (IEGs) in the vomeronasal organ (VNO; Egr1) and centers of the olfactory and vomeronasal brain pathways (cFos) in virgin and late-pregnant females exposed to pups, as compared to buttons (socially neutral control). In pup-exposed females, we quantified diverse behaviors including pup retrieval, sniffing, pup-directed attack, nest building and time in nest or on nest, as well as time off nest. Pups induce Egr1 expression in the VNO of females, irrespective of their physiological condition, thus suggesting the existence of VNO-detected pup chemosignals. A similar situation is found in the accessory olfactory bulb (AOB) and posteromedial part of the medial bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BSTMPM). By contrast, in the medial amygdala and posteromedial cortical amygdala (PMCo), responses to pups-vs-buttons are different in virgin and late-pregnant females, thus suggesting altered sensory processing during late pregnancy. The olfactory system also shows changes in sensory processing with pregnancy. In the main olfactory bulbs, as well as the anterior and posterior piriform cortex, buttons activate cFos expression in virgins more than in pregnant females. By contrast, in the anterior and especially posterior piriform cortex, pregnant females show more activation by pups than buttons. Correlation between IEGs expression and behavior suggests the existence of two vomeronasal subsystems: one associated to pup care (with PMCo as its main center) and another related to pup-directed aggression observed in some pregnant females (with the BSTMPM as the main nucleus). Our data also suggest a coactivation of the olfactory and vomeronasal systems during interaction with pups in pregnant females.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: The Parvalbumin Hypothesis of Autism Spectrum Disorder</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.577525</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The prevalence of autism spectrum disorder (ASD)—a type of neurodevelopmental disorder—is increasing and is around 2% in North America, Asia, and Europe. Besides the known genetic link, environmental, epigenetic, and metabolic factors have been implicated in ASD etiology. Although highly heterogeneous at the behavioral level, ASD comprises a set of core symptoms including impaired communication and social interaction skills as well as stereotyped and repetitive behaviors. This has led to the suggestion that a large part of the ASD phenotype is caused by changes in a few and common set of signaling pathways, the identification of which is a fundamental aim of autism research. Using advanced bioinformatics tools and the abundantly available genetic data, it is possible to classify the large number of ASD-associated genes according to cellular function and pathways. Cellular processes known to be impaired in ASD include gene regulation, synaptic transmission affecting the excitation/inhibition balance, neuronal Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; signaling, development of short-/long-range connectivity (circuits and networks), and mitochondrial function. Such alterations often occur during early postnatal neurodevelopment. Among the neurons most affected in ASD as well as in schizophrenia are those expressing the Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-binding protein parvalbumin (PV). These mainly inhibitory interneurons present in many different brain regions in humans and rodents are characterized by rapid, non-adaptive firing and have a high energy requirement. PV expression is often reduced at both messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein levels in human ASD brain samples and mouse ASD (and schizophrenia) models. Although the human PVALB gene is not a high-ranking susceptibility/risk gene for either disorder and is currently only listed in the SFARI Gene Archive, we propose and present supporting evidence for the Parvalbumin Hypothesis, which posits that decreased PV level is causally related to the etiology of ASD (and possibly schizophrenia).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroanatomy: A Systematic Approach to Dissection of the Equine Brain–Evaluation of a Species-Adapted Protocol for Beginners and Experts</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnana.2020.614929</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Introduction of new imaging modalities for the equine brain have refocused attention on the horse as a natural model for ethological, neuroanatomical, and neuroscientific investigations. As opposed to imaging studies, strategies for equine neurodissection still lack a structured approach, standardization and reproducibility. In contrast to other species, where adapted protocols for sampling have been published, no comparable guideline is currently available for equids. Hence, we developed a species-specific slice protocol for whole brain vs. hemispheric dissection and tested its applicability and practicability in the field, as well as its neuroanatomical accuracy and reproducibility. Dissection steps are concisely described and depicted by schematic illustrations, photographs and instructional videos. Care was taken to show the brain in relation to the raters' hands, cutting devices and bench surface. Guidance is based on a minimum of external anatomical landmarks followed by geometric instructions that led to procurement of 14 targeted slabs. The protocol was performed on 55 formalin-fixed brains by three groups of investigators with different neuroanatomical skills. Validation of brain dissection outcomes addressed the aptitude of slabs for neuroanatomical studies as opposed to simplified routine diagnostic purposes. Across all raters, as much as 95.2% of slabs were appropriate for neuroanatomical studies, and 100% of slabs qualified for a routine diagnostic setting. Neither autolysis nor subfixation significantly affected neuroanatomical accuracy score, while a significant negative effect was observed with brain extraction artifacts. Procedure times ranged from 14 to 66 min and reached a mean duration of 23.25 ± 7.93 min in the last of five trials in inexperienced raters vs. 16 ± 2.83 min in experts, while acceleration of the dissection did not negatively impact neuroanatomical accuracy. This protocol, derived analogously to the consensus report of the International Veterinary Epilepsy Task Force in dogs and cats, allows for systematic, quick and easy dissection of the equine brain, even for inexperienced investigators. Obtained slabs feature virtually all functional subcompartments at suitable planes for both diagnostic and neuroscientific investigations and complement the data obtained from imaging studies. The instructive protocol and brain dissection videos are available in Supplementary Material.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Identification of Circular RNA hsa_Circ_0003391 in Peripheral Blood Is Potentially Associated With Alzheimer's Disease</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.601965</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Circular RNAs (circRNAs) have recently been discovered as a novel type of endogenous non-coding RNA that may regulate gene expression in mammals. In the central nervous system (CNS), circRNAs are relevant to many neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). In this study, we attempted to identify an aberrant circRNA, hsa_circ_0003391, which is significantly downregulated in the peripheral blood of patients with AD, and to explore the relationship between hsa_circ_0003391 and the clinical manifestation of AD. The expression of hsa_circ_0003391 had a specific decrease in the peripheral blood of patients with AD compared to those with other types of dementia. To evaluate the potential diagnostic value of the circRNA, we performed a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. The area under the curve (AUC) value was 0.7283 for hsa_circ_0003391, which was statistically significant. The natural form of hsa_circ_0003391 in the peripheral blood was a loop structure with good stability. We found a potential correlation between the expression of hsa_circ_0003391 and the clinical manifestations of AD. Bioinformatic analysis was carried out to predict the latent target microRNAs (miRNA) of hsa_circ_0003391. Furthermore, microRNAs targeted by hsa_circ_0003391 were successfully detected, and miR-574-5p had an expected elevation in the AD groups, suggesting that miR-574-5p might be a potential microRNA target for hsa_circ_0003391. Our results suggest that the downregulation of hsa_circ_0003391 in the peripheral blood has a potential relationship with AD. Our findings not only provide an important latent biomarker but also highlight an important perspective for the following study into AD pathogenesis. This may promote the process of novel therapeutics targeting non-coding RNA.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

&lt;p&gt;During brain development, synapses form and are refined through the accumulation of different proteins. Here we examined the dynamic distribution of Synaptotagmin 2a (Syt2a) in the developing forebrain of zebrafish larvae with a focus on regions associated with social behavior. We show that Syt2a colocalized with tyrosine hydroxylase, a protein important for behavior. Further, we found that Syt2a localizes to synapses onto neurons implicated in social behavior, with an increase of Syt2a expression coinciding with the emergence of social behavior.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As they form, synapses go through various stages of maturation and refinement. These steps are linked to significant changes in synaptic function, potentially resulting in emergence and maturation of behavioral outputs. Synaptotagmins are calcium‐sensing proteins of the synaptic vesicle exocytosis machinery, and changes in Synaptotagmin proteins at synapses have significant effects on vesicle release and synaptic function. Here, we examined the distribution of the synaptic vesicle protein Synaptotagmin 2a (Syt2a) during development of the zebrafish nervous system. Syt2a is widely distributed throughout the midbrain and hindbrain early during larval development but very weakly expressed in the forebrain. Later in development, Syt2a expression levels in the forebrain increase, particularly in regions associated with social behavior, and most intriguingly, around the time social behavior becomes apparent. We provide evidence that Syt2a localizes to synapses onto neurons implicated in social behavior in the ventral forebrain and show that Syt2a is colocalized with tyrosine hydroxylase, a biosynthetic enzyme in the dopamine pathway. Our results suggest a developmentally important role for Syt2a in maturing synapses in the forebrain, coinciding with the emergence of social behavior.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Reverse transcription, an essential event in the HIV-1 life cycle, requires deoxynucleotide triphosphates (dNTPs) to fuel DNA synthesis, thus requiring penetration of dNTPs into the viral capsid. The central cavity of the capsid protein (CA) hexamer reveals itself as a plausible channel that allows the passage of dNTPs into assembled capsids. Nevertheless, the molecular mechanism of nucleotide import into the capsid remains unknown. Employing all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, we established that cooperative binding between nucleotides inside a CA hexamer cavity results in energetically favorable conditions for passive translocation of dNTPs into the HIV-1 capsid. Furthermore, binding of the host cell metabolite inositol hexakisphosphate (IP&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;) enhances dNTP import, while binding of synthesized molecules like benzenehexacarboxylic acid (BHC) inhibits it. The enhancing effect on reverse transcription by IP&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; and the consequences of interactions between CA and nucleotides were corroborated using atomic force microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and virological assays. Collectively, our results provide an atomistic description of the permeability of the HIV-1 capsid to small molecules and reveal a novel mechanism for the involvement of metabolites in HIV-1 capsid stabilization, nucleotide import, and reverse transcription.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/CpYzL7eAJF4&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

The antimicrobial resistance crisis has persisted despite broad attempts at intervention. It has been proposed that an important driver of resistance is selection imposed on bacterial populations that are not the intended target of antimicrobial therapy. But to date, there has been limited quantitative measure of the mean and variance of resistance following antibiotic exposure. Here we focus on the important nosocomial pathogen &lt;i&gt;Enterococcus faecium&lt;/i&gt; in a hospital system where resistance to daptomycin is evolving despite standard interventions. We hypothesized that the intravenous use of daptomycin generates off-target selection for resistance in transmissible gastrointestinal (carriage) populations of &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;faecium&lt;/i&gt;. We performed a cohort study in which the daptomycin resistance of &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;faecium&lt;/i&gt; isolated from rectal swabs from daptomycin-exposed patients was compared to a control group of patients exposed to linezolid, a drug with similar indications. In the daptomycin-exposed group, daptomycin resistance of &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;faecium&lt;/i&gt; from the off-target population was on average 50% higher than resistance in the control group (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 428 clones from 22 patients). There was also greater phenotypic diversity in daptomycin resistance within daptomycin-exposed patients. In patients where multiple samples over time were available, a wide variability in temporal dynamics were observed, from long-term maintenance of resistance to rapid return to sensitivity after daptomycin treatment stopped. Sequencing of isolates from a subset of patients supports the argument that selection occurs within patients. Our results demonstrate that off-target gastrointestinal populations rapidly respond to intravenous antibiotic exposure. Focusing on the off-target evolutionary dynamics may offer novel avenues to slow the spread of antibiotic resistance.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/Kkmye7te-0c&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Toll-like receptors (TLRs) play a crucial role in the innate immune response. Although endosomal TLR7 recognizes single-stranded RNAs, their endogenous RNA ligands have not been fully explored. Here, we report 5′-tRNA half molecules as abundant activators of TLR7. Mycobacterial infection and accompanying surface TLR activation up-regulate the expression of 5′-tRNA half molecules in human monocyte-derived macrophages (HMDMs). The abundant accumulation of 5′-tRNA halves also occur in HMDM-secreted extracellular vehicles (EVs); the abundance of EV-5′-tRNA&lt;sup&gt;HisGUG&lt;/sup&gt; half molecules is &amp;gt;200-fold higher than that of the most abundant EV-microRNA (miRNA). Sequence identification of the 5′-tRNA halves using cP-RNA-seq revealed abundant and selective packaging of specific 5′-tRNA half species into EVs. The EV-5′-tRNA&lt;sup&gt;HisGUG&lt;/sup&gt; half was experimentally demonstrated to be delivered into endosomes in recipient cells and to activate endosomal TLR7. Up-regulation of the 5′-tRNA half molecules was also observed in the plasma of patients infected with &lt;i&gt;Mycobacterium tuberculosis&lt;/i&gt;. These results unveil a novel tRNA-engaged pathway in the innate immune response and assign the role of “immune activators” to 5′-tRNA half molecules.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/tpa9O3HlOqo&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

&lt;p&gt;Genetic ablation of G protein‐coupled receptor 37‐like 1 results in increased patched 1 expression and internalization. This leads to the intracellular accumulation of cholesterol, with concomitant stimulation of sonic hedgehog (Shh) production and activation of Shh‐induced proliferative signaling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mammalian cerebellar astrocytes critically regulate the differentiation and maturation of neuronal Purkinje cells and granule precursors. The G protein‐coupled receptor 37‐like 1 (Gpr37l1) is expressed by Bergmann astrocytes and interacts with patched 1 (Ptch1) at peri‐ciliary membranes. Cerebellar primary astrocyte cultures from wild‐type and &lt;i&gt;Gpr37l1&lt;/i&gt; null mutant mouse pups were established and studied. Primary cilia were produced by cultures of both genotypes, as well as Ptch1 and smoothened (Smo) components of the sonic hedgehog (Shh) mitogenic pathway. Compared to wild‐type cells, &lt;i&gt;Gpr37l1&lt;sup&gt;−/−&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; astrocytes displayed striking increases in proliferative activity, Ptch1 protein expression and internalization, intracellular cholesterol content, ciliary localization of Smo, as well as a marked production of active Shh. Similar effects were reproduced by treating wild‐type astrocytes with a putative prosaptide ligand of Gpr37l1. These findings indicate that Gpr37l1–Ptch1 interactions specifically regulate Ptch1 internalization and trafficking, with consequent stimulation of Shh production and activation of proliferative signaling.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Modulation of the Acetylcholine Receptor Clustering Pathway Improves Neuromuscular Junction Structure and Muscle Strength in a Mouse Model of Congenital Myasthenic Syndrome</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2020.594220</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Introduction: Congenital myasthenic syndromes (CMS) are a diverse group of inherited neuromuscular disorders characterized by a failure of synaptic transmission at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ). CMS often present early with fatigable weakness and can be fatal through respiratory complications. The AGRN gene is one of over 30 genes known to harbor mutations causative for CMS. In this study, we aimed to determine if a compound (NT1654), developed to stimulate the acetylcholine receptor (AChR) clustering pathway, would benefit a mouse model of CMS caused by a loss-of-function mutation in Agrn (Agrn&lt;sup&gt;nmf380&lt;/sup&gt; mouse).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods:Agrn&lt;sup&gt;nmf380&lt;/sup&gt; mice received an injection of either NT1654 or vehicle compound daily, with wild-type litter mates used for comparison. Animals were weighed daily and underwent grip strength assessments. After 30 days of treatment animals were sacrificed, and muscles collected. Investigations into NMJ and muscle morphology were performed on collected tissue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: While minimal improvements in NMJ ultrastructure were observed with electron microscopy, gross NMJ structure analysis using fluorescent labelling and confocal microscopy revealed extensive postsynaptic improvements in Agrn&lt;sup&gt;nmf380&lt;/sup&gt; mice with NT1654 administration, with variables frequently returning to wild type levels. An improvement in muscle weight and myofiber characteristics helped increase forelimb grip strength and body weight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: We conclude that NT1654 restores NMJ postsynaptic structure and improves muscle strength through normalization of muscle fiber composition and the prevention of atrophy. We hypothesize this occurs through the AChR clustering pathway in Agrn&lt;sup&gt;nmf380&lt;/sup&gt; mice. Future studies should investigate if this may represent a viable treatment option for patients with CMS, especially those with mutations in proteins of the AChR clustering pathway.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neural Technology: Beyond Technologies of Electroencephalography-Based Brain-Computer Interfaces: A Systematic Review From Commercial and Ethical Aspects</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.611130</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The deployment of electroencephalographic techniques for commercial applications has undergone a rapid growth in recent decades. As they continue to expand in the consumer markets as suitable techniques for monitoring the brain activity, their transformative potential necessitates equally significant ethical inquiries. One of the main questions, which arises then when evaluating these kinds of applications, is whether they should be aligned or not with the main ethical concerns reported by scholars and experts. Thus, the present work attempts to unify these disciplines of knowledge by performing a comprehensive scan of the major electroencephalographic market applications as well as their most relevant ethical concerns arising from the existing literature. In this literature review, different databases were consulted, which presented conceptual and empirical discussions and findings about commercial and ethical aspects of electroencephalography. Subsequently, the content was extracted from the articles and the main conclusions were presented. Finally, an external assessment of the outcomes was conducted in consultation with an expert panel in some of the topic areas such as biomedical engineering, biomechatronics, and neuroscience. The ultimate purpose of this review is to provide a genuine insight into the cutting-edge practical attempts at electroencephalography. By the same token, it seeks to highlight the overlap between the market needs and the ethical standards that should govern the deployment of electroencephalographic consumer-grade solutions, providing a practical approach that overcomes the engineering myopia of certain ethical discussions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: N2b Reflects the Cognitive Changes in Executive Functioning After Concussion: A Scoping Review</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.601370</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Objectives: The N2b is an event-related potential (ERP) component thought to index higher-order executive function. While the impact of concussion on executive functioning is frequently discussed in the literature, limited research has been done on the role of N2b in evaluating executive functioning in patients with concussion. The aims of this review are to consolidate an understanding of the cognitive functions reflected by the N2b and to account for discrepancies in literature findings regarding the N2b and concussion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: A scoping review was conducted on studies that used the N2b to measure cognitive functioning in healthy control populations, as well as in people with concussions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Sixty-six articles that met inclusion criteria demonstrated that the N2b effectively represents stimulus-response conflict management, response selection, and response inhibition. However, the 19 included articles investigating head injury (using terms such as concussion, mild head injury, and mild traumatic brain injury) found widely varied results: some studies found the amplitude of the N2b to be increased in the concussion group, while others found it to be decreased or unchanged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: Based on the available evidence, differences in the amplitude of the N2b have been linked to response selection, conflict, and inhibition deficits in concussion. However, due to large variations in methodology across studies, findings about the directionality of this effect remain inconclusive. The results of this review suggest that future research should be conducted with greater standardization and consistency.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Researcher Perspectives on Data Sharing in Deep Brain Stimulation</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.578687</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The expansion of research on deep brain stimulation (DBS) and adaptive DBS (aDBS) raises important neuroethics and policy questions related to data sharing. However, there has been little empirical research on the perspectives of experts developing these technologies. We conducted semi-structured, open-ended interviews with aDBS researchers regarding their data sharing practices and their perspectives on ethical and policy issues related to sharing. Researchers expressed support for and a commitment to sharing, with most saying that they were either sharing their data or would share in the future and that doing so was important for advancing the field. However, those who are sharing reported a variety of sharing partners, suggesting heterogeneity in sharing practices and lack of the broad sharing that would reflect principles of open science. Researchers described several concerns and barriers related to sharing, including privacy and confidentiality, the usability of shared data by others, ownership and control of data (including potential commercialization), and limited resources for sharing. They also suggested potential solutions to these challenges, including additional safeguards to address privacy issues, standardization and transparency in analysis to address issues of data usability, professional norms and heightened cooperation to address issues of ownership and control, and streamlining of data transmission to address resource limitations. Researchers also offered a range of views on the sensitivity of neural activity data (NAD) and data related to mental health in the context of sharing. These findings are an important input to deliberations by researchers, policymakers, neuroethicists, and other stakeholders as they navigate ethics and policy questions related to aDBS research.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Frontal Theta Oscillation as a Mechanism for Implicit Gender Stereotype Control: Electrophysiological Evidence From an Extrinsic Affective Simon Task</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.573187</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Previous research has indicated that frontal midline theta (FMθ) reflects a domain-general cognitive control mechanism of the prefrontal cortex. Brain imaging studies have shown that the inhibition of implicit stereotypes was dependent on this domain-general cognitive control mechanism. Based on this knowledge, the present study investigated the neural oscillatory correlates of implicit gender stereotype control in an extrinsic affective Simon task (EAST) using electrophysiological methods. Participants in this task conducted verification to white gender names and colored gender traits, and their behavioral response and electroencephalogram (EEG) were recorded during their performances. As predicted, stereotype-inconsistent trials resulted in reduced response accuracies and slower response times than stereotype-consistent trials. For the event-related potential (ERP) results, the enhanced performance of stereotype-inconsistent trials was accompanied by an enhanced N400 amplitude but an attenuated late positive potential amplitude. In contrast, early attentional components such as P2 and N2 as well as their amplitudes were impacted by the experimental manipulations and individual differences in gender factors. In addition, based on time–frequency (TF) analysis, we found that the enhanced performance of stereotype-inconsistent trials was also accompanied by an event-related synchronization on the frontal theta oscillation. This frontal theta appeared at a late processing stage and persisted across a time window from N400 to late positive potential. Additionally, this enhanced frontal theta effect was not modulated by the experimental manipulations and individual differences in gender factors. Based on these findings, the feature of frontal theta oscillation in the implicit gender stereotype control process was discussed.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Prefrontal Disinhibition in Social Fear: A Vital Action of Somatostatin Interneurons</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.611732</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Social fear and avoidance of social partners and social situations represent the core behavioral symptom of Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD), a prevalent psychiatric disorder worldwide. The pathological mechanism of SAD remains elusive and there are no specific and satisfactory therapeutic options currently available. With the development of appropriate animal models, growing studies start to unravel neuronal circuit mechanisms underlying social fear, and underscore a fundamental role of the prefrontal cortex (PFC). Prefrontal cortical functions are implemented by a finely wired microcircuit composed of excitatory principal neurons (PNs) and diverse subtypes of inhibitory interneurons (INs). Disinhibition, defined as a break in inhibition via interactions between IN subtypes that enhances the output of excitatory PNs, has recently been discovered to serve as an efficient strategy in cortical information processing. Here, we review the rodent animal models of social fear, the prefrontal IN diversity, and their circuits with a particular emphasis on a novel disinhibitory microcircuit mediated by somatostatin-expressing INs in gating social fear behavior. The INs subtype distinct and microcircuit-based mechanism advances our understanding of the etiology of social fear and sheds light on developing future treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders associated with social fear.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Dysfunctional Autophagy and Endolysosomal System in Neurodegenerative Diseases: Relevance and Therapeutic Options</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.602116</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Autophagy and endolysosomal trafficking are crucial in neuronal development, function and survival. These processes ensure efficient removal of misfolded aggregation-prone proteins and damaged organelles, such as dysfunctional mitochondria, thus allowing the maintenance of proper cellular homeostasis. Beside this, emerging evidence has pointed to their involvement in the regulation of the synaptic proteome needed to guarantee an efficient neurotransmitter release and synaptic plasticity. Along this line, an intimate interplay between the molecular machinery regulating synaptic vesicle endocytosis and synaptic autophagy is emerging, suggesting that synaptic quality control mechanisms need to be tightly coupled to neurosecretion to secure release accuracy. Defects in autophagy and endolysosomal pathway have been associated with neuronal dysfunction and extensively reported in Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, Huntington’s and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis among other neurodegenerative diseases, with common features and emerging genetic bases. In this review, we focus on the multiple roles of autophagy and endolysosomal system in neuronal homeostasis and highlight how their defects probably contribute to synaptic default and neurodegeneration in the above-mentioned diseases, discussing the most recent options explored for therapeutic interventions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Age-Dependent Activation and Neuronal Differentiation of Lgr5+ Basal Cells in Injured Olfactory Epithelium via Notch Signaling Pathway</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.602688</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Aging is an important factor affecting function of smell, leading to the degeneration of mature olfactory sensory neurons and inducing the occurrence of smell loss. The mammalian olfactory epithelium (OE) can regenerate when subjected to chemical assaults. However, this capacity is not limitless. Inactivation of globose basal cells and failure to generate sensory neurons are the main obstacles to prevent the OE regeneration. Here, we found the significant attenuation in mature sensory neuronal generation and apparent transcriptional alternation in the OE from aged mice compared with young ones. The recruitment of leucine-rich repeat-containing G-protein coupled receptor 5 (Lgr5)-positive cells in injured OE was weakened in aged mice, and more Lgr5+ cells remained quiescence in aged OE postinjury. Lineage-traced progenies from Lgr5+ cells were significantly fewer in the OE with aging. Moreover, Notch activation enhanced the neuronal regeneration in aged OE, making the regenerative capacity of aged OE comparable with that of young animals after injury. The growth and morphology of three-dimensional (3D)-cultured organoids from the OE of young and aged mice varied and was modulated by small molecules regulating the Notch signaling pathway. Thus, we concluded that activation of Lgr5+ cells in injured OE was age dependent and Notch activation could enhance the capacity of neuronal generation from Lgr5+ cells in aged OE after injury.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: An Integrative Nomogram for Identifying Early-Stage Parkinson's Disease Using Non-motor Symptoms and White Matter-Based Radiomics Biomarkers From Whole-Brain MRI</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.548616</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Purpose: To develop and validate an integrative nomogram based on white matter (WM) radiomics biomarkers and nonmotor symptoms for the identification of early-stage Parkinson's disease (PD).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: The brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and clinical characteristics of 336 subjects, including 168 patients with PD, were collected from the Parkinson's Progress Markers Initiative (PPMI) database. All subjects were randomly divided into training and test sets. According to the baseline MRI scans of patients in the training set, the WM was segmented to extract the radiomic features of each patient and develop radiomics biomarkers, which were then combined with nonmotor symptoms to build an integrative nomogram using machine learning. Finally, the diagnostic accuracy and reliability of the nomogram were evaluated using a receiver operating characteristic curve and test data, respectively. In addition, we investigated 58 patients with atypical PD who had imaging scans without evidence of dopaminergic deficit (SWEDD) to verify whether the nomogram was able to distinguish patients with typical PD from patients with SWEDD. A decision curve analysis was also performed to validate the clinical practicality of the nomogram.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: The area under the curve values of the integrative nomogram for the training, testing and verification sets were 0.937, 0.922, and 0.836, respectively; the specificity values were 83.8, 88.2, and 91.38%, respectively; and the sensitivity values were 84.6, 82.4, and 70.69%, respectively. A significant difference in the number of patients with PD was observed between the high-risk group and the low-risk group based on the nomogram (P &amp;lt; 0.05).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: This integrative nomogram is a new potential method to identify patients with early-stage PD.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience: Neuronal Correlates of Cognitive Control Are Altered in Women With Endometriosis and Chronic Pelvic Pain</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2020.593581</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Endometriosis is a debilitating women's health condition and is the most common cause of chronic pelvic pain. Impaired cognitive control is common in chronic pain conditions, however, it has not yet been investigated in endometriosis. The aim of this study was to explore the neuronal correlates of cognitive control in women with endometriosis. Using a cross-sectional study design with data collected at a single time-point, event-related potentials were elicited during a cued continuous performance test from 20 women with endometriosis (mean age = 28.5 ± 5.2 years) and 20 age- and gender-matched controls (mean age = 28.5 ± 5.2 years). Event-related potential components were extracted and P3 component amplitudes were derived with temporal principal components analysis. Behavioral and ERP outcomes were compared between groups and subjective pain severity was correlated with ERP component amplitudes. No significant behavioral differences were seen in task performance between the groups (all p &amp;gt; 0.094). Target P3b (all p &amp;lt; 0.034) and SW (all p &amp;lt; 0.040), and non-target early P3a (eP3a; all p &amp;lt; 0.023) and late P3a (lP3a; all p &amp;lt; 0.035) amplitudes were smaller for the endometriosis compared to the healthy control group. Lower non-target eP3a (p &amp;lt; 0.001), lP3a (p = 0.013), and SW (p = 0.019) amplitudes were correlated with higher pain severity scores. Findings suggest that endometriosis-associated chronic pelvic pain is linked to alterations in stimulus-response processing and inhibitory control networks, but not impaired behavioral performance, due to compensatory neuroplastic changes in overlapping cognitive control and pain networks.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Accumulation of Cerebrospinal Fluid Glycerophospholipids and Sphingolipids in Cognitively Healthy Participants With Alzheimer’s Biomarkers Precedes Lipolysis in the Dementia Stage</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.611393</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Insight into lipids’ roles in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) pathophysiology is limited because brain membrane lipids have not been characterized in cognitively healthy (CH) individuals. Since age is a significant risk factor of AD, we hypothesize that aging renders the amyloid precursor protein (APP) more susceptible to abnormal processing because of deteriorating membrane lipids. To reflect brain membranes, we studied their lipid components in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and brain-derived CSF nanoparticle membranes. Based on CSF Aβ&lt;sub&gt;42&lt;/sub&gt;/Tau levels established biomarkers of AD, we define a subset of CH participants with normal Aβ&lt;sub&gt;42&lt;/sub&gt;/Tau (CH-NAT) and another group with abnormal or pathological Aβ&lt;sub&gt;42&lt;/sub&gt;/Tau (CH-PAT). We report that glycerophospholipids are differentially metabolized in the CSF supernatant fluid and nanoparticle membrane fractions from CH-NAT, CH-PAT, and AD participants. Phosphatidylcholine molecular species from the supernatant fraction of CH-PAT were higher than in the CH-NAT and AD participants. Sphingomyelin levels in the supernatant fraction were lower in the CH-PAT and AD than in the CH-NAT group. The decrease in sphingomyelin corresponded with an increase in ceramide and dihydroceramide and an increase in the ceramide to sphingomyelin ratio in AD. In contrast to the supernatant fraction, sphingomyelin is higher in the nanoparticle fraction from the CH-PAT group, accompanied by lower ceramide and dihydroceramide and a decrease in the ratio of ceramide to sphingomyelin in CH-PAT compared with CH-NAT. On investigating the mechanism for the lipid changes in AD, we observed that phospholipase A&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (PLA&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) activity was higher in the AD group than the CH groups. Paradoxically, acid and neutral sphingomyelinase (SMase) activities were lower in AD compared to the CH groups. Considering external influences on lipids, the clinical groups did not differ in their fasting blood lipids or dietary lipids, consistent with the CSF lipid changes originating from brain pathophysiology. The lipid accumulation in a prodromal AD biomarker positive stage identifies perturbation of lipid metabolism and disturbances in APP/Amyloid beta (Aβ) as early events in AD pathophysiology. Our results identify increased lipid turnover in CH participants with AD biomarkers, switching to a predominantly lipolytic state in dementia. This knowledge may be useful for targeting and testing new AD treatments.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.588357</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Interactions between two brains constitute the essence of social communication. Daily movements are commonly executed during social interactions and are determined by different mental states that may express different positive or negative behavioral intent. In this context, the effective recognition of festive or violent intent before the action execution remains crucial for survival. Here, we hypothesize that the EEG signals contain the distinctive features characterizing movement intent already expressed before movement execution and that such distinctive information can be identified by state-of-the-art classification algorithms based on Riemannian geometry. We demonstrated for the first time that a classifier based on covariance matrices and Riemannian geometry can effectively discriminate between neutral, festive, and violent mental states only on the basis of non-invasive EEG signals in both the actor and observer participants. These results pave the way for new electrophysiological discrimination of mental states based on non-invasive EEG recordings and cutting-edge machine learning techniques.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Neural and Genetic Bases for Human Ability Traits</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.609170</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The judgement of human ability is ubiquitous, from school admissions to job performance reviews. The exact make-up of ability traits, however, is often narrowly defined and lacks a comprehensive basis. We attempt to simplify the spectrum of human ability, similar to how five personality traits are widely believed to describe most personalities. Finding such a basis for human ability would be invaluable since neuropsychiatric disease diagnoses and symptom severity are commonly related to such differences in performance. Here, we identified four underlying ability traits within the National Institutes of Health Toolbox normative data (n = 1, 369): (1) Motor-endurance, (2) Emotional processing, (3) Executive and cognitive function, and (4) Social interaction. We used the Human Connectome Project young adult dataset (n = 778) to show that Motor-endurance and Executive and cognitive function were reliably associated with specific brain functional networks (r&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.305 ± 0.021), and the biological nature of these ability traits was also shown by calculating their heritability (31 and 49%, respectively) from twin data.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Emotional Reactivity and Regulation in Preschool-Age Children Who Do and Do Not Stutter: Evidence From Autonomic Nervous System Measures</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.600790</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Purpose: This experimental cross-sectional research study examined the emotional reactivity and emotion regulation in preschool-age children who do (CWS) and do not stutter (CWNS) by assessing their psychophysiological response during rest and while viewing pictures from the International Affective Picture System (Lang et al., 2008).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Method: Participants were 18 CWS (16 boys and two girls; mean age 4 years, 5 months) and 18 age- and gender-matched CWNS. Participants' psychophysiological responses were measured during two baselines and two picture viewing conditions. Skin conductance level (SCL) and heart rate were measured to assess emotional reactivity. Respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) was measured to assess emotional regulation. Participants' shyness and executive function were assessed via parent report and considered for their effects on participants' psychophysiological responses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: First, CWNS and CWS did not differ in their initial baseline SCL, heart rate, or RSA, but all participants had higher SCL and lower RSA in the second baseline, subsequent to the first challenge condition, compared to the first baseline. Second, during the challenge conditions, CWS did not differ from CWNS in their SCL, but showed a significantly higher heart rate than CWNS. Third, CWS exhibited a significantly lower RSA during the challenge conditions compared to CWNS. Lastly, the temperamental quality of shyness was associated with preschool-age children's SCL, such that participants who were rated higher in shyness had a higher SCL during the challenge conditions. Participants' executive function had a marginally significant effect on the RSA, such that the participants who had higher executive function composite scores exhibited lower RSA during the challenge conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: Our findings suggest that CWS and CWNS did not differ in their emotional reactivity and emotional regulation abilities at rest. During challenge conditions, however, CWS tended to be more emotionally reactive, as indicated by a higher heart rate, and also employed more emotional regulation, indexed by a greater decrease in RSA, compared to CWNS. Preschool-age children's behavior is largely dominated by reactivity, but there is the emergence of regulation, which can help children adjust to various contextual demands. For CWS who are more emotionally reactive, regulatory skills may be particularly critical to their prognosis and treatment.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Electroencephalogram Access for Emotion Recognition Based on a Deep Hybrid Network</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.589001</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In the human-computer interaction (HCI), electroencephalogram (EEG) access for automatic emotion recognition is an effective way for robot brains to perceive human behavior. In order to improve the accuracy of the emotion recognition, a method of EEG access for emotion recognition based on a deep hybrid network was proposed in this paper. Firstly, the collected EEG was decomposed into four frequency band signals, and the multiscale sample entropy (MSE) features of each frequency band were extracted. Secondly, the constructed 3D MSE feature matrices were fed into a deep hybrid network for autonomous learning. The deep hybrid network was composed of a continuous convolutional neural network (CNN) and hidden Markov models (HMMs). Lastly, HMMs trained with multiple observation sequences were used to replace the artificial neural network classifier in the CNN, and the emotion recognition task was completed by HMM classifiers. The proposed method was applied to the DEAP dataset for emotion recognition experiments, and the average accuracy could achieve 79.77% on arousal, 83.09% on valence, and 81.83% on dominance. Compared with the latest related methods, the accuracy was improved by 0.99% on valence and 14.58% on dominance, which verified the effectiveness of the proposed method.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Anodal Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation of Anterior Cingulate Cortex Modulates Subcortical Brain Regions Resulting in Cognitive Enhancement</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.584136</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) has been widely utilized in research settings and modulates brain activity. The application of anodal tDCS on the prefrontal cortex has indicated improvement in cognitive functioning. The cingulate cortex, situated in the medial aspect of the prefrontal cortex, has been identified as a core region performing cognitive functions. Most of the previous studies investigating the impact of stimulation on the prefrontal cortex stimulated the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), however, the impact of stimulation on cingulate has not been explored. The current study investigates the effect of stimulation on the resting-state functional connectivity of the anterior cingulate cortex with other regions of the brain and changes in behavioral results in a color-word Stroop task, which has repeatedly elicited activation in different regions of the cingulate. Twenty subjects were randomly assigned to the experimental and sham group, and their medial prefrontal area was stimulated using MRI compatible tDCS. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) and cognitive Stroop task were monitored before, during, and after the stimulation. Neuroimaging results indicated a significant decrease in resting-state functional connectivity in the experimental group during and after stimulation as compared to before stimulation in two clusters including right insular cortex, right central operculum cortex, right frontal operculum cortex and right planum polare with the left anterior cingulate cortex (L-ACC) selected as the seed. The behavioral results indicated a significant decrease in reaction time (RT) following stimulation in the experimental group compared to the sham group. Moreover, the change in functional connectivity in subcortical regions with L-ACC as the seed and change in RT was positively correlated. The results demonstrated that ACC has a close functional relationship with the subcortical regions, and stimulation of ACC can modulate these connections, which subsequently improves behavioral performance, thus, providing another potential target of stimulation for cognitive enhancement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clinical Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04318522.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience: Comparing Theories for the Maintenance of Late LTP and Long-Term Memory: Computational Analysis of the Roles of Kinase Feedback Pathways and Synaptic Reactivation</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2020.569349</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A fundamental neuroscience question is how memories are maintained from days to a lifetime, given turnover of proteins that underlie expression of long-term synaptic potentiation (LTP) or “tag” synapses as eligible for LTP. A likely solution relies on synaptic positive feedback loops, prominently including persistent activation of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;/calmodulin kinase II (CaMKII) and self-activated synthesis of protein kinase M ζ (PKMζ). Data also suggest positive feedback based on recurrent synaptic reactivation within neuron assemblies, or engrams, is necessary to maintain memories. The relative importance of these mechanisms is controversial. To explore the likelihood that each mechanism is necessary or sufficient to maintain memory, we simulated maintenance of LTP with a simplified model incorporating persistent kinase activation, synaptic tagging, and preferential reactivation of strong synapses, and analyzed implications of recent data. We simulated three model variants, each maintaining LTP with one feedback loop: autonomous, self-activated PKMζ synthesis (model variant I); self-activated CamKII (model variant II); and recurrent reactivation of strengthened synapses (model variant III). Variant I predicts that, for successful maintenance of LTP, either 1) PKMζ contributes to synaptic tagging, or 2) a low constitutive tag level persists during maintenance independent of PKMζ, or 3) maintenance of LTP is independent of tagging. Variant II maintains LTP and suggests persistent CaMKII activation could maintain PKMζ activity, a feedforward interaction not previously considered. However, we note data challenging the CaMKII feedback loop. In Variant III synaptic reactivation drives, and thus predicts, recurrent or persistent activation of CamKII and other necessary kinases, plausibly contributing to persistent elevation of PKMζ levels. Reactivation is thus predicted to sustain recurrent rounds of synaptic tagging and incorporation of plasticity-related proteins. We also suggest (model variant IV) that synaptic reactivation and autonomous kinase activation could synergistically maintain LTP. We propose experiments that could discriminate these maintenance mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Electrophysiological Profile Remodeling via Selective Suppression of Voltage-Gated Currents by CLN1/PPT1 Overexpression in Human Neuronal-Like Cells</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.569598</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;CLN1 disease (OMIM #256730) is an inherited neurological disorder of early childhood with epileptic seizures and premature death. It is associated with mutations in CLN1 coding for Palmitoyl-Protein Thioesterase 1 (PPT1), a lysosomal enzyme which affects the recycling and degradation of lipid-modified (S-acylated) proteins by removing palmitate residues. Transcriptomic evidence from a neuronal-like cellular model derived from differentiated SH-SY5Y cells disclosed the potential negative roles of CLN1 overexpression, affecting the elongation of neuronal processes and the expression of selected proteins of the synaptic region. Bioinformatic inquiries of transcriptomic data pinpointed a dysregulated expression of several genes coding for proteins related to voltage-gated ion channels, including subunits of calcium and potassium channels (VGCC and VGKC). In SH-SY5Y cells overexpressing CLN1 (SH-CLN1 cells), the resting potential and the membrane conductance in the range of voltages close to the resting potential were not affected. However, patch-clamp recordings indicated a reduction of Ba&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; currents through VGCC of SH-CLN1 cells; Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; imaging revealed reduced Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; influx in the same cellular setting. The results of the biochemical and morphological investigations of CACNA2D2/α&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;δ-2, an accessory subunit of VGCC, were in accordance with the downregulation of the corresponding gene and consistent with the hypothesis that a lower number of functional channels may reach the plasma membrane. The combined use of 4-AP and NS-1643, two drugs with opposing effects on K&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;11 and K&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;12 subfamilies of VGKC coded by the KCNH gene family, provides evidence for reduced functional K&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;12 channels in SH-CLN1 cells, consistent with transcriptomic data indicating the downregulation of KCNH4. The lack of compelling evidence supporting the palmitoylation of many ion channels subunits investigated in this study stimulates inquiries about the role of PPT1 in the trafficking of channels to the plasma membrane. Altogether, these results indicate a reduction of functional voltage-gated ion channels in response to CLN1/PPT1 overexpression in differentiated SH-SY5Y cells and provide new insights into the altered neuronal excitability which may underlie the severe epileptic phenotype of CLN1 disease. It remains to be shown if remodeling of such functional channels on plasma membrane can occur as a downstream effect of CLN1 disease.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.618538</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Background and Objective: Ventricle volume is closely related to hydrocephalus, brain atrophy, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's syndrome, and other diseases. To accurately measure the volume of the ventricles for elderly patients, we use deep learning to establish a systematic and comprehensive automated ventricle segmentation framework.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: The study participation included 20 normal elderly people, 20 patients with cerebral atrophy, 64 patients with normal pressure hydrocephalus, and 51 patients with acquired hydrocephalus. Second, get their imaging data through the picture archiving and communication systems (PACS) system. Then use ITK software to manually label participants' ventricular structures. Finally, extract imaging features through machine learning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: This automated ventricle segmentation method can be applied not only to CT and MRI images but also to images with different scan slice thicknesses. More importantly, it produces excellent segmentation results (Dice &amp;gt; 0.9).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: This automated ventricle segmentation method has wide applicability and clinical practicability. It can help clinicians find early disease, diagnose disease, understand the patient's disease progression, and evaluate the patient's treatment effect.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Brain NAD Is Associated With ATP Energy Production and Membrane Phospholipid Turnover in Humans</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.609517</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The brain requires a large amount of energy, mostly derived from the metabolism of glucose, which decreases substantially with age and neurological diseases. While mounting evidence in model organisms illustrates the central role of brain nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) for maintaining energy homeostasis, similar data are sparse in humans. This study explores the correlations between brain NAD, energy production and membrane phospholipid metabolism by 31-phosphorous magnetic resonance spectroscopy (&lt;sup&gt;31&lt;/sup&gt;P-MRS) across 50 healthy participants including a young (mean age 27.1-year-old) and middle-aged (mean age 56.4-year-old) group. The analysis revealed that brain NAD level and NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/NADH redox ratio were positively associated with ATP level and the rate of energy production, respectively. Moreover, a metabolic network linking NAD with membrane phospholipid metabolism, energy production, and aging was identified. An inverted trend between age and NAD level was detected. These results pave the way for the use of &lt;sup&gt;31&lt;/sup&gt;P-MRS as a powerful non-invasive tool to support the development of new therapeutic interventions targeting NAD associated phospho-metabolic pathways in brain aging and neurological diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>
