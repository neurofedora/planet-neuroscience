	<content:encoded>Deafness causes speech to deteriorate, but whether this deterioration reflects an active or passive process is unclear. Birdsong – a learned vocal behavior that resembles speech in its dependence on auditory feedback – also deteriorates following deafening. In their 2000 paper, Brainard and Doupe showed that, following deafening, birdsong deteriorates through an active process mediated by a cortex–basal ganglia (BG) circuit.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>In the late 1970s, key discoveries in neurophysiology, psychophysics, computer vision, and image processing had reached a tipping point that would shape visual science for decades to come. David Marr and Ellen Hildreth’s ‘Theory of edge detection’, published in 1980, set out to integrate the newly available wealth of data from behavioral, physiological, and computational approaches in a unifying theory. Although their work had wide and enduring ramifications, their most important contribution may have been to consolidate the foundations of the ongoing dialogue between theoretical and empirical vision science.</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: An open source tool for automatic spatiotemporal assessment of calcium transients and local ‘signal-close-to-noise’ activity in calcium imaging data</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/8fH_ykpqpmQ/article</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Juan Prada, Manju Sasi, Corinna Martin, Sibylle Jablonka, Thomas Dandekar, Robert Blum&lt;/p&gt;

Local and spontaneous calcium signals play important roles in neurons and neuronal networks. Spontaneous or cell-autonomous calcium signals may be difficult to assess because they appear in an unpredictable spatiotemporal pattern and in very small neuronal loci of axons or dendrites. We developed an open source bioinformatics tool for an unbiased assessment of calcium signals in x,y-t imaging series. The tool bases its algorithm on a continuous wavelet transform-guided peak detection to identify calcium signal candidates. The highly sensitive calcium event definition is based on identification of peaks in 1D data through analysis of a 2D wavelet transform surface. For spatial analysis, the tool uses a grid to separate the x,y-image field in independently analyzed grid windows. A document containing a graphical summary of the data is automatically created and displays the loci of activity for a wide range of signal intensities. Furthermore, the number of activity events is summed up to create an estimated total activity value, which can be used to compare different experimental situations, such as calcium activity before or after an experimental treatment. All traces and data of active loci become documented. The tool can also compute the signal variance in a sliding window to visualize activity-dependent signal fluctuations. We applied the calcium signal detector to monitor activity states of cultured mouse neurons. Our data show that both the total activity value and the variance area created by a sliding window can distinguish experimental manipulations of neuronal activity states. Notably, the tool is powerful enough to compute local calcium events and ‘signal-close-to-noise’ activity in small loci of distal neurites of neurons, which remain during pharmacological blockade of neuronal activity with inhibitors such as tetrodotoxin, to block action potential firing, or inhibitors of ionotropic glutamate receptors. The tool can also offer information about local homeostatic calcium activity events in neurites.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/8fH_ykpqpmQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>RSS PAP: Differences in the Electrophysiological Properties of Mouse Somatosensory Layer 2/3 Neurons in Vivo and Slice Stem from Intrinsic Sources Rather than a Network-Generated High Conductance State</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0447-17.2018v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Synaptic activity &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; can potentially alter the integration properties of neurons. Using recordings in awake mice, we targeted somatosensory layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons and compared neuronal properties with those from slices. Pyramidal cells &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; had lower resistance and gain values, as well as broader spikes and increased spike frequency adaptation compared to the same cells in slices. Increasing conductance in neurons using dynamic clamp to levels observed &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;, however, did not lessen the differences between &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; and slice conditions. Further, local application of tetrodotoxin &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; blocked synaptic-mediated membrane voltage fluctuations, but had little impact on pyramidal cell membrane input resistance and time constant values. Differences in electrophysiological properties of layer 2/3 neurons in mouse somatosensory cortex, therefore, stem from intrinsic sources separate from synaptic-mediated membrane voltage fluctuations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Neurons &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; are often modeled as being in a high conductance state arising from intense synaptic activity in awake conditions. Outside of the expected reduction in membrane time constant, it remains unclear if other features are altered &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. Here we show that cellular properties between mouse somatosensory neurons &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; and slices differ substantially in terms of spike shape, input-output responses, and subthreshold membrane resistance. Increasing the membrane conductance of neurons in slices to match values observed at rest &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;, however, does not generate properties consistent with those observed &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. Differences in the properties of mouse somatosensory layer 2/3 pyramidal cells &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; and slices, therefore, are not the product of a network-generated high conductance state.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Cytoskeletal components, such as tubulins and actins, have the remarkable ability to organize themselves into filaments and networks to support specialized and compartmentalized functions. Alterations in cytoskeletal proteins have long been associated with a variety of neurodevelopmental disorders. This review focuses on recent findings, primarily from forward genetic screens in Caenorhabditis elegans that illustrate how different tubulin protein isotypes can play distinct roles in neuronal development and function. Additionally, we discuss studies revealing new regulators of the actin cytoskeleton, and highlight recent technological advances in in vivo imaging and functional dissection of the neuronal cytoskeleton. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content:encoded>

These limitations reflect what has been dichotomy between the structure and mechanical properties of living brain tissue and non-living neural probes. To bridge the gap between neural and electronic networks, we have introduced the new concept of mesh electronics probes designed with structural and mechanical properties such that the implant begins to ‘look and behave’ like neural tissue. Syringe-implanted mesh electronics have led to the realization of probes that are neuro-attractive and free of the chronic immune response, as well as capable of stable long-term mapping and modulation of brain activity at the single-neuron level. This review provides a historical overview of a 10-year development of mesh electronics by highlighting the tissue-like design, syringe-assisted delivery, seamless neural tissue integration, and single-neuron level chronic recording stability of mesh electronics. We also offer insights on unique near-term opportunities and future directions for neuroscience and neurology that now are available or expected for mesh electronics neurotechnologies. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content:encoded>

Human neuroimaging studies consistently show a hunger-dependent, selective enhancement of responses to images of food in association cortex and amygdala. More recently, cellular-resolution imaging combined with circuit mapping experiments in behaving mice have revealed underlying neuronal population dynamics and enabled tracing of pathways by which hunger circuits influence the assignment of value to visual objects in visual association cortex, insular cortex, and amygdala. These experiments begin to provide a mechanistic understanding of motivation-specific neural processing of need-relevant cues in healthy humans and in disease states such as obesity and other eating disorders. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content:encoded>

A recent explosion of technical advances in genome-editing and single-cell sequencing has enabled lineage analysis in an unprecedented scale, speed, and depth across different species.

Safe propagation of action potentials relies on specific ion channel expression at strategic points of the axon such as nodes of Ranvier or axonal branch points. However, while action potentials are generally considered as the quantum of neuronal information, their signaling is not entirely digital. In fact, both their shape and their conduction speed have been shown to be modulated by activity, leading to regulations of synaptic latency and synaptic strength. We report here newly identified mechanisms of (1) safe spike propagation along the axon, (2) compartmentalization of action potential shape in the axon, (3) analog modulation of spike-evoked synaptic transmission and (4) alteration in conduction time after persistent regulation of axon morphology in central neurons. We discuss the contribution of these regulations in information processing. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content:encoded>

This neural activity reflects internal processes by which the brain plans and executes volitional movements. The study of motor planning offers an opportunity to understand how the structure and dynamics of neural circuits support persistent internal states and how these states influence behavior. Recent advances in large-scale neural recordings are beginning to decipher the relationship of the dynamics of populations of neurons during motor planning and movements. New behavioral tasks in rodents, together with quantified perturbations, link dynamics in specific nodes of neural circuits to behavior. These studies reveal a neural network distributed across multiple brain regions that collectively supports motor planning. We review recent advances and highlight areas where further work is needed to achieve a deeper understanding of the mechanisms underlying motor planning and related cognitive processes. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content:encoded>

To be effective, these systems must be able to simultaneously record and stimulate neural activity, a task made difficult by persistent stimulation artifacts that distort and obscure underlying biomarkers. To enable simultaneous stimulation and recording, several techniques have been proposed. These techniques involve artifact-preventing system configurations, resilient recording front-ends, and back-end signal processing for removing recorded artifacts. Co-designing and integrating these artifact cancellation techniques will be key to enabling neuromodulation systems to stimulate and record at the same time. Here, we review the state-of-the-art for these techniques and their role in achieving artifact-free neuromodulation. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content:encoded>

With the development of sensitive genetically encoded calcium indicators, this has extended to the whole-brain imaging of neural activity with cellular resolution. This technique has been used to study brain-wide population dynamics accompanying sensory processing and sensorimotor transformations, and has spurred the development of innovative closed-loop behavioral paradigms in which stimulus–response relationships can be studied. More recently, microscopes have been developed that allow whole-brain calcium imaging in freely swimming and behaving larvae. In this review, we highlight the technologies underlying whole-brain functional imaging in zebrafish, provide examples of the sensory and motor processes that have been studied with this technique, and discuss the need to merge data from whole-brain functional imaging studies with neurochemical and anatomical information to develop holistic models of functional neural circuits. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content:encoded>

They deliver low-noise recordings from hundreds of neurons, providing a step change in the type of data available to neuroscientists.

With vast cell number and diversity, mammalian nervous systems present a daunting challenge for achieving specific and comprehensive cell type access—prerequisite to circuit analysis. Genetic approaches in the mouse have relied on germline engineering to access marker-defined cell populations. Combinatorial strategies that engage marker intersection, anatomy and projection pattern (e.g. antero-grade and retro-grade viral vectors), and developmental lineage substantially increase the specificity of cell type targeting. While increasing number of mouse cell types are becoming experimentally accessible, comprehensive coverage requires larger coordinated efforts with strategic infrastructural and fiscal planning. CRISPR-based genome editing may enable cell type access in other species, but issues of time, cost and ethics remain, especially for primates. Novel approaches that bypass the germline, such as somatic cell engineering and cell surface-based gene delivery, may reduce the barrier of genetic access to mammalian cell types. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content:encoded>

Despite extensive characterization of individual brain areas involved in parental care, we do not fully understand how discrete aspects of this behavior are orchestrated at the neural circuit level. Recent progress in identifying genetically specified neuronal populations critical for parenting, and the use of genetic and viral tools for circuit-cracking now allow us to deconstruct the underlying circuitry and, thus, to elucidate how different aspects of parental care are controlled. Here we review the latest advances, outline possible organizational principles of parental circuits and discuss future challenges. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content:encoded>

Autocrine signals have been discovered in many neuronal contexts, providing insights into their regulation and function. The growing realization of the importance of cell-autonomous signaling stems from advances in both conditional genetic approaches and in sophisticated analyses of growth factor dynamics, which combine to enable rigorous in vivo dissection of signaling pathways. Here we review recent studies defining autocrine roles for growth factors such as BDNF, and classical morphogens, including Wnts and BMPs, in regulating neuronal development and plasticity. Collectively, these studies highlight an intimate relationship between activity-dependent autocrine signaling and synaptic plasticity, and further suggest a common principle for coordinating paracrine and autocrine signaling in the nervous system. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content:encoded>

When synaptic vesicles fuse with the plasma membrane, these membranes and the attached proteins are endocytosed and either recycled or degraded. This turnover needs to be tightly regulated in a timely and spatially confined manner. Increasing evidence suggests that these mechanisms do not only serve for the removal of defective synaptic vesicles or structural proteins of the active zone but also contribute to pathways regulating synaptic strength. The corresponding presynaptic autophagy system thus appears also important for synaptic maintenance and plasticity. Exciting new studies provide evidence how the autophagy machinery recognizes and degrades synaptic components and lay the ground to understand how autophagy in the presynaptic compartment contributes to modulation and maintenance of synaptic function. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content:encoded>

During synchronous neurotransmission release is precisely coupled to action potentials, in contrast, asynchronous release events show only loose temporal coupling to presynaptic activity whereas spontaneous neurotransmission occurs independent of presynaptic activity. The mechanisms that give rise to this diversity in neurotransmitter release modes are poorly understood. Recent studies have described several presynaptic molecular pathways controlling synaptic vesicle pool segregation and recycling, which in turn may dictate distinct modes of neurotransmitter release. In this article, we review this recent work regarding neurotransmitter release modes and their relationship to synaptic vesicle pool dynamics as well as the molecular machinery that establishes synaptic vesicle pool identity. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content:encoded>

Individual network components in the mushroom bodies of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster represent cues, learning signals and behavioral outcomes of learned experience. Recent findings have highlighted the importance of dopamine-driven plasticity and activity in feedback and feedforward connections, between various elements of the mushroom body neural network. These computational motifs have been shown to be crucial for long term olfactory memory consolidation, integration of internal states, re-evaluation and updating of learned information. The often recurrent circuit anatomy and a prolonged requirement for activity in parts of these underlying networks, suggest that self-sustained and precisely timed activity is a fundamental feature of network computations in the insect brain. Together these processes allow flies to continuously adjust the content of their learned knowledge and direct their behavior in a way that best represents learned expectations and serves their most pressing current needs. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content:encoded>

These devices, usually sensing cell activity via microelectrodes, should be characterized by safe working conditions in the biological milieu together with a well-controlled operation-life. The stable device/neuronal electrical coupling at the interface requires tight interactions between the electrode surface and the cell membrane. This neuro-electrode hybrid represents the hyphen between the soft nature of neural tissue, generating electrical signals via ion motions, and the rigid realm of microelectronics and medical devices, dealing with electrons in motion. Efficient integration of these entities is essential for monitoring, analyzing and controlling neuronal signaling but poses significant technological challenges. Improving the cell/electrode interaction and thus the interface performance requires novel engineering of (nano)materials: tuning at the nanoscale electrode's properties may lead to engineer interfacing probes that better camouflaged with their biological target. In this brief review, we highlight the most recent concepts in nanotechnologies and nanomaterials that might help reducing the mismatch between tissue and electrode, focusing on the device's mechanical properties and its biological integration with the tissue. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/292557v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Repeated testing leads to improved long-term memory retention compared to repeated study, but the mechanism underlying this improvement remains controversial. In this work, we test the hypothesis that retrieval practice benefits subsequent recall by reducing competition from related memories. This hypothesis implies that the degree of reduction in competition between retrieval practice attempts should predict subsequent memory for practiced items. To test this prediction, we collected electroencephalography (EEG) data across two sessions. In the first session, participants practiced selectively retrieving exemplars from superordinate semantic categories (high competition), as well as retrieving the names of the superordinate categories from exemplars (low competition). In the second session, participants repeatedly studied and were tested on Swahili-English vocabulary. One week after session two, participants were again tested on the vocabulary. We trained a within-subject classifier on the data from session one to distinguish high and low competition states. We then used this classifier to measure competition across multiple retrieval practice attempts in the second session. The degree to which competition decreased for a given vocabulary word predicted whether that item was subsequently remembered in the third session. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that repeated testing improves retention by reducing competition.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/292508v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Attention can be involuntarily captured by physically salient stimuli, a phenomenon known as bottom-up attention. Typically, these salient stimuli occur unpredictably in time and space. Therefore, in a series of three behavioral experiments, we investigated the extent to which such bottom-up attentional capture is a function of one's prior expectations. In the context of an exogenous cueing task, we systematically manipulated participants' spatial (Experiment 1) or temporal (Experiment 2 and 3) expectations about an uninformative cue, and examined the extent of attentional capture by the cue. We anticipated larger attentional capture for unexpected compared to expected cues. However, while we observed robust attentional capture in all experiments, we did not find any evidence for a modulation of attentional capture by prior expectation. This underscores the automatic and reflexive nature of bottom-up attention.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/292250v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>A wide range of motor function declines with aging. Motor adaptation, which occurs when participants learn to reach accurately to a target despite a perturbation, does not deviate from this rule. There are currently three major hypotheses that have been put forward to explain this age-related decline in adaptation: deterioration of internal model recalibration due to age-related cerebellar degeneration, impairment of the cognitive component of motor adaptation, and deficit in the retention of the learned movement. In the present study, we systematically investigated these three hypotheses and demonstrate that age-related deficits in motor adaptation are not due to impaired internal model recalibration or impaired retention of motor memory. Rather, we found that the cognitive component was reduced in older people. Therefore, our study suggests the interesting possibility that cerebellar-based mechanisms do not deteriorate with age despite cerebellar degeneration. In contrast, internal model recalibration appears to compensate for deficits in the cognitive component of this type of learning.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/292193v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Stroke often results in hemiparesis, leaving one side of the body affected relative to the other side. Prior research has shown that the affected arm has higher variability, however, the extent to which this variability can be modulated is unclear. Here we used a shared bimanual task to examine the degree to which participants could modulate the variability in the affected arm after stroke. Participants with chronic stroke (n = 11), and age-matched controls (n = 11) performed unimanual and bimanual reaching movements to move a cursor on a screen to different targets. In the unimanual condition, the cursor was controlled only by the movement of a single arm whereas in the bimanual condition, the cursor position was shared between the two arms by using a weighted average of the two hand positions. Unknown to the participants, we altered the weightings of the affected and unaffected arms to cursor motion and examined how the movement variability on each arm changed depending on its contribution to the task. Results showed that stroke survivors had higher movement variability on the affected arm, however, like age-matched controls, they were able to modulate the variability in both the affected and unaffected arms according to the weighting condition. Specifically, as the weighting on a particular arm increased (i.e. it became more important to the task), the movement variability decreased. These results show that stroke survivors are capable of modulating variability depending on the task context, and this feature may potentially be exploited for rehabilitation paradigms.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>The way in which the central nervous system (CNS) governs animal movement is complex and difficult to solve solely by the analyses of muscle movement patterns. We tackle this problem by observing the activity of a large population of neurons in the CNS of larval Drosophila. We focused on two major behaviors of the larvae, forward and backward locomotion, and analyzed the neuronal activity related to these behaviors during fictive locomotion that spontaneously occurs in the isolated CNS. We expressed genetically-encoded calcium indicator, GCaMP, and a nuclear marker in all neurons and used digital scanned light-sheet microscopy to record neural activities in the entire ventral nerve cord at a fast frame rate. We developed image processing tools that automatically detect the cell position based on the nuclear staining and allocate the activity signals to each detected cell. We also applied a machine learning-based method that we developed recently to assign motor status in each time frame. Based on these methods, we find cells whose activity is biased to forward versus backward locomotion and vice versa. In particular, we identified a group of neurons near the boundary of subesophageal zone (SEZ) and thoracic neuromeres, which are strongly active during an early phase of backward but not forward fictive locomotion. Our experimental procedure and computational pipeline enable systematic identification of neurons to show characteristic motor activities in larval Drosophila.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Dorsal Hippocampal Activation Suppresses Neuropathic Pain Behaviors: Chronic pain as extinction-resistant pain-related memory traces</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/292094v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Accumulating evidence suggests the hippocampus being involved in, and modified with, chronic neuropathic pain. However, it is still not clear whether hippocampal activity has direct control over neuropathic behaviors. Here we show that activation of the dorsal, but not ventral, hippocampus, by glutamate microinjection or by chemogenetically increasing excitability (PSAM/PSEM), completely or partially reversed neuropathic behaviors: tactile allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia in the models of spared nerve injury and lumbar spinal nerve ligation. Using a new methodology (chemo-fMRI), where we combine awake resting state brain imaging with viral vector mediated chemogenetic activation (PSAM/PSEM), we could demonstrate that increased excitability of dorsal hippocampus neurons altered resting state functional connectivity within circuitry specifically related to the extent of diminution of neuropathic behavior (tactile allodynia). The identified circuitry most reliably (survived a validation procedure) identified dorsal hippocampal connections to the somatosensory cortex and the thalamus. Moreover, anterograde tracing indicated non-overlapping projections from dorsal and ventral hippocampus. Thus, the present study exhibits a novel causal role for the dorsal hippocampus, and mediating circuitry, controlling neuropathic pain-related behaviors. Altogether, these results imply downregulation of dorsal hippocampus circuitry in chronic neuropathic pain; the activation of which reverses pain behaviors either through disruption of accumulated memories and/or by enhancing extinction circuitry.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Task activations produce spurious but systematic inflation of task functional connectivity estimates</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/292045v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Task-state functional connections - such as those measured using functional MRI (fMRI) - are thought to coordinate distributed cognitive processes throughout the brain. Utilizing a neural mass computational model we found that the conversion of neural signals into fMRI hemodynamic responses substantially and inappropriately inflates task-state functional connectivity (FC) estimates (temporal correlations). Such activation-induced inflation of task FC estimates was postulated previously, but this phenomenon has not been conclusively established either theoretically or empirically, leading many task FC studies to simply ignore the issue. We found that activation-based task FC inflation was primarily driven by task-evoked fMRI activations introducing a similar hemodynamic response shape to underlying neural time series. This demonstrates that isolating task-state network changes from task-evoked activations is essential for ensuring discovery of unique functional network effects, independent of mechanistically-distinct activation effects. Standard approaches for fitting and removing task-evoked activations were unable to correct these inflated correlations. In contrast, methods that flexibly fit hemodynamic response shapes (especially finite impulse response-based regression) effectively corrected the inflated correlations. Results with empirical fMRI data confirmed the model's predictions, revealing activation-induced task FC inflation for both Pearson correlation and psychophysiological interaction approaches. These results demonstrate that removal of task activations using an approach that flexibly models hemodynamic response shape is an essential preprocessing step for valid estimation of task-state FC with fMRI.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Some patients with medically refractory focal epilepsy are chronically implanted with a brain-responsive neurostimulation device (the RNS System), permitting neurophysiological measurements at millisecond resolution. This clinical device can be adapted to measure hippocampal dynamics time-locked to cognitive tasks. We illustrate the technique with a proof of concept in three patients previously implanted with the RNS System as they engage in an associative memory task, measured months apart. Hippocampal activity measured in successful encoding in RNS System patients mirrors that in surgical patients during intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG), suggesting that chronic iEEG allows sensitive measurements of hippocampal physiology over prolonged timescales.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/291377v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>In the adult and developing brain, G protein-regulated inducer of neurite outgrowth 1 (GPRIN1) is a downstream effector for Go/i/z proteins that promotes neurite outgrowth. However, so far, the physiological role of GPRIN1 in brain health has not been reported. We generated a viable GPRIN1 whole-body knockout mouse to assess its physiological role in synaptic function both ex vivo and in vivo. In adult neurons, GPRIN1 is highly localized to the plasma membrane and synapses where it regulates neuronal signal transduction and Ca2+ homeostasis. Our results reveal that GPRIN1 might be a novel protein involved in agonist-stimulated cytoskeletal reorganization, which is crucial for early neuronal network development and in functionally mature neurons. Finally, we show that loss of GPRIN1 leads to a learning deficit in vivo and sensitizes neurons to stress, suggesting a modulatory role in brain health and disease.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/291245v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Variability is a fundamental feature of human brain activity that is particularly pronounced during development. However, developmental neuroimaging research has only recently begun to move beyond characterizing brain function across development exclusively in terms of magnitude of neural activation to incorporating estimates of variability. No prior neuroimaging study has done so in the domain of emotion regulation. We investigated how age and affective experiences influence spatial and temporal variability in neural activity during emotion regulation. In the current study, 70 typically developing youth aged 8-17 years completed a cognitive reappraisal task of emotion regulation while undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging. Estimates of spatial and temporal variability during emotion regulation were calculated across a network of brain regions, defined a priori, and were then related to age and affective experiences. Results showed that increasing age was associated with reduced spatial and temporal variability in a set of frontoparietal regions (e.g., dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, superior parietal lobule) known to be involved in effortful emotion regulation. In addition, youth who reported less negative affect during emotion regulation had less spatial variability in the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex. We interpret age-related reductions in spatial and temporal variability as evidence of neural specialization. These results imply that the development of emotion regulation is undergirded by a process of neural specialization and open up a host of possibilities for incorporating neural variability into the study of emotion regulation development.</content:encoded>

RNA-protein binding is critical to gene regulation, controlling fundamental processes including splicing, translation, localization and stability, and aberrant RNA-protein interactions are known to play a role in a wide variety of diseases. However, molecular understanding of RNA-protein interactions remains limited; in particular, identification of RNA motifs that bind proteins has long been challenging, especially when such motifs depend on both sequence and structure. Moreover, although RNA binding proteins (RBPs) often contain more than one binding domain, algorithms capable of identifying more than one binding motif simultaneously have not been developed. In this paper we present a novel pipeline to determine binding peaks in crosslinking immunoprecipitation (CLIP) data, to discover multiple possible RNA sequence/structure motifs among them, and to experimentally validate such motifs. At the core is a new semi-automatic algorithm SARNAclust, the first unsupervised method to identify and deconvolve multiple sequence/structure motifs simultaneously. SARNAclust computes similarity between sequence/structure objects using a graph kernel, providing the ability to isolate the impact of specific features through the bulge graph formalism. Application of SARNAclust to synthetic data shows its capability of clustering 5 motifs at once with a V-measure value of over 0.95, while GraphClust achieves only a V-measure of 0.083 and RNAcontext cannot detect any of the motifs. When applied to existing eCLIP sets, SARNAclust finds known motifs for SLBP and HNRNPC and novel motifs for several other RBPs such as AGGF1, AKAP8L and ILF3. We demonstrate an experimental validation protocol, a targeted Bind-n-Seq-like high-throughput sequencing approach that relies on RNA inverse folding for oligo pool design, that can validate the components within the SLBP motif. Finally, we use this protocol to experimentally interrogate the SARNAclust motif predictions for protein ILF3. Our results support a newly identified partially double-stranded UUUUUGAGA motif similar to that known for the splicing factor HNRNPC.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Sk4-TYwKrLk&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Quantitative reasoning and techniques are increasingly ubiquitous across the life sciences. However, new graduate researchers with a biology background are often not equipped with the skills that are required to utilize such techniques correctly and efficiently. In parallel, there are increasing numbers of engineers, mathematicians, and physical scientists interested in studying problems in biology with only basic knowledge of this field. Students from such varied backgrounds can struggle to engage proactively together to tackle problems in biology. There is therefore a need to establish bridges between those disciplines. It is our proposal that the beginning of graduate school is the appropriate time to initiate those bridges through an interdisciplinary short course. We have instigated an intensive 10-day course that brought together new graduate students in the life sciences from across departments within the National University of Singapore. The course aimed at introducing biological problems as well as some of the quantitative approaches commonly used when tackling those problems. We have run the course for three years with over 100 students attending. Building on this experience, we share 11 quick tips on how to run such an effective, interdisciplinary short course for new graduate students in the biosciences.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/lgYLCd2q9tA&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Cloud computing has revolutionized the development and operations of hardware and software across diverse technological arenas, yet academic biomedical research has lagged behind despite the numerous and weighty advantages that cloud computing offers. Biomedical researchers who embrace cloud computing can reap rewards in cost reduction, decreased development and maintenance workload, increased reproducibility, ease of sharing data and software, enhanced security, horizontal and vertical scalability, high availability, a thriving technology partner ecosystem, and much more. Despite these advantages that cloud-based workflows offer, the majority of scientific software developed in academia does not utilize cloud computing and must be migrated to the cloud by the user. In this article, we present 11 quick tips for architecting biomedical informatics workflows on compute clouds, distilling knowledge gained from experience developing, operating, maintaining, and distributing software and virtualized appliances on the world’s largest cloud. Researchers who follow these tips stand to benefit immediately by migrating their workflows to cloud computing and embracing the paradigm of abstraction.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/C7tl3DiTInM&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>RSS PAP: Reduced Orexin System Function Contributes to Resilience to Repeated Social Stress</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0273-17.2018v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Exposure to stress increases the risk of developing affective disorders such as depression and Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). However, these disorders only occur in a subset of individuals, those that are more vulnerable to the effects of stress, whereas others remain resilient. The coping style adopted to deal with the stressor, either passive or active coping, is related to vulnerability or resilience, respectively. Important neural substrates that mediate responses to a stressor are the orexins. These neuropeptides are altered in the cerebrospinal fluid of patients with stress-related illnesses such as depression and PTSD. The present experiments used a rodent social defeat model that generates actively coping rats and passively coping rats, which we have previously shown exhibit resilient and vulnerable profiles, respectively, to examine if orexins play a role in these stress-induced phenotypes. &lt;i&gt;In situ&lt;/i&gt; radiolabeling and qPCR revealed that actively coping rats expressed significantly lower prepro-orexin mRNA compared with passively coping rats. This led to the hypothesis that lower levels of orexins contribute to resilience to repeated social stress. To test this hypothesis, rats first underwent five days of social defeat to establish active and passive coping phenotypes. Then, orexin neurons were inhibited prior to each social defeat for three additional days using Designer Receptors Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs (DREADDs). Inhibition of orexins increased social interaction behavior and decreased depressive-like behavior in the vulnerable population of rats. Indeed, this suggests that lowering orexins promoted resilience to social defeat, and may be an important target for treatment of stress-related disorders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Stress-related mental illnesses only occur in a subset of individuals, whereas others are resilient to the effects of stress. Our work used an animal model of social stress to identify a substrate of resilience, the neuropeptides orexins, which are known to be altered in patients with MDD and PTSD. We found that orexins are decreased in rats resilient to social stress. To test whether low orexins contribute to resilience, orexins were inhibited during three days of a social defeat stress paradigm, which increased subsequent social interaction behavior and decreased depressive-like behaviors in a previously vulnerable population of rats. This suggests that lowering orexins is important in promoting resilience to stress, and are an important target for treatments of stress-related illness.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>RSS PAP: Cortical Measures of Phoneme-Level Speech Encoding Correlate with the Perceived Clarity of Natural Speech</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0084-18.2018v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;In real-world environments, humans comprehend speech by actively integrating prior knowledge and expectations with sensory input. Recent studies have revealed effects of prior information in temporal and frontal cortical areas, and have suggested that these effects are underpinned by enhanced encoding of speech-specific features, rather than a broad enhancement or suppression of cortical activity. However, in terms of the specific hierarchical stages of processing involved in speech comprehension, the effects of integrating bottom-up sensory responses and top-down predictions are still unclear. In addition, it is unclear whether the predictability that comes with prior information may differentially affect speech encoding relative to the perceptual enhancement that comes with that prediction. One way to investigate these issues is through examining the impact of prior knowledge on indices of cortical tracking of continuous speech features. Here, we did this by presenting participants with degraded speech sentences that either were or were not preceded by a clear recording of the same sentences while recording non-invasive electroencephalography. We assessed the impact of prior information on an isolated index of cortical tracking that reflected phoneme-level processing. Our findings suggests the possibility that prior information affects the early encoding of natural speech in a dual manner. Firstly, the availability of prior information, as hypothesized, enhanced the perceived clarity of degraded speech, which was positively correlated with changes in phoneme-level encoding across subjects. In addition, prior knowledge induced an overall reduction of this cortical measure, which we interpret as resulting from the increase in predictability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; The human ability to comprehend speech despite challenges such as loud noise and competing speech derives in large part from the use of prior knowledge of the upcoming speech. Here, we examine the cortical underpinnings of this process by using prior knowledge to modulate the perceived intelligibility of degraded stimuli. We find two distinct effects of prior knowledge: A positive correlation between perceptual enhancement and phoneme-level encoding and an overall suppression of this cortical encoding.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1803.10753</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The aim of the study was to examine how the complexity of surface
electromyogram (sEMG) signal, estimated by Higuchi fractal dimension (HFD) and
Sample Entropy (SampEn), change depending on muscle contraction intensity and
external perturbation of the corticospinal activity during muscle contraction
induced by single-pulse Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (spTMS). HFD and
SampEn were computed from sEMG signal recorded at three various levels of
voluntary contraction before and after spTMS. After spTMS, both HFD and SampEn
decreased at medium compared to the mild contraction. SampEn increased, while
HFD did not change significantly at strong compared to medium contraction.
spTMS significantly decreased both parameters at all contraction levels. When
same parameters were computed from the mathematically generated sine-wave
calibration curves, the results show that SampEn has better accuracy at lower
(0-40 Hz) and HFD at higher (60-120 Hz) frequencies. Changes in the sEMG
complexity associated with increased muscle contraction intensity cannot be
accurately depicted by a single complexity measure. Examination of sEMG should
entail both SampEn and HFD as they provide complementary information about
different frequency components of sEMG. Further studies are needed to explain
the implication of changes in nonlinear parameters and their relation to
underlying sEMG physiological processes.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Long before the mathematical developments that led inexorably to the
development of systems factorial technology, the somewhat arduous, but arguably
requisite labors which precisely defined parallel and serial architectures had
begun (e.g., Townsend, 1969, 1972). Both then and now, what are now referred to
as standard serial models and standard parallel models not only play an
important role in psychological science, they are often what non-mathematical
psychologists are (sometimes in an unschooled fashion) referring to when they
up architectural concepts. Interestingly, two strategic and critical
properties, and therefore implicit predictions of the canonical serial and
parallel models have witnessed little analysis. Thus, standard parallel models
predict stochastically independent actual processing times and therefore total
completion times. What do standard serial models predict about this statistic?
Similarly, standard serial models predict independent actual processing times
and therefore intercompletion times. What do standard parallel models predict
about this statistic? Finally, are there psychological questions that pertain
to these distinctions and are there any experiments that have emerged to assess
the latter. All these matters are targeted for our exposition.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Can deep learning (DL) guide our understanding of computations happening in
biological brain? We will first briefly consider how DL has contributed to the
research on visual object recognition. In the main part we will assess whether
DL could also help us to clarify the computations underlying higher cognitive
functions such as Theory of Mind. In addition, we will compare the objectives
and learning signals of brains and machines, leading us to conclude that simply
scaling up the current DL algorithms will not lead to human level mindreading
skills. We then provide some insights about how to fairly compare human and DL
performance. In the end we find that DL can contribute to our understanding of
biological computations by providing an example of an end-to-end algorithm that
solves the same problems the biological agents face.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1803.10318</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Brain interfaces are cyber-physical systems that aim to harvest information
from the (physical) brain through sensing mechanisms, extract information about
the underlying processes, and decide/actuate accordingly. Nonetheless, the
brain interfaces are still in their infancy, but reaching to their maturity
quickly as several initiatives are released to push forward their development
(e.g., NeuraLink by Elon Musk and `typing-by-brain' by Facebook). This has
motivated us to revisit the design of EEG-based non-invasive brain interfaces.
Specifically, current methodologies entail a highly skilled neuro-functional
approach and evidence-based \emph{a priori} knowledge about specific signal
features and their interpretation from a neuro-physiological point of view.
Hereafter, we propose to demystify such approaches, as we propose to leverage
new time-varying complex network models that equip us with a fractal dynamical
characterization of the underlying processes. Subsequently, the parameters of
the proposed complex network models can be explained from a system's
perspective, and, consecutively, used for classification using machine learning
algorithms and/or actuation laws determined using control system's theory.
Besides, the proposed system identification methods and techniques have
computational complexities comparable with those currently used in EEG-based
brain interfaces, which enable comparable online performances. Furthermore, we
foresee that the proposed models and approaches are also valid using other
invasive and non-invasive technologies. Finally, we illustrate and
experimentally evaluate this approach on real EEG-datasets to assess and
validate the proposed methodology. The classification accuracies are high even
on having less number of training samples.

	<content:encoded>Operant conditioning is a crucial tool in neuroscience research for probing brain function. While molecular, anatomical and even physiological techniques have seen radical increases in throughput, efficiency, and reproducibility in recent years, behavioural tools have seen much less of an improvement. Here we present a fully automated, high-throughput system for self-initiated conditioning of up to 25 group-housed, radio-frequency identification (RFID) tagged mice over periods of several months and &amp;gt;10^6 trials. We validate this 'AutonoMouse' system in a series of olfactory behavioural tasks and show that acquired data is comparable to previous semi-manual approaches. Furthermore, we use AutonoMouse to systematically probe the impact of graded olfactory bulb lesions on olfactory behaviour and resolve the long-standing conundrum about the apparent lack of impact of lesions on olfactory abilities. The modular nature and open-source design of AutonoMouse should allow for similar robust and systematic assessments across neuroscience research areas.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: A Quantitative Tractography Study into the Connectivity, Segmentation and Laterality of the Human Inferior Longitudinal Fasciculus</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/291625v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>The human inferior longitudinal fasciculus (ILF) is a ventral, temporo-occipital association tract. Though described in early neuroanatomical works, its existence was later questioned. Application of in vivo tractography to the neuroanatomical study of the ILF has generally confirmed its existence, however consensus is lacking regarding its subdivision, laterality and connectivity. Further, there is a paucity of detailed neuroanatomic data pertaining to the exact anatomy of the ILF. Generalized Q-Sampling imaging (GQI) is a non-tensor tractographic modality permitting high resolution imaging of white-matter structures. As it is a non-tensor modality, it permits visualization of crossing fibers and accurate delineation of close-proximity fiber-systems. We applied deterministic GQI tractography to data from 30 healthy subjects and a large-volume diffusion atlas, to delineate ILF anatomy. Post-mortem white matter dissection was also carried out in a cadaveric specimen for further validation. The ILF was found in all 60 hemispheres. At its occipital extremity, it demonstrated a trifurcated termination pattern which was used to separate the ILF into 3 distinct sub-fascicles: Dorsolateral, ventrolateral and ventromedial. These divisions were consistent across the subject set and within the atlas. We applied quantitative techniques to study connectivity strength of the ILF at its anterior and posterior extremities. Overall, the 3 sub-fascicles, and the whole ILF, demonstrated strong leftward-lateralized connectivity patterns. Leftward-lateralization was also found for ILF volumes across the subject set. Due to connective and volumetric leftward-dominance and ventral location, we postulate the ILFs role in the semantic system. Further, our results are in agreement with functional and lesion-based postulations pertaining to the ILFs role in facial recognition.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/291401v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Prion diseases (PrDs), Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease (PD) are fatal neurodegenerative disorders that share neuropathological and biochemical features, including the aggregation of pathological protein conformers. Lymphocyte activation gene 3 (Lag3, also known as CD223) is a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily of receptors expressed on immune cells and neurons, which serves as a receptor for -synuclein aggregates in PD. Here we examined the possible role of Lag3 in the pathogenesis of PrDs. Through quantitative real-time PCR and RNA-sequencing, we found that the expression levels of Lag3 were relatively low in adult mouse brains, yet its expression was significantly upregulated after prion infection. However, we failed finding significant differences regarding the incubation time, PrPSc load, neurodegeneration and inflammatory gene expression profiles between the Lag3 knockout mice and wild-type littermate controls after prion infection. We conclude that loss of Lag3 has no significant influence on PrD pathogenesis. Considering that Lag3 is an immune checkpoint receptor, our results also suggest that immune checkpoint inhibition (an increasingly prevalent therapeutic modality against many types of cancer) might not exert positive or negative effects on the progression of PrDs.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/291310v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Synaptic vesicles (SVs) are a key component of neuronal signaling and fulfil different roles depending on their composition. In electron micrograms of neurites, two types of vesicles can be distinguished by morphological criteria, the classical &quot;clear core&quot; vesicles (CCV) and the typically larger &quot;dense core&quot; vesicles (DCV), with differences in electron density due to their diverse cargos. Compared to CCVs, the precise function of DCVs is less defined. DCVs are known to store neuropeptides, which function as neuronal messengers and modulators [1]. In C. elegans, they play a role in locomotion, dauer formation, egg-laying, and mechano- and chemosensation [2]. Another type of DCVs, also referred to as granulated vesicles, are known to transport Bassoon, Piccolo and further constituents of the presynaptic density in the center of the active zone (AZ), and therefore are important for synaptogenesis [3]. To better understand the role of different types of SVs, we present here a new automated approach to classify vesicles and to quantify their properties from electron tomograms. We combine machine learning with an extension of our previously developed vesicle segmentation workflow, the ImageJ macro 3D ART VeSElecT, to reliably distinguish CCVs and DCVs using image-based features. We apply this method to electron tomograms of the C. elegans NMJs, and find an increased fraction of DCVs as well as a higher mean distance between DCVs and AZs in dauer larvae when compared to adult hermaphrodites. Our machine learning approach could be applied to study properties of different synaptic vesicle pools in electron tomograms of diverse model organisms.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Chemicogenetic recruitment of specific interneurons suppresses seizure activity</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/291179v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Enhancing the brain's endogenous inhibitory mechanisms represents an important strategy for suppressing epileptic discharges. Indeed, drugs that boost synaptic inhibition can disrupt epileptic seizure activity, although these drugs generate complex effects due to the broad nature of their action. Recently developed chemicogenetic techniques provide the opportunity to pharmacologically enhance endogenous inhibitory mechanisms in a more selective manner. Here we use chemicogenetics to assess the anti-epileptic potential of enhancing the synaptic output from three major interneuron populations in the hippocampus: parvalbumin (PV), somatostatin (SST) and vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) expressing interneurons. Targeted pre- and post-synaptic whole cell recordings in an in vitro hippocampal mouse model revealed that all three interneuron types increase their firing rate and synaptic output following chemicogenetic activation. However, the interneuron populations exhibited different anti-epileptic effects. Recruiting VIP interneurons resulted in a mixture of pro-epileptic and anti-epileptic effects. In contrast, recruiting SST or PV interneurons produced robust suppression of epileptiform activity. PV interneurons exhibited the strongest effect per cell, eliciting at least a five-fold greater reduction in epileptiform activity than the other cell types. Consistent with this, we found that chemicogenetic recruitment of PV interneurons was effective in an in vivo mouse model of hippocampal seizures. Following efficient delivery of the chemicogenetic tool, pharmacological enhancement of the PV interneuron population suppressed a range of seizure-related behaviours and prevented generalized seizures. Our findings therefore support the idea that selective chemicogenetic enhancement of synaptic inhibitory pathways offers potential as an anti-epileptic strategy.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Object recognition requires dynamic transformations of low-level visual inputs to complex semantic representations. While this process depends on the ventral visual pathway (VVP), we lack an incremental account from low-level inputs to semantic representations, and the mechanistic details of these dynamics. Here we combine computational models of vision with semantics, and test the output of the incremental model against patterns of neural oscillations recorded with MEG in humans. Representational Similarity Analysis showed visual information was represented in alpha activity throughout the VVP, and semantic information was represented in theta activity. Furthermore, informational connectivity showed visual information travels through feedforward connections, while visual information is transformed into semantic representations through feedforward and feedback activity, centered on the anterior temporal lobe. Our research highlights that the complex transformations between visual and semantic information is driven by feedforward and recurrent dynamics resulting in object-specific semantics.</content:encoded>

Somatic copy number variations (CNVs) play a crucial role in development of many human cancers. The broad availability of next-generation sequencing data has enabled the development of algorithms to computationally infer CNV profiles from a variety of data types including exome and targeted sequence data; currently the most prevalent types of cancer genomics data. However, systemic evaluation and comparison of these tools remains challenging due to a lack of ground truth reference sets. To address this need, we have developed Bamgineer, a tool written in Python to introduce user-defined haplotype-phased allele-specific copy number events into an existing Binary Alignment Mapping (BAM) file, with a focus on targeted and exome sequencing experiments. As input, this tool requires a read alignment file (BAM format), lists of non-overlapping genome coordinates for introduction of gains and losses (bed file), and an optional file defining known haplotypes (vcf format). To improve runtime performance, Bamgineer introduces the desired CNVs in parallel using queuing and parallel processing on a local machine or on a high-performance computing cluster. As proof-of-principle, we applied Bamgineer to a single high-coverage (mean: 220X) exome sequence file from a blood sample to simulate copy number profiles of 3 exemplar tumors from each of 10 tumor types at 5 tumor cellularity levels (20–100%, 150 BAM files in total). To demonstrate feasibility beyond exome data, we introduced read alignments to a targeted 5-gene cell-free DNA sequencing library to simulate &lt;i&gt;EGFR&lt;/i&gt; amplifications at frequencies consistent with circulating tumor DNA (10, 1, 0.1 and 0.01%) while retaining the multimodal insert size distribution of the original data. We expect Bamgineer to be of use for development and systematic benchmarking of CNV calling algorithms by users using locally-generated data for a variety of applications.

Oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) have remarkable properties: they represent the most abundant cycling cell population in the adult normal brain and they manage to achieve a uniform and constant density throughout the adult brain. This equilibrium is obtained by the interplay of four processes: division, differentiation or death, migration and active self-repulsion. They are also strongly suspected to be at the origin of gliomas, when their equilibrium is disrupted. In this article, we present a model of the dynamics of OPCs, first in a normal tissue. This model is based on a cellular automaton and its rules are mimicking the ones that regulate the dynamics of real OPCs. The model is able to reproduce the homeostasis of the cell population, with the maintenance of a constant and uniform cell density and the healing of a lesion. We show that there exists a fair quantitative agreement between the simulated and experimental parameters, such as the cell velocity, the time taken to close a lesion, and the duration of the cell cycle. We present three possible scenarios of disruption of the equilibrium: the appearance of an over-proliferating cell, of a deadless/non-differentiating cell, or of a cell that lost any contact-inhibition. We show that the appearance of an over-proliferating cell is sufficient to trigger the growth of a tumor that has low-grade glioma features: an invasive behaviour, a linear radial growth of the tumor with a corresponding growth velocity of less than 2 mm per year, as well a cell density at the center which exceeds the one in normal tissue by a factor of less than two. The loss of contact inhibition leads to a more high-grade-like glioma. The results of our model contribute to the body of evidence that identify OPCs as possible cells of origin of gliomas.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/4yhFdqGpIbo&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Experimental recordings in hippocampal slices indicate that astrocytic dysfunction may cause neuronal hyper-excitation or seizures. Considering that astrocytes play important roles in mediating local uptake and spatial buffering of K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; in the extracellular space of the cortical circuit, we constructed a novel model of an astrocyte-neuron network module consisting of a single compartment neuron and 4 surrounding connected astrocytes and including extracellular potassium dynamics. Next, we developed a new model function for the astrocyte gap junctions, connecting two astrocyte-neuron network modules. The function form and parameters of the gap junction were based on nonlinear regression fitting of a set of experimental data published in previous studies. Moreover, we have created numerical simulations using the above single astrocyte-neuron network module and the coupled astrocyte-neuron network modules. Our model validates previous experimental observations that both Kir4.1 channels and gap junctions play important roles in regulating the concentration of extracellular potassium. In addition, we also observe that changes in Kir4.1 channel conductance and gap junction strength induce spontaneous epileptic activity in the absence of external stimuli.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/fOtr0tevqZs&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Maternal and Early Postnatal Immune Activation Produce Dissociable Effects on Neurotransmission in mPFC-Amygdala Circuits</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/13/3358?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Inflammatory processes may be involved in the pathophysiology of neuropsychiatric illnesses including autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Evidence from studies in rodents indicates that immune activation during early development can produce core features of ASD (social interaction deficits, dysregulation of communication, increases in stereotyped behaviors, and anxiety), although the neural mechanisms of these effects are not thoroughly understood. We treated timed-pregnant mice with polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid (Poly I:C), which simulates a viral infection, or vehicle on gestational day 12.5 to produce maternal immune activation (MIA). Male offspring received either vehicle or lipopolysaccharide, which simulates a bacterial infection, on postnatal day 9 to produce postnatal immune activation (PIA). We then used optogenetics to address the possibility that early developmental immune activation causes persistent alterations in the flow of signals within the mPFC to basolateral amygdala (BLA) pathway, a circuit implicated in ASD. We found that our MIA regimen produced increases in synaptic strength in glutamatergic projections from the mPFC to the BLA. In contrast, our PIA regimen produced decreases in feedforward GABAergic inhibitory postsynaptic responses resulting from activation of local circuit interneurons in the BLA by mPFC-originating fibers. Both effects were seen together when the regimens were combined. Changes in the balance between excitation and inhibition were differentially translated into the modified spike output of BLA neurons. Our findings raise the possibility that prenatal and postnatal immune activation may affect different cellular targets within brain circuits that regulate some of the core behavioral signs of conditions such as ASD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Immune system activation during prenatal and early postnatal development may contribute to the development of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Combining optogenetic approaches and behavioral assays that reflect core features of ASD (anxiety, decreased social interactions), we uncovered mechanisms by which the ASD-associated behavioral impairments induced by immune activation could be mediated at the level of interactions within brain circuits implicated in control of emotion and motivation (mPFC and BLA, specifically). Here, we present evidence that prenatal and postnatal immune activation can have different cellular targets in the brain, providing support to the notion that the etiology of ASD may be linked to the excitation/inhibition imbalance in the brain affecting the signal flow within relevant behavior-driving neural microcircuits.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Celecoxib Ameliorates Seizure Susceptibility in Autosomal Dominant Lateral Temporal Epilepsy</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/13/3346?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Autosomal dominant lateral temporal epilepsy (ADLTE) is an inherited syndrome caused by mutations in the leucine-rich glioma inactivated 1 (LGI1) gene. It is known that glutamatergic transmission is altered in LGI1 mutant mice, and seizures can be reduced by restoring LGI1 function. Yet, the mechanism underlying ADLTE is unclear. Here, we propose that seizures in male &lt;i&gt;LGI1&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt; mice are due to nonsynaptic epileptiform activity in cortical neurons. We examined the intrinsic excitability of pyramidal neurons in the temporal cortex of male &lt;i&gt;LGI1&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt; mice and found that the voltage-gated K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channel Kv1.2 was significantly downregulated. We also found that cytosolic phospholipase A&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (cPLA&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)-cyclooxygenase 2 (Cox2) signaling was enhanced in &lt;i&gt;LGI1&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt; mice. Interestingly, Cox2 inhibition effectively restored the dysregulated Kv1.2 and reduced the intrinsic excitability of pyramidal neurons. Moreover, &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; injection of celecoxib, an FDA-approved nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, rescued the defective Kv1.2 (an ~1.9-fold increase), thereby alleviating the seizure susceptibility and extending the life of &lt;i&gt;LGI1&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt; mice by 5 d. In summary, we conclude that LGI1 deficiency dysregulates cPLA&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-Cox2 signaling to cause hyperexcitability of cortical pyramidal neurons, and celecoxib is a potential agent to manage human ADLTE.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Haploinsufficiency of the leucine-rich glioma inactivated 1 (LGI1) gene is the major pathogenic basis for ADLTE, an inherited syndrome with no cure to date. Existing studies suggest that altered glutamatergic transmission in the hippocampus causes this disease, but the data are paradoxical. We demonstrate that the loss of LGI1 decreases Kv1.2 expression, enhances intrinsic excitability, and thereby causes epilepsy. Interestingly, for the first time, we show that an FDA-approved drug, celecoxib, rescues the Kv1.2 defect and alleviates seizure susceptibility in &lt;i&gt;LGI1&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt; mice, as well as improving their survival. Thus, we suggest that celecoxib is a promising drug for the treatment of ADLTE patients.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Challenge to Promote Change: The Neural Basis of the Contextual Interference Effect in Young and Older Adults</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/13/3333?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Motor performance deteriorates with age. Hence, studying the effects of different training types on performance improvement is particularly important. Here, we investigated the neural correlates of the contextual interference (CI) effect in 32 young (YA; 16 female) and 28 older (OA; 12 female) human adults. Participants were randomly assigned to either a blocked or a random practice schedule, practiced three variations of a bimanual visuomotor task over 3 d, and were retested 6 d later. Functional magnetic resonance imaging data were acquired during the first and last training days and during retention. Although the overall performance level was lower in OA than YA, the typical CI effects were observed in both age groups, i.e., inferior performance during acquisition but superior performance during retention for random relative to blocked practice. At the neural level, blocked practice showed higher brain activity in motor-related brain regions compared with random practice across both age groups. However, although activity in these regions decreased with blocked practice in both age groups, it was either preserved (YA) or increased (OA) as a function of random practice. In contrast, random compared with blocked practice resulted in greater activations in visual processing regions across age groups. Interestingly, in OA, the more demanding random practice schedule triggered neuroplastic changes in areas of the default mode network, ultimately leading to better long-term retention. Our findings may have substantial implications for the optimization of practice schedules, and rehabilitation settings in particular.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; In aging societies, it is critically important to understand how motor skills can be maintained or enhanced in older adults, with the ultimate goal to prolong functional independence. Here, we demonstrated that a more challenging random as opposed to a blocked practice environment temporarily reduced performance during the acquisition phase but resulted in lasting benefits for skill retention. In older adults, learning success was critically dependent on reduction of activation in areas of the default mode network, pointing to plastic functional changes in brain regions that are vulnerable to aging effects. The random practice context led to increased economy of brain activity and better skill retention. This provides new perspectives for reversing the negative consequences of aging.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Neuronal Organization in the Inferior Colliculus Revisited with Cell-Type-Dependent Monosynaptic Tracing</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/13/3318?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The inferior colliculus (IC) is a critical integration center in the auditory pathway. However, because the inputs to the IC have typically been studied by the use of conventional anterograde and retrograde tracers, the neuronal organization and cell-type-specific connections in the IC are poorly understood. Here, we used monosynaptic rabies tracing and &lt;i&gt;in situ&lt;/i&gt; hybridization combined with excitatory and inhibitory Cre transgenic mouse lines of both sexes to characterize the brainwide and cell-type-specific inputs to specific neuron types within the lemniscal IC core and nonlemniscal IC shell. We observed that both excitatory and inhibitory neurons of the IC shell predominantly received ascending inputs rather than descending or core inputs. Correlation and clustering analyses revealed two groups of excitatory neurons in the shell: one received inputs from a combination of ascending nuclei, and the other received inputs from a combination of descending nuclei, neuromodulatory nuclei, and the contralateral IC. In contrast, inhibitory neurons in the core received inputs from the same combination of all nuclei. After normalizing the extrinsic inputs, we found that core inhibitory neurons received a higher proportion of inhibitory inputs from the ventral nucleus of the lateral lemniscus than excitatory neurons. Furthermore, the inhibitory neurons preferentially received inhibitory inputs from the contralateral IC shell. Because IC inhibitory neurons innervate the thalamus and contralateral IC, the inhibitory inputs we uncovered here suggest two long-range disinhibitory circuits. In summary, we found: (1) dominant ascending inputs to the shell, (2) two subpopulations of shell excitatory neurons, and (3) two disinhibitory circuits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Sound undergoes extensive processing in the brainstem. The inferior colliculus (IC) core is classically viewed as the integration center for ascending auditory information, whereas the IC shell integrates descending feedback information. Here, we demonstrate that ascending inputs predominated in the IC shell but appeared to be separated from the descending inputs. The presence of inhibitory projection neurons is a unique feature of the auditory ascending pathways, but the connections of these neurons are poorly understood. Interestingly, we also found that inhibitory neurons in the IC core and shell preferentially received inhibitory inputs from ascending nuclei and contralateral IC, respectively. Therefore, our results suggest a bipartite domain in the IC shell and disinhibitory circuits in the IC.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Doctor, Teacher, and Stethoscope: Neural Representation of Different Types of Semantic Relations</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/13/3303?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Concepts can be related in many ways. They can belong to the same taxonomic category (e.g., &quot;doctor&quot; and &quot;teacher,&quot; both in the category of people) or be associated with the same event context (e.g., &quot;doctor&quot; and &quot;stethoscope,&quot; both associated with medical scenarios). How are these two major types of semantic relations coded in the brain? We constructed stimuli from three taxonomic categories (people, manmade objects, and locations) and three thematic categories (school, medicine, and sports) and investigated the neural representations of these two dimensions using representational similarity analyses in human participants (10 men and nine women). In specific regions of interest, the left anterior temporal lobe (ATL) and the left temporoparietal junction (TPJ), we found that, whereas both areas had significant effects of taxonomic information, the taxonomic relations had stronger effects in the ATL than in the TPJ (&quot;doctor&quot; and &quot;teacher&quot; closer in ATL neural activity), with the reverse being true for thematic relations (&quot;doctor&quot; and &quot;stethoscope&quot; closer in TPJ neural activity). A whole-brain searchlight analysis revealed that widely distributed regions, mainly in the left hemisphere, represented the taxonomic dimension. Interestingly, the significant effects of the thematic relations were only observed after the taxonomic differences were controlled for in the left TPJ, the right superior lateral occipital cortex, and other frontal, temporal, and parietal regions. In summary, taxonomic grouping is a primary organizational dimension across distributed brain regions, with thematic grouping further embedded within such taxonomic structures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; How are concepts organized in the brain? It is well established that concepts belonging to the same taxonomic categories (e.g., &quot;doctor&quot; and &quot;teacher&quot;) share neural representations in specific brain regions. How concepts are associated in other manners (e.g., &quot;doctor&quot; and &quot;stethoscope,&quot; which are thematically related) remains poorly understood. We used representational similarity analyses to unravel the neural representations of these different types of semantic relations by testing the same set of words that could be differently grouped by taxonomic categories or by thematic categories. We found that widely distributed brain areas primarily represented taxonomic categories, with the thematic categories further embedded within the taxonomic structure.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Testing the Efficacy of Single-Cell Stimulation in Biasing Presubicular Head Direction Activity</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/13/3287?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;To support navigation, the firing of head direction (HD) neurons must be tightly anchored to the external space. Indeed, inputs from external landmarks can rapidly reset the preferred direction of HD cells. Landmark stimuli have often been simulated as excitatory inputs from &quot;visual cells&quot; (encoding landmark information) to the HD attractor network; when excitatory visual inputs are sufficiently strong, preferred directions switch abruptly to the landmark location. In the present work, we tested whether mimicking such inputs via juxtacellular stimulation would be sufficient for shifting the tuning of individual presubicular HD cells recorded in passively rotated male rats. We recorded 81 HD cells in a cue-rich environment, and evoked spikes trains outside of their preferred direction (distance range, 11–178°). We found that HD tuning was remarkably resistant to activity manipulations. Even strong stimulations, which induced seconds-long spike trains, failed to induce a detectable shift in directional tuning. HD tuning curves before and after stimulation remained highly correlated, indicating that postsynaptic activation alone is insufficient for modifying HD output. Our data are thus consistent with the predicted stability of an HD attractor network when anchored to external landmarks. A small spiking bias at the stimulus direction could only be observed in a visually deprived environment in which both average firing rates and directional tuning were markedly reduced. Based on this evidence, we speculate that, when attractor dynamics become unstable (e.g., under disorientation), the output of HD neurons could be more efficiently controlled by strong biasing stimuli.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The activity of head direction (HD) cells is thought to provide the mammalian brain with an internal sense of direction. To support navigation, the firing of HD neurons must be anchored to external landmarks, a process thought to be supported by associative plasticity within the HD system. Here, we investigated these plasticity mechanisms by juxtacellular stimulation of single HD neurons &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; in awake rats. We found that HD coding is strongly resistant to external manipulations of spiking activity. Only in a visually deprived environment was juxtacellular stimulation able to induce a small activity bias in single presubicular neurons. We propose that juxtacellular stimulation can bias HD tuning only when competing anchoring inputs are reduced or not available.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Cell-Specific Deletion of PGC-1{alpha} from Medium Spiny Neurons Causes Transcriptional Alterations and Age-Related Motor Impairment</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/13/3273?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Multiple lines of evidence indicate that a reduction in the expression and function of the transcriptional coactivator peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator-1α (PGC-1α) is associated with neurodegeneration in diseases such as Huntington's disease (&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;D). Polymorphisms in the PGC-1α gene modify HD progression and PGC-1α expression is reduced in striatal medium spiny neurons (MSNs) of HD patients and mouse models. However, neither the MSN-specific function of PGC-1α nor the contribution of PGC-1α deficiency to motor dysfunction is known. We identified novel, PGC-1α-dependent transcripts involved in RNA processing, signal transduction, and neuronal morphology and confirmed reductions in these transcripts in male and female mice lacking PGC-1α specifically in MSNs, indicating a cell-autonomous effect in this population. MSN-specific PGC-1α deletion caused reductions in previously identified neuronal and metabolic PGC-1α-dependent genes without causing striatal vacuolizations. Interestingly, these mice exhibited a hypoactivity with age, similar to several HD animal models. However, these newly identified PGC-1α-dependent genes were upregulated with disease severity and age in knock-in HD mouse models independent of changes in PGC-1α transcript, contrary to what would be predicted from a loss-of-function etiological mechanism. These data indicate that PGC-1α is necessary for MSN transcriptional homeostasis and function with age and that, whereas PGC-1α loss in MSNs does not replicate an HD-like phenocopy, its downstream genes are altered in a repeat-length and age-dependent fashion. Understanding the additive effects of PGC-1α gene functional variation and mutant huntingtin on transcription in this cell type may provide insight into the selective vulnerability of MSNs in HD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Reductions in peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator-1α (PGC-1α)-mediated transcription have been implicated in the pathogenesis of Huntington's disease (&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;D). We show that, although PGC-1α-dependent transcription is necessary to maintain medium spiny neuron (MSN) function with age, its loss is insufficient to cause striatal atrophy in mice. We also highlight a set of genes that can serve as proxies for PGC-1α functional activity in the striatum for target engagement studies. Furthermore, we demonstrate that PGC-1α-dependent genes are upregulated in a dose- and age-dependent fashion in HD mouse models, contrary to what would be predicted from a loss-of-function etiological mechanism. However, given this role for PGC-1α in MSN transcriptional homeostasis, it is important to consider how genetic variation in PGC-1α could contribute to mutant-huntingtin-induced cell death and disease progression.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Electrophysiological Signatures of Spatial Boundaries in the Human Subiculum</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/13/3265?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Environmental boundaries play a crucial role in spatial navigation and memory across a wide range of distantly related species. In rodents, boundary representations have been identified at the single-cell level in the subiculum and entorhinal cortex of the hippocampal formation. Although studies of hippocampal function and spatial behavior suggest that similar representations might exist in humans, boundary-related neural activity has not been identified electrophysiologically in humans until now. To address this gap in the literature, we analyzed intracranial recordings from the hippocampal formation of surgical epilepsy patients (of both sexes) while they performed a virtual spatial navigation task and compared the power in three frequency bands (1–4, 4–10, and 30–90 Hz) for target locations near and far from the environmental boundaries. Our results suggest that encoding locations near boundaries elicited stronger theta oscillations than for target locations near the center of the environment and that this difference cannot be explained by variables such as trial length, speed, movement, or performance. These findings provide direct evidence of boundary-dependent neural activity localized in humans to the subiculum, the homolog of the hippocampal subregion in which most boundary cells are found in rodents, and indicate that this system can represent attended locations that rather than the position of one's own body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Spatial computations using environmental boundaries are an integral part of the brain's spatial mapping system. In rodents, border/boundary cells in the subiculum and entorhinal cortex reveal boundary coding at the single-neuron level. Although there is good reason to believe that such representations also exist in humans, the evidence has thus far been limited to functional neuroimaging studies that broadly implicate the hippocampus in boundary-based navigation. By combining intracranial recordings with high-resolution imaging of hippocampal subregions, we identified a neural marker of boundary representation in the human subiculum.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: The Encoding of Sound Source Elevation in the Human Auditory Cortex</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/13/3252?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Spatial hearing is a crucial capacity of the auditory system. While the encoding of horizontal sound direction has been extensively studied, very little is known about the representation of vertical sound direction in the auditory cortex. Using high-resolution fMRI, we measured voxelwise sound elevation tuning curves in human auditory cortex and show that sound elevation is represented by broad tuning functions preferring lower elevations as well as secondary narrow tuning functions preferring individual elevation directions. We changed the ear shape of participants (male and female) with silicone molds for several days. This manipulation reduced or abolished the ability to discriminate sound elevation and flattened cortical tuning curves. Tuning curves recovered their original shape as participants adapted to the modified ears and regained elevation perception over time. These findings suggest that the elevation tuning observed in low-level auditory cortex did not arise from the physical features of the stimuli but is contingent on experience with spectral cues and covaries with the change in perception. One explanation for this observation may be that the tuning in low-level auditory cortex underlies the subjective perception of sound elevation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; This study addresses two fundamental questions about the brain representation of sensory stimuli: how the vertical spatial axis of auditory space is represented in the auditory cortex and whether low-level sensory cortex represents physical stimulus features or subjective perceptual attributes. Using high-resolution fMRI, we show that vertical sound direction is represented by broad tuning functions preferring lower elevations as well as secondary narrow tuning functions preferring individual elevation directions. In addition, we demonstrate that the shape of these tuning functions is contingent on experience with spectral cues and covaries with the change in perception, which may indicate that the tuning functions in low-level auditory cortex underlie the perceived elevation of a sound source.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Synaptotagmin 7 Mediates Both Facilitation and Asynchronous Release at Granule Cell Synapses</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/13/3240?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;When an action potential invades a presynaptic terminal it evokes large, brief Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; signals that trigger vesicle fusion within milliseconds that is followed by a small residual Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; (Ca&lt;sub&gt;res&lt;/sub&gt;) signal. At many synapses Ca&lt;sub&gt;res&lt;/sub&gt; produces synaptic facilitation that lasts up to hundreds of milliseconds and, although less common, Ca&lt;sub&gt;res&lt;/sub&gt; can also evoke asynchronous release (AR) that persists for tens of milliseconds. The properties of facilitation and AR are very different, which suggests that they are mediated by distinct mechanisms. However, recently it has been shown that the slow calcium sensor synaptotagmin 7 (Syt7) mediates facilitation at many synapses where AR does not occur, and conversely Syt7 can mediate AR without mediating facilitation. Here we study cerebellar granule cell synapses onto stellate cells and Purkinje cells in mice of both sexes to assess the role of Syt7 in these phenomena at the same synapse. This is of particular interest at granule cell synapses where AR is much more calcium dependent and shorter-lived than facilitation. We find that Syt7 can mediate these two processes despite their divergent properties. In Syt7 knock-out animals, facilitation and AR are smaller and shorter lived than in wild-type animals, even though the initial probability of release and Ca&lt;sub&gt;res&lt;/sub&gt; signals are unchanged. Although there are short-lived Syt7-independent mechanisms that mediate facilitation and AR in Syt7 KO animals, we find that at granule cell synapses AR and facilitation are both mediated primarily by Syt7.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; At synapses made by cerebellar granule cells, presynaptic activity elevates calcium for tens of milliseconds, which in turn evokes both asynchronous release (AR) and synaptic facilitation. AR is more calcium sensitive and shorter-lived than facilitation at these synapses, suggesting that they are mediated by different mechanisms. However, we find that the slow calcium sensor synaptotagmin 7 mediates both of these phenomena. Small, rapidly decaying components of AR and facilitation are present in Syt7 KO animals, indicating that additional mechanisms can contribute to both AR and facilitation at these synapses.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Nigrostriatal and Mesolimbic D2/3 Receptor Expression in Parkinson's Disease Patients with Compulsive Reward-Driven Behaviors</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/13/3230?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The nigrostriatal and mesocorticolimbic dopamine networks regulate reward-driven behavior. Regional alterations to mesolimbic dopamine D&lt;sub&gt;2/3&lt;/sub&gt; receptor expression are described in drug-seeking and addiction disorders. Parkinson's disease (PD) patients are frequently prescribed D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-like dopamine agonist (DAgonist) therapy for motor symptoms, yet a proportion develop clinically significant behavioral addictions characterized by impulsive and compulsive behaviors (ICBs). Until now, changes in D&lt;sub&gt;2/3&lt;/sub&gt; receptor binding in both striatal and extrastriatal regions have not been concurrently quantified in this population. We identified 35 human PD patients (both male and female) receiving DAgonist therapy, with (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 17) and without (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 18) ICBs, matched for age, disease duration, disease severity, and dose of dopamine therapy. In the off-dopamine state, all completed PET imaging with [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]fallypride, a high affinity D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-like receptor ligand that can measure striatal and extrastriatal D&lt;sub&gt;2/3&lt;/sub&gt; nondisplaceable binding potential (BP&lt;sub&gt;ND&lt;/sub&gt;). Striatal differences between ICB+/ICB– patients localized to the ventral striatum and putamen, where ICB+ subjects had reduced BP&lt;sub&gt;ND&lt;/sub&gt;. In this group, self-reported severity of ICB symptoms positively correlated with midbrain D&lt;sub&gt;2/3&lt;/sub&gt; receptor BP&lt;sub&gt;ND&lt;/sub&gt;. Group differences in regional D&lt;sub&gt;2/3&lt;/sub&gt; BP&lt;sub&gt;ND&lt;/sub&gt; relationships were also notable: ICB+ (but not ICB–) patients expressed positive correlations between midbrain and caudate, putamen, globus pallidus, and amygdala BP&lt;sub&gt;ND&lt;/sub&gt;s. These findings support the hypothesis that compulsive behaviors in PD are associated with reduced ventral and dorsal striatal D&lt;sub&gt;2/3&lt;/sub&gt; expression, similar to changes in comparable behavioral disorders. The data also suggest that relatively preserved ventral midbrain dopaminergic projections throughout nigrostriatal and mesolimbic networks are characteristic of ICB+ patients, and may account for differential DAgonist therapeutic response.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The biologic determinants of compulsive reward-based behaviors have broad clinical relevance, from addiction to neurodegenerative disorders. Here, we address biomolecular distinctions in Parkinson's disease patients with impulsive compulsive behaviors (ICBs). This is the first study to image a large cohort of ICB+ patients using positron emission tomography with [18F]fallypride, allowing quantification of D&lt;sub&gt;2/3&lt;/sub&gt; receptors throughout the mesocorticolimbic network. We demonstrate widespread differences in dopaminergic networks, including (1) D2-like receptor distinctions in the ventral striatum and putamen, and (2) a preservation of widespread dopaminergic projections emerging from the midbrain, which is associated with the severity of compulsive behaviors. This clearly illustrates the roles of D&lt;sub&gt;2/3&lt;/sub&gt; receptors and medication effects in maladaptive behaviors, and localizes them specifically to nigrostriatal and extrastriatal regions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Positive Allosteric Modulation as a Potential Therapeutic Strategy in Anti-NMDA Receptor Encephalitis</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/13/3218?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-methyl-d-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) are ionotropic glutamate receptors important for synaptic plasticity, memory, and neuropsychiatric health. NMDAR hypofunction contributes to multiple disorders, including anti-NMDAR encephalitis (NMDARE), an autoimmune disease of the CNS associated with GluN1 antibody-mediated NMDAR internalization. Here we characterize the functional/pharmacological consequences of exposure to CSF from female human NMDARE patients on NMDAR function, and we characterize the effects of intervention with recently described positive allosteric modulators (PAMs) of NMDARs. Incubation (48 h) of rat hippocampal neurons of both sexes in confirmed NMDARE patient CSF, but not control CSF, attenuated NMDA-induced current. Residual NMDAR function was characterized by lack of change in channel open probability, indiscriminate loss of synaptic and extrasynaptic NMDARs, and indiscriminate loss of GluN2B-containing and GluN2B-lacking NMDARs. NMDARs tagged with N-terminal pHluorin fluorescence demonstrated loss of surface receptors. Thus, function of residual NMDARs following CSF exposure was indistinguishable from baseline, and deficits appear wholly accounted for by receptor loss. Coapplication of CSF and PAMs of NMDARs (SGE-301 or SGE-550, oxysterol-mimetic) for 24 h restored NMDAR function following 24 h incubation in patient CSF. Curiously, restoration of NMDAR function was observed despite washout of PAMs before electrophysiological recordings. Subsequent experiments suggested that residual allosteric potentiation of NMDAR function explained the persistent rescue. Further studies of the pathogenesis of NMDARE and intervention with PAMs may inform new treatments for NMDARE and other disorders associated with NMDAR hypofunction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Anti-&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-methyl-d-aspartate receptor encephalitis (NMDARE) is increasingly recognized as an important cause of sudden-onset psychosis and other neuropsychiatric symptoms. Current treatment leaves unmet medical need. Here we demonstrate cellular evidence that newly identified positive allosteric modulators of NMDAR function may be a viable therapeutic strategy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: A Critical Role for the Nucleus Reuniens in Long-Term, But Not Short-Term Associative Recognition Memory Formation</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/13/3208?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Recognition memory for single items requires the perirhinal cortex (PRH), whereas recognition of an item and its associated location requires a functional interaction among the PRH, hippocampus (HPC), and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). Although the precise mechanisms through which these interactions are effected are unknown, the nucleus reuniens (NRe) has bidirectional connections with each regions and thus may play a role in recognition memory. Here we investigated, in male rats, whether specific manipulations of NRe function affected performance of recognition memory for single items, object location, or object-in-place associations. Permanent lesions in the NRe significantly impaired long-term, but not short-term, object-in-place associative recognition memory, whereas single item recognition memory and object location memory were unaffected. Temporary inactivation of the NRe during distinct phases of the object-in-place task revealed its importance in both the encoding and retrieval stages of long-term associative recognition memory. Infusions of specific receptor antagonists showed that encoding was dependent on muscarinic and nicotinic cholinergic neurotransmission, whereas NMDA receptor neurotransmission was not required. Finally, we found that long-term object-in-place memory required protein synthesis within the NRe. These data reveal a specific role for the NRe in long-term associative recognition memory through its interactions with the HPC and mPFC, but not the PRH. The delay-dependent involvement of the NRe suggests that it is not a simple relay station between brain regions, but, rather, during high mnemonic demand, facilitates interactions between the mPFC and HPC, a process that requires both cholinergic neurotransmission and protein synthesis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Recognizing an object and its associated location, which is fundamental to our everyday memory, requires specific hippocampal–cortical interactions, potentially facilitated by the nucleus reuniens (NRe) of the thalamus. However, the role of the NRe itself in associative recognition memory is unknown. Here, we reveal the crucial role of the NRe in encoding and retrieval of long-term object-in-place memory, but not for remembrance of an individual object or individual location and such involvement is cholinergic receptor and protein synthesis dependent. This is the first demonstration that the NRe is a key node within an associative recognition memory network and is not just a simple relay for information within the network. Rather, we argue, the NRe actively modulates information processing during long-term associative memory formation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: A Novel Retrieval-Dependent Memory Process Revealed by the Arrest of ERK1/2 Activation in the Basolateral Amygdala</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/13/3199?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Fully consolidated fear memories can be maintained or inhibited by retrieval-dependent mechanisms depending on the degree of re-exposure to fear cues. Short exposures promote memory maintenance through reconsolidation, and long exposures promote inhibition through extinction. Little is known about the neural mechanisms by which increasing cue exposure overrides reconsolidation and instead triggers extinction. Using auditory fear conditioning in male rats, we analyzed the role of a molecular mechanism common to reconsolidation and extinction of fear, ERK1/2 activation within the basolateral amygdala (BLA), after intermediate conditioned stimulus (CS) exposure events. We show that an intermediate re-exposure (four CS presentations) failed to activate ERK1/2 in the BLA, suggesting the absence of reconsolidation or extinction mechanisms. Supporting this hypothesis, pharmacologically inhibiting the BLA ERK1/2-dependent signaling pathway in conjunction with four CS presentations had no effect on fear expression, and the NMDA receptor partial agonist d-cycloserine, which enhanced extinction and ERK1/2 activation in partial extinction protocols (seven CSs), had no behavioral or molecular effect when given in association with four CS presentations. These molecular and behavioral data reveal a novel retrieval-dependent memory phase occurring along the transition between conditioned fear maintenance and inhibition. CS-dependent molecular events in the BLA may arrest reconsolidation intracellular signaling mechanism in an extinction-independent manner. These findings are critical for understanding the molecular underpinnings of fear memory persistence after retrieval both in health and disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Consolidated fear memories can be altered by retrieval-dependent mechanisms. Whereas a brief conditioned stimulus (CS) exposure promotes fear memory maintenance through reconsolidation, a prolonged exposure engages extinction and fear inhibition. The nature of this transition and whether an intermediate degree of CS exposure engages reconsolidation or extinction is unknown. We show that an intermediate cue exposure session (four CSs) produces the arrest of ERK1/2 activation in the basolateral amygdala, a common mechanism for reconsolidation and extinction. Amnestic or hypermnestic treatments given in association with four CSs had no behavioral or molecular effects, respectively. This evidence reveals a novel retrieval-dependent memory phase. Intermediate degrees of CS exposure fail to trigger reconsolidation or extinction, leaving the original memory in an insensitive state.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Elevation of Hippocampal Neurogenesis Induces a Temporally Graded Pattern of Forgetting of Contextual Fear Memories</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/13/3190?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Throughout life neurons are continuously generated in the subgranular zone of the hippocampus. The subsequent integration of newly generated neurons alters patterns of dentate gyrus input and output connectivity, potentially rendering memories already stored in those circuits harder to access. Consistent with this prediction, we previously showed that increasing hippocampal neurogenesis after training induces forgetting of hippocampus-dependent memories, including contextual fear memory. However, the brain regions supporting contextual fear memories change with time, and this time-dependent memory reorganization might regulate the sensitivity of contextual fear memories to fluctuations in hippocampal neurogenesis. By virally expressing the inhibitory designer receptor exclusively activated by designer drugs, hM4Di, we first confirmed that chemogenetic inhibition of dorsal hippocampal neurons impairs retrieval of recent (day-old) but not remote (month-old) contextual fear memories in male mice. We then contrasted the effects of increasing hippocampal neurogenesis at recent versus remote time points after contextual fear conditioning in male and female mice. Increasing hippocampal neurogenesis immediately following training reduced conditioned freezing when mice were replaced in the context 1 month later. In contrast, when hippocampal neurogenesis was increased time points remote to training, conditioned freezing levels were unaltered when mice were subsequently tested. These temporally graded forgetting effects were observed using both environmental and genetic interventions to increase hippocampal neurogenesis. Our experiments identify memory age as a boundary condition for neurogenesis-mediated forgetting and suggest that, as contextual fear memories mature, they become less sensitive to changes in hippocampal neurogenesis levels because they no longer depend on the hippocampus for their expression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; New neurons are generated in the hippocampus throughout life. As they integrate into the hippocampus, they remodel neural circuitry, potentially making information stored in those circuits harder to access. Consistent with this, increasing hippocampal neurogenesis after learning induces forgetting of the learnt information. The current study in mice asks whether these forgetting effects depend on the age of the memory. We found that post-training increases in hippocampal neurogenesis only impacted recently acquired, and not remotely acquired, hippocampal memories. These experiments identify memory age as a boundary condition for neurogenesis-mediated forgetting, and suggest remote memories are less sensitive to changes in hippocampal neurogenesis levels because they no longer depend critically on the hippocampus for their expression.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Codeficiency of Lysosomal Mucolipins 3 and 1 in Cochlear Hair Cells Diminishes Outer Hair Cell Longevity and Accelerates Age-Related Hearing Loss</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/13/3177?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Acquired hearing loss is the predominant neurodegenerative condition associated with aging in humans. Although mutations on several genes are known to cause congenital deafness in newborns, few genes have been implicated in age-related hearing loss (ARHL), perhaps because its cause is likely polygenic. Here, we generated mice lacking lysosomal calcium channel mucolipins 3 and 1 and discovered that both male and female mice suffered a polygenic form of hearing loss. Whereas mucolipin 1 is ubiquitously expressed in all cells, mucolipin 3 is expressed in a small subset of cochlear cells, hair cells (HCs) and marginal cells of the stria vascularis, and very few other cell types. Mice lacking both mucolipins 3 and 1, but not either one alone, experienced hearing loss as early as at 1 month of age. The severity of hearing impairment progressed from high to low frequencies and increased with age. Early onset of ARHL in these mice was accompanied by outer HC (OHC) loss. Adult mice conditionally lacking mucolipins in HCs exhibited comparable auditory phenotypes, thereby revealing that the reason for OHC loss is mucolipin codeficiency in the HCs and not in the stria vascularis. Furthermore, we observed that OHCs lacking mucolipins contained abnormally enlarged lysosomes aggregated at the apical region of the cell, whereas other organelles appeared normal. We also demonstrated that these aberrant lysosomes in OHCs lost their membrane integrity through lysosomal membrane permeabilization, a known cause of cellular toxicity that explains why and how OHCs die, leading to premature ARHL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Presbycusis, or age-related hearing loss (ARHL), is a common characteristic of aging in mammals. Although many genes have been identified to cause deafness from birth in both humans and mice, only a few are known to associate with progressive ARHL, the most prevalent form of deafness. We have found that mice lacking two lysosomal channels, mucolipins 3 and 1, suffer accelerated ARHL due to auditory outer hair cell degeneration, the most common cause of hearing loss and neurodegenerative condition in humans. Lysosomes lacking mucolipins undergo organelle membrane permeabilization and promote cytotoxicity with age, revealing a novel mechanism of outer hair cell degeneration and ARHL. These results underscore the importance of lysosomes in hair cell survival and the maintenance of hearing.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: C8ORF37 Is Required for Photoreceptor Outer Segment Disc Morphogenesis by Maintaining Outer Segment Membrane Protein Homeostasis</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/13/3160?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;C8ORF37&lt;/i&gt; is a causative gene for three different clinical forms of incurable retinal degeneration. However, the completely unknown function of &lt;i&gt;C8ORF37&lt;/i&gt; limits our understanding of the pathogenicity of &lt;i&gt;C8ORF37&lt;/i&gt; mutations. Here, we performed a comprehensive phenotypic characterization of a &lt;i&gt;C8orf37&lt;/i&gt; KO mouse line, generated using CRISPR/Cas9 technology. Both &lt;i&gt;C8orf37&lt;/i&gt; KO male and female mice exhibited progressive and simultaneous degeneration of rod and cone photoreceptors but no non-ocular phenotypes. The major ultrastructural feature of &lt;i&gt;C8orf37&lt;/i&gt; KO photoreceptors was massive disorganization of the outer segment (OS) membrane discs starting from the onset of disc morphogenesis during development. At the molecular level, the amounts of multiple OS-specific membrane proteins, including proteins involved in membrane disc organization, were reduced, although these proteins were targeted normally to the OS. Considering the distribution of C8ORF37 throughout the photoreceptor cell body, the normal structure of the KO photoreceptor connecting cilium, and the absence of defects in other ciliary organs of the KO mice, our findings do not support the previous notion that C8ORF37 was a ciliary protein. Because C8ORF37 is absent in the photoreceptor OS, C8ORF37 may participate in the secretory pathway of OS membrane proteins in the photoreceptor cell body and thus maintain the homeostasis of these proteins. This study established a valid animal model for future therapeutic studies of &lt;i&gt;C8ORF37&lt;/i&gt;-associated retinal degeneration. This study also shed new light on the role of C8ORF37 in photoreceptors and on the pathogenic mechanism underlying retinal degeneration caused by &lt;i&gt;C8ORF37&lt;/i&gt; mutations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Inherited retinal degeneration is a group of incurable conditions with poorly understood underlying molecular mechanisms. We investigated &lt;i&gt;C8ORF37&lt;/i&gt;, a causative gene for three retinal degenerative conditions: retinitis pigmentosa, cone–rod dystrophy, and Bardet–Biedl syndrome. &lt;i&gt;C8ORF37&lt;/i&gt; encodes a protein with no known functional domains and thus its biological function is unpredictable. We knocked out the &lt;i&gt;C8ORF37&lt;/i&gt; ortholog in mice, which resulted in a retinal phenotype similar to that observed in patients. We further demonstrated that C8ORF37 is required for photoreceptor outer segment disc formation and alignment, a process that is critical for photoreceptor function and survival. This study advances our understanding of the pathogenesis of retinal degeneration and establishes a valuable mouse model for future therapeutic development.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1803.10205</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Neuronal network models and corresponding computer simulations are invaluable
tools to aid the interpretation of the relationship between neuron properties,
connectivity and measured activity in cortical tissue. Spatiotemporal patterns
of activity propagating across the cortical surface as observed experimentally
can for example be described by neuronal network models with layered geometry
and distance-dependent connectivity. The interpretation of the resulting stream
of multi-modal and multi-dimensional simulation data calls for integrating
interactive visualization steps into existing simulation-analysis workflows.
Here, we present a set of interactive visualization concepts called views for
the visual analysis of activity data in topological network models, and a
corresponding reference implementation VIOLA (VIsualization Of Layer Activity).
The software is a lightweight, open-source, web-based and platform-independent
application combining and adapting modern interactive visualization paradigms,
such as coordinated multiple views, for massively parallel neurophysiological
data. For a use-case demonstration we consider spiking activity data of a
two-population, layered point-neuron network model subject to a spatially
confined excitation originating from an external population. With the multiple
coordinated views, an explorative and qualitative assessment of the
spatiotemporal features of neuronal activity can be performed upfront of a
detailed quantitative data analysis of specific aspects of the data.
Furthermore, ongoing efforts including the European Human Brain Project aim at
providing online user portals for integrated model development, simulation,
analysis and provenance tracking, wherein interactive visual analysis tools are
one component. Browser-compatible, web-technology based solutions are therefore
required. Within this scope, with VIOLA we provide a first prototype.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1803.09974</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Reconstructing network connectivity from the collective dynamics of a system
typically requires access to its complete continuous-time evolution although
these are often experimentally inaccessible. Here we propose a theory for
revealing physical connectivity of networked systems only from the event time
series their intrinsic collective dynamics generate. Representing the patterns
of event timings in an event space spanned by inter-event and cross-event
intervals, we reveal which other units directly influence the inter-event times
of any given unit. For illustration, we linearize an event space mapping
constructed from the spiking patterns in model neural circuits to reveal the
presence or absence of synapses between any pair of neurons as well as whether
the coupling acts in an inhibiting or activating (excitatory) manner. The
proposed model-independent reconstruction theory is scalable to larger networks
and may thus play an important role in the reconstruction of networks from
biology to social science and engineering.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1803.09807</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A fundamental challenge in neuroscience is to understand what structure in
the world is represented in spatially distributed patterns of neural activity
from multiple single-trial measurements. This is often accomplished by learning
a simple, linear transformations between neural features and features of the
sensory stimuli or motor task. While successful in some early sensory
processing areas, linear mappings are unlikely to be ideal tools for
elucidating nonlinear, hierarchical representations of higher-order brain areas
during complex tasks, such as the production of speech by humans. Here, we
apply deep networks to predict produced speech syllables from cortical surface
electric potentials recorded from human sensorimotor cortex. We found that deep
networks had higher decoding prediction accuracy compared to baseline models,
and also exhibited greater improvements in accuracy with increasing dataset
size. We further demonstrate that deep network's confusions revealed
hierarchical latent structure in the neural data, which recapitulated the
underlying articulatory nature of speech motor control. Finally, we used deep
networks to compare task-relevant information in different neural frequency
bands, and found that the high-gamma band contains the vast majority of
information relevant for the speech prediction task, with little-to-no
additional contribution from lower-frequencies. Together, these results
demonstrate the utility of deep networks as a data analysis tool for
neuroscience.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1803.09574</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Networks of spiking neurons (SNNs) are frequently studied as models for
networks of neurons in the brain, but also as paradigm for novel energy
efficient computing hardware. In principle they are especially suitable for
computations in the temporal domain, such as speech processing, because their
computations are carried out via events in time and space. But so far they have
been lacking the capability to preserve information for longer time spans
during a computation, until it is updated or needed - like a register of a
digital computer. This function is provided to artificial neural networks
through Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) units. We show here that SNNs attain
similar capabilities if one includes adapting neurons in the network.
Adaptation denotes an increase of the firing threshold of a neuron after
preceding firing. A substantial fraction of neurons in the neocortex of rodents
and humans has been found to be adapting. It turns out that if adapting neurons
are integrated in a suitable manner into the architecture of SNNs, the
performance of these enhanced SNNs, which we call LSNNs, for computation in the
temporal domain approaches that of artificial neural networks with LSTM-units.
In addition, the computing and learning capabilities of LSNNs can be
substantially enhanced through learning-to-learn (L2L) methods from machine
learning, that have so far been applied primarily to LSTM networks and
apparently never to SSNs.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Conscious Perception: Time for an Update?. (arXiv:1803.09107v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1803.09107</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Understanding the neural mechanism underlying subjective representation has
become a central endeavor in cognitive-neuroscience. In theories of conscious
perception, stimulus gaining conscious access is usually considered as a
discrete neuronal event to be characterized in time or space, sometimes refer
to as a 'conscious episode'. Surprisingly, the alternative hypothesis according
to which conscious perception is a dynamic process has been rarely considered.
Here, we discuss this hypothesis and envisage its implications. We show how it
can reconcile inconsistent empirical findings on the timing of the neural
correlates of consciousness (NCCs), and make testable predictions. According to
this hypothesis, a stimulus is consciously perceived for as long as it is
recoded to fit an ongoing stream composed of all other perceived stimuli. We
suggest that this 'updating' process is governed by at least three factors (1)
context, (2) stimulus saliency and (3) observer's goal. Finally, this framework
forces us to reconsider the typical distinction between conscious and
unconscious information processing.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1803.09018</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Psychiatric neuroscience is increasingly aware of the need to define
psychopathology in terms of abnormal neural computation. The central tool in
this endeavour is the fitting of computational models to behavioural data. The
most prominent example of this procedure is fitting reinforcement learning (RL)
models to decision-making data collected from mentally ill and healthy subject
populations. These models are generative models of the decision-making data
themselves, and the parameters we seek to infer can be psychologically and
neurobiologically meaningful. Currently, the gold standard approach to this
inference procedure involves Monte-Carlo sampling, which is robust but
computationally intensive---rendering additional procedures, such as
cross-validation, impractical. Searching for point estimates of model
parameters using optimization procedures remains a popular and interesting
option. On a novel testbed simulating parameter estimation from a common RL
task, we investigated the effects of smooth vs. boundary constraints on
parameter estimation using interior point and deterministic direct search
algorithms for optimization. Ultimately, we show that the use of boundary
constraints can lead to substantial truncation effects. Our results discourage
the use of boundary constraints for these applications.

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Prefrontal Oxytocin is Involved in Impairments in Prefrontal Plasticity and Social Memory Following Acute Exposure to High Fat Diet in Juvenile Animals</title>

	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Juvenility represents a critical developmental phase during which exposure to a high fat diet (HFD) can severely modify cognitive and emotional functioning. The purpose of this study was to address how short and acute exposure to a HFD during juvenility affects social memory recognition and prefrontal long-term potentiation (LTP). As LTP and social memory depend on the neuromodulator oxytocin (OXY) and due to its role in metabolism, we also examined the effects of OXY in mediating HFD-induced alterations in social memory and LTP. Our results show that short exposure to a HFD during juvenility impairs social preference memory and prefrontal LTP. Interestingly, whereas systemic injections of OXY reversed the impairments in HFD-fed animals and impaired LTP and memory in control animals; prefrontal injections of the OXY agonist TGOT reversed the effects in HFD animals without affecting control animals. Exposure to HFD was associated with a reduction in the levels of OXY in the prefrontal compared to control animals. Interestingly, the restoration of social memory by TGOT in HFD animals was also associated with normalization of OXY in the prefrontal. These results point to a role that prefrontal OXY has in mediating the effects of HFD on memory and plasticity.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Working Memory Load Modulates Neuronal Coupling</title>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy065/4955775?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;There is a severe limitation in the number of items that can be held in working memory. However, the neurophysiological limits remain unknown. We asked whether the capacity limit might be explained by differences in neuronal coupling. We developed a theoretical model based on Predictive Coding and used it to analyze Cross Spectral Density data from the prefrontal cortex (PFC), frontal eye fields (FEF), and lateral intraparietal area (LIP). Monkeys performed a change detection task. The number of objects that had to be remembered (memory load) was varied (1–3 objects in the same visual hemifield). Changes in memory load changed the connectivity in the PFC–FEF–LIP network. Feedback (top-down) coupling broke down when the number of objects exceeded cognitive capacity. Thus, impaired behavioral performance coincided with a break-down of Prediction signals. This provides new insights into the neuronal underpinnings of cognitive capacity and how coupling in a distributed working memory network is affected by memory load.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Regional GABA Concentrations Modulate Inter-network Resting-state Functional Connectivity</title>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy059/4955774?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Coordinated activity within and differential activity between large-scale neuronal networks such as the default mode network (DMN) and the control network (CN) is a critical feature of brain organization. The CN usually exhibits activations in response to cognitive tasks while the DMN shows deactivations; in addition, activity between the two networks is anti-correlated at rest. To address this issue, we used functional MRI to measure whole-brain BOLD signal during resting-state and task-evoked conditions, and MR spectroscopy (MRS) to quantify GABA and glutamate concentrations, in nodes within the DMN and CN (MPFC and DLPFC, respectively) in 19 healthy individuals at 3 Tesla. We found that GABA concentrations in the MPFC were significantly associated with DMN deactivation during a working memory task and with anti-correlation between DMN and CN at rest and during task performance, while GABA concentrations in the DLPFC weakly modulated DMN–CN anti-correlation in the opposite direction. Highlighting specificity, glutamate played a less significant role related to brain activity. These findings indicate that GABA in the MPFC is potentially involved in orchestrating between-network brain activity at rest and during task performance.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>The physiology of the central nervous system (CNS) is built on a foundation of connection, integration, and the exchange of complex information among brain cells. Emerging evidence indicates that extracellular vesicles (EVs) are key players in the intercellular communication that underlies physiological processes such as synaptic plasticity and the maintenance of myelination. Furthermore, upon injury to the CNS, EVs may propagate inflammation across the blood–brain barrier and beyond, and also appear to mediate neuroprotection and modulate regenerative processes.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Representation of Border, Velocity and Speed in the Goldfish Brain</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/291013v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Like most animals, the survival of fish depends crucially on navigation in space. This capacity has been documented in numerous behavioral studies that have revealed navigation strategies and the sensory modalities used for navigation. However, virtually nothing is known about how fish represent space and locomotion in the brain to enable successful navigation. Using a novel wireless recording system, we measured the activity of single neurons in the goldfish lateral pallium, a brain region known to be involved in spatial memory and navigation, while the fish swam freely in a water tank. Three cell types were identified: border cells, velocity cells and speed cells. Border cells are active when the fish is near the boundary of the environment. Velocity cells encode swimming direction and speed and can represent the direction needed for navigation. Speed cells only encode the absolute speed independent of direction and may provide an odometry signal. This study is thus the first to address the question of how information relevant for navigation may be represented in the fish brain, and address the fundamental question of the neural basis of navigation in this diverse group of vertebrates. The similarities between our observations in fish and earlier findings in mammals may indicate that the networks controlling navigation in vertebrate originate from a common ancient circuit.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: A gate-and-switch model for head orientation behaviors in C. elegans</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/291005v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>The nervous system seamlessly integrates perception and action. This ability is essential for stable representation of and appropriate responses to the external environment. How the sensorimotor integration underlying this ability occurs at the level of individual neurons is of keen interest. In Caenorhabditis elegans, RIA interneurons receive input from sensory pathways and have reciprocal connections with head motor neurons. Through separate physiological mechanisms, RIA simultaneously encodes both head orientation and sensory stimuli. Based on these observations, we proposed a model for how RIA may integrate these two signals to detect the spatial distribution of stimuli across head sweeps and generate directional head responses. Here, we show that blocking synaptic release from RIA disrupts head orientation behaviors in response to unilaterally presented stimuli. We found that sensory encoding in RIA is gated according to head orientation. This dependence on head orientation is independent of motor encoding in RIA, suggesting a second, posture-dependent pathway upstream of RIA. This gating mechanism may allow RIA to selectively attend to stimuli that are asymmetric across head sweeps. Attractive odor removal during head bends triggers rapid head withdrawal in the opposite direction. Unlike sensory encoding, this directional response is dependent on motor inputs to and synaptic output from RIA. Together, these results suggest that RIA is part of a sensorimotor pathway that is dynamically regulated according to head orientation at two levels: the first is a gate that filters sensory representations in RIA, and the second is a switch that routes RIA synaptic output to dorsal or ventral head motor neurons.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Computation is concentrated in rich clubs of local cortical neurons</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/290981v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>To understand how neural circuits process information, it is essential to identify the relationship between computation and circuit topology. Rich-clubs, highly interconnected sets of neurons, are known to propagate a disproportionate amount of information within cortical circuits. Here, we test the hypothesis that rich-clubs also perform a disproportionate amount of computation. To do so, we recorded the spiking activity of on average ~300 well-isolated individual neurons from organotypic cortical cultures. We then constructed weighted, directed networks reflecting the effective connectivity between the neurons. For each neuron, we quantified the amount of computation it performed based on its inputs. We found that rich-club neurons compute ~200% more information than neurons outside of the rich club. Indeed, the amount of computation performed in the rich-club was proportional to the amount information propagation by the same neurons. This suggests that, in these circuits, information propagation drives computation. Comparing the computation-to-propagation ratio inside versus outside of the rich club showed that rich clubs compute at a slightly, though significantly, reduced level (~4% lower). In total, our findings indicate that rich club topology in effective cortical circuits supports not only information propagation but also neural computation.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/290783v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>The entorhinal-hippocampal circuit is a strategic hub for memory but also the first site to be affected in the Alzheimer's Disease (AD)-related pathology. We investigated MRI patterns of brain atrophy and functional connectivity in a study cohort obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative database including healthy control (HC), Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), and AD subjects. MCI individuals were clinically evaluated 24 months after the MRI scan, and the group further divided into a subset of subjects who either did (c-MCI) or did not (nc-MCI) convert to AD. Compared to HC subjects, AD patients exhibited a collapse of long-range connectivity from the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex, pronounced cortical/sub-cortical atrophy, and a dramatic decline in cognitive performances. c-MCI patients showed entorhinal and hippocampal hypo-connectivity, no signs of cortical thinning but evidence of right hippocampus atrophy. On the contrary, nc-MCI patients showed lack of brain atrophy, largely preserved cognitive functions, hippocampal and entorhinal hyper-connectivity with selected neocortical/sub-cortical regions mainly involved in memory processing and brain meta-stability. This hyper-connectivity can represent an early compensatory strategy to overcome the progression of cognitive impairment. This functional signature can also be employed for the diagnosis of c-MCI subjects.</content:encoded>

When making choices, collecting more information is beneficial but comes at the cost of sacrificing time that could be allocated to making other potentially rewarding decisions. To investigate how the brain balances these costs and benefits, we conducted a series of novel experiments in humans and simulated various computational models. Under six levels of time pressure, subjects made decisions either by integrating sensory information over time or by dynamically combining sensory and reward information over time. We found that during sensory integration, time pressure reduced performance as the deadline approached, and choice was more strongly influenced by the most recent sensory evidence. By fitting performance and reaction time with various models we found that our experimental results are more compatible with leaky integration of sensory information with an urgency signal or a decision process based on stochastic transitions between discrete states modulated by an urgency signal. When combining sensory and reward information, subjects spent less time on integration than optimally prescribed when reward decreased slowly over time, and the most recent evidence did not have the maximal influence on choice. The suboptimal pattern of reaction time was partially mitigated in an equivalent control experiment in which sensory integration over time was not required, indicating that the suboptimal response time was influenced by the perception of imperfect sensory integration. Meanwhile, during combination of sensory and reward information, performance did not drop as the deadline approached, and response time was not different between correct and incorrect trials. These results indicate a decision process different from what is involved in the integration of sensory information over time. Together, our results not only reveal limitations in sensory integration over time but also illustrate how these limitations influence dynamic combination of sensory and reward information.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/6W0_cn-RZQs&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Dynamic cues for whisker-based object localization: An analytical solution to vibration during active whisker touch</title>

Vibrations are important cues for tactile perception across species. Whisker-based sensation in mice is a powerful model system for investigating mechanisms of tactile perception. However, the role vibration plays in whisker-based sensation remains unsettled, in part due to difficulties in modeling the vibration of whiskers. Here, we develop an analytical approach to calculate the vibrations of whiskers striking objects. We use this approach to quantify vibration forces during active whisker touch at a range of locations along the whisker. The frequency and amplitude of vibrations evoked by contact are strongly dependent on the position of contact along the whisker. The magnitude of vibrational shear force and bending moment is comparable to quasi-static forces. The fundamental vibration frequencies are in a detectable range for mechanoreceptor properties and below the maximum spike rates of primary sensory afferents. These results suggest two dynamic cues exist that rodents can use for object localization: vibration frequency and comparison of vibrational to quasi-static force magnitude. These complement the use of quasi-static force angle as a distance cue, particularly for touches close to the follicle, where whiskers are stiff and force angles hardly change during touch. Our approach also provides a general solution to calculation of whisker vibrations in other sensing tasks.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/oRjfKRlw_io&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: From correlation to causation: Estimating effective connectivity from zero-lag covariances of brain signals</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/OQUjBd7KMBU/article</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Jonathan Schiefer, Alexander Niederbühl, Volker Pernice, Carolin Lennartz, Jürgen Hennig, Pierre LeVan, Stefan Rotter&lt;/p&gt;

Knowing brain connectivity is of great importance both in basic research and for clinical applications. We are proposing a method to infer directed connectivity from zero-lag covariances of neuronal activity recorded at multiple sites. This allows us to identify causal relations that are reflected in neuronal population activity. To derive our strategy, we assume a generic linear model of interacting continuous variables, the components of which represent the activity of local neuronal populations. The suggested method for inferring connectivity from recorded signals exploits the fact that the covariance matrix derived from the observed activity contains information about the existence, the direction and the sign of connections. Assuming a sparsely coupled network, we disambiguate the underlying causal structure via &lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;-minimization, which is known to prefer sparse solutions. In general, this method is suited to infer effective connectivity from resting state data of various types. We show that our method is applicable over a broad range of structural parameters regarding network size and connection probability of the network. We also explored parameters affecting its activity dynamics, like the eigenvalue spectrum. Also, based on the simulation of suitable Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes to model BOLD dynamics, we show that with our method it is possible to estimate directed connectivity from zero-lag covariances derived from such signals. In this study, we consider measurement noise and unobserved nodes as additional confounding factors. Furthermore, we investigate the amount of data required for a reliable estimate. Additionally, we apply the proposed method on full-brain resting-state fast fMRI datasets. The resulting network exhibits a tendency for close-by areas being connected as well as inter-hemispheric connections between corresponding areas. In addition, we found that a surprisingly large fraction of more than one third of all identified connections were of inhibitory nature.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/OQUjBd7KMBU&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

In the context of an ageing population, understanding the transmission of infectious diseases such as scabies through well-connected sub-units of the population, such as residential care homes, is particularly important for the design of efficient interventions to mitigate against the effects of those diseases. Here, we present a modelling methodology based on the efficient solution of a large-scale system of linear differential equations that allows statistical calibration of individual-based random models to real data on scabies in residential care homes. In particular, we review and benchmark different numerical methods for the integration of the differential equation system, and then select the most appropriate of these methods to perform inference using Markov chain Monte Carlo. We test the goodness-of-fit of this model using posterior predictive intervals and propagate forward the resulting parameter uncertainty in a Bayesian framework to consider the economic cost of delayed interventions against scabies, quantifying the benefits of prompt action in the event of detection. We also revisit the previous methodology used to assess the safety of treatments in small population sub-units—in this context ivermectin—and demonstrate that even a very slight relaxation of the implicit assumption of homogeneous death rates significantly increases the plausibility of the hypothesis that ivermectin does not cause excess mortality based upon the data of Barkwell and Shields [1].&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/UwFpGqUcNck&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Most cancer cells harbor multiple drivers whose epistasis and interactions with expression context clouds drug and drug combination sensitivity prediction. We constructed a mechanistic computational model that is context-tailored by omics data to capture regulation of stochastic proliferation and death by pan-cancer driver pathways. Simulations and experiments explore how the coordinated dynamics of RAF/MEK/ERK and PI-3K/AKT kinase activities in response to synergistic mitogen or drug combinations control cell fate in a specific cellular context. In this MCF10A cell context, simulations suggest that synergistic ERK and AKT inhibitor-induced death is likely mediated by BIM rather than BAD, which is supported by prior experimental studies. AKT dynamics explain S-phase entry synergy between EGF and insulin, but simulations suggest that stochastic ERK, and not AKT, dynamics seem to drive cell-to-cell proliferation variability, which in simulations is predictable from pre-stimulus fluctuations in C-Raf/B-Raf levels. Simulations suggest MEK alteration negligibly influences transformation, consistent with clinical data. Tailoring the model to an alternate cell expression and mutation context, a glioma cell line, allows prediction of increased sensitivity of cell death to AKT inhibition. Our model mechanistically interprets context-specific landscapes between driver pathways and cell fates, providing a framework for designing more rational cancer combination therapy.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/w6d_RFwOJFE&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

intra-areal connectivity with implications on neural simulation platforms.
Two-dimensional grids of cortical columns composed by up to 11 M point-like
spiking neurons with spike frequency adaption were connected by up to 30 G
synapses using short- and long-range connectivity models. The MPI processes
composing the distributed simulator were run on up to 1024 hardware cores,
hosted on a 64 nodes server platform. The hardware platform was a cluster of
IBM NX360 M5 16-core compute nodes, each one containing two Intel Xeon Haswell

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Non-invasive methods to measure brain activity are important to understand
cognitive processes in the human brain. A prominent example is functional
magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), which is a noisy measurement of a delayed
signal that depends non-linearly on the neuronal activity through the
neurovascular coupling. These characteristics make the inference of neuronal
activity from fMRI a difficult but important step in fMRI studies that require
information at the neuronal level. In this article, we address this inference
problem using a Bayesian approach where we model the latent neural activity as
a stochastic process and assume that the observed BOLD signal results from a
realistic physiological (Balloon) model. We apply a recently developed
smoothing method called APIS to efficiently sample the posterior given single
event fMRI time series. To infer neuronal signals with high likelihood for
multiple time series efficiently, a modification of the original algorithm is
introduced. We demonstrate that our adaptive procedure is able to compensate
the lacking of inputs in the model to infer the neuronal activity and that it
outperforms dramatically the standard bootstrap particle filter-smoother in
this setting. This makes the proposed procedure especially attractive to
deconvolve resting state fMRI data. To validate the method, we evaluate the
quality of the signals inferred using the timing information contained in them.
APIS obtains reliable event timing estimates based on fMRI data gathered during
a reaction time experiment with short stimuli. Hence, we show for the first
time that one can obtain accurate absolute timing of neuronal activity by
reconstructing the latent neural signal.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Changes to the axon hillock in frequently firing neurons are known to be
important predictors of early disease states. Studying this phenomenon is
critical to understanding the first insult implicated in multiple
neuro-degenerative disorders. To study these changes we used cyclical
stimulations using micro-electrodes to the axon hillock of mouse intracortical
neurons. Numerical simulation results indicate that axon hillock water
potential fluctuated sinusoidally on high voltage only. Fluctuations in the
amplitude and trend were caused by calcium flow and storage resistance,
respectively. The change in axon hillock-stored water was proportional to the
change rate in water potential. Axon hillock diameter increased with
fluctuations in calcium free media; moreover, it varied slightly under low
voltage conditions. Changes in axon hillock diameter were caused by changes in
water potential, which was determined by subcellular gated channels, media
calcium potential, and other baseline characteristics of neurons.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: A spectrum of routing strategies for brain networks. (arXiv:1803.08541v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1803.08541</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Communication of signals among nodes in a complex network poses fundamental
problems of efficiency and cost. Routing of messages along shortest paths
requires global information about the topology, while spreading by diffusion,
which operates according to local topological features, is informationally
&quot;cheap&quot; but inefficient. We introduce a stochastic model for network
communication that combines varying amounts of local and global information
about the network topology. The model generates a continuous spectrum of
dynamics that converge onto shortest-path and random-walk (diffusion)
communication processes at the limiting extremes. We implement the model on two
cohorts of human connectome networks and investigate the effects of varying
amounts of local and global information on the network's communication cost. We
identify routing strategies that approach a (highly efficient) shortest-path
communication process with a relatively small amount of global information.
Moreover, we show that the cost of routing messages from and to hub nodes
varies as a function of the amount of global information driving the system's
dynamics. Finally, we implement the model to identify individual subject
differences from a communication dynamics point of view. The present framework
departs from the classical shortest paths vs. diffusion dichotomy, suggesting
instead that brain networks may exhibit different types of communication
dynamics depending on varying functional demands and the availability of
resources.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Branching into the Unknown: Inferring collective dynamical states from subsampled systems. (arXiv:1608.07035v2 [physics.data-an] UPDATED)</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.07035</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;When assessing spatially-extended complex systems, one can rarely sample the
states of all components. We show that this spatial subsampling typically leads
to severe underestimation of the risk of instability in systems with
propagating events. We derive a subsampling-invariant estimator, and
demonstrate that it correctly infers the infectiousness of various diseases
under subsampling, making it particularly useful in countries with unreliable
case reports. In neuroscience, recordings are strongly limited by subsampling.
Here, the subsampling-invariant estimator allows to revisit two prominent
hypotheses about the brain's collective spiking dynamics:
asynchronous-irregular or critical. We identify consistently for rat, cat and
monkey a state that combines features of both and allows input to reverberate
in the network for hundreds of milliseconds. Overall, owing to its ready
applicability, the novel estimator paves the way to novel insight for the study
of spatially-extended dynamical systems.

	<content:encoded>The brain is an organ of immense complexity. Next-generation RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) is becoming increasingly popular in the deconstruction of this complexity into distinct classes of ‘cell types’. Notably, in addition to revealing the organization of this distinct cell-type landscape, the technology has also begun to illustrate that continuous variation can be found within narrowly defined cell types. Here we summarize the evidence for graded transcriptomic heterogeneity being present, widespread, and functionally relevant in the nervous system.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/3QzCHPdoiAg/article</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Matthew P. Edgington, Luke S. Alphey&lt;/p&gt;

A number of different genetics-based vector control methods have been proposed. Two approaches currently under development in &lt;i&gt;Aedes aegypti&lt;/i&gt; mosquitoes are the two-locus engineered underdominance and killer-rescue gene drive systems. Each of these is theoretically capable of increasing in frequency within a population, thus spreading associated desirable genetic traits. Thus they have gained attention for their potential to aid in the fight against various mosquito-vectored diseases. In the case of engineered underdominance, introduced transgenes are theoretically capable of persisting indefinitely (i.e. it is self-sustaining) whilst in the killer-rescue system the rescue component should initially increase in frequency (while the lethal component (killer) is common) before eventually declining (when the killer is rare) and being eliminated (i.e. it is temporally self-limiting). The population genetics of both systems have been explored using discrete generation mathematical models. The effects of various ecological factors on these two systems have also been considered using alternative modelling methodologies. Here we formulate and analyse new mathematical models combining the population dynamics and population genetics of these two classes of gene drive that incorporate ecological factors not previously studied and are simple enough to allow the effects of each to be disentangled. In particular, we focus on the potential effects that may be obtained as a result of differing ecological factors such as strengths of larval competition; numbers of breeding sites; and the relative fitness of transgenic mosquitoes compared with their wild-type counterparts. We also extend our models to consider population dynamics in two demes in order to explore the effects of dispersal between neighbouring populations on the outcome of UD and KR gene drive systems.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/3QzCHPdoiAg&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Fluctuating Finite Element Analysis (FFEA): A continuum mechanics software tool for mesoscale simulation of biomolecules</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/hC4qKh8DkTM/article</link>

Fluctuating Finite Element Analysis (FFEA) is a software package designed to perform continuum mechanics simulations of proteins and other globular macromolecules. It combines conventional finite element methods with stochastic thermal noise, and is appropriate for simulations of large proteins and protein complexes at the mesoscale (length-scales in the range of 5 nm to 1 μm), where there is currently a paucity of modelling tools. It requires 3D volumetric information as input, which can be low resolution structural information such as cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) maps or much higher resolution atomistic co-ordinates from which volumetric information can be extracted. In this article we introduce our open source software package for performing FFEA simulations which we have released under a GPLv3 license. The software package includes a C ++ implementation of FFEA, together with tools to assist the user to set up the system from Electron Microscopy Data Bank (EMDB) or Protein Data Bank (PDB) data files. We also provide a PyMOL plugin to perform basic visualisation and additional Python tools for the analysis of FFEA simulation trajectories. This manuscript provides a basic background to the FFEA method, describing the implementation of the core mechanical model and how intermolecular interactions and the solvent environment are included within this framework. We provide prospective FFEA users with a practical overview of how to set up an FFEA simulation with reference to our publicly available online tutorials and manuals that accompany this first release of the package.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/hC4qKh8DkTM&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Beings, animate or inanimate, are dynamical systems which continuously
interact with the (external and /or internal) environment through the physical

the nature of their interactions is determined by the inner workings of their
systems. It is from this perspective that this work attempts to address some of
the long-held philosophical questions, major one among them consciousness-- in
the context of the physicality of the dynamic systems.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: A mechanistic model of connector hubs, modularity, and cognition. (arXiv:1803.08109v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1803.08109</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The human brain network is modular--comprised of communities of tightly
interconnected nodes. This network contains local hubs, which have many
connections within their own communities, and connector hubs, which have
connections diversely distributed across communities. A mechanistic
understanding of these hubs and how they support cognition has not been
demonstrated. Here, we leveraged individual differences in hub connectivity and
cognition. We show that a model of hub connectivity accurately predicts the
cognitive performance of 476 individuals in four distinct tasks. Moreover,
there is a general optimal network structure for cognitive
performance--individuals with diversely connected hubs and consequent modular
brain networks exhibit increased cognitive performance, regardless of the task.
Critically, we find evidence consistent with a mechanistic model in which
connector hubs tune the connectivity of their neighbors to be more modular
while allowing for task appropriate information integration across communities,
which increases global modularity and cognitive performance.

Competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) has emerged as an important post-transcriptional mechanism that simultaneously alters expressions of thousands genes in cancers. However, only a few ceRNA genes have been studied for their functions to date. To understand the major biological functions of thousands ceRNA genes as a whole, we designed Model-based Analysis of Competing-endogenous Pathways (MACPath) to infer pathways co-regulated through ceRNA mechanism (cePathways). Our analysis on breast tumors suggested that NGF (nerve growth factor)-induced tumor cell proliferation might be associated with tumor-related growth factor pathways through ceRNA. MACPath also identified indirect cePathways, whose ceRNA relationship is mediated by mediating ceRNAs. Finally, MACPath identified mediating ceRNAs that connect the indirect cePathways based on efficient &lt;i&gt;integer linear programming&lt;/i&gt; technique. Mediating ceRNAs are unexpectedly enriched in tumor suppressor genes, whose down-regulation is suspected to disrupt indirect cePathways, such as between DNA replication and WNT signaling pathways. Altogether, MACPath is the first computational method to comprehensively understand functions of thousands ceRNA genes, both direct and indirect, at the pathway level.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/8vndNEzF5NY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-modulated (HCN) channels control electrical rhythmicity in specialized brain and heart cells. We quantitatively analysed voltage-dependent activation of homotetrameric HCN2 channels and its modulation by the second messenger cAMP using global fits of hidden Markovian models to complex experimental data. We show that voltage-dependent activation is essentially governed by two separable voltage-dependent steps followed by voltage-independent opening of the pore. According to this model analysis, the binding of cAMP to the channels exerts multiple effects on the voltage-dependent gating: It stabilizes the open pore, reduces the total gating charge from ~8 to ~5, makes an additional closed state outside the activation pathway accessible and strongly accelerates the ON-gating but not the OFF-gating. Furthermore, the open channel has a much slower computed OFF-gating current than the closed channel, in both the absence and presence of cAMP. Together, these results provide detailed new insight into the voltage- and cAMP-induced activation gating of HCN channels.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/syBDlU90QXo&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Understanding how neurons cooperate to integrate sensory inputs and guide behavior is a fundamental problem in neuroscience. A large body of methods have been developed to study neuronal firing at the single cell and population levels, generally seeking interpretability as well as predictivity. However, these methods are usually confronted with the lack of ground-truth necessary to validate the approach. Here, using neuronal data from the head-direction (HD) system, we present evidence demonstrating how gradient boosted trees, a non-linear and supervised Machine Learning tool, can learn the relationship between behavioral parameters and neuronal responses with high accuracy by optimizing the information rate. Interestingly, and unlike other classes of Machine Learning methods, the intrinsic structure of the trees can be interpreted in relation to behavior (e.g. to recover the tuning curves) or to study how neurons cooperate with their peers in the network. We show how the method, unlike linear analysis, reveals that the coordination in thalamo-cortical circuits is qualitatively the same during wakefulness and sleep, indicating a brain-state independent feed-forward circuit. Machine Learning tools thus open new avenues for benchmarking model-based characterization of spike trains.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/eLys5LrtLXM&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

To move a hard table together, humans may coordinate by following the dominant partner’s motion [1–4], but this strategy is unsuitable for a soft mattress where the perceived forces are small. How do partners readily coordinate in such differing interaction dynamics? To address this, we investigated how pairs tracked a target using flexion-extension of their wrists, which were coupled by a hard, medium or soft virtual elastic band. Tracking performance monotonically increased with a stiffer band for the worse partner, who had higher tracking error, at the cost of the skilled partner’s muscular effort. This suggests that the worse partner followed the skilled one’s lead, but simulations show that the results are better explained by a model where partners share movement goals through the forces, whilst the coupling dynamics determine the capacity of communicable information. This model elucidates the versatile mechanism by which humans can coordinate during both hard and soft physical interactions to ensure maximum performance with minimal effort.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/bXD1PWYahz8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Measuring and Validating the Levels of Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor in Human Serum</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/5/2/ENEURO.0419-17.2018?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) secreted by neurons is a significant component of synaptic plasticity. In humans, it is also present in blood platelets where it accumulates following its biosynthesis in megakaryocytes. BDNF levels are thus readily detectable in human serum and it has been abundantly speculated that they may somehow serve as an indicator of brain function. However, there is a great deal of uncertainty with regard to the range of BDNF levels that can be considered normal, how stable these values are over time and even whether BDNF levels can be reliably measured in serum. Using monoclonal antibodies and a sandwich ELISA, this study reports on BDNF levels in the serum of 259 volunteers with a mean value of 32.69 ± 8.33 ng/ml (SD). The mean value for the same cohort after 12 months was not significantly different (&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt; = 226, 32.97 ± 8.36 ng/ml SD, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.19). Power analysis of these values indicates that relatively large cohorts are necessary to identify significant differences, requiring a group size of 60 to detect a 20% change. The levels determined by ELISA could be validated by Western blot analyses using a BDNF monoclonal antibody. While no association was observed with gender, a weak, positive correlation was found with age. The overall conclusions are that BDNF levels can be reliably measured in human serum, that these levels are quite stable over one year, and that comparisons between two populations may only be meaningful if cohorts of sufficient sizes are assembled.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>RSS PAP: Combined Blockade of Interleukin-1 {alpha} and {beta} Signaling Protects Mice from Cognitive Dysfunction after Traumatic Brain Injury</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0385-17.2018v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Diffuse activation of interleukin-1 inflammatory cytokine signaling after traumatic brain injury (TBI) elicits progressive neurodegeneration and neuropsychiatric dysfunction, and thus represents a potential opportunity for therapeutic intervention. Although IL-1α and IL-1β both activate the common type 1 interleukin-1 receptor (IL-1RI), they manifest distinct injury-specific roles in some models of neurodegeneration. Despite its potential relevance to treating patients with TBI, however, the individual contributions of IL-1α and IL-1β to TBI-pathology have not been previously investigated. To address this need, we applied genetic and pharmacologic approaches in mice to dissect the individual contributions of IL-1α, IL-β, and IL-1RI signaling to the pathophysiology of fluid percussion-mediated TBI, a model of mixed focal and diffuse TBI. IL-1RI ablation conferred a greater protective effect on brain cytokine expression and cognitive function after TBI than did individual IL-1α or IL-1β ablation. This protective effect was recapitulated by treatment with the drug anakinra, a recombinant naturally-occurring IL-1RI antagonist. Our data thus suggest that broad targeting of IL-1RI signaling is more likely to reduce neuroinflammation and preserve cognitive function after TBI than are approaches that individually target IL-1α or IL-1β signaling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Traumatic brain injury is a leading cause of death and disability. Secondary signaling cascades, including neuroinflammation, trigger progressive neuronal injury following TBI. Interleukin-1 (IL-1) is a major driver of the neuroinflammatory response to brain injury, but the impact of individual IL-1α or IL-1β blockade on TBI outcome had not been evaluated. Using genetic and pharmacologic approaches, we dissected the contributions of IL-1α, IL-β, and IL-1RI to the pathophysiology of fluid percussion-mediated TBI. We show that genetic ablation of IL-1RI conferred the greatest benefit after TBI. Moreover, the beneficial effects were recapitulated by treatment with an IL-1RI antagonist. Given the need for the development of effective therapies that mitigate neurodegeneration after TBI, this is a timely, relevant area of study.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>RSS PAP: Sensorimotor Representation of Speech Perception - Cross-Decoding of Place of Articulation Features during Selective Attention to Syllables in 7T fMRI</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0252-17.2018v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Sensorimotor integration, the translation between acoustic signals and motoric programs, may constitute a crucial mechanism for speech. During speech perception, the acoustic-motoric translations include the recruitment of cortical areas for the representation of speech articulatory features, such as place of articulation. Selective attention can shape the processing and performance of speech perception tasks. Whether and where sensorimotor integration takes place during attentive speech perception remains to be explored. Here, we investigate articulatory feature representations of spoken consonant-vowel syllables during two distinct tasks. Fourteen healthy humans attended to either the vowel or the consonant within a syllable in separate delayed-match-to-sample tasks. Single-trial fMRI BOLD responses from perception periods were analyzed using multivariate pattern classification and a searchlight approach to reveal neural activation patterns sensitive to the processing of place of articulation (i.e., bilabial/labiodental vs. alveolar). To isolate place of articulation representation from acoustic covariation, we applied a cross-decoding (generalization) procedure across distinct features of manner of articulation (i.e., stop, fricative, and nasal). We found evidence for the representation of place of articulation across tasks and in both tasks separately: for attention to vowels, generalization maps included bilateral clusters of superior and posterior temporal, insular, and frontal regions; for attention to consonants, generalization maps encompassed clusters in temporoparietal, insular, and frontal regions within the right hemisphere only. Our results specify the cortical representation of place of articulation features generalized across manner of articulation during attentive syllable perception, thus supporting sensorimotor integration during attentive speech perception and demonstrating the value of generalization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Speech is supported by sensorimotor integration, a bidirectional translation of its auditory and motoric signals. Whether our brain represents speech as articulatory features during selective attention has not yet been well specified. We focused on the representation of articulatory information of speech during attentive speech perception. For the first time, we applied generalization in classification analysis to counteract the differences in acoustic properties that accompany articulatory information. Participants attended to either the vowels or consonants of syllables, while undergoing fMRI. Our results show that articulatory information is represented in widespread cortical areas during selective attention to the different syllable components, supporting sensorimotor integration during attentive speech perception.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Scan transcription of two-dimensional shapes as an alternative neuromorphic concept. (arXiv:1803.07883v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1803.07883</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Selfridge, along with Sutherland and Marr provided some of the earliest
proposals for how to program computers to recognize shapes. Their emphasis on
filtering for contour features, especially the orientation of boundary
segments, was reinforced by the Nobel Prize winning work of Hubel &amp;amp; Wiesel who
discovered that neurons in primary visual cortex selectively respond as a
function of contour orientation. Countless investigators and theorists have
continued to build on this approach. These models are often described as
neuromorphic, which implies that the computational methods are based on
biologically plausible principles. Recent work from the present lab has
challenged the emphasis on orientation selectivity and the use of neural
network principles. The goal of the present report is not to relitigate those
issues, but to provide an alternative concept for encoding of shape information
that may be useful to neuromorphic modelers.

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Role of genetic heterogeneity in determining the epidemiological severity of H1N1 influenza</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/x5hYH_0EN7g/article</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Narmada Sambaturu, Sumanta Mukherjee, Martín López-García, Carmen Molina-París, Gautam I. Menon, Nagasuma Chandra&lt;/p&gt;

Genetic differences contribute to variations in the immune response mounted by different individuals to a pathogen. Such differential response can influence the spread of infectious disease, indicating why such diseases impact some populations more than others. Here, we study the impact of population-level genetic heterogeneity on the epidemic spread of different strains of H1N1 influenza. For a population with known HLA class-I allele frequency and for a given H1N1 viral strain, we classify individuals into sub-populations according to their level of susceptibility to infection. Our core hypothesis is that the susceptibility of a given individual to a disease such as H1N1 influenza is inversely proportional to the number of high affinity viral epitopes the individual can present. This number can be extracted from the HLA genetic profile of the individual. We use ethnicity-specific HLA class-I allele frequency data, together with genome sequences of various H1N1 viral strains, to obtain susceptibility sub-populations for 61 ethnicities and 81 viral strains isolated in 2009, as well as 85 strains isolated in other years. We incorporate these data into a multi-compartment SIR model to analyse the epidemic dynamics for these (ethnicity, viral strain) epidemic pairs. Our results show that HLA allele profiles which lead to a large spread in individual susceptibility values can act as a protective barrier against the spread of influenza. We predict that populations skewed such that a small number of highly susceptible individuals coexist with a large number of less susceptible ones, should exhibit smaller outbreaks than populations with the same average susceptibility but distributed more uniformly across individuals. Our model tracks some well-known qualitative trends of influenza spread worldwide, suggesting that HLA genetic diversity plays a crucial role in determining the spreading potential of different influenza viral strains across populations.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/x5hYH_0EN7g&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Susceptibility to Oxidative Stress Is Determined by Genetic Background in Neuronal Cell Cultures</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/5/2/ENEURO.0335-17.2018?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Traumatic brain injury (TBI) leads to a deleterious and multifactorial secondary inflammatory response in the brain. Oxidative stress from the inflammation likely contributes to the brain damage although it is unclear to which extent. A largely unexplored approach is to consider phenotypic regulation of oxidative stress levels. Genetic polymorphism influences inflammation in the central nervous system and it is possible that the antioxidative response differs between phenotypes and affects the severity of the secondary injury. We therefore compared the antioxidative response in inbred rat strains dark agouti (DA) to piebald viral glaxo (PVG). DA has high susceptibility to inflammatory challenges and PVG is protected. Primary neuronal cell cultures were exposed to peroxynitrite (ONOO&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt;), nitric oxide (NO), superoxide (O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt;), and 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE). Our findings demonstrated a phenotypic control of the neuronal antioxidative response, specific to manganese O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt; dismutase (MnSOD). DA neurons had increased levels of MnSOD, equal levels of peroxiredoxin 5 (PRDX5), decreased oxidative stress markers 3-nitrotyrosine (3-NT) and 4-HNE and decreased neuronal death detected by lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release after 24 h, and higher oxidative stress levels by CellROX than PVG after 2 h. It is possible that DA neurons had a phenotypic adaptation to a fiercer inflammatory environment. ONOO&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt; was confirmed as the most powerful oxidative damage mediator, while 4-HNE caused few oxidative effects. Inducible NO synthase (iNOS) was not induced, suggesting that inflammatory, while not oxidative stimulation was required. These findings indicate that phenotypic antioxidative regulation affects the secondary inflammation, which should be considered in future individualized treatments and when evaluating antioxidative pharmacological interventions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>RSS PAP: Common Sense in Choice: The Effect of Sensory Modality on Neural Value Representations</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0346-17.2018v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Although it is well established that the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) represents value using a common currency across categories of rewards, it is unknown whether the vmPFC represents value irrespective of the sensory modality in which alternatives are presented. In the current study, male and female human subjects completed a decision-making task while their neural activity was recorded using functional magnetic resonance imaging. On each trial, subjects chose between a safe alternative and a lottery, which was presented visually or aurally. A univariate conjunction analysis revealed that the anterior portion of the vmPFC tracks subjective value irrespective of the sensory modality. Using a novel cross-modality multivariate classifier, we were able to decode auditory value based on visual trials and vice versa. In addition, we found that the visual and auditory sensory cortices, which were identified using functional localizers, are also sensitive to the value of stimuli, albeit in a modality-specific manner. Whereas both primary and higher-order auditory cortices represented auditory subjective value, only a higher-order visual area represented visual subjective value. These findings expand our understanding of the Common Currency Network of the brain, and shed a new light on the interplay between sensory and value information processing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Whether auditory information has the same impact on the value system as visual information is unknown. This is striking, given that we live in a multimodal world, and decision-making relies on evidence from all of our senses. It is well-known that the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) represents value in an abstract and common manner, which allows comparison between different options. We examined whether this representation is sensitive to the sensory modality in which options are presented. Using fMRI and a risk-evaluating task, we show that whereas sensory cortices represent value of options in a modality-specific way, the vmPFC represents value irrespective of sensory modality. This brings our understanding of the neural value system closer to choices in the real world.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>RSS PAP: Dopaminergic Drug Effects on Probability Weighting during Risky Decision-Making</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0330-18.2018v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Dopamine has been associated with risky decision-making, as well as with pathological gambling, a behavioural addiction characterized by excessive risk-taking behaviour. However, the specific mechanisms through which dopamine might act to foster risk-taking and pathological gambling remain elusive. Here we test the hypothesis that this might be achieved, in part, via modulation of subjective probability weighting during decision-making. Human healthy controls (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 21) and pathological gamblers (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 16) played a decision-making task involving choices between sure monetary options and risky gambles both in the gain and loss domains. Each participant played the task twice, either under placebo or the dopamine D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/D&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; receptor antagonist sulpiride, in a double-blind counter-balanced design. A prospect theory modelling approach was used to estimate subjective probability weighting and sensitivity to monetary outcomes. Consistent with prospect theory, we found that participants presented a distortion in the subjective weighting of probabilities, i.e. they overweighted low probabilities and underweighted moderate to high probabilities, both in the gain and loss domains. Compared with placebo, sulpiride attenuated this distortion in the gain domain. Across drugs, the groups did not differ in their probability weighting, although gamblers consistently underweighted losing probabilities in the placebo condition. Overall, our results reveal that dopamine D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/D&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; receptor antagonism modulates the subjective weighting of probabilities in the gain domain, in the direction of more objective, economically rational decision-making.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Dopamine has been implicated in risky decision-making and gambling addiction, but the exact mechanisms underlying this influence remain partly elusive. Here we tested the hypothesis that dopamine modulates subjective probability weighting, by examining the effect of a dopaminergic drug on risk-taking behavior, both in healthy individuals and pathologic gamblers. We found that selectively blocking dopamine D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/D&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; receptors diminished the typically observed distortion of winning probabilities, characterized by an overweighting of low probabilities and underweighting of high probabilities. This made participants more linear in their subjective estimation of probabilities and thus more rational in their decision-making behavior. Healthy participants and pathologic gamblers did not differ in their risk-taking behavior, except in the placebo condition in which gamblers consistently underweighted losing probabilities.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>RSS PAP: Excitatory Neuronal Responses of Ca2+ Transients in Interstitial Cells of Cajal in the Small Intestine</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0080-18.2018v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Interstitial cells of Cajal (ICC) regulate smooth muscle excitability and motility in the gastrointestinal tract. ICC in the deep muscular plexus (ICC-DMP) of the small intestine are aligned closely with varicosities of enteric motor neurons and thought to transduce neural responses. ICC-DMP generate Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; transients that activate Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; activated Cl&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; channels and generate electrophysiological responses. We tested the hypothesis that excitatory neurotransmitters regulate Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; transients in ICC-DMP as a means of regulating intestinal muscles. High-resolution confocal microscopy was used to image Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; transients in ICC-DMP within murine small intestinal muscles with cell-specific expression of GCaMP3. Intrinsic nerves were stimulated by electrical field stimulation (EFS). ICC-DMP exhibited ongoing Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; transients before stimuli were applied. EFS caused initial suppression of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; transients, followed by escape during sustained stimulation, and large increases in Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; transients after cessation of stimulation. Basal Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; activity and the excitatory phases of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; responses to EFS were inhibited by atropine and neurokinin 1 receptor (NK1) antagonists, but not by NK2 receptor antagonists. Exogenous ACh and substance P increased Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; transients, atropine and NK1 antagonists decreased Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; transients. Neurokinins appear to be released spontaneously (tonic excitation) in small intestinal muscles and are the dominant excitatory neurotransmitters. Subcellular regulation of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; release events in ICC-DMP may be a means by which excitatory neurotransmission organizes intestinal motility patterns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Interstitial cells of Cajal (ICC) are innervated by enteric motor neurons and thought to transduce neural responses in GI muscles. Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; transients, due to Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; release from Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; intracellular stores, mediate electrophysiological events in ICC by activation of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-activated Cl&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; channels. Neural responses in ICC in the deep muscular plexus of the small intestine (ICC-DMP) were studied by confocal imaging of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; transients in these cells. Excitatory neural input was due to cholinergic and peptidergic neurotransmitters (acetylcholine and neurokinins), as excitatory effects on Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; transients were blocked by atropine and neurokinin receptor antagonists. Neurokinins are the dominant excitatory regulators of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; transients in ICC-DMP. ICC-DMP are innervated by enteric motor neurons and mediate significant excitatory responses in intestinal muscles.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>http://www.cell.com/trends/neurosciences/fulltext/S0166-2236(18)30062-6?rss=yes</link>
	<content:encoded>A predominant view of perirhinal cortex (PRC) and postrhinal/parahippocampal cortex (POR/PHC) function contends that these structures are tuned to represent objects and spatial information, respectively. However, known anatomical connectivity, together with recent electrophysiological, neuroimaging, and lesion data, indicate that both brain areas participate in spatial and nonspatial processing. Instead of content-based organization, the PRC and PHC/POR may participate in two computationally distinct cortical–hippocampal networks: one network that is tuned to process coarse information quickly, forming gist-like representations of scenes/environments, and a second network tuned to process information about the specific sensory details that are necessary for discrimination across sensory modalities.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy054/4938776?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Humans commonly operate within 3D environments such as multifloor buildings and yet there is a surprising dearth of studies that have examined how these spaces are represented in the brain. Here, we had participants learn the locations of paintings within a virtual multilevel gallery building and then used behavioral tests and fMRI repetition suppression analyses to investigate how this 3D multicompartment space was represented, and whether there was a bias in encoding vertical and horizontal information. We found faster response times for within-room egocentric spatial judgments and behavioral priming effects of visiting the same room, providing evidence for a compartmentalized representation of space. At the neural level, we observed a hierarchical encoding of 3D spatial information, with left anterior hippocampus representing local information within a room, while retrosplenial cortex, parahippocampal cortex, and posterior hippocampus represented room information within the wider building. Of note, both our behavioral and neural findings showed that vertical and horizontal location information was similarly encoded, suggesting an isotropic representation of 3D space even in the context of a multicompartment environment. These findings provide much-needed information about how the human brain supports spatial memory and navigation in buildings with numerous levels and rooms.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Measurements of somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs), recorded using electroencephalography during different phases of movement, have been fundamental in understanding the neurophysiological changes related to motor control. SEP recordings have also been used to investigate adaptive plasticity changes in somatosensory processing related to active and observational motor learning tasks. Combining noninvasive brain stimulation with SEP recordings and intracranial SEP depth recordings, including recordings from deep brain stimulation electrodes, has been critical in identifying neural areas involved in specific temporal stages of somatosensory processing.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Current antiaging strategies focusing on druggable targets have met with relatively limited success to date. Replacement of cells, tissues, and organs could provide an alternative means for targeting age-induced damage and potentially eliminating some of it. However, before this is a viable option, numerous challenges need to be addressed. Most notably, whether the brain, which defines our self-identity, is amenable to replacement therapies is unclear. Here, we consider whether progressive cell replacement is a potential approach to reverse brain aging without grossly altering function.</content:encoded>

	<title>RSS PAP: Brain Activity during Methamphetamine Anticipation in a Non-Invasive Self-Administration Paradigm in Mice</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0433-17.2018v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;The ability to sense time and anticipate events is critical for survival. Learned responses that allow anticipation of the availability of food or water have been intensively studied. While anticipatory behaviors also occur prior to availability of regularly available rewards, there has been relatively little work on anticipation of drugs of abuse, specifically methamphetamine (MA). In the present study, we used a protocol that avoided possible CNS effects of stresses of handling or surgery by testing anticipation of MA availability in animals living in their home cages, with daily voluntary access to the drug at a fixed time of day. Anticipation was operationalized as the amount of wheel running prior to MA availability. Mice were divided into four groups given access to either nebulized MA or water, in early or late day. Animals with access to MA, but not water controls, showed anticipatory activity, with more anticipation in early compared to late day and significant interaction effects. Next, we explored the neural basis of the MA anticipation, using c-FOS expression, in animals euthanized at the usual time of nebulization access. In the dorsomedial hypothalamus and orbitofrontal cortex, the pattern of c-FOS expression paralleled that of anticipatory behavior, with significant main and interaction effects of treatment and time of day. The results for the lateral septum were significant for main effects and marginally significant for interaction effects. These studies suggest that anticipation of MA is associated with activation of brain regions important in circadian timing, emotional regulation and decision-making.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; A primary function of the brain is to predict future events. Brain regions regulating anticipation of drugs have received little analysis. We studied methamphetamine anticipation in mice living in their home cage and having access to nebulized methamphetamine for 1hr daily via a tunnel to a nebulizing chamber. Mice spontaneously awakened from sleep ~2hr before methamphetamine availability and voluntarily entered the chamber when accessible. This protocol avoided the potential CNS effects associated with handling, injections and surgery. c-FOS expression before methamphetamine availability was observed in the dorsomedial hypothalamus, lateral septum, and orbitofrontal cortex, suggesting that anticipation of regularly scheduled methamphetamine is associated with activation of brain regions important in circadian timing, emotional regulation and decision-making.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Isoflurane Impairs Low-Frequency Feedback but Leaves High-Frequency Feedforward Connectivity Intact in the Fly Brain</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/5/1/ENEURO.0329-17.2018?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Hierarchically organized brains communicate through feedforward (FF) and feedback (FB) pathways. In mammals, FF and FB are mediated by higher and lower frequencies during wakefulness. FB is preferentially impaired by general anesthetics in multiple mammalian species. This suggests FB serves critical functions in waking brains. The brain of &lt;i&gt;Drosophila melanogaster&lt;/i&gt; (fruit fly) is also hierarchically organized, but the presence of FB in these brains is not established. Here, we studied FB in the fly brain, by simultaneously recording local field potentials (LFPs) from low-order peripheral structures and higher-order central structures. We analyzed the data using Granger causality (GC), the first application of this analysis technique to recordings from the insect brain. Our analysis revealed that low frequencies (0.1–5 Hz) mediated FB from the center to the periphery, while higher frequencies (10–45 Hz) mediated FF in the opposite direction. Further, isoflurane anesthesia preferentially reduced FB. Our results imply that the spectral characteristics of FF and FB may be a signature of hierarchically organized brains that is conserved from insects to mammals. We speculate that general anesthetics may induce unresponsiveness across species by targeting the mechanisms that support FB.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>RSS PAP: Measuring and Validating the Levels of Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor in Human Serum</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0419-17.2018v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) secreted by neurons is a significant component of synaptic plasticity. In humans, it is also present in blood platelets where it accumulates following its biosynthesis in megakaryocytes. BDNF levels are thus readily detectable in human serum and it has been abundantly speculated that they may somehow serve as an indicator of brain function. However, there is a great deal of uncertainty with regard to the range of BDNF levels that can be considered normal, how stable these values are over time and even whether BDNF levels can be reliably measured in serum. Using monoclonal antibodies and a sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), this study reports on BDNF levels in the serum of 259 volunteers with a mean value of 32.69 ± 8.33 ng/ml (SD). The mean value for the same cohort after 12 months was not significantly different (N = 226, 32.97 ± 8.36 ng/ml SD, p = 0.19). Power analysis of these values indicates that relatively large cohorts are necessary to identify significant differences, requiring a group size of 60 to detect a 20% change. The levels determined by ELISA could be validated by Western blot analyses using a BDNF monoclonal antibody. Whilst no association was observed with gender, a weak, &lt;i&gt;positive&lt;/i&gt; correlation was found with age. The overall conclusions are that BDNF levels can be reliably measured in human serum, that these levels are quite stable over one year, and that comparisons between two populations may only be meaningful if cohorts of sufficient sizes are assembled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; The presence of BDNF in human blood has generated considerable interest as illustrated by the very large number of publications associating BDNF levels with various conditions affecting brain function, including depression and neurodegeneration. Yet a range of technical issues, together with a lack of plausible mechanisms explaining this association, raise questions as to the meaning and value of such measurements. This contribution deals with the feasibility of reliably measuring BDNF levels in human serum and gives indications of the size of cohorts to be recruited for meaningful differences to be observed between populations of interest.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>RSS PAP: Susceptibility to Oxidative Stress Is Determined by Genetic Background in Neuronal Cell Cultures</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0335-17.2018v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Traumatic brain injury (TBI) leads to a deleterious and multifactorial secondary inflammatory response in the brain. Oxidative stress from the inflammation likely contributes to the brain damage although it is unclear to which extent. A largely unexplored approach is to consider phenotypic regulation of oxidative stress levels. Genetic polymorphism influences inflammation in the central nervous system and it is possible that the antioxidative response differs between phenotypes and affects the severity of the secondary injury. We therefore compared the antioxidative response in inbred rat strains Dark Agouti (DA) to Piebald Viral Glaxo (PVG). DA has high susceptibility to inflammatory challenges and PVG is protected. Primary neuronal cell cultures were exposed to peroxynitrite (ONOO&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;), nitric oxide (NO), superoxide (O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;) and 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE). Our findings demonstrated a phenotypic control of the neuronal antioxidative response, specific to manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD). DA neurons had increased levels of MnSOD, equal levels of peroxiredoxin 5, decreased oxidative stress markers 3-Nitrotyrosine and 4-HNE and decreased neuronal death detected by lactate dehydrogenase release after 24h, and higher oxidative stress levels by CellROX than PVG after 2h. It is possible that DA neurons had a phenotypic adaptation to a fiercer inflammatory environment. Peroxynitrite was confirmed as the most powerful oxidative damage mediator, while 4-HNE caused few oxidative effects. iNOS was not induced, suggesting that inflammatory, while not oxidative stimulation was required. These findings indicate that phenotypic antioxidative regulation affects the secondary inflammation, which should be considered in future individualized treatments and when evaluating antioxidative pharmacological interventions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Neurotrauma leads to inflammation and oxidative stress in the brain. The outcome differs between individuals and it is largely unknown what causes this diversity. It is possible that the brain phenotype is linked to oxidative stress levels, and that some individuals acquire less oxidative stress than others. We therefore tested the oxidative stress reaction patterns in rat neurons from two strains with different susceptibility to inflammation. We found that the phenotypes have different regulation of antioxidative enzymes and oxidative stress. While further studies are needed to corroborate the findings &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;, it is a proof of concept of genetic regulation of direct oxidative stress, which may impact outcome after TBI and interact with future antioxidative treatment trials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Neurons are dynamic cells that respond and adapt to stimuli throughout their long postmitotic lives. The structural and functional plasticity of neurons requires the regulated transcription of new gene products, and dysregulation of transcription in either the developing or adult brain impairs cognition. We discuss how mechanisms of chromatin regulation help to orchestrate the transcriptional programs that underlie the maturation of developing neurons and the plasticity of adult neurons. We review how chromatin regulation acts locally to modulate the expression of specific genes and more broadly to coordinate gene expression programs during transitions between cellular states.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Post-translational modification of substrate proteins by SUMO conjugation regulates a diverse array of cellular processes. While predominantly a nuclear protein modification, there is a growing appreciation that SUMOylation of proteins outside the nucleus plays direct roles in controlling synaptic transmission, neuronal excitability, and adaptive responses to cell stress. Furthermore, alterations in protein SUMOylation are observed in a wide range of neurological and neurodegenerative diseases, and several extranuclear disease-associated proteins have been shown to be directly SUMOylated.</content:encoded>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Collateral Projections Innervate the Mammillary Bodies and Retrosplenial Cortex: A New Category of Hippocampal Cells</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/5/1/ENEURO.0383-17.2018?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;To understand the hippocampus, it is necessary to understand the subiculum. Unlike other hippocampal subfields, the subiculum projects to almost all distal hippocampal targets, highlighting its critical importance for external networks. The present studies, in male rats and mice, reveal a new category of dorsal subiculum neurons that innervate both the mammillary bodies (MBs) and the retrosplenial cortex (RSP). These bifurcating neurons comprise almost half of the hippocampal cells that project to RSP. The termination of these numerous collateral projections was visualized within the medial mammillary nucleus and the granular RSP (area 29). These collateral projections included subiculum efferents that cross to the contralateral MBs. Within the granular RSP, the collateral projections form a particularly dense plexus in deep Layer II and Layer III. This retrosplenial termination site colocalized with markers for VGluT2 and neurotensin. While efferents from the hippocampal CA fields standardly collateralize, subiculum projections often have only one target site. Consequently, the many collateral projections involving the RSP and the MBs present a relatively unusual pattern for the subiculum, which presumably relates to how both targets have complementary roles in spatial processing. Furthermore, along with the anterior thalamic nuclei, the MBs and RSP are key members of a memory circuit, which is usually described as both starting and finishing in the hippocampus. The present findings reveal how the hippocampus simultaneously engages different parts of this circuit, so forcing an important revision of this network.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Losing Control in Social Situations: How the Presence of Others Affects Neural Processes Related to Sense of Agency</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/5/1/ENEURO.0336-17.2018?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Social contexts substantially influence individual behavior, but little is known about how they affect cognitive processes related to voluntary action. Previously, it has been shown that social context reduces participants’ sense of agency over the outcomes of their actions and outcome monitoring. In this fMRI study on human volunteers, we investigated the neural mechanisms by which social context alters sense of agency. Participants made costly actions to stop inflating a balloon before it burst. On &quot;social&quot; trials, another player could act in their stead, but we analyzed only trials in which the other player remained passive. We hypothesized that mentalizing processes during social trials would affect decision-making fluency and lead to a decreased sense of agency. In line with this hypothesis, we found increased activity in the bilateral temporo-parietal junction (TPJ), precuneus, and middle frontal gyrus during social trials compared with nonsocial trials. Activity in the precuneus was, in turn, negatively related to sense of agency at a single-trial level. We further found a double dissociation between TPJ and angular gyrus (AG): activity in the left AG was not sensitive to social context but was negatively related to sense of agency. In contrast, activity in the TPJ was modulated by social context but was not sensitive to sense of agency.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Reliability-Weighted Integration of Audiovisual Signals Can Be Modulated by Top-down Attention</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/5/1/ENEURO.0315-17.2018?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Behaviorally, it is well established that human observers integrate signals near-optimally weighted in proportion to their reliabilities as predicted by maximum likelihood estimation. Yet, despite abundant behavioral evidence, it is unclear how the human brain accomplishes this feat. In a spatial ventriloquist paradigm, participants were presented with auditory, visual, and audiovisual signals and reported the location of the auditory or the visual signal. Combining psychophysics, multivariate functional MRI (fMRI) decoding, and models of maximum likelihood estimation (MLE), we characterized the computational operations underlying audiovisual integration at distinct cortical levels. We estimated observers’ behavioral weights by fitting psychometric functions to participants’ localization responses. Likewise, we estimated the neural weights by fitting neurometric functions to spatial locations decoded from regional fMRI activation patterns. Our results demonstrate that low-level auditory and visual areas encode predominantly the spatial location of the signal component of a region’s preferred auditory (or visual) modality. By contrast, intraparietal sulcus forms spatial representations by integrating auditory and visual signals weighted by their reliabilities. Critically, the neural and behavioral weights and the variance of the spatial representations depended not only on the sensory reliabilities as predicted by the MLE model but also on participants’ modality-specific attention and report (i.e., visual vs. auditory). These results suggest that audiovisual integration is not exclusively determined by bottom-up sensory reliabilities. Instead, modality-specific attention and report can flexibly modulate how intraparietal sulcus integrates sensory signals into spatial representations to guide behavioral responses (e.g., localization and orienting).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Dopamine D2 Receptors in Dopaminergic Neurons Modulate Performance in a Reversal Learning Task in Mice</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/5/1/ENEURO.0229-17.2018?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Neuroimaging studies in animal models and human subjects have each revealed that relatively low striatal dopamine D2-like receptor binding potential is associated with poor impulse control and with vulnerability for addiction-related behaviors. These studies cannot, however, disambiguate the roles for various pools of D2 receptors found in the striatum (e.g., those expressed on medium spiny striato-pallidal neurons vs on dopamine-releasing nerve terminals) in these behavioral outcomes. To clarify the role of the latter pool, namely, D2 autoreceptors, we studied mice carrying a conditional DRD2 gene, with or without Cre-recombinase expressed under the transcriptional control of the dopamine transporter gene locus (autoDrd2-KO, &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 19 and controls, &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 21). These mice were tested for locomotor response to cocaine, and spatial reversal learning was assessed in operant conditioning chambers. As predicted, compared to control mice, autoDrd2-KO animals demonstrated heightened sensitivity to the locomotor stimulating effect of cocaine (10 mg/kg, i.p.), confirming previous research using a similar genetic model. In the spatial reversal learning task, autoDrd2-KO mice were slower to reach a learning criterion and had difficulty sustaining a prolonged nose poke response, measurements conceptually related to impaired response inhibition. Rate of learning of the initial discrimination and latencies to collect rewards, to initiate trials and to produce a response were unaffected by genetic deletion of D2 autoreceptors, discarding possible motor and motivational factors. Together, these findings confirm the role of D2 autoreceptors in reversal learning and suggest a broader involvement in behavioral inhibition mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Sulcal Polymorphisms of the IFC and ACC Contribute to Inhibitory Control Variability in Children and Adults</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/5/1/ENEURO.0197-17.2018?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Inhibitory control (IC) is a core executive function that enables humans to resist habits, temptations, or distractions. IC efficiency in childhood is a strong predictor of academic and professional success later in life. Based on analysis of the sulcal pattern, a qualitative feature of cortex anatomy determined during fetal life and stable during development, we searched for evidence that interindividual differences in IC partly trace back to prenatal processes. Using anatomical magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), we analyzed the sulcal pattern of two key regions of the IC neural network, the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and the inferior frontal cortex (IFC), which limits the inferior frontal gyrus. We found that the sulcal pattern asymmetry of both the ACC and IFC contributes to IC (Stroop score) in children and adults: participants with asymmetrical ACC or IFC sulcal patterns had better IC efficiency than participants with symmetrical ACC or IFC sulcal patterns. Such additive effects of IFC and ACC sulcal patterns on IC efficiency suggest that distinct early neurodevelopmental mechanisms targeting different brain regions likely contribute to IC efficiency. This view shares some analogies with the &quot;common variant–small effect&quot; model in genetics, which states that frequent genetic polymorphisms have small effects but collectively account for a large portion of the variance. Similarly, each sulcal polymorphism has a small but additive effect: IFC and ACC sulcal patterns, respectively, explained 3% and 14% of the variance of the Stroop interference scores.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>
