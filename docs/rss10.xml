Although the basic cellular organization of the cortex is conserved across mammals, cells have diversified during evolution. An increasingly integrated taxonomy of cell types, especially with the advent of single-cell transcriptomic data, has revealed an unprecedented variety of human cortical cell subtypes. Here, we broadly review the cellular composition and diversity of the mammalian brain, and how progenitor pools generate cell subtypes during development. We then discuss human cortical cells that are distinct from rodent cells, as well as the challenges and advantages of using model systems to study human cell types in health and disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded>

Quantitative information on protein lifetimes can provide clues as to how these challenges are met. Advances in proteomics and mass spectrometry, which now enable comprehensive lifetime estimations for thousands of proteins, suggest that neuronal and synaptic protein lifetimes are unusually long, with half-lives typically ranging from days to weeks, even months and beyond for certain protein families. Half-lives &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt; are several-fold longer than those in cell culture, tend to cluster for proteins belonging to multimolecular complexes, are affected by developmental stage, and possibly by environmental conditions and activity levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Alzheimer's Disease Risk Factor Pyk2 Mediates Amyloid-{beta}-Induced Synaptic Dysfunction and Loss</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/4/758?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Dozens of genes have been implicated in late onset Alzheimer's disease (AD) risk, but none has a defined mechanism of action in neurons. Here, we show that the risk factor Pyk2 (PTK2B) localizes specifically to neurons in adult brain. Absence of Pyk2 has no major effect on synapse formation or the basal parameters of synaptic transmission in the hippocampal Schaffer collateral pathway. However, the induction of synaptic LTD is suppressed in Pyk2-null slices. In contrast, deletion of Pyk2 expression does not alter LTP under control conditions. Of relevance for AD pathophysiology, Pyk2&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt; slices are protected from amyloid-β-oligomer (Aβo)-induced suppression of LTP in hippocampal slices. Acutely, a Pyk2 kinase inhibitor also prevents Aβo-induced suppression of LTP in WT slices. Female and male transgenic AD model mice expressing APPswe/PSEN1E9 require Pyk2 for age-dependent loss of synaptic markers and for impairment of learning and memory. However, absence of Pyk2 does not alter Aβ accumulation or gliosis. Therefore, the Pyk2 risk gene is directly implicated in a neuronal Aβo signaling pathway impairing synaptic anatomy and function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Genetic variation at the Pyk2 (PTK2B) locus is a risk for late onset Alzheimer's disease (AD), but the pathophysiological role of Pyk2 is not clear. Here, we studied Pyk2 neuronal function in mice lacking expression with and without transgenes generating amyloid-β (Aβ) plaque pathology. Pyk2 is not required for basal synaptic transmission or LTP, but participates in LTD. Hippocampal slices lacking Pyk2 are protected from AD-related Aβ oligomer suppression of synaptic plasticity. In transgenic AD model mice, deletion of Pyk2 rescues synaptic loss and learning/memory deficits. Therefore, Pyk2 plays a central role in AD-related synaptic dysfunction mediating Aβ-triggered dysfunction.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Claudin-1-Dependent Destabilization of the Blood-Brain Barrier in Chronic Stroke</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/4/743?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Recent evidence suggests that blood–brain barrier (BBB) recovery and reestablishment of BBB impermeability after stroke is incomplete. This could influence stroke recovery, increase the risk of repeat stroke, and be a solid substrate for developing vascular dementia. Although accumulating evidence has defined morphological alterations and underlying mechanisms of tight junction (TJ) changes during BBB breakdown in acute stroke, very little is known about the type of alterations and mechanisms in BBB &quot;leakage&quot; found subacutely or chronically. The current study examined BBB structural alterations during the &quot;BBB leakage&quot; associated with the chronic phase of stroke in male mice and both genders of humans. We found significant upregulation of claudin-1 mRNA and protein, a nonspecific claudin for blood vessels, and downregulation in claudin-5 expression. Morphological and biochemical as well as fluorescence resonance energy transfer and fluorescence recovery after photobleaching analysis of postischemic brain endothelial cells and cells overexpressing claudin-1 indicated that newly synthesized claudin-1 was present on the cell membrane (~45%), was incorporated into the TJ complex with established interaction with zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1), and was building homophilic &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt;- and &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;-interactions. The appearance of claudin-1 in the TJ complex reduced claudin-5 strands (homophilic claudin-5 &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt;- and &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;-interactions) and claudin-5/ZO-1 interaction affecting claudin-5 incorporation into the TJ complex. Moreover, claudin-1 induction was associated with an endothelial proinflammatory phenotype. Targeting claudin-1 with a specific C1C2 peptide improved brain endothelial barrier permeability and functional recovery in chronic stroke condition. This study highlights a potential &quot;defect&quot; in postischemic barrier formation that may underlie prolonged vessel leakiness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Although rarely expressed at the normal blood–brain barrier (BBB), claudin-1 is expressed in pathological conditions. Analyzing poststroke human and mouse blood microvessels we have identified that claudin-1 is highly expressed in leaky brain microvessels. Our results reveal that claudin-1 is incorporated in BBB tight junction complex, impeding BBB recovery and causing BBB leakiness during poststroke recovery. Targeting claudin-1 with a claudin-1 peptide improves brain endothelial barrier permeability and consequently functional neurological recovery after stroke.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Conditional Knock-out of mGluR5 from Astrocytes during Epilepsy Development Impairs High-Frequency Glutamate Uptake</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/4/727?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Astrocyte expression of metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5) is consistently observed in resected tissue from patients with epilepsy and is equally prevalent in animal models of epilepsy. However, little is known about the functional signaling properties or downstream consequences of astrocyte mGluR5 activation during epilepsy development. In the rodent brain, astrocyte mGluR5 expression is developmentally regulated and confined in expression/function to the first weeks of life, with similar observations made in human control tissue. Herein, we demonstrate that mGluR5 expression and function dramatically increase in a mouse model of temporal lobe epilepsy. Interestingly, in both male and female mice, mGluR5 function persists in the astrocyte throughout the process of epileptogenesis following status epilepticus. However, mGluR5 expression and function are transient in animals that do not develop epilepsy over an equivalent time period, suggesting that patterns of mGluR5 expression may signify continuing epilepsy development or its resolution. We demonstrate that, during epileptogenesis, astrocytes reacquire mGluR5-dependent calcium transients following agonist application or synaptic glutamate release, a feature of astrocyte-neuron communication absent since early development. Finally, we find that the selective and conditional knock-out of mGluR5 signaling from astrocytes during epilepsy development slows the rate of glutamate clearance through astrocyte glutamate transporters under high-frequency stimulation conditions, a feature that suggests astrocyte mGluR5 expression during epileptogenesis may recapitulate earlier developmental roles in regulating glutamate transporter function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; In development, astrocyte mGluR5 signaling plays a critical role in regulating structural and functional interactions between astrocytes and neurons at the tripartite synapse. Notably, mGluR5 signaling is a positive regulator of astrocyte glutamate transporter expression and function, an essential component of excitatory signaling regulation in hippocampus. After early development, astrocyte mGluR5 expression is downregulated, but reemerges in animal models of temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) development and patient epilepsy samples. We explored the hypothesis that astrocyte mGluR5 reemergence recapitulates earlier developmental roles during TLE acquisition. Our work demonstrates that astrocytes with mGluR5 signaling during TLE development perform faster glutamate uptake in hippocampus, revealing a previously unexplored role for astrocyte mGluR5 signaling in hypersynchronous pathology.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Hard Decisions Shape the Neural Coding of Preferences</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/4/718?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Hard decisions between equally valued alternatives can result in preference changes, meaning that subsequent valuations for chosen items increase and decrease for rejected items. Previous research suggests that this phenomenon is a consequence of cognitive dissonance reduction after the decision, induced by the mismatch between initial preferences and decision outcomes. In contrast, this functional magnetic resonance imaging and eye-tracking study with male and female human participants found that preferences are already updated online during the process of decision-making. Preference changes were predicted from activity in left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and precuneus while making hard decisions. Fixation durations during this phase predicted both choice outcomes and subsequent preference changes. These preference adjustments became behaviorally relevant only for choices that were remembered and were in turn associated with hippocampus activity. Our results suggest that preferences evolve dynamically as decisions arise, potentially as a mechanism to prevent stalemate situations in underdetermined decision scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Most theories of decision-making assume that we always choose the best option available, based on a set of stable preferences. However, what happens for hard decisions when the available options are preferred equally? We show that in such stalemate situations, decision-makers adjust their preferences dynamically during the process of decision-making, and these preference adjustments are predicted by a left prefrontal-parietal network. We also show that eye movements during decision-making are predictive of the magnitude of the upcoming value change. Our results suggest that preferences are dynamic, adjusted every time a hard decision is made, prompting a re-evaluation of existing frameworks of decision-making.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: A Posterior-Anterior Distinction between Scene Perception and Scene Construction in Human Medial Parietal Cortex</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/4/705?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Human retrosplenial complex (RSC), located in medial parietal cortex, has been implicated in numerous cognitive functions, including scene perception, spatial navigation, and autobiographical memory retrieval. Recently, a posterior–anterior distinction within RSC was proposed, such that posterior aspects process scene-related visual information (constituting a medial place area [MPA]), whereas anterior aspects process information that is vividly retrieved from memory, thereby supporting remembering and potentially navigation. Here, we tested this proposed distinction in a single group of participants (both male and female) using fMRI with both perceptual and mnemonic tasks. After completing a resting-state scan, participants performed a task that required constructing scenes from memory and completed a scene selectivity localizer task. We tested directly perceptual and mnemonic responses in MPA and an anterior, connectivity-defined region (CON), which showed strong functional connectivity with anterior parahippocampal place area. A double dissociation was observed, such that CON was more strongly activated during scene construction than was MPA, whereas MPA was more perceptually responsive than CON. Further, peak responses from the scene construction task were anterior to perceptual peaks in all but 1 participant and hemisphere. Finally, through analyses of the posterior–anterior response profiles, we identify the fundus of the parieto-occipital sulcus as a potential location for the crossover from perceptual to mnemonic representations and highlight a potential left-hemisphere advantage for mnemonic representations. Collectively, our results support a distinction between posterior and anterior aspects of the RSC, suggesting that more specific functional-anatomic terms should be used in its place in future work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The retrosplenial complex (RSC) has been implicated in vision, spatial cognition, and memory. We previously speculated on a potential posterior–anterior distinction within RSC for scene perception and memory-based scene construction/navigation. Here, we tested this distinction through a combination of resting-state, perceptual, and mnemonic task data. Consistent with our predictions, we demonstrate that perceptual responses peak consistently posterior of those elicited by memory-based scene construction within the broader RSC. Further, we highlight (1) the fundus of the parieto-occipital sulcus as a landmark for the transition between these representations, (2) the anterior bank of parieto-occipital sulcus as the point of maximal separation between these representations, and (3) identify a potential hemispheric asymmetry in mnemonic representations. These data support functional dissociations within RSC.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: A Sensorimotor Pathway via Higher-Order Thalamus</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/4/692?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;We now know that sensory processing in cortex occurs not only via direct communication between primary to secondary areas, but also via their parallel cortico-thalamo-cortical (i.e., &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;-thalamic) pathways. Both corticocortical and &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;-thalamic pathways mainly signal through glutamatergic class 1 (driver) synapses, which have robust and efficient synaptic dynamics suited for the transfer of information such as receptive field properties, suggesting the importance of class 1 synapses in feedforward, hierarchical processing. However, such a parallel arrangement has only been identified in sensory cortical areas: visual, somatosensory, and auditory. To test the generality of &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;-thalamic pathways, we sought to establish its presence beyond purely sensory cortices to determine whether there is a &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;-thalamic pathway parallel to the established primary somatosensory (S1) to primary motor (M1) pathway. We used &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;-synaptic viral tracing, optogenetics in slice preparations, and bouton size analysis in the mouse (both sexes) to document that a circuit exists from layer 5 of S1 through the posterior medial nucleus of the thalamus to M1 with glutamatergic class 1 properties. This represents a hitherto unknown, robust sensorimotor linkage and suggests that the arrangement of parallel direct and &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;-thalamic corticocortical circuits may be present as a general feature of cortical functioning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; During sensory processing, feedforward pathways carry information such as receptive field properties via glutamatergic class 1 synapses, which have robust and efficient synaptic dynamics. As expected, class 1 synapses subserve the feedforward projection from primary to secondary sensory cortex, but also a route through specific higher-order thalamic nuclei, creating a parallel feedforward &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;-thalamic pathway. We now extend the concept of cortical areas being connected via parallel, direct, and &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;-thalamic circuits from purely sensory cortices to a sensorimotor cortical circuit (i.e., primary sensory cortex to primary motor cortex). This suggests a generalized arrangement for corticocortical communication.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Drebrin-like (Dbnl) Controls Neuronal Migration via Regulating N-Cadherin Expression in the Developing Cerebral Cortex</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/4/678?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The actin cytoskeleton is crucial for neuronal migration in the mammalian developing cerebral cortex. The adaptor protein Drebrin-like (Dbnl) plays important roles in reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton, dendrite formation, and endocytosis by interacting with F-actin, cobl, and dynamin. Although Dbnl is known to be expressed in the brain, the functions of this molecule during brain development are largely unknown. In this study, to examine the roles of Dbnl in the developing cerebral cortex, we conducted experiments using mice of both sexes with knockdown of Dbnl, effected by &lt;i&gt;in utero&lt;/i&gt; electroporation, in the migrating neurons of the embryonic cortex. Time-lapse imaging of the Dbnl-knockdown neurons revealed that the presence of Dbnl is a prerequisite for appropriate formation of processes in the multipolar neurons in the multipolar cell accumulation zone or the deep part of the subventricular zone, and for neuronal polarization and entry into the cortical plate. We found that Dbnl knockdown decreased the amount of N-cadherin protein expressed on the plasma membrane of the cortical neurons. The defect in neuronal migration caused by Dbnl knockdown was rescued by moderate overexpression of N-cadherin and αN-catenin or by transfection of the phospho-mimic form (Y337E, Y347E), but not the phospho-resistant form (Y337F, Y347F), of Dbnl. These results suggest that Dbnl controls neuronal migration, neuronal multipolar morphology, and cell polarity in the developing cerebral cortex via regulating N-cadherin expression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Disruption of neuronal migration can cause neuronal disorders, such as lissencephaly and subcortical band heterotopia. During cerebral cortical development, the actin cytoskeleton plays a key role in neuronal migration; however, the mechanisms of regulation of neuronal migration by the actin cytoskeleton still remain unclear. Herein, we report that the novel protein Dbnl, an actin-binding protein, controls multiple events during neuronal migration in the developing mouse cerebral cortex. We also showed that this regulation is mediated by phosphorylation of Dbnl at tyrosine residues 337 and 347 and αN-catenin/N-cadherin, suggesting that the Dbnl-αN-catenin/N-cadherin pathway is important for neuronal migration in the developing cortex.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Local Acceleration of Neurofilament Transport at Nodes of Ranvier</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/4/663?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Myelinated axons are constricted at nodes of Ranvier. These constrictions are important physiologically because they increase the speed of saltatory nerve conduction, but they also represent potential bottlenecks for the movement of axonally transported cargoes. One type of cargo are neurofilaments, which are abundant space-filling cytoskeletal polymers that function to increase axon caliber. Neurofilaments move bidirectionally along axons, alternating between rapid movements and prolonged pauses. Strikingly, axon constriction at nodes is accompanied by a reduction in neurofilament number that can be as much as 10-fold in the largest axons. To investigate how neurofilaments navigate these constrictions, we developed a transgenic mouse strain that expresses a photoactivatable fluorescent neurofilament protein in neurons. We used the pulse-escape fluorescence photoactivation technique to analyze neurofilament transport in mature myelinated axons of tibial nerves from male and female mice of this strain &lt;i&gt;ex vivo&lt;/i&gt;. Fluorescent neurofilaments departed the activated region more rapidly in nodes than in flanking internodes, indicating that neurofilament transport is faster in nodes. By computational modeling, we showed that this nodal acceleration can be explained largely by a local increase in the duty cycle of neurofilament transport (i.e., the proportion of the time that the neurofilaments spend moving). We propose that this transient acceleration functions to maintain a constant neurofilament flux across nodal constrictions, much as the current increases where a river narrows its banks. In this way, neurofilaments are prevented from piling up in the flanking internodes, ensuring a stable neurofilament distribution and uniform axonal morphology across these physiologically important axonal domains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Myelinated axons are constricted at nodes of Ranvier, resulting in a marked local decrease in neurofilament number. These constrictions are important physiologically because they increase the efficiency of saltatory nerve conduction, but they also represent potential bottlenecks for the axonal transport of neurofilaments, which move along axons in a rapid intermittent manner. Imaging of neurofilament transport in mature myelinated axons &lt;i&gt;ex vivo&lt;/i&gt; reveals that neurofilament polymers navigate these nodal axonal constrictions by accelerating transiently, much as the current increases where a river narrows its banks. This local acceleration is necessary to ensure a stable axonal morphology across nodal constrictions, which may explain the vulnerability of nodes of Ranvier to neurofilament accumulations in animal models of neurotoxic neuropathies and neurodegenerative diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Localizing Proton-Mediated Inhibitory Feedback at the Retinal Horizontal Cell-Cone Synapse with Genetically-Encoded pH Probes</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/4/651?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Lateral inhibition in the vertebrate retina depends on a negative feedback synapse between horizontal cells (HCs) and rod and cone photoreceptors. A change in pH is thought to be the signal for negative feedback, but its spatial profile in the synaptic cleft is unknown. Here we use three different membrane proteins, each fused to the same genetically-encoded pH-sensitive Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) (pHluorin), to probe synaptic pH in retina from transgenic zebrafish (&lt;i&gt;Danio rerio&lt;/i&gt;) of either sex. We used the cone transducin promoter to express SynaptopHluorin (pHluorin on vesicle-associated membrane protein (VAMP2)) or CalipHluorin (pHluorin on an L-type Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; channel) and the HC-specific connexin-55.5 promoter to express AMPApHluorin (pHluorin on an AMPA receptor). Stimulus light led to increased fluorescence of all three probes, consistent with alkalinization of the synaptic cleft. The receptive field size, sensitivity to surround illumination, and response to activation of an alien receptor expressed exclusively in HCs, are consistent with lateral inhibition as the trigger for alkalinization. However, SynaptopHluorin and AMPApHluorin, which are displaced farther from cone synaptic ribbons than CalipHluorin, reported a smaller pH change. Hence, unlike feedforward glutamatergic transmission, which spills over to allow cross talk between terminals in the cone network, the pH change underlying HC feedback is compartmentalized to individual synaptic invaginations within a cone terminal, consistent with private line communication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Lateral inhibition (LI) is a fundamental feature of information processing in sensory systems, enhancing contrast sensitivity and enabling edge discrimination. Horizontal cells (HCs) are the first cellular substrate of LI in the vertebrate retina, but the synaptic mechanisms underlying LI are not completely understood, despite decades of study. This paper makes a significant contribution to our understanding of LI, by showing that each HC–cone synapse is a &quot;private-line&quot; that operates independently from other HC–cone connections. Using transgenic zebrafish expressing pHluorin, a pH-sensitive GFP variant spliced onto three different protein platforms expressed either in cones or HCs we show that the feedback pH signal is constrained to individual cone terminals, and more stringently, to individual synaptic contact sites within each terminal.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Extrasynaptic NMDA Receptors on Rod Pathway Amacrine Cells: Molecular Composition, Activation, and Signaling</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/4/627?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In the rod pathway of the mammalian retina, axon terminals of glutamatergic rod bipolar cells are presynaptic to AII and A17 amacrine cells in the inner plexiform layer. Recent evidence suggests that both amacrines express NMDA receptors, raising questions concerning molecular composition, localization, activation, and function of these receptors. Using dual patch-clamp recording from synaptically connected rod bipolar and AII or A17 amacrine cells in retinal slices from female rats, we found no evidence that NMDA receptors contribute to postsynaptic currents evoked in either amacrine. Instead, NMDA receptors on both amacrine cells were activated by ambient glutamate, and blocking glutamate uptake increased their level of activation. NMDA receptor activation also increased the frequency of GABAergic postsynaptic currents in rod bipolar cells, suggesting that NMDA receptors can drive release of GABA from A17 amacrines. A striking dichotomy was revealed by pharmacological and immunolabeling experiments, which found GluN2B-containing NMDA receptors on AII amacrines and GluN2A-containing NMDA receptors on A17 amacrines. Immunolabeling also revealed a clustered organization of NMDA receptors on both amacrines and a close spatial association between GluN2B subunits and connexin 36 on AII amacrines, suggesting that NMDA receptor modulation of gap junction coupling between these cells involves the GluN2B subunit. Using multiphoton Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; imaging, we verified that activation of NMDA receptors evoked an increase of intracellular Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; in dendrites of both amacrines. Our results suggest that AII and A17 amacrines express clustered, extrasynaptic NMDA receptors, with different and complementary subunits that are likely to contribute differentially to signal processing and plasticity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Glutamate is the most important excitatory neurotransmitter in the CNS, but not all glutamate receptors transmit fast excitatory signals at synapses. NMDA-type glutamate receptors act as voltage- and ligand-gated ion channels, with functional properties determined by their specific subunit composition. These receptors can be found at both synaptic and extrasynaptic sites on neurons, but the role of extrasynaptic NMDA receptors is unclear. Here, we demonstrate that retinal AII and A17 amacrine cells, postsynaptic partners at rod bipolar dyad synapses, express extrasynaptic (but not synaptic) NMDA receptors, with different and complementary GluN2 subunits. The localization of GluN2A-containing receptors to A17s and GluN2B-containing receptors to AIIs suggests a mechanism for differential modulation of excitability and signaling in this retinal microcircuit.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Enhancement of BDNF Expression and Memory by HDAC Inhibition Requires BET Bromodomain Reader Proteins</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/4/612?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors may have therapeutic utility in multiple neurological and psychiatric disorders, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we identify BRD4, a BET bromodomain reader of acetyl-lysine histones, as an essential component involved in potentiated expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and memory following HDAC inhibition. In &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; studies, we reveal that pharmacological inhibition of BRD4 reversed the increase in &lt;i&gt;BDNF&lt;/i&gt; mRNA induced by the class I/IIb HDAC inhibitor suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA). Knock-down of HDAC2 and HDAC3, but not other HDACs, increased &lt;i&gt;BDNF&lt;/i&gt; mRNA expression, whereas knock-down of BRD4 blocked these effects. Using dCas9-BRD4, locus-specific targeting of BRD4 to the &lt;i&gt;BDNF&lt;/i&gt; promoter increased &lt;i&gt;BDNF&lt;/i&gt; mRNA. In additional studies, RGFP966, a pharmacological inhibitor of HDAC3, elevated &lt;i&gt;BDNF&lt;/i&gt; expression and BRD4 binding to the BDNF promoter, effects that were abrogated by JQ1 (an inhibitor of BRD4). Examining known epigenetic targets of BRD4 and HDAC3, we show that H4K5ac and H4K8ac modifications and H4K5ac enrichment at the &lt;i&gt;BDNF&lt;/i&gt; promoter were elevated following RGFP966 treatment. In electrophysiological studies, JQ1 reversed RGFP966-induced enhancement of LTP in hippocampal slice preparations. Last, in behavioral studies, RGFP966 increased subthreshold novel object recognition memory and cocaine place preference in male C57BL/6 mice, effects that were reversed by cotreatment with JQ1. Together, these data reveal that BRD4 plays a key role in HDAC3 inhibitor-induced potentiation of &lt;i&gt;BDNF&lt;/i&gt; expression, neuroplasticity, and memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Some histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors are known to have neuroprotective and cognition-enhancing properties, but the underlying mechanisms have yet to be fully elucidated. In the current study, we reveal that BRD4, an epigenetic reader of histone acetylation marks, is necessary for enhancing brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) expression and improved memory following HDAC inhibition. Therefore, by identifying novel epigenetic regulators of BDNF expression, these data may lead to new therapeutic targets for the treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Modulator-Gated, SUMOylation-Mediated, Activity-Dependent Regulation of Ionic Current Densities Contributes to Short-Term Activity Homeostasis</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/4/596?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Neurons operate within defined activity limits, and feedback control mechanisms dynamically tune ionic currents to maintain this optimal range. This study describes a novel, rapid feedback mechanism that uses SUMOylation to continuously adjust ionic current densities according to changes in activity. Small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) is a peptide that can be post-translationally conjugated to ion channels to influence their surface expression and biophysical properties. Neuronal activity can regulate the extent of protein SUMOylation. This study on the single, unambiguously identifiable lateral pyloric neuron (LP), a component of the pyloric network in the stomatogastric nervous system of male and female spiny lobsters (&lt;i&gt;Panulirus interruptus&lt;/i&gt;), focused on dynamic SUMOylation in the context of activity homeostasis. There were four major findings: First, neuronal activity adjusted the balance between SUMO conjugation and deconjugation to continuously and bidirectionally fine-tune the densities of two opposing conductances: the hyperpolarization activated current (I&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;) and the transient potassium current (I&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;). Second, tonic 5 nm dopamine (DA) gated activity-dependent SUMOylation to permit and prevent activity-dependent regulation of I&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt; and I&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;, respectively. Third, DA-gated, activity-dependent SUMOylation contributed to a feedback mechanism that restored the timing and duration of LP activity during prolonged modulation by 5 μm DA, which initially altered these and other activity features. Fourth, DA modulatory and metamoduatory (gating) effects were tailored to simultaneously alter and stabilize neuronal output. Our findings suggest that modulatory tone may select a subset of rapid activity-dependent mechanisms from a larger menu to achieve homeostasis under varying conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Post-translational SUMOylation of ion channel subunits controls their interactions. When subunit SUMOylation is dysregulated, conductance densities mediated by the channels are distorted, leading to nervous system disorders, such as seizures and chronic pain. Regulation of ion channel SUMOylation is poorly understood. This study demonstrated that neuronal activity can regulate SUMOylation to reconfigure ionic current densities over minutes, and this regulation was gated by tonic nanomolar dopamine. Dynamic SUMOylation was necessary to maintain specific aspects of neuronal output while the neuron was being modulated by high (5 μm) concentrations of dopamine, suggesting that the gating function may ensure neuronal homeostasis during extrinsic modulation of a circuit.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Coincidence Detection within the Excitable Rat Olfactory Bulb Granule Cell Spines</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/4/584?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In the mammalian olfactory bulb, the inhibitory axonless granule cells (GCs) feature reciprocal synapses that interconnect them with the principal neurons of the bulb, mitral, and tufted cells. These synapses are located within large excitable spines that can generate local action potentials (APs) upon synaptic input (&quot;spine spike&quot;). Moreover, GCs can fire global APs that propagate throughout the dendrite. Strikingly, local postsynaptic Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; entry summates mostly linearly with Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; entry due to coincident global APs generated by glomerular stimulation, although some underlying conductances should be inactivated. We investigated this phenomenon by constructing a compartmental GC model to simulate the pairing of local and global signals as a function of their temporal separation t. These simulations yield strongly sublinear summation of spine Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; entry for the case of perfect coincidence t = 0 ms. Summation efficiency (SE) sharply rises for both positive and negative t. The SE reduction for coincident signals depends on the presence of voltage-gated Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channels in the spine head, while NMDARs are not essential. We experimentally validated the simulated SE in slices of juvenile rat brain (both sexes) by pairing two-photon uncaging of glutamate at spines and APs evoked by somatic current injection at various intervals t while imaging spine Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; signals. Finally, the latencies of synaptically evoked global APs and EPSPs were found to correspond to t  10 ms, explaining the observed approximately linear summation of synaptic local and global signals. Our results provide additional evidence for the existence of the GC spine spike.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Here we investigate the interaction of local synaptic inputs and global activation of a neuron by a backpropagating action potential within a dendritic spine with respect to local Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; signaling. Our system of interest, the reciprocal spine of the olfactory bulb granule cell, is known to feature a special processing mode, namely, a synaptically triggered action potential that is restricted to the spine head. Therefore, coincidence detection of local and global signals follows different rules than in more conventional synapses. We unravel these rules using both simulations and experiments and find that signals coincident within ±7 ms around 0 ms result in sublinear summation of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; entry because of synaptic activation of voltage-gated Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channels within the spine.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

software, developed under the auspices of the HBP. The performance portability
is by virtue of back-end specific optimizations for x86 multicore, Intel KNL,
and NVIDIA GPUs. When coupled with low memory overheads, these optimizations
make Arbor an order of magnitude faster than the most widely-used comparable

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1901.07298</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Many time-series data including text, movies, and biological signals can be
represented as sequences of correlated binary patterns. These patterns may be
described by weighted combinations of a few dominant structures that underpin
specific interactions among the binary elements. To extract the dominant
correlation structures and their contributions to generating data in a
time-dependent manner, we model the dynamics of binary patterns using the
state-space model of an Ising-type network that is composed of multiple
undirected graphs. We provide a sequential Bayes algorithm to estimate the
dynamics of weights on the graphs while gaining the graph structures online.
This model can uncover overlapping graphs underlying the data better than a
traditional orthogonal decomposition method, and outperforms an original
time-dependent full Ising model. We assess the performance of the method by
simulated data, and demonstrate that spontaneous activity of cultured
hippocampal neurons is represented by dynamics of multiple graphs.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Children with congenital heart disease (CHD) remain at risk for
neurodevelopmental impairment despite improved peri- and intraoperative care.
Our prospective cohort study aimed to determine the relationship between
perioperative brain volumes and neurodevelopmental outcome in neonates with
severe CHD. Pre- and postoperative cerebral MRI was acquired in term born
neonates with CHD undergoing neonatal cardiopulmonary bypass surgery. Brain
volumes were measured using an atlas prior based automated method. One-year
outcome was assessed with the Bayley-III. CHD infants (n=77) had lower pre- and
postoper-ative total and regional brain volumes compared to controls (n=44, all
p&amp;lt;0.01). CHD infants had poorer cognitive and motor outcome (p&amp;lt;=0.0001) and a
trend towards lower language composite score compared to controls (p=0.06). The
total and selected regional postoperative brain volumes predicted cognitive and
language outcome (all p&amp;lt;0.04). This association was independent of length of
intensive care unit stay for total, cortical, temporal, frontal and cerebellar
volumes. In CHD neonates undergoing cardiopulmonary bypass surgery, pre- and
postoperative brain volumes are reduced, and postoperative brain volumes
predict cognitive and language outcome at one year. Reduced cerebral volumes in
CHD patients could serve as a biomarker for im-paired outcome.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1901.06552</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Working memory (WM) allows information to be stored and manipulated over
short time scales. Performance on WM tasks is thought to be supported by the
frontoparietal system (FPS), the default mode system (DMS), and interactions
between them. Yet little is known about how these systems and their
interactions relate to individual differences in WM performance. We address
this gap in knowledge using functional MRI data acquired during the performance
of a 2-back WM task, as well as diffusion tensor imaging data collected in the
same individuals. We show that the strength of functional interactions between
the FPS and DMS during task engagement is inversely correlated with WM
performance, and that this strength is modulated by the activation of FPS
regions but not DMS regions. Next, we use a clustering algorithm to identify
two distinct subnetworks of the FPS, and find that these subnetworks display
distinguishable patterns of gene expression. Activity in one subnetwork is
positively associated with the strength of FPS-DMS functional interactions,
while activity in the second subnetwork is negatively associated. Further, the
pattern of structural linkages of these subnetworks explains their differential
capacity to influence the strength of FPS-DMS functional interactions. To
determine whether these observations could provide a mechanistic account of
large-scale neural underpinnings of WM, we build a computational model of the
system composed of coupled oscillators. Modulating the amplitude of the
subnetworks in the model causes the expected change in the strength of FPS-DMS
functional interactions, thereby offering support for a mechanism in which
subnetwork activity tunes functional interactions. Broadly, our study presents
a holistic account of how regional activity, functional interactions, and
structural linkages together support individual differences in WM in humans.

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/43888</link>
	<content:encoded>Myelin serves as an axonal insulator that facilitates rapid nerve conduction along axons. By transmission electron microscopy, a healthy myelin sheath comprises compacted membrane layers spiraling around the cross-sectioned axon. Previously we identified the assembly of septin filaments in the innermost non-compacted myelin layer as one of the latest steps of myelin maturation in the central nervous system (CNS) (Patzig et al., 2016). Here we show that loss of the cytoskeletal adaptor protein anillin (ANLN) from oligodendrocytes disrupts myelin septin assembly, thereby causing the emergence of pathological myelin outfoldings. Since myelin outfoldings are a poorly understood hallmark of myelin disease and brain aging we assessed axon/myelin-units in &lt;i&gt;Anln&lt;/i&gt;-mutant mice by focused ion beam-scanning electron microscopy (FIB-SEM); myelin outfoldings were three-dimensionally reconstructed as large sheets of multiple compact membrane layers. We suggest that anillin-dependent assembly of septin filaments scaffolds mature myelin sheaths, facilitating rapid nerve conduction in the healthy CNS.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/41800</link>
	<content:encoded>Nuclear entry of HIV-1 replication complexes through intact nuclear pore complexes is critical for successful infection. The host protein cleavage-and-polyadenylation-specificity-factor-6 (CPSF6) has been implicated in different stages of early HIV-1 replication. Applying quantitative microscopy of HIV-1 reverse-transcription and pre-integration-complexes (RTC/PIC), we show that CPSF6 is strongly recruited to nuclear replication complexes but absent from cytoplasmic RTC/PIC in primary human macrophages. Depletion of CPSF6 or lack of CPSF6 binding led to accumulation of HIV-1 subviral complexes at the nuclear envelope of macrophages and reduced infectivity. Two-color stimulated-emission-depletion microscopy indicated that under these circumstances HIV-1 complexes are retained inside the nuclear pore and undergo CA-multimer dependent CPSF6 clustering adjacent to the nuclear basket. We propose that nuclear entry of HIV-1 subviral complexes in macrophages is mediated by consecutive binding of Nup153 and CPSF6 to the hexameric CA lattice.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/41139</link>
	<content:encoded>GTPase signal transduction pathways control cellular decision making by integrating multiple cellular events into a single signal. The Mitotic Exit Network (MEN), a Ras-like GTPase signaling pathway, integrates spatial and temporal cues to ensure that cytokinesis only occurs after the genome has partitioned between mother and daughter cells during anaphase. Here we show that signal integration does not occur at a single step of the pathway. Rather, sequential components of the pathway are controlled in series by different signals. The spatial signal, nuclear position, regulates the MEN GTPase Tem1. The temporal signal, commencement of anaphase, is mediated by mitotic cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) phosphorylation of the GTPase's downstream kinases. We propose that integrating multiple signals through sequential steps in the GTPase pathway represents a generalizable principle in GTPase signaling and explains why intracellular signal transmission is a multi-step process. Serial signal integration rather than signal amplification makes multi-step signal transduction necessary.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/40364</link>
	<content:encoded>The PLZF transcription factor is essential for osteogenic differentiation of hMSCs; however, its regulation and molecular function during this process is not fully understood. Here, we revealed that the &lt;i&gt;ZBTB16&lt;/i&gt; locus encoding PLZF, is repressed by Polycomb (PcG) and H3K27me3 in naive hMSCs. At the pre-osteoblast stage of differentiation, the locus lost PcG binding and H3K27me3, gained JMJD3 recruitment, and H3K27ac resulting in high expression of PLZF. Subsequently, PLZF was recruited to osteogenic enhancers, influencing H3K27 acetylation and expression of nearby genes important for osteogenic function. Furthermore, we identified a latent enhancer within the &lt;i&gt;ZBTB16/PLZF&lt;/i&gt; locus itself that became active, gained PLZF, p300 and Mediator binding and looped to the promoter of the nicotinamide N-methyltransferase (&lt;i&gt;NNMT&lt;/i&gt;) gene. The increased expression of NNMT correlated with a decline in SAM levels, which is dependent on PLZF and is required for osteogenic differentiation.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/40212</link>
	<content:encoded>The scaffold protein PAR3 and the kinase PAR1 are essential proteins that control cell polarity. Their precise opposite localisations define plasma membrane domains with specific functions. PAR3 and PAR1 are mutually inhibited by direct or indirect phosphorylations, but their fates once phosphorylated are poorly known. Through precise spatiotemporal quantification of PAR3 localisation in the &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; oocyte, we identify several mechanisms responsible for its anterior cortex accumulation and its posterior exclusion. We show that PAR3 posterior plasma membrane exclusion depends on PAR1 and an endocytic mechanisms relying on RAB5 and PI(4,5)P2. In a second phase, microtubules and the dynein motor, in connection with vesicular trafficking involving RAB11 and IKK-related kinase, IKKε, are required for PAR3 transport towards the anterior cortex. Altogether our results point to a connection between membrane trafficking and dynein-mediated transport to sustain PAR3 asymmetry.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Daylight vision starts with signals in three classes of cone photoreceptors sensitive to short (S), middle (M), and long (L) wavelengths. Psychophysical studies show that perceptual sensitivity to rapidly varying inputs differs for signals originating in S cones versus L and M cones; notably, S-cone signals appear perceptually delayed relative to L- and M-cone signals. These differences could originate in the cones themselves or in the post-cone circuitry. To determine if the cones could contribute to these and related perceptual phenomena, we compared the light responses of primate S, M, and L cones. We found that S cones generate slower light responses than L and M cones, show much smaller changes in response kinetics as background-light levels increase, and are noisier than L and M cones. It will be important to incorporate these differences into descriptions of how cone signaling shapes human visual perception.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Optimal sparse olfactory representations persist in a plastic network</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/528125v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>The neural representation of a stimulus is repeatedly transformed as it moves from the sensory periphery to deeper layers of the nervous system. Sparsening transformations are thought to increase the separation between similar representations, encode stimuli with great specificity, maximize storage capacity as associative memories, and provide an energy efficient instantiation of information in neural circuits. In the insect olfactory system, odors are initially represented in the periphery as a combinatorial code with simple temporal dynamics. Subsequently, in the antennal lobe this representation is transformed into a dense spatiotemporal activity pattern. Next, in the mushroom body Kenyon cells (KCs), the representation is dramatically sparsened. Then in mushroom body output neurons (MBONs), the representation takes on a new dense spatiotemporal format. Here, we develop a computational model to simulate this chain of olfactory processing from the receptor neurons to MBONs. We demonstrate that representations of similar odorants are maximally separated, measured by the distance between the corresponding MBON activity vectors, when KC responses are sparse and that the sparseness is maintained across variations in odor concentration by adjusting the feedback inhibition KCs receive. Different odor concentrations require different strength and timing of feedback inhibition for optimal processing. Further, in vivo, the KC-MBON synapse is highly plastic, and changes in synaptic strength after learning can change the balance of excitation and inhibition and may lead to a change in the distance between MBON activity vectors of two odorants for the same level of KC population sparseness. Thus, what is an optimal degree of sparseness before odor learning, could be rendered sub-optimal post learning. Here, we show, however, that synaptic weight changes caused by spike timing dependent plasticity increase the distance between the odor representations from the perspective of MBONs and do not lead to a concomitant change in the optimal sparseness.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/527945v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>The quantitative study of visual behaviors using virtual flight arenas is complicated by the fact that an effective experimental setup needs to combine a rather complex set of custom-built mechanical, electronic, and software components. Assembling such an apparatus amounts to a major challenge when working in an environment without the support of a machine shop. Here we present detailed instructions for the assembly of virtual flight arenas optimized for Drosophila skylight navigation, which can easily be modified towards other uses. This system consists entirely of off-the-shelf parts and 3D-printed components, combining a modular flight arena designed to reduce visual artifacts, swappable high-power LED light sources, polarization filters on a computer-controlled rotating filter wheel, all placed within a temperature and humidity controlled environment. Using this new assay, we show that individual flies choose arbitrary headings when flying under a uniform field of linear polarization. Furthermore, flies adjust their heading to both sudden and continuous changes in filter orientation and can keep their chosen heading for several minutes. Finally, flies show the tendency to maintain headings even after interruption with an unpolarized stimulus. Taken together, these findings demonstrate the usefulness of these assays for the study of skylight navigation in flies.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Alpha Neurofeedback Training with a portable Low-Priced and Commercially Available EEG Device Leads to Faster Alpha Enhancement.A Single-blind, Sham-feedback Controlled Study &amp; Methodological Review</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/527598v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Introduction Findings of recent studies have proposed that it is possible to enhance cognitive capacities of healthy individuals by means of individual upper alpha (around 10 to 13.5 Hz) neurofeedback training. Although these results are promising, most of this research was conducted based on high-priced EEG systems developed for clinical and research purposes only. This study addresses the question whether such effects can also be shown with an easy to use and comparably low priced Emotiv Epoc EEG headset available for the average consumer. In addition, critical voices were raised regarding the control group designs of studies addressing the link between neurofeedback training and cognitive performance. Based on an extensive literature review revealing considerable methodological issues in an important part of the existing research, the present study addressed the question whether individual upper alpha neurofeedback has a positive effect on alpha amplitudes (i.e. increases alpha amplitudes) and short-term memory performance focussing on a methodologically sound, single-blinded, sham controlled design. Method Participants (N = 33) took part in four test sessions over four consecutive days of either neurofeedback training or sham feedback (control group). In the experimental group, five three-minute periods of visual neurofeedback training were administered each day whereas in the control group, the same amount of sham feedback was presented. Performance on eight digit-span tests as well as participants' affective states were assessed before and after each of the daily training sessions. Results Participants in the neurofeedback training (NFT) group showed faster and greater alpha enhancement compared to the control group. Contrary to the authors' expectations, alpha enhancement was also observed in the control group. Surprisingly, exploratory analyses showed a significant correlation between the initial alpha level and the alpha improvement during the course of the study. This finding suggests that participants with high initial alpha levels profit more from alpha NFT interventions. digit-span performance increased in both groups over the course of time. However, the increase in individual upper relative alpha did not explain significant variance of digit-span improvement. In the discussion, the authors explore the appearance of the alpha enhancement in the control group and possible reasons for the absence of a connection between NFT and short-term memory.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/526624v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>The acquisition of fear memories involves plasticity of the thalamic and cortical pathways to the lateral amygdala (LA). The maintenance of synaptic plasticity requires the interplay between input-specific synaptic tags and the allocation of plasticity-related proteins (PRPs). Based on this interplay, weakly activated synapses can express long-lasting synaptic plasticity by cooperation with strongly activated ones. Increasing the number of activated synapses can shift cooperation to competition. Synaptic cooperation and competition can determine whether two events, separated in time, are linked or selected. The rules that determine whether synapses cooperate or compete are unknown. We found that synaptic cooperation and competition, in the LA, are determined by the temporal sequence of cortical and thalamic stimulation and that the strength of the synaptic tag is modulated by the endocannabinoid signalling. This modulation is particularly effective in thalamic synapses, suggesting a critical role of endocannabinoids in restricting thalamic plasticity. Also, we found that PRPs availability is modulated by the action-potential firing of neurons, shifting competition to cooperation. Our data present the first evidence that pre-synaptic modulation of synaptic activation, by the cannabinoid signalling, function as a temporal gating mechanism limiting synaptic cooperation and competition.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Debmalya Chakrabarty, Mounya Elhilali&lt;/p&gt;

Our current understanding of how the brain segregates auditory scenes into meaningful objects is in line with a Gestaltism framework. These Gestalt principles suggest a theory of how different attributes of the soundscape are extracted then bound together into separate groups that reflect different objects or streams present in the scene. These cues are thought to reflect the underlying statistical structure of natural sounds in a similar way that statistics of natural images are closely linked to the principles that guide figure-ground segregation and object segmentation in vision. In the present study, we leverage inference in stochastic neural networks to learn emergent grouping cues directly from natural soundscapes including speech, music and sounds in nature. The model learns a hierarchy of local and global spectro-temporal attributes reminiscent of simultaneous and sequential Gestalt cues that underlie the organization of auditory scenes. These mappings operate at multiple time scales to analyze an incoming complex scene and are then fused using a Hebbian network that binds together coherent features into perceptually-segregated auditory objects. The proposed architecture successfully emulates a wide range of well established auditory scene segregation phenomena and quantifies the complimentary role of segregation and binding cues in driving auditory scene segregation.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/vyBkEuhJkjY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Generalizing clusters of similar species as a signature of coexistence under competition</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/IY4Xes5-Z1I/article</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Rafael D’Andrea, Maria Riolo, Annette M. Ostling&lt;/p&gt;

Patterns of trait distribution among competing species can potentially reveal the processes that allow them to coexist. It has been recently proposed that competition may drive the spontaneous emergence of niches comprising clusters of similar species, in contrast with the dominant paradigm of greater-than-chance species differences. However, current clustering theory relies largely on heuristic rather than mechanistic models. Furthermore, studies of models incorporating demographic stochasticity and immigration, two key players in community assembly, did not observe clusters. Here we demonstrate clustering under partitioning of resources, partitioning of environmental gradients, and a competition-colonization tradeoff. We show that clusters are robust to demographic stochasticity, and can persist under immigration. While immigration may sustain clusters that are otherwise transient, too much dilutes the pattern. In order to detect and quantify clusters in nature, we introduce and validate metrics which have no free parameters nor require arbitrary trait binning, and weigh species by their abundances rather than relying on a presence-absence count. By generalizing beyond the circumstances where clusters have been observed, our study contributes to establishing them as an update to classical trait patterning theory.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/IY4Xes5-Z1I&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Top-down inputs drive neuronal network rewiring and context-enhanced sensory processing in olfaction</title>

Much of the computational power of the mammalian brain arises from its extensive top-down projections. To enable neuron-specific information processing these projections have to be precisely targeted. How such a specific connectivity emerges and what functions it supports is still poorly understood. We addressed these questions in silico in the context of the profound structural plasticity of the olfactory system. At the core of this plasticity are the granule cells of the olfactory bulb, which integrate bottom-up sensory inputs and top-down inputs delivered by vast top-down projections from cortical and other brain areas. We developed a biophysically supported computational model for the rewiring of the top-down projections and the intra-bulbar network via adult neurogenesis. The model captures various previous physiological and behavioral observations and makes specific predictions for the cortico-bulbar network connectivity that is learned by odor exposure and environmental contexts. Specifically, it predicts that—after learning—the granule-cell receptive fields with respect to sensory and with respect to cortical inputs are highly correlated. This enables cortical cells that respond to a learned odor to enact disynaptic inhibitory control specifically of bulbar principal cells that respond to that odor. For this the reciprocal nature of the granule cell synapses with the principal cells is essential. Functionally, the model predicts context-enhanced stimulus discrimination in cluttered environments (‘olfactory cocktail parties’) and the ability of the system to adapt to its tasks by rapidly switching between different odor-processing modes. These predictions are experimentally testable. At the same time they provide guidance for future experiments aimed at unraveling the cortico-bulbar connectivity.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Zr8mG2szw1g&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Differential mobility and local variation in infection attack rate</title>

Infectious disease transmission in animals is an inherently spatial process in which a host’s home location and their social mixing patterns are important, with the mixing of infectious individuals often different to that of susceptible individuals. Although incidence data for humans have traditionally been aggregated into low-resolution data sets, modern representative surveillance systems such as electronic hospital records generate high volume case data with precise home locations. Here, we use a gridded spatial transmission model of arbitrary resolution to investigate the theoretical relationship between population density, differential population movement and local variability in incidence. We show analytically that a uniform local attack rate is only possible for individual pixels in the grid if susceptible and infectious individuals move in the same way. Using a population in Guangdong, China, for which a robust quantitative description of movement is available (a movement kernel), and a natural history consistent with pandemic influenza; we show that local cumulative incidence is positively correlated with population density when susceptible individuals are more connected in space than infectious individuals. Conversely, under the less intuitively likely scenario, when infectious individuals are more connected, local cumulative incidence is negatively correlated with population density. The strength and direction of correlation changes sign for other kernel parameter values. We show that simulation models in which it is assumed implicitly that only infectious individuals move are assuming a slightly unusual specific correlation between population density and attack rate. However, we also show that this potential structural bias can be corrected by using the appropriate non-isotropic kernel that maps infectious-only code onto the isotropic dual-mobility kernel. These results describe a precise relationship between the spatio-social mixing of infectious and susceptible individuals and local variability in attack rates. More generally, these results suggest a genuine risk that mechanistic models of high-resolution attack rate data may reach spurious conclusions if the precise implications of spatial force-of-infection assumptions are not first fully characterized, prior to models being fit to data.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/bSUhdjfqBC8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>RSS PAP: Human verbal memory encoding is hierarchically distributed in a continuous processing stream: Human processing stream for verbal memory encoding</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0214-18.2018v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Processing of memory is supported by coordinated activity in a network of sensory, association, and motor brain regions. It remains a major challenge to determine where memory is encoded for later retrieval. Here we used direct intracranial brain recordings from epilepsy patients performing free recall tasks to determine the temporal pattern and anatomical distribution of verbal memory encoding across the entire human cortex. High gamma frequency activity (65-115 Hz) showed consistent power responses during encoding of subsequently recalled and forgotten words on a subset of electrodes localized in 16 distinct cortical areas activated in the tasks. More of the high gamma power during word encoding, and less power before and after the word presentation, was characteristic of successful recall and observed across multiple brain regions. Latencies of the induced power changes and this subsequent memory effect between the recalled and forgotten words followed an anatomical sequence from visual to prefrontal cortical areas. Finally, the magnitude of the memory effect was unexpectedly found to be the largest in selected brain regions both at the top and at the bottom of the processing stream. These included the language processing areas of the prefrontal cortex and the downstream visual areas at the junction of the occipital and temporal lobes. Our results provide evidence for distributed encoding of verbal memory organized along a hierarchical posterior-to-anterior processing stream.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Verbal memory is a complex function supported by a network of brain regions specialized for perception, decision-making, and execution of action. Our results shed light on the temporal and anatomical organization of this network during encoding of memories for subsequent recall. By finding consistent differences in fast gamma activity recorded directly from the human brain during presentation of words that were later recalled or forgotten, we identified specific regions with the greatest memory effect. This subsequent memory effect was present across a feed-forward processing stream, providing evidence for hierarchical and distributed organization of verbal memory. The identified brain regions in the processing stream present new targets for brain modulation technologies to treat verbal and cognitive deficits in brain disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Lyme borreliosis is the object of numerous misconceptions. In this review, we revisit the fundamental manifestations of neuroborreliosis (meningitis, cranial neuritis, and radiculoneuritis), as these have withstood the test of time. We also discuss other manifestations that are less frequent. Stroke, as a manifestation of Lyme neuroborreliosis, is considered in the context of other infections. The summary of the literature regarding clinical outcomes of neuroborreliosis leads to its controversies. We also include new information on pathogenesis and on the polymicrobial nature of tick‐borne diseases.

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: Stroke Recovery in Rats after 24‐Hour–Delayed Intramuscular Neurotrophin‐3 Infusion</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25386?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neurotrophin‐3 (NT3) plays a key role in the development and function of locomotor circuits including descending serotonergic and corticospinal tract axons and afferents from muscle and skin. We have previously shown that gene therapy delivery of human NT3 into affected forelimb muscles improves sensorimotor recovery after stroke in adult and elderly rats. Here, to move toward the clinic, we tested the hypothesis that intramuscular infusion of NT3 protein could improve sensorimotor recovery after stroke.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rats received unilateral ischemic stroke in sensorimotor cortex. To simulate a clinically feasible time to treatment, 24 hours later rats were randomized to receive NT3 or vehicle by infusion into affected triceps brachii for 4 weeks using implanted catheters and minipumps.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Radiolabeled NT3 crossed from the bloodstream into the brain and spinal cord in rodents with or without strokes. NT3 increased the accuracy of forelimb placement during walking on a horizontal ladder and increased use of the affected arm for lateral support during rearing. NT3 also reversed sensory impairment of the affected wrist. Functional magnetic resonance imaging during stimulation of the affected wrist showed spontaneous recovery of peri‐infarct blood oxygenation level–dependent signal that NT3 did not further enhance. Rather, NT3 induced neuroplasticity of the spared corticospinal and serotonergic pathways.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our results show that delayed, peripheral infusion of NT3 can improve sensorimotor function after ischemic stroke. Phase I and II clinical trials of NT3 (for constipation and neuropathy) have shown that peripheral high doses are safe and well tolerated, which paves the way for NT3 as a therapy for stroke. &lt;b&gt;ANN NEUROL 2019;85:32–46.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: Serum Soluble Triggering Receptor Expressed on Myeloid Cells 2 as a Biomarker for Incident Dementia: The Hisayama Study</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25385?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To investigate the association between serum soluble triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (sTREM2), a soluble type of an innate immune receptor expressed on the microglia, and the risk of dementia.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A total of 1,349 Japanese community residents aged 60 and older without dementia were followed prospectively for 10 years (2002–2012). Serum sTREM2 levels were quantified by using an enzyme‐linked immunosorbent assay and divided into quartiles. Cox proportional hazards model was used to estimate the hazard ratios (HRs) of serum sTREM2 levels on the risk of dementia.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the follow‐up, 300 subjects developed all‐cause dementia; 193 had Alzheimer's disease (AD), and 85 had vascular dementia (VaD). The age‐ and sex‐adjusted incidences of all‐cause dementia, AD, and VaD elevated significantly with higher serum sTREM2 levels (all &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; for trend &amp;lt; 0.012). These associations were not altered after adjustment for confounding factors, including high‐sensitive C‐reactive protein. Subjects with the highest quartile of serum sTREM2 levels had significantly higher multivariable‐adjusted risks of developing all‐cause dementia, AD, and VaD than those with the lowest quartile (HR = 2.03, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.39–2.97, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001 for all‐cause dementia; HR = 1.62, 95% CI = 1.02–2.55, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.04 for AD; HR = 2.85, 95% CI = 1.35–6.02, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.006 for VaD). No significant heterogeneity in the association of serum sTREM2 levels with the development of dementia was observed among the other risk factor subgroups (all &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; for heterogeneity &amp;gt; 0.11).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The present findings suggest a significant association between increased serum sTREM2 levels and the risk of developing all‐cause dementia, AD, and VaD in the general elderly Japanese population. &lt;b&gt;ANN NEUROL 2019;85:47–58.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25384?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hand amputation is a highly disabling event, which significantly affects quality of life. An effective hand replacement can be achieved if the user, in addition to motor functions, is provided with the sensations that are naturally perceived while grasping and moving. Intraneural peripheral electrodes have shown promising results toward the restoration of the sense of touch. However, the long‐term usability and clinical relevance of intraneural sensory feedback have not yet been clearly demonstrated.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To this aim, we performed a 6‐month clinical study with 3 transradial amputees who received implants of transverse intrafascicular multichannel electrodes (TIMEs) in their median and ulnar nerves. After calibration, electrical stimulation was delivered through the TIMEs connected to artificial sensors in the digits of a prosthesis to generate sensory feedback, which was then used by the subjects while performing different grasping tasks.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All subjects, notwithstanding their important clinical differences, reported stimulation‐induced sensations from the phantom hand for the whole duration of the trial. They also successfully integrated the sensory feedback into their motor control strategies while performing experimental tests simulating tasks of real life (with and without the support of vision). Finally, they reported a decrement of their phantom limb pain and a general improvement in mood state.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The promising results achieved with all subjects show the feasibility of the use of intraneural stimulation in clinical settings. &lt;b&gt;ANN NEUROL 2019;85:137–154.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25383?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Agonism of protease‐activated receptor (PAR) 1 by activated protein C (APC) provides neuro‐ and vasculoprotection in experimental neuroinjury models. The pleiotropic PAR1 agonist, 3K3A‐APC, reduces neurological injury and promotes vascular integrity; 3K3A‐APC proved safe in human volunteers. We performed a randomized, controlled, blinded trial to determine the maximally tolerated dose (MTD) of 3K3A‐APC in ischemic stroke patients.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The NeuroNEXT trial, RHAPSODY, used a novel continual reassessment method to determine the MTD using tiers of 120, 240, 360, and 540 μg/kg of 3K3A‐APC. After intravenous tissue plasminogen activator, intra‐arterial mechanical thrombectomy, or both, patients were randomized to 1 of the 4 doses or placebo. Vasculoprotection was assessed as microbleed and intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) rates.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Between January 2015 and July 2017, we treated 110 patients. Demographics resembled a typical stroke population. The MTD was the highest‐dose 3K3A‐APC tested, 540 μg/kg, with an estimated toxicity rate of 7%. There was no difference in prespecified ICH rates. In exploratory analyses, 3K3A‐APC reduced ICH rates compared to placebo from 86.5% to 67.4% in the combined treatment arms (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.046) and total hemorrhage volume from an average of 2.1 ± 5.8 ml in placebo to 0.8 ± 2.1 ml in the combined treatment arms (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.066).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RHAPSODY is the first trial of a neuroprotectant for acute ischemic stroke in a trial design allowing thrombectomy, thrombolysis, or both. The MTD was 540 μg/kg for the PAR1 active cytoprotectant, 3K3A‐APC. A trend toward lower hemorrhage rate in an exploratory analysis requires confirmation.&lt;/p&gt;

	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25380?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The degree to which Alzheimer's versus other neuropathologies contribute to the risk of Alzheimer's dementia is unknown. We examined the risk of Alzheimer's dementia attributable to pathologic AD and 8 other neuropathologies.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Participants (n = 1,161) came from 2 clinical‐pathological studies of aging. Multivariable logistic regression models examined associations of 8 neuropathological indices with Alzheimer's dementia and quantified the percentage of cases attributable to each. Furthermore, because some dementia cases are not driven by common neuropathologies, we re‐estimated the attributable risks after empirically adjusting for such cases.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of 1,161 persons, 512 (44.1%) had Alzheimer's dementia at time of death. With the exception of microinfarcts, all neuropathological indices were independently associated with greater odds of Alzheimer's dementia. Two hundred ten (41.0%) Alzheimer's dementia cases were attributable to pathological AD. Separately, 8.9% were attributable to macroscopic infarcts, 10.8% to Lewy bodies, 5.2% to hippocampal sclerosis, 11.7% to transactive response DNA‐binding protein 43, 8.1% to cerebral amyloid angiopathy, 6.0% to atherosclerosis, and 5.2% to arteriolosclerosis. A total of 83.3% of cases were attributable to all 8 indices combined. However, after further adjustment for cases driven by other factors, a total of 67.5% of cases were attributable to all 8 neuropathologic indices combined.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pathological AD accounts for a considerable percentage of Alzheimer's dementia cases, but multiple other neuropathologies also contribute. In total, just over two‐thirds of Alzheimer's dementia cases are attributable to common age‐related neuropathologies, suggesting that other disease and resilience factors are important. &lt;b&gt;ANN NEUROL 2019;85:114–124.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25379?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To determine the association between clinical outcomes and acute systolic blood pressure (SBP) levels achieved after intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eligible patients who were randomized to the ATACH‐2 (Antihypertensive Treatment in Intracerebral Hemorrhage 2) trial (&lt;a href=&quot;http://clinicaltrials.gov&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Link to external resource&quot;&gt;ClinicalTrials.gov&lt;/a&gt;: NCT01176565) were divided into 5 groups by 10‐mmHg strata of average hourly minimum SBP (&amp;lt;120, 120–130, 130–140, 140–150, and ≥ 150 mmHg) during 2 to 24 hours after randomization. Outcomes included: 90‐day modified Rankin Scale (mRS) 4 to 6; hematoma expansion, defined as an increase ≥6 ml from baseline to 24‐hour computed tomography; and cardiorenal adverse events within 7 days.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of the 1,000 subjects in ATACH‐2, 995 with available SBP data were included in the analyses. The proportion of mRS 4 to 6 was 37.5, 36.0, 42.8, 38.6, and 38.0%, respectively. For the “140 to 150” group relative to the “120 to 130,” the odds ratio (OR), adjusting for sex, race, age, onset‐to‐randomization time, baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score, hematoma volume, and hematoma location, was 1.62 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.02–2.58). Hematoma expansion was identified in 16.9, 13.7, 21.4, 18.5, and 26.4%, respectively. The 140 to 150 (OR, 1.80; 95% CI, 1.05–3.09) and “≥150” (1.98; 1.12–3.51) showed a higher frequency of expansion than the 120 to 130 group. Cardiorenal events occurred in 13.6, 16.6, 11.5, 8.1, and 8.2%, respectively. The 140 to 150 (0.43; 0.19–0.88) and ≥ 150 (0.44; 0.18–0.96) showed a lower frequency of the events than the 120 to 130.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beneficial effects of lowering and maintaining SBP at 120 to 130 mmHg during the first 24 hours on clinical outcomes by suppressing hematoma expansion was somewhat offset by cardiorenal complications. &lt;b&gt;ANN NEUROL 2019;85:105–113.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: Magnetic resonance T1w/T2w ratio: A parsimonious marker for Parkinson disease</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25376?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Newer magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques have shown promise in capturing early Parkinson disease (PD)‐related changes in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc), the key pathological loci. Their translational value, however, is hindered by technical complexity and inconsistent results.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A novel yet simple MRI contrast, the T1w/T2w ratio, was used to study 76 PD patients and 70 controls. The T1w/T2w ratio maps were analyzed using both voxel‐based and region‐of‐interest approaches in normalized space. The sensitivity and specificity of the SNc T1w/T2w ratio in discriminating between PD and controls also were assessed. In addition, its diagnostic performance was tested in a subgroup of PD patients with disease duration ≤2 years (PDE). A second independent cohort of 73 PD patients and 49 controls was used for validation.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compared to controls, PD patients showed a higher T1w/T2w ratio in both the right (cluster size = 164mm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.0001) and left (cluster size = 213mm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.0001) midbrain that was located ventrolateral to the red nucleus and corresponded to the SNc. The region‐of‐interest approach confirmed the group difference in the SNc T1w/T2w ratio between PD and controls (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.0001). The SNc T1w/T2w ratio had high sensitivity (0.908) and specificity (0.80) to separate PD and controls (area under the curve [AUC] = 0.926), even for PDE patients (AUC = 0.901, sensitivity = 0.857, specificity = 0.857). These results were validated in the second cohort.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The T1w/T2w ratio can detect PD‐related changes in the SNc and may be used as a novel, parsimonious in vivo biomarker for the disease, particularly for early stage patients, with high translational value for clinical practice and research. &lt;b&gt;ANN NEUROL 2019;85:96–104.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: Brain state–dependent stimulation boosts functional recovery following stroke</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25375?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adjuvant protocols devised to enhance motor recovery in subacute stroke patients have failed to show benefits with respect to classic therapeutic interventions. Here, we evaluate the efficacy of a novel brain state–dependent intervention based on known mechanisms of memory and learning that is integrated as part of the weekly rehabilitation program in subacute stroke patients.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Twenty‐four hospitalized subacute stroke patients were randomly assigned to 2 intervention groups: (1) the associative group received 30 pairings of a peripheral electrical nerve stimulus (ES) such that the generated afferent volley arrived precisely during the most active phase of the motor cortex as patients attempted to perform a movement; and (2) in the control group, the ES intensity was too low to generate a stimulation of the nerve. Functional (including the lower extremity Fugl–Meyer assessment [LE‐FM; primary outcome measure]) and neurophysiological (changes in motor evoked potentials [MEPs]) assessments were performed prior to and following the intervention period.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The associative group significantly improved functional recovery with respect to the control group (median [interquartile range] LE‐FM improvement = 6.5 [3.5–8.25] and 3 [0.75–3], respectively; &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.029). Significant increases in MEP amplitude were seen following all sessions in the associative group only (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; ≤ 0.006).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the first evidence of a clinical effect of a neuromodulatory intervention in the subacute phase of stroke. This was evident with relatively few repetitions in comparison to available techniques, making it a clinically viable approach. The results indicate the potential of the proposed neuromodulation system in daily clinical routine for stroke rehabilitation. &lt;b&gt;ANN NEUROL 2019;85:84–95.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25373?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To determine whether brain amyloid burden in elderly patients with narcolepsy type 1 (NT1) is lower than in controls, and to assess in patients with NT1 the relationships between amyloid burden, cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) markers of Alzheimer disease (AD), CSF orexin‐A, and cognitive profile.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cognitive and &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F‐florbetapir positron emission tomography (PET) data were compared in patients with NT1 aged ≥ 65 years (n = 23) and in age‐ and sex‐matched controls free of clinical dementia selected from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI; n = 69) and the Multi‐Domain Intervention Alzheimer's Prevention Trial (MAPT‐18F AV45‐PET; n = 23) cohorts. The standardized uptake values (SUVs) of the cortical retention index for 6 regions of interest were computed and averaged to create a mean SUV ratio normalized to 3 subcortical reference regions (cerebellum, pons, and a composite region). A cortical/cerebellum SUV ratio ≥ 1.17 defined positive PET amyloid.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lower cortical amyloid burden was observed in the NT1 than in the ADNI and MAPT‐AV45 groups (mean cortical/cerebellum SUV ratios = 0.95 ± 0.15, 1.11 ± 0.18 [&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.0001], and 1.14 ± 0.17 [&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.0005], respectively). Similar results were obtained with all subcortical reference regions and for all cortical regions of interest, except cingulum. Only 1 patient with NT1 (4.4%) had positive PET amyloid compared with 27.5% in the ADNI and 30.4% in the MAPT‐AV45 group. In the NT1 group, cortical or regional amyloid load was not associated with CSF orexin‐A, CSF AD biomarkers, or neuropsychological profile.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lower brain amyloid burden, assessed by &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F‐florbetapir PET, in patients with NT1 suggests delayed appearance of amyloid plaques. &lt;b&gt;ANN NEUROL 2019;85:74–83.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: Neural basis of induced phantom limb pain relief</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25371?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Phantom limb pain (PLP) is notoriously difficult to treat, partly due to an incomplete understanding of PLP‐related disease mechanisms. Noninvasive brain stimulation (NIBS) is used to modulate plasticity in various neuropathological diseases, including chronic pain. Although NIBS can alleviate neuropathic pain (including PLP), both disease and treatment mechanisms remain tenuous. Insight into the mechanisms underlying both PLP and NIBS‐induced PLP relief is needed for future implementation of such treatment and generalization to related conditions.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We used a within‐participants, double‐blind, and sham‐controlled design to alleviate PLP via task‐concurrent NIBS over the primary sensorimotor missing hand cortex (S1/M1). To specifically influence missing hand signal processing, amputees performed phantom hand movements during anodal transcranial direct current stimulation. Brain activity was monitored using neuroimaging during and after NIBS. PLP ratings were obtained throughout the week after stimulation.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A single session of intervention NIBS significantly relieved PLP, with effects lasting at least 1 week. PLP relief associated with reduced activity in the S1/M1 missing hand cortex after stimulation. Critically, PLP relief and reduced S1/M1 activity correlated with preceding activity changes during stimulation in the mid‐ and posterior insula and secondary somatosensory cortex (S2).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The observed correlation between PLP relief and decreased S1/M1 activity confirms our previous findings linking PLP with increased S1/M1 activity. Our results further highlight the driving role of the mid‐ and posterior insula, as well as S2, in modulating PLP. Lastly, our novel PLP intervention using task‐concurrent NIBS opens new avenues for developing treatment for PLP and related pain conditions. &lt;b&gt;ANN NEUROL 2019;85:59–73.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: latest articles: A toolbox of IgG subclass-switched recombinant monoclonal antibodies for enhanced multiplex immunolabeling of brain</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/43322</link>
	<content:encoded>Generating recombinant monoclonal antibodies (R-mAbs) from mAb-producing hybridomas offers numerous advantages that increase the effectiveness, reproducibility, and transparent reporting of research. We report here the generation of a novel resource in the form of a library of recombinant R-mAbs validated for neuroscience research. We cloned immunoglobulin G (IgG) variable domains from cryopreserved hybridoma cells and input them into an integrated pipeline for expression and validation of functional R-mAbs. To improve efficiency over standard protocols, we eliminated aberrant Sp2/0-Ag14 hybridoma-derived variable light transcripts using restriction enzyme treatment. Further, we engineered a plasmid backbone that allows for switching of the IgG subclasses without altering target binding specificity to generate R-mAbs useful in simultaneous multiplex labeling experiments not previously possible. The method was also employed to rescue IgG variable sequences and generate functional R-mAbs from a non-viable cryopreserved hybridoma. All R-mAb sequences and plasmids will be archived and disseminated from open source suppliers.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: latest articles: Absence of TGFβ signaling in retinal microglia induces retinal degeneration and exacerbates choroidal neovascularization</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/42049</link>
	<content:encoded>Constitutive TGFβ signaling is important in maintaining retinal neurons and blood vessels and is a factor contributing to the risk for age-related macular degeneration (AMD), a retinal disease involving neurodegeneration and microglial activation. How TGFβ signaling to microglia influences pathological retinal neuroinflammation is unclear. We discovered that ablation of the TGFβ receptor, TGFBR2, in retinal microglia of adult mice induced abnormal microglial numbers, distribution, morphology, and activation status, and promoted a pathological microglial gene expression profile. TGFBR2-deficient retinal microglia induced secondary gliotic changes in Müller cells, neuronal apoptosis, and decreased light-evoked retinal function reflecting abnormal synaptic transmission. While retinal vasculature was unaffected, TGFBR2-deficient microglia demonstrated exaggerated responses to laser-induced injury that was associated with increased choroidal neovascularization, a hallmark of advanced exudative AMD. These findings demonstrate that deficiencies in TGFβ-mediated microglial regulation can drive neuroinflammatory contributions to AMD-related neurodegeneration and neovascularization, highlighting TGFβ signaling as a potential therapeutic target.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: latest articles: Factors affecting template switch recombination associated with restarted DNA replication</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/41697</link>
	<content:encoded>Homologous recombination helps ensure the timely completion of genome duplication by restarting collapsed replication forks. This beneficial function is not without risk however, as replication restarted by homologous recombination is prone to template switching (TS) that can generate deleterious genome rearrangements associated with diseases such as cancer. In a previous paper (Nguyen et al., 2015), we established an assay for studying TS in &lt;i&gt;Schizosaccharomyces pombe&lt;/i&gt;. Here, we advance this work by showing that TS is detected up to 75 kb downstream of a collapsed replication fork and can be triggered by head-on collision between the restarted fork and RNA Polymerase III transcription. The Pif1 DNA helicase, Pfh1, promotes efficient restart and also suppresses TS. A further three conserved helicases (Fbh1, Rqh1 and Srs2) strongly suppress TS, but there is no change in TS frequency in cells lacking Fml1 or Mus81. We discuss how these factors likely influence TS.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: latest articles: Generality and opponency of rostromedial tegmental (RMTg) roles in valence processing</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/41542</link>
	<content:encoded>The rostromedial tegmental nucleus (RMTg), a GABAergic afferent to midbrain dopamine (DA) neurons, has been hypothesized to be broadly activated by aversive stimuli. However, this encoding pattern has only been demonstrated for a limited number of stimuli, and the RMTg influence on ventral tegmental (VTA) responses to aversive stimuli is untested. Here, we found that RMTg neurons are broadly excited by aversive stimuli of different sensory modalities and inhibited by reward-related stimuli. These stimuli include visual, auditory, somatosensory and chemical aversive stimuli, as well as “opponent” motivational states induced by removal of sustained rewarding or aversive stimuli. These patterns are consistent with broad encoding of negative valence in a subset of RMTg neurons. We further found that valence-encoding RMTg neurons preferentially project to the DA-rich VTA versus other targets, and excitotoxic RMTg lesions greatly reduce aversive stimulus-induced inhibitions in VTA neurons, particularly putative DA neurons, while also impairing conditioned place aversion to multiple aversive stimuli. Together, our findings indicate a broad RMTg role in encoding aversion and driving VTA responses and behavior.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/41439</link>
	<content:encoded>CRISPR-based homing gene drives have sparked both enthusiasm and deep concerns                    due to their potential for genetically altering entire species. This raises the                    question about our ability to prevent the unintended spread of such drives from                    the laboratory into a natural population. Here, we experimentally demonstrate                    the suitability of synthetic target site drives as well as split drives as                    flexible safeguarding strategies for gene drive experiments by showing that                    their performance closely resembles that of standard homing drives in                        &lt;i&gt;Drosophila melanogaster&lt;/i&gt;. Using our split drive system, we                    further find that maternal deposition of both Cas9 and gRNA is required to form                    resistance alleles in the early embryo and that maternally-deposited Cas9 alone                    can power germline drive conversion in individuals that lack a genomic source of                    Cas9.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: latest articles: Gut microbiota density influences host physiology and is shaped by host and microbial factors</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/40553</link>
	<content:encoded>To identify factors that regulate gut microbiota density and the impact of varied microbiota density on health, we assayed this fundamental ecosystem property in fecal samples across mammals, human disease, and therapeutic interventions. Physiologic features of the host (carrying capacity) and the fitness of the gut microbiota shape microbiota density. Therapeutic manipulation of microbiota density in mice altered host metabolic and immune homeostasis. In humans, gut microbiota density was reduced in Crohn’s disease, ulcerative colitis, and ileal pouch-anal anastomosis. The gut microbiota in recurrent &lt;i&gt;Clostridium difficile&lt;/i&gt; infection had lower density and reduced fitness that were restored by fecal microbiota transplantation. Understanding the interplay between microbiota and disease in terms of microbiota density, host carrying capacity, and microbiota fitness provide new insights into microbiome structure and microbiome targeted therapeutics.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: latest articles: High-molecular-weight polymers from dietary fiber drive aggregation of particulates in the murine small intestine</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/40387</link>
	<content:encoded>The lumen of the small intestine (SI) is filled with particulates: microbes, therapeutic particles, and food granules. The structure of this particulate suspension could impact uptake of drugs and nutrients and the function of microorganisms; however, little is understood about how this suspension is re-structured as it transits the gut. Here, we demonstrate that particles spontaneously aggregate in SI luminal fluid ex vivo. We find that mucins and immunoglobulins are not required for aggregation. Instead, aggregation can be controlled using polymers from dietary fiber in a manner that is qualitatively consistent with polymer-induced depletion interactions, which do not require specific chemical interactions. Furthermore, we find that aggregation is tunable; by feeding mice dietary fibers of different molecular weights, we can control aggregation in SI luminal fluid. This work suggests that the molecular weight and concentration of dietary polymers play an underappreciated role in shaping the physicochemical environment of the gut.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/39982</link>
	<content:encoded>Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is driven by dysfunction between host genetics, the microbiota, and immune system. Knowledge gaps remain regarding how IBD genetic risk loci drive gut microbiota changes. The Crohn’s disease risk allele &lt;i&gt;ATG16L1&lt;/i&gt; T300A results in abnormal Paneth cells due to decreased selective autophagy, increased cytokine release, and decreased intracellular bacterial clearance. To unravel the effects of &lt;i&gt;ATG16L1&lt;/i&gt; T300A on the microbiota and immune system, we employed a gnotobiotic model using human fecal transfers into &lt;i&gt;ATG16L1&lt;/i&gt; T300A knock-in mice. We observed increases in &lt;i&gt;Bacteroides ovatus&lt;/i&gt; and Th1 and Th17 cells in &lt;i&gt;ATG16L1&lt;/i&gt; T300A mice. Association of altered Schaedler flora mice with &lt;i&gt;B. ovatus&lt;/i&gt; specifically increased Th17 cells selectively in &lt;i&gt;ATG16L1&lt;/i&gt; T300A knock-in mice. Changes occur before disease onset, suggesting that &lt;i&gt;ATG16L1&lt;/i&gt; T300A contributes to dysbiosis and immune infiltration prior to disease symptoms. Our work provides insight for future studies on IBD subtypes, IBD patient treatment and diagnostics.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: latest articles: Quantitative analysis of auxin sensing in leaf primordia argues against proposed role in regulating leaf dorsoventrality</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/39298</link>
	<content:encoded>Dorsoventrality in leaves has been shown to depend on the pre-patterned expression of KANADI and HD-ZIPIII genes within the plant shoot apical meristem (SAM). However, it has also been proposed that asymmetric auxin levels within initiating leaves help establish leaf polarity, based in part on observations of the DII auxin sensor. By analyzing and quantifying the expression of the R2D2 auxin sensor, we find that there is no obvious asymmetry in auxin levels during Arabidopsis leaf development. We further show that the mDII control sensor also exhibits an asymmetry in expression in developing leaf primordia early on, while it becomes more symmetric at a later developmental stage as reported previously. Together with other recent findings, our results argue against the importance of auxin asymmetry in establishing leaf polarity.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Microglia provide immune surveillance of the CNS. They display diverse behaviors, including nondirectional and directed motility of their processes, phagocytosis of targets such as dying neurons or superfluous synapses, and generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and cytokines. Many of these functions are mediated by ion channels and cell surface receptors, the expression of which varies with the many morphological and functional states that microglial cells can adopt. Recent progress in understanding microglial function has been facilitated by applying classical cell physiological techniques in situ, such as patch-clamping and live imaging, and cell-specific transcriptomic analyses.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/527572v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Amyloid Precursor Protein (APP) and its cleavage product beta-amyloid are widely believed to be key players in the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the distribution of amyloid deposits in the brain does not correlate well with disease progression. Therefore, it seemed possible that APP metabolites other than beta-amyloid might make a strong contribution to AD pathology. We developed a sensitive assay adapted to the detection of C99, an intermediate in the conversion of APP to beta-amyloid. Brain tissue sections were obtained from patients suffering from sporadic AD and non-demented controls. Our results demonstrate that C99 levels, but not Abeta levels, correlate with the degree of vulnerability to neurodegeneration and cognitive impairment in patients suffering from AD.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/527119v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Humans and other animals base important decisions on estimates of number, and intraparietal cortex is thought to provide a crucial substrate of this ability. However, it remains debated whether an independent neuronal processing mechanism underlies this 'number sense', or whether number is instead judged indirectly on the basis of other quantitative features. We performed high-resolution 7 Tesla fMRI while adult human volunteers attended either to the numerosity or to an orthogonal dimension (average item size) of visual dot arrays. Numerosity explained a significant amount of variance in activation patterns, above and beyond non-numerical dimensions. Its representation was progressively enhanced along the dorsal visual pathway and was selectively amplified by attention when task relevant. These results reveal a dedicated extraction mechanism for numerosity that operates independently of other quantitative dimensions of the stimuli, and suggest that later stages along the dorsal stream are most important for the explicit manipulation of numerical quantity.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/526186v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Background: Inverse association between premorbid body mass index (BMI) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) has been discovered in observational studies; however, whether this association is causal remains largely unknown. Methods: We employed a two-sample Mendelian randomization approach to evaluate the causal relationship of genetically increased BMI with the risk of ALS. The analyses were implemented using summary statistics obtained for the independent instruments identified from large-scale genome-wide association studies of BMI (up to ~770,000 individuals) and ALS (up to ~81,000 individuals). The causal relationship between BMI and ALS was estimated using inverse-variance weighted methods and was further validated through extensive complementary and sensitivity analyses. Findings: Using 1,031 instruments strongly related to BMI, the causal effect of per one standard deviation increase of BMI was estimated to be 1.04 (95% CI 0.97~1.11, p=0.275) in the European population. The null association between BMI and ALS discovered in the European population also held in the East Asian population and was robust against various modeling assumptions and outlier biases. Additionally, the Egger-regression and MR-PRESSO ruled out the possibility of horizontal pleiotropic effects of instruments. Interpretation: Our results do not support the causal role of genetically increased or decreased BMI on the risk of ALS.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Multi-frequency tACS has lasting effects on neural synchrony and audiovisual responses</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/526087v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>BACKGROUND: In cortical networks, synchronized oscillatory activity of neuronal populations enables communication, and its disturbance is related to a range of pathologies. Transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) has been explored as a flexible, noninvasive tool for the modulation and restoration of synchronized oscillatory signals. While numerous studies have addressed cognitive or behavioural effects of electrical stimulation, the neural changes underlying the effects of tACS and their persistence after stimulation offset have remained unclear. OBJECTIVE: Here, we screened for lasting aftereffects of prolonged tACS on intrinsic network activity and audiovisual processing in the anesthetized ferret brain. METHODS: Electrical stimulation was applied via subcutaneous wire electrodes. Current waveforms were synthesized from two frequencies in the alpha or gamma range, respectively. Flashes and clicks were used for audiovisual stimulation. Electrocorticographic recordings from an extended network including occipital, temporal and parietal cortical areas were obtained before and after tACS. RESULTS: Changes in local synchrony (continuous and spike-triggered power of LFP), synchrony across recording sites (imaginary coherence) and altered dynamics of sensory response-features (peak-to-peak amplitude, extremum latency) following electrical stimulation consistently point to a synchronizing effect of tACS that can outlast stimulation offset by at least 10 min. Gamma-band tACS proved particularly effective. In line with previous reports on cross-frequency interactions, we observed effects on coherence and power of baseline activity at frequencies other than the ones targeted by tACS. These cross-frequency interactions appeared to underlie the strengthening and stabilizing effect on audiovisual responses. CONCLUSION: We demonstrate aftereffects of tACS on synchrony and stimulus processing in an extended cortical network, measured intracranially in a setting that resembles tACS stimulation in humans. The data provide direct evidence for the efficacy of tACS as a tool for sustained modulation of cortical network dynamics.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently identified mutations of the axon guidance molecule receptor gene, &lt;i&gt;DCC,&lt;/i&gt; present an opportunity to investigate, in living human brain, mechanisms affecting neural connectivity and the basis of mirror movements, involuntary contralateral responses that mirror voluntary unilateral actions. We hypothesized that haploinsufficient &lt;i&gt;DCC&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;+/‐&lt;/sup&gt; mutation carriers with mirror movements would exhibit decreased &lt;i&gt;DCC&lt;/i&gt; mRNA expression, a functional ipsilateral corticospinal tract, greater “mirroring” motor representations, and reduced interhemispheric inhibition. &lt;i&gt;DCC&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;+/‐&lt;/sup&gt; mutation carriers without mirror movements might exhibit some of these features.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The participants (n=52) included 13 &lt;i&gt;DCC&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;+/‐&lt;/sup&gt; mutation carriers with mirror movements, 7 &lt;i&gt;DCC&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;+/‐&lt;/sup&gt; mutation carriers without mirror movements, 13 relatives without the mutation or mirror movements, and 19 unrelated healthy volunteers. The multimodal approach comprised quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction, transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) under resting and task conditions, and measures of white matter integrity.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mirror movements were associated with reduced &lt;i&gt;DCC&lt;/i&gt; mRNA expression, increased ipsilateral TMS‐induced motor evoked potentials, increased fMRI responses in the “mirroring” M1 and cerebellum, and markedly reduced interhemispheric inhibition. The &lt;i&gt;DCC&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;+/‐&lt;/sup&gt; mutation, irrespective of mirror movements, was associated with reduced functional connectivity and white matter integrity.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diverse connectivity abnormalities were identified in mutation carriers with and without mirror movements, but corticospinal effects and decreased peripheral &lt;i&gt;DCC&lt;/i&gt; mRNA appeared driven by the mirror movement phenotype.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One hundred thirty‐seven older individuals (age = 76.3 ± 6.22 years) participating in the Harvard Aging Brain Study underwent Aβ (&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;C‐Pittsburgh compound B) and tau (&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F‐flortaucipir) positron emission tomography (PET) with prospective neuropsychological assessments following PET imaging (mean number of cognitive visits = 2.8 ± 1.1). Tau and Aβ PET measures were assessed in regions of interest (ROIs) as well as vertex‐wise map analyses. Cognitive change was evaluated with Memory and Executive Function composites.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Higher levels of Aβ and tau were both associated with greater memory decline, but not with change in executive function. Higher cortical Aβ was associated with higher tau levels in all ROIs, independent of age, and very elevated levels of tau were observed primarily in clinically normal with elevated Aβ. A significant interaction between tau and Aβ was observed in both ROI and map‐level analyses, such that rapid prospective memory decline was observed in participants who had high levels of both pathologies.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our results are consistent with the supposition that both Aβ and tau are necessary for memory decline in the preclinical stages of AD. These findings may be relevant for disambiguating aging and early cognitive manifestations of AD, and to inform secondary prevention trials in preclinical AD.

	<title>RSS PAP: Transgenerational transmission of enhanced ocular dominance plasticity from enriched mice to their non-enriched offspring</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0252-18.2018v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;In recent years, evidence has accumulated that non-Mendelian transgenerational inheritance of qualities acquired through experience is possible. In particular, it has been shown that raising rodents in a so-called enriched environment (EE) can not only modify the animals’ behaviour and increase their susceptibility to activity-dependent neuronal network changes, but also influences both behaviour and neuronal plasticity of the non-enriched offspring. Here, we tested whether such a transgenerational transmission can also be observed in the primary visual cortex (V1) using ocular dominance (OD) plasticity after monocular deprivation (MD) as a paradigm. While OD-plasticity after 7 days of MD is absent in standard-cage (SC) raised mice beyond postnatal day (P) 110, it is present lifelong in EE-raised mice. Using intrinsic signal optical imaging to visualize cortical activity, we confirm these previous observations and additionally show that OD-plasticity is not only preserved in adult EE-mice but also in their adult non-enriched offspring: mice born to enriched parents, but raised in SCs at least until P110 displayed similar OD-shifts towards the open eye after 7 days of MD as age-matched EE-raised animals. Furthermore, testing the offspring of EE-female versus EE-males with SC-mating partners revealed that only pups of EE-females, but not of EE-males, preserved OD-plasticity into adulthood, suggesting that the life experiences of the mother have a greater impact on the continued V1-plasticity of the offspring. The OD-plasticity of the non-enriched pups of EE-mothers was, however, mechanistically different from that of non-enriched pups of EE-parents or EE-mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance statement&lt;/b&gt; Recently evidence is accumulating that life experiences and thus acquired qualities of parents can be transmitted across generations in a non-Mendelian fashion and have a significant impact on the fitness of offspring. Raising mice in a so-called enriched environment with enhanced opportunities for social interaction, voluntary physical exercise and explorative behaviour has been shown to boost cortical plasticity. Our results now show that the plasticity-promoting effect of enrichment on ocular dominance plasticity, a well-established plasticity paradigm in a primary sensory cortex, can also be transmitted from enriched parents to their non-enriched offspring. Thus cortical plasticity is not only influenced by an animal’s life experiences but can also be modified by the life experiences of its parents.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/44491</link>
	<content:encoded>Accurate lineage reconstruction of mammalian pre-implantation development is essential for inferring the earliest cell fate decisions. Lineage tracing using global fluorescence labeling techniques is complicated by increasing cell density and rapid embryo rotation, which hampers automatic alignment and accurate cell tracking of obtained four-dimensional imaging data sets. Here, we exploit the advantageous properties of primed convertible fluorescent proteins (pr-pcFPs) to simultaneously visualize the global green and the photoconverted red population in order to minimize tracking uncertainties over prolonged time windows. Confined primed conversion of H2B-pr-mEosFP-labeled nuclei combined with light-sheet imaging greatly facilitates segmentation, classification, and tracking of individual nuclei from the 4-cell stage up to the blastocyst. Using green and red labels as fiducial markers, we computationally correct for rotational and translational drift, reduce overall data size, and accomplish high-fidelity lineage tracing even for increased imaging time intervals – addressing major concerns in the field of volumetric embryo imaging.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/43587</link>
	<content:encoded>A series of recent studies identified key structures in the mesencephalic locomotor region and the caudal brainstem of mice involved in the initiation and control of slow (exploratory) and fast (escape-type) locomotion and gait. Yet, how these brainstem centers interact with each other and with the spinal locomotor circuits is poorly understood. In a previous model (Danner et al., 2017), we suggested that commissural and long propriospinal interneurons are the main targets for brainstem inputs adjusting gait. Here, by extending our previous model, we propose a connectome of the brainstem-spinal circuitry and suggest a mechanistic explanation of the operation of brainstem structures and their roles in controlling speed and gait. We suggest that brainstem control of locomotion is mediated by two pathways, one controlling locomotor speed via connections to rhythm generating circuits in the spinal cord and the other providing gait control by targeting commissural and long propriospinal interneurons.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Differences in brain networks and underlying white matter abnormalities have been suggested to underlie symptoms of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). However, robustly characterizing microstructural white matter differences has been challenging. In the present study, we applied an analytic technique that calculates structural metrics specific to differently-oriented fiber bundles within a voxel, termed “fixels”. Fixel-based analyses were used to compare diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging data from 25 individuals with ASD (mean age = 16.8 years) and 27 typically developing age-matched controls (mean age = 16.9 years). Group comparisons of fiber density (FD) and bundle morphology were run on a fixel-wise, tract-wise, and global white matter (GWM) basis. We found that individuals with ASD had reduced FD, suggestive of decreased axonal count, in several major white matter tracts, including the corpus callosum (CC), bilateral inferior frontal-occipital fasciculus, right arcuate fasciculus, and right uncinate fasciculus, as well as a GWM reduction. Secondary analyses assessed associations with social impairment in participants with ASD, and showed that lower FD in the splenium of the CC was associated with greater social impairment. Our findings suggest that reduced FD could be the primary microstructural white matter abnormality in ASD.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Optic nerve (ON) injury is an established model of axonal injury which results in retrograde degeneration and death of retinal ganglion cells as well anterograde loss of transmission and Wallerian degeneration of the injured axons. While the local impact of ON crush has been extensively documented we know comparatively little about the functional changes that occur in higher visual structures such as primary visual cortex (V1). We explored the extent of adult cortical plasticity using ON crush in aged mice. V1 function of the contralateral hemisphere was assessed longitudinally by intrinsic signal imaging and 2-photon calcium imaging before and after ON crush. Functional imaging demonstrated an immediate shift in V1 ocular dominance towards the ipsilateral, intact eye, due to the expected almost complete loss of responses to contralateral eye stimulation. Surprisingly, within 2 weeks we observed a delayed increase in ipsilateral eye responses. Additionally, spontaneous activity in V1 was reduced, similar to the lesion projection zone after retinal lesions. The observed changes in V1 activity indicate that severe ON injury in adulthood evokes cortical plasticity not only cross-modally but also within the visual cortex; this plasticity may be best compared with that seen after retinal lesions.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Selective Modulation of Early Visual Cortical Activity by Movement Intention</title>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy345/5298362?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;The primate visual system contains myriad feedback projections from higher- to lower-order cortical areas, an architecture that has been implicated in the top-down modulation of early visual areas during working memory and attention. Here we tested the hypothesis that these feedback projections also modulate early visual cortical activity during the planning of visually guided actions. We show, across three separate human functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies involving object-directed movements, that information related to the motor effector to be used (i.e., limb, eye) and action goal to be performed (i.e., grasp, reach) can be selectively decoded—prior to movement—from the retinotopic representation of the target object(s) in early visual cortex. We also find that during the planning of sequential actions involving objects in two different spatial locations, that motor-related information can be decoded from both locations in retinotopic cortex. Together, these findings indicate that movement planning selectively modulates early visual cortical activity patterns in an effector-specific, target-centric, and task-dependent manner. These findings offer a neural account of how motor-relevant target features are enhanced during action planning and suggest a possible role for early visual cortex in instituting a sensorimotor estimate of the visual consequences of movement.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Sequence Variation Associated with SLC12A5 Gene Expression Is Linked to Brain Structure and Function in Healthy Adults</title>

	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;A single-nucleotide polymorphism in the promoter region of the Matrix Metalloproteinase-9 (&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;MMP9&lt;/span&gt;) gene, rs3918242, has been shown to affect &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;MMP9&lt;/span&gt; expression in macrophages and was associated with schizophrenia by two independent groups. However, rs3918242's effects on &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;MMP9&lt;/span&gt; expression were not replicable in cell lines or brain tissue. Additionally, publically available data indicate that rs3918242 genotype is related not to &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;MMP9&lt;/span&gt; expression, but rather to expression of &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;SLC12A5&lt;/span&gt;, a nearby gene coding for a K+/Cl- cotransporter, whose expression has also been related to schizophrenia. Here, we studied brain structure and function in healthy participants stratified by rs3918242 genotype using structural MRI (&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;N&lt;/span&gt; = 298), functional MRI during an N-back working memory task (&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;N&lt;/span&gt; = 554), and magnetoencephalography (MEG) during the same task (&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;N&lt;/span&gt; = 190). We found rs3918242 was associated with gray matter volume (GMV) in the insula and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex bilaterally, closely replicated in discovery and replication samples; and with inferior parietal lobule (IPL) GMV when the samples were meta-analytically combined. Additionally, using both fMRI and MEG, rs3918242 was associated with right IPL working memory-related activation, replicated in two cohorts and across imaging modalities. These convergent results provide further impetus for examinations of the relationship of &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;SLC12A5&lt;/span&gt; with brain structure and function in neuropsychiatric disease.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Biological Characteristics of Connection-Wise Resting-State Functional Connectivity Strength</title>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy342/5298363?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Functional connectivity is defined as the statistical dependency of neurophysiological activity between 2 separate brain areas. To investigate the biological characteristics of resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC)—and in particular the significance of connection-wise variation in time-series correlations—rsFC was compared with strychnine-based connectivity measured in the macaque. Strychnine neuronography is a historical technique that induces activity in cortical areas through means of local administration of the substance strychnine. Strychnine causes local disinhibition through GABA suppression and leads to subsequent activation of functional pathways. Multiple resting-state fMRI recordings were acquired in 4 macaques (examining in total 299 imaging runs) from which a group-averaged rsFC matrix was constructed. rsFC was observed to be higher (&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;P&lt;/span&gt; &amp;lt; 0.0001) between region-pairs with a strychnine-based connection as compared with region-pairs with no strychnine-based connection present. In particular, higher resting-state connectivity was observed in connections that were relatively stronger (weak &amp;lt; moderate &amp;lt; strong; &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;P&lt;/span&gt; &amp;lt; 0.01) and in connections that were bidirectional (&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;P&lt;/span&gt; &amp;lt; 0.0001) instead of unidirectional in strychnine-based connectivity. Our results imply that the level of correlation between brain areas as extracted from resting-state fMRI relates to the strength of underlying interregional functional pathways.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Spontaneous Brain Activity Predicts Task-Evoked Activity During Animate Versus Inanimate Touch</title>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy340/5298359?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;The spontaneous activity of the brain is characterized by an elaborate temporal structure with scale-free properties as indexed by the power law exponent (PLE). We test the hypothesis that spontaneous brain activity modulates task-evoked activity during interactions with animate versus inanimate stimuli. For this purpose, we developed a paradigm requiring participants to actively touch either animate (real hand) or inanimate (mannequin hand) stimuli. Behaviorally, participants perceived the animate target as closer in space, temporally more synchronous with their own self, and more personally relevant, compared with the inanimate. Neuronally, we observed a modulation of task-evoked activity by animate versus inanimate interactions in posterior insula, in medial prefrontal cortex, comprising anterior cingulate cortex, and in medial superior frontal gyrus. Among these regions, an increased functional connectivity was shown between posterior insula and perigenual anterior cingulate cortex (PACC) during animate compared with inanimate interactions and during resting state. Importantly, PLE during spontaneous brain activity in PACC correlated positively with PACC task-evoked activity during animate versus inanimate stimuli. In conclusion, we demonstrate that brain spontaneous activity in PACC can be related to the distinction between animate and inanimate stimuli and thus might be specifically tuned to align our brain with its animate environment.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Neural Coding of Contact Events in Somatosensory Cortex</title>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy337/5298364?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Manual interactions with objects require precise and rapid feedback about contact events. These tactile signals are integrated with motor plans throughout the neuraxis to achieve dexterous object manipulation. To better understand the role of somatosensory cortex in interactions with objects, we measured, using chronically implanted arrays of electrodes, the responses of populations of somatosensory neurons to skin indentations designed to simulate the initiation, maintenance, and termination of contact with an object. First, we find that the responses of somatosensory neurons to contact onset and offset dwarf their responses to maintenance of contact. Second, we show that these responses rapidly and reliably encode features of the simulated contact events—their timing, location, and strength—and can account for the animals’ performance in an amplitude discrimination task. Third, we demonstrate that the spatiotemporal dynamics of the population response in cortex mirror those of the population response in the nerves. We conclude that the responses of populations of somatosensory neurons are well suited to encode contact transients and are consistent with a role of somatosensory cortex in signaling transitions between task subgoals.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Open Access: Thalamocortical Afferents Innervate the Cortical Subplate much Earlier in Development in Primate than in Rodent</title>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy327/5298367?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;The current model, based on rodent data, proposes that thalamocortical afferents (TCA) innervate the subplate towards the end of cortical neurogenesis. This implies that the laminar identity of cortical neurons is specified by intrinsic instructions rather than information of thalamic origin. In order to determine whether this mechanism is conserved in the primates, we examined the growth of thalamocortical (TCA) and corticofugal afferents in early human and monkey fetal development. In the human, TCA, identified by secretagogin, calbindin, and ROBO1 immunoreactivity, were observed in the internal capsule of the ventral telencephalon as early as 7–7.5 PCW, crossing the pallial/subpallial boundary (PSB) by 8 PCW before the calretinin immunoreactive corticofugal fibers do. Furthermore, TCA were observed to be passing through the intermediate zone and innervating the presubplate of the dorsolateral cortex, and already by 10–12 PCW TCAs were occupying much of the cortex. Observations at equivalent stages in the marmoset confirmed that this pattern is conserved across primates. Therefore, our results demonstrate that in primates, TCAs innervate the cortical presubplate at earlier stages than previously demonstrated by acetylcholinesterase histochemistry, suggesting that pioneer thalamic afferents may contribute to early cortical circuitry that can participate in defining cortical neuron phenotypes.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Loss of EPAC2 results in altered synaptic composition of dendritic spines and excitatory and inhibitory balance</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/526772v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>EPAC2 is a guanine nucleotide exchange factor that regulates GTPase activity of the small GTPase Rap and Ras) and is highly enriched at synapses. Activation of EPAC2 has been shown to induce dendritic spine shrinkage and increase spine motility, effects that are necessary for synaptic plasticity. These morphological effects are dysregulated by rare mutations of EPAC2 associated with autism spectrum disorders. In addition, EPAC2 destabilizes synapses through the removal of synaptic GluA2/3-containing AMPA receptors. Previous work has shown that Epac2 knockout mice (Epac2-/-) display abnormal social interactions, as well as gross disorganization of the frontal cortex and abnormal spine motility in vivo. In this study we sought to further understand the cellular consequences of knocking out Epac2 on the development of neuronal and synaptic structure and organization of cortical neurons. Using primary cortical neurons generated from Epac2+/+ or Epac2-/- mice, we confirm that EPAC2 is required for cAMP-dependent spine shrinkage. Neurons from Epac2-/- mice also displayed increased synaptic expression of GluA2/3-containing AMPA receptors, as well as of the adhesion protein N-cadherin. Intriguingly, analysis of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic proteins revealed that loss of EPAC2 resulted in altered of expression of vesicular glutamate transporter 1 (VGluT1) and vesicular GABA transporter (VGAT), indicating a potential imbalance in excitatory/inhibitory inputs onto neurons. Finally, examination of cortical neurons located within the anterior cingulate cortex further revealed subtle deficits in the establishment of dendritic arborization in vivo. These data provide evidence that EPAC2 is required for the correct composition of synapses and that loss of this protein could result in an imbalance of excitatory and inhibitory synapses.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/526509v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>The spine apparatus (SA) is an endoplasmic reticulum-related organelle which is present in a subset of dendritic spines in cortical and pyramidal neurons. The synaptopodin protein localizes between the stacks of the spine apparatus and is essential for the formation of this unique organelle. Although several studies have demonstrated the significance of the SA and synaptopodin in calcium homeostasis and plasticity of dendritic spines, it is still unclear what factors contribute to its stability at the synapse and whether the SA is locally formed or it is actively delivered to the spines. In this study we show that synaptopodin clusters are stable at their locations. We found no evidence of active microtubule-based transport for synaptopodin. Instead new clusters were emerging in the spines, which we interpret as the SA being assembled on-site. Furthermore, using super-resolution microscopy we show a tight association of synaptopodin with actin filaments. We identify the actin-based motor proteins myosin V and VI as novel interaction partners of synaptopodin and demonstrate that myosin V is important for the formation and/or maintenance of the SA.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/525980v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>It is often assumed that Hebbian synaptic plasticity forms a cell assembly, a mutually interacting group of neurons that encodes memory. However, in recurrently connected networks with pure Hebbian plasticity, cell assemblies typically diverge or fade under ongoing changes of synaptic strength. Previously assumed mechanisms that stabilize cell assemblies do not robustly reproduce the experimentally reported unimodal and long-tailed distribution of synaptic strengths. Here, we show that augmenting Hebbian plasticity with experimentally observed intrinsic spine dynamics can stabilize cell assemblies and reproduce the distribution of synaptic strengths. Moreover, we posit that strong intrinsic spine dynamics impair learning performance. Our theory explains how excessively strong spine dynamics, experimentally observed in several animal models of autism spectrum disorder, impair learning associations in the brain.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Regionally diffuse muscle pain-hypersensitivity in humans during acute muscle pain</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/525832v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Background: We have previously shown that an intramuscular infusion of 5% hypertonic saline (HS) produces a painful response to normally innocuous stimuli applied to overlying and adjacent skin regions. In the current study, we explored whether a similar interaction could be observed between adjacent, contralateral and remote muscles. Indeed, widespread muscle pain-hypersensitivity is a hallmark of chronic pain conditions such as fibromyalgia. Methods: 5% HS was infused into the flexor carpi ulnaris (FCU) muscle to develop a stable baseline pain (n=30). In separate experiments, each of the three test locations (n=10 per site), the adjacent abductor digiti minimi (ADM), contralateral FCU and contralateral tibialis anterior (TA) (part 1-3, respectively), 50uL of 0.9% normal saline (NS) was infused (in triplicate) prior to, during and following HS-induced muscle pain. Results: Under control conditions (no background pain), the infusion of NS was imperceptible by all subjects. In the presence of HS-induced background pain (FCU), in part 1 the NS co-infusion into ADM increased overall pain by 17%. This was replicated in the contralateral FCU (part 2) with a 12% pain increase, and in the TA (part 3) with a 15% pain increase in response to the NS co-infusions. Notably, over 80% of subjects perceived the NS-induced increase in pain at the HS-infusion location (FCU) rather than the NS-infusion location (adjacent, contralateral and remote). Conclusions: Intramuscular infusion of HS results in pain-hypersensitivity to sub-perceptual stimulation of muscle afferents in a somatotopically unrestricted manner, indicating the involvement of a central (likely supra-spinal) mechanism.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/525824v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>There is a large variability in the recovery trajectory and outcome of first episode of psychosis [FEP] patients. To date, individuals outcome trajectories at early stage of illness and potential risk factors associated with a poor outcome trajectory are largely unknown. This study aims to apply three separate predictors (positive symptoms, negative symptoms, and soft neurological signs) to identify homogeneous function outcome trajectories in patients with FEP using objective data-driven methods, and to explore the potential risk /protective factors associated with each trajectory. Methods: A total of 369 first episode patients (93% antipsychotic naive) were included in the baseline assessments and followed-up at 4-8 weeks, 6 months, and 1 year. K means cluster modelling for longitudinal data (kml3d) was used to identify distinct, homogeneous clusters of functional outcome trajectories. Patients with at least 3 assessments were included in the trajectory analyses (N=129). The Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms (SANS), Scale for the Assessment of Positive Symptoms (SAPS), and Neurological examination abnormalities (NEA) were used as predictors against Global Assessment of Functioning Scale (GAF). Results: In each of the three predictor models, four distinct functional outcome trajectories emerged: Poor, Intermediate, Good and Catch-up. Individuals with male gender; ethnic minority status; low premorbid adjustment; low executive function/IQ, low SES, personality disorder, substance use history may be risk factors for poor recovery. Conclusions: Functioning recovery in individuals with FEP is heterogeneous, although distinct recovery profiles are apparent. Data-driven trajectory analysis can facilitate better characterization of individual longitudinal patterns of functioning recovery.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/525782v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>The medial thalamus (MThal), anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and striatum play important roles in affective-motivational pain processing and reward learning. Opioids affect both pain and reward through uncharacterized modulation of this circuitry. This study examined opioid actions on glutamate transmission between these brain regions in mouse. Mu-opioid receptor (MOR) agonists potently inhibited MThal inputs without affecting ACC inputs to individual striatal medium spiny neurons (MSNs). MOR activation also inhibited MThal inputs to the pyramidal neurons in the ACC. In contrast, delta-opioid receptor (DOR) agonists disinhibited ACC pyramidal neuron responses to MThal inputs by suppressing local feed-forward GABA signaling from parvalbumin-positive interneurons. As a result, DOR activation in the ACC facilitated poly-synaptic (thalamo-cortico-striatal) excitation of MSNs by MThal inputs. These results suggest that opioid effects on pain and reward may be shaped by the relative selectivity of opioid drugs to the specific circuit components.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Neuroinflammation and protein aggregation co-localize across the frontotemporal dementia spectrum.</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/525642v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>The clinical syndromes of frontotemporal dementia are clinically and neuropathologically heterogeneous, but processes such as neuroinflammation may be common across the disease spectrum. We investigated how neuroinflammation relates to the aggregation of Tau and TDP-43 in frontotemporal dementia, and to the heterogeneity of clinical disease. We used positron emission tomography in vivo with (a) [11C]PK-11195, a marker of activated microglia and a proxy index of neuroinflammation, and (b) [18F]AV-1451, a radioligand with increased binding to pathologically affected regions in tauopathies and diseases associated with TDP-43 protein aggregation, and which is used as a surrogate marker of non-{beta}-amyloid protein aggregation. We assessed 31 patients with frontotemporal dementia (10 with behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia, 11 with the semantic variant of primary progressive aphasia and 10 with the non-fluent variant of primary progressive aphasia), 28 of whom underwent both [18F]AV-1451 and [11C]PK-11195 PET, and matched controls (14 for [18F]AV-1451 and 15 for [11C]PK-11195). We used univariate region-of-interest analyses, and multivariate analysis of the distribution of binding that explicitly control for individual differences in ligand affinity for TDP-43 and different Tau isoforms. We found differences between patients and controls in frontotemporal regions for both neuroinflammation and protein aggregation, and a strong positive correlation between these two processes in all disease groups. Despite this regional co-localisation, the multivariate distribution of [11C]PK-11195 binding related better to clinical heterogeneity than did the distribution of [18F]AV-1451: distinct spatial modes of neuroinflammation were associated with different frontotemporal dementia syndromes and supported accurate group classification of participants. These in vivo findings indicate a close association between neuroinflammation and protein aggregation in frontotemporal dementia. The inflammatory component may be important in shaping the clinical and neuropathological patterns of the diverse clinical syndromes of frontotemporal dementia.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Fetal resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) has emerged as a critical new approach for characterizing brain network development before birth. Despite rapid and widespread growth of this approach, at present we lack neuroimaging analysis pipelines suited to address the unique challenges inherent in this data type.

Leveraging our library of more than 1,000 manually traced fetal fMRI images, we trained a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) that achieved excellent accuracy (&amp;gt;90%) across two held-out test sets from separate populations. Furthermore, we unite the auto-masking model with a full processing pipeline and report methodology, performance, and comparison to available alternatives. This work represents the first open source, automated, start-to-finish processing pipeline for fetal fMRI data.</content:encoded>

Methods: To assess the feasibility of automated pupillometry for the detection of command following, we enrolled 20 healthy volunteers and 48 patients with a wide range of neurological disorders, including 7 patients in the intensive care unit (ICU), who were asked to engage in mental arithmetic. Results: Fourteen of 20 (70%) healthy volunteers and 17 of 43 (39.5%) neurological patients, including 1 in the ICU, fulfilled prespecified criteria for command following by showing pupillary dilations during [≥] 4 of 5 arithmetic tasks. None of the 5 sedated and unconscious ICU patients passed this threshold. Conclusions: Automated pupillometry combined with mental arithmetic appears to be a promising paradigm for the detection of covert consciousness in people with brain injury. We plan to build on this study by focusing on non-communicating ICU patients in whom the level of consciousness is unknown. If some of these patients show reproducible pupillary dilation during mental arithmetic, this would suggest that the present paradigm can reveal conscious awareness in unresponsive patients in whom standard investigations have failed to detect signs of covert consciousness.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Learning in visual regions as support for the bias in future value-driven choice</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/523340v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Learning biases decision-making towards higher expected outcomes. Cognitive theories describe this through the tracking of value and outcome evaluations within striatum and prefrontal cortex. Decisions however first require processing of sensory input, and to-date, far less is known about the learning perception interplay. This fMRI study (N=43), relates visual BOLD responses to value-beliefs during choice, and, signed prediction errors after outcomes. To understand these relationships, which co-occurred in striatum, we next evaluated relevance with the prediction of future value-based choices, using a separate transfer-phase with learning already established. We decoded choice outcomes with a 69% accuracy with a machine learning algorithm that was given trial-by-trial BOLD from visual regions alongside traditional prefrontal, and striatal regions. Importantly, this decoding of value-driven choice outcomes again showed an important role for visual activity. These results raise the intriguing possibility that value learning in visual cortex is supportive for the striatal bias towards valued options.</content:encoded>

Genetic mutant analysis in the nematode &lt;em&gt;Caenorhabditis elegans&lt;/em&gt; has revealed common molecular programs that control neuronal identity. Neuron type-specific combinations of transcription factors, called terminal selectors, act as master regulatory factors to initiate and maintain terminal identity programs through direct regulation of neuron type-specific effector genes. We will provide here an update on recent studies that solidify the terminal selector concept in worms, flies and chordates. We will also describe how the terminal selector concept has been expanded by recent work in &lt;em&gt;C. elegans&lt;/em&gt; to explain neuronal subtype diversification and plasticity of neuronal identity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25416?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To investigate the initial termination rate of status epilepticus (SE) in a large observational study, and to explore associated variables.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data of adults treated for SE were collected prospectively in centers in Germany, Austria, and Switzerland, during 4.5 years. Incident episodes of 1,049 patients were analyzed using uni‐ and multivariate statistics to determine factors predicting cessation of SE within 1 hour (for generalized convulsive SE, GCSE) and 12 hours (for non‐GCSE) of initiating treatment.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Median age at SE onset was 70 years; most frequent etiologies were remote (32%) and acute (31%). GCSE was documented in 43%. Median latency between SE onset and first treatment was 30 minutes in GCSE and 150 minutes in non‐GCSE. The first intravenous compound was a benzodiazepine in 86% in GCSE, and 73% in non‐GCSE. Bolus doses of the first treatment step were lower than recommended by current guidelines in 76% of the GCSE patients and 78% of the non‐GCSE patients. In 319 GCSE patients (70%), SE was ongoing 1 hour after initiating treatment, and in 342 non‐GCSE patients (58%) 12 hours after initiating treatment. Multivariate Cox regression demonstrated that the use of benzodiazepines as first treatment step, and a higher cumulative dose of anticonvulsants within the first period of treatment were associated with shorter time to cessation of SE for both groups.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In clinical practice, treatment guidelines were not followed in a substantial proportion of patients. This under‐dosing correlated with lack of cessation of SE. Our data suggest that sufficiently dosed benzodiazepines should be used as first treatment step.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: In vivo metabotropic glutamate receptor type 5 abnormalities localize the epileptogenic zone in mesial temporal lobe epilepsy</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25404?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Surgical specimens from patients with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE) show abnormalities in tissue concentrations of metabotropic glutamate receptor type 5 (mGluR5). To clarify whether these abnormalities are specific to the epileptogenic zone (EZ), we characterized in vivo whole‐brain mGluR5 availability in MTLE patients using positron emission tomography (PET) and [&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;C]ABP688, a radioligand that binds specifically to the mGluR5 allosteric site.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thirty‐one unilateral MTLE patients and 30 healthy controls underwent [&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;C]ABP688 PET. We compared partial volume corrected [&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;C]ABP688 nondisplaceable binding potentials (BP&lt;sub&gt;ND&lt;/sub&gt;) between groups using region‐of‐interest and whole‐brain voxelwise analyses. [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET was acquired in 15 patients, for whom we calculated asymmetry indices of [&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;C]ABP688 BP&lt;sub&gt;ND&lt;/sub&gt; and [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]FDG uptake to compare lateralization and localization differences.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;C]ABP688 BP&lt;sub&gt;ND&lt;/sub&gt; was focally reduced in the epileptogenic hippocampal head and amygdala (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001). Patients with hippocampal atrophy showed more extensive abnormalities, including the ipsilateral temporal neocortex (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.006). [&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;C]ABP688 BP&lt;sub&gt;ND&lt;/sub&gt; showed interhemispheric differences of higher magnitude and discriminated the epileptogenic structures more accurately when compared to [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]FDG uptake, which showed more widespread hypometabolism. Among 23 of 25 operated patients with &amp;gt;1 year of follow‐up, 13 were seizure‐free (Engel Ia) and showed significantly lower [&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;C]ABP688 BP&lt;sub&gt;ND&lt;/sub&gt; in the ipsilateral entorhinal cortex.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;C]ABP688 PET provides a focal biomarker for the EZ in MTLE with higher spatial accuracy compared to [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]FDG PET. Focally reduced mGluR5 availability in the EZ might reflect receptor internalization or conformational changes in response to excessive extracellular glutamate, supporting a potential role for mGluR5 as therapeutic target in human MTLE.

	<content:encoded>Defining a complete set of cell types within the cortex requires reconciling disparate results achieved through diverging methodologies. To address this correspondence problem, multiple methodologies must be applied to the same cells in multiple single-cell experiments.

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Modular structure of human olfactory receptor codes reflects the bases of odor perception</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/525287v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>The circuits of olfactory signaling are reminiscent of complex computational devices. The olfactory receptor code, which represents the responses of receptors elicited by olfactory stimuli, is effectively an input code for the neural computation of odor sensing. Here, analyzing a recent dataset of the responses of human olfactory receptors (ORs) to odorants, we show that the space of human olfactory receptor codes is partitioned into a modular structure where groups of receptors are &quot;labeled&quot; for key olfactory features. The existence of such independent and sizable receptor groups implies a significant dimensional reduction in the space of human odor perception. Our data-driven statistical analysis of receptor codes leads to a valuable discovery that human olfaction works by hybridizing both the combinatorial coding and labeled line strategies, even at the early stage of signal processing.</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: OpenCASA: A new open-source and scalable tool for sperm quality analysis</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/26i5OktndI4/article</link>

In the field of assisted reproductive techniques (ART), computer-assisted sperm analysis (CASA) systems have proved their utility and potential for assessing sperm quality, improving the prediction of the fertility potential of a seminal dose. Although most laboratories and scientific centers use commercial systems, in the recent years certain free and open-source alternatives have emerged that can reduce the costs that research groups have to face. However, these open-source alternatives cannot analyze sperm kinetic responses to different stimuli, such as chemotaxis, thermotaxis or rheotaxis. In addition, the programs released to date have not usually been designed to encourage the scalability and the continuity of software development. We have developed an open-source CASA software, called OpenCASA, which allows users to study three classical sperm quality parameters: motility, morphodmetry and membrane integrity (viability) and offers the possibility of analyzing the guided movement response of spermatozoa to different stimuli (useful for chemotaxis, thermotaxis or rheotaxis studies) or different motile cells such as bacteria, using a single software. This software has been released in a Version Control System at Github. This platform will allow researchers not only to download the software but also to be involved in and contribute to further developments. Additionally, a Google group has been created to allow the research community to interact and discuss OpenCASA. For validation of the OpenCASA software, we analysed different simulated sperm populations (for chemotaxis module) and evaluated 36 ejaculates obtained from 12 fertile rams using other sperm analysis systems (for motility, membrane integrity and morphology modules). The results were compared with those obtained by Open-CASA using the Pearson’s correlation and Bland-Altman tests, obtaining a high level of correlation in all parameters and a good agreement between the different used methods and the OpenCASA. With this work, we propose an open-source project oriented to the development of a new software application for sperm quality analysis. This proposed software will use a minimally centralized infrastructure to allow the continued development of its modules by the research community.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/26i5OktndI4&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: A Manifold Regularized Multi-Task Learning Model for IQ Prediction from Multiple fMRI Paradigms. (arXiv:1901.05913v1 [q-bio.QM])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1901.05913</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Multi-modal brain functional connectivity (FC) data have shown great
potential for providing insights into individual variations in behavioral and
cognitive traits. The joint learning of multi-modal imaging data can utilize
the intrinsic association, and thus can boost the learning performance.
Although several multi-task based learning models have already been proposed by
viewing the feature learning on each modality as one task, most of them ignore
the geometric structure information inherent in the modalities, which may play
an important role in extracting discriminative features. In this paper, we
propose a new manifold regularized multi-task learning model by simultaneously
considering between-subject and between-modality relationships. Besides
employing a group-sparsity regularizer to jointly select a few common features
across multiple tasks (modalities), we design a novel manifold regularizer to
preserve the structure information both within and between modalities in our
model. This will make our model more adaptive for realistic data analysis. Our
model is then validated on the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort dataset,
where we regard our modalities as functional MRI (fMRI) data collected under
two paradigms. Specifically, we conduct experimental studies on fMRI based FC
network data in two task conditions for intelligence quotient (IQ) prediction.
The results demonstrate that our proposed model can not only achieve improved
prediction performance, but also yield a set of IQ-relevant biomarkers.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1901.04908</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The current dominant visual processing paradigm in both human and machine
research is the feedforward, layered hierarchy of neural-like processing
elements. Within this paradigm, visual saliency is seen by many to have a
specific role, namely that of early selection. Early selection is thought to
enable very fast visual performance by limiting processing to only the most
relevant candidate portions of an image. Though this strategy has indeed led to
improved processing time efficiency in machine algorithms, at least one set of
critical tests of this idea has never been performed with respect to the role
of early selection in human vision. How would the best of the current saliency
models perform on the stimuli used by experimentalists who first provided
evidence for this visual processing paradigm? Would the algorithms really
provide correct candidate sub-images to enable fast categorization on those
same images? Here, we report on a new series of tests of these questions whose
results suggest that it is quite unlikely that such an early selection process
has any role in human rapid visual categorization.

	<title>eLife: latest articles: Identification of a bilirubin receptor that may mediate a component of cholestatic itch</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/44116</link>
	<content:encoded>Various pathologic conditions result in jaundice, a yellowing of the skin due to a buildup of bilirubin. Patients with jaundice commonly report experiencing an intense non-histaminergic itch. Despite this association, the pruritogenic capacity of bilirubin itself has not been explored, and no bilirubin receptor has been identified. Here, we demonstrate that pathophysiologic levels of bilirubin excite peripheral itch sensory neurons and elicit pruritus through MRGPRs, a family of G-protein coupled receptors expressed in primary sensory neurons. Bilirubin binds and activates two MRGPRs, mouse MRGPRA1 and human MRGPRX4. In two mouse models of pathologic hyperbilirubinemia, we show that genetic deletion of either &lt;i&gt;Mrgpra1&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;Blvra&lt;/i&gt;, the gene that encodes the bilirubin-producing enzyme, attenuates itch. Similarly, plasma isolated from hyperbilirubinemic patients evoked itch in wild-type animals but not &lt;i&gt;Mrgpra1&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; animals. Removing bilirubin decreased the pruritogenic capacity of patient plasma. Based on these data, targeting MRGPRs is a promising strategy for alleviating jaundice-associated itch.</content:encoded>

Complex eukaryotic promoters normally contain multiple cis-regulatory sequences for different transcription factors (TFs). The binding patterns of the TFs to these sites, as well as the way the TFs interact with each other and with the RNA polymerase (RNAp), lead to combinatorial problems rarely understood in detail, especially under varying epigenetic conditions. The aim of this paper is to build a model describing how the main regulatory cluster of the olfactory receptor Or59b drives transcription of this gene in &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt;. The cluster-driven expression of this gene is represented as the equilibrium probability of RNAp being bound to the promoter region, using a statistical thermodynamic approach. The RNAp equilibrium probability is computed in terms of the occupancy probabilities of the single TFs of the cluster to the corresponding binding sites, and of the interaction rules among TFs and RNAp, using experimental data of Or59b expression to tune the model parameters. The model reproduces correctly the changes in RNAp binding probability induced by various mutation of specific sites and epigenetic modifications. Some of its predictions have also been validated in novel experiments.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/OzMB2Hh3nOo&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Modeling cell line-specific recruitment of signaling proteins to the insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/FF8MbA9TfH8/article</link>

Receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) typically contain multiple autophosphorylation sites in their cytoplasmic domains. Once activated, these autophosphorylation sites can recruit downstream signaling proteins containing Src homology 2 (SH2) and phosphotyrosine-binding (PTB) domains, which recognize phosphotyrosine-containing short linear motifs (SLiMs). These domains and SLiMs have polyspecific or promiscuous binding activities. Thus, multiple signaling proteins may compete for binding to a common SLiM and vice versa. To investigate the effects of competition on RTK signaling, we used a rule-based modeling approach to develop and analyze models for ligand-induced recruitment of SH2/PTB domain-containing proteins to autophosphorylation sites in the insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) receptor (IGF1R). Models were parameterized using published datasets reporting protein copy numbers and site-specific binding affinities. Simulations were facilitated by a novel application of model restructuration, to reduce redundancy in rule-derived equations. We compare predictions obtained via numerical simulation of the model to those obtained through simple prediction methods, such as through an analytical approximation, or ranking by copy number and/or K&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt; value, and find that the simple methods are unable to recapitulate the predictions of numerical simulations. We created 45 cell line-specific models that demonstrate how early events in IGF1R signaling depend on the protein abundance profile of a cell. Simulations, facilitated by model restructuration, identified pairs of IGF1R binding partners that are recruited in anti-correlated and correlated fashions, despite no inclusion of cooperativity in our models. This work shows that the outcome of competition depends on the physicochemical parameters that characterize pairwise interactions, as well as network properties, including network connectivity and the relative abundances of competitors.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/FF8MbA9TfH8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: STRFs in primary auditory cortex emerge from masking-based statistics of natural sounds</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/9z31h2VhhpY/article</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Abdul-Saboor Sheikh, Nicol S. Harper, Jakob Drefs, Yosef Singer, Zhenwen Dai, Richard E. Turner, Jörg Lücke&lt;/p&gt;

We investigate how the neural processing in auditory cortex is shaped by the statistics of natural sounds. Hypothesising that auditory cortex (A1) represents the structural primitives out of which sounds are composed, we employ a statistical model to extract such components. The input to the model are cochleagrams which approximate the non-linear transformations a sound undergoes from the outer ear, through the cochlea to the auditory nerve. Cochleagram components do not superimpose linearly, but rather according to a rule which can be approximated using the max function. This is a consequence of the compression inherent in the cochleagram and the sparsity of natural sounds. Furthermore, cochleagrams do not have negative values. Cochleagrams are therefore not matched well by the assumptions of standard linear approaches such as sparse coding or ICA. We therefore consider a new encoding approach for natural sounds, which combines a model of early auditory processing with maximal causes analysis (MCA), a sparse coding model which captures both the non-linear combination rule and non-negativity of the data. An efficient truncated EM algorithm is used to fit the MCA model to cochleagram data. We characterize the generative fields (GFs) inferred by MCA with respect to &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; neural responses in A1 by applying reverse correlation to estimate spectro-temporal receptive fields (STRFs) implied by the learned GFs. Despite the GFs being non-negative, the STRF estimates are found to contain both positive and negative subfields, where the negative subfields can be attributed to explaining away effects as captured by the applied inference method. A direct comparison with ferret A1 shows many similar forms, and the spectral and temporal modulation tuning of both ferret and model STRFs show similar ranges over the population. In summary, our model represents an alternative to linear approaches for biological auditory encoding while it captures salient data properties and links inhibitory subfields to explaining away effects.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/9z31h2VhhpY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Sequential infection experiments for quantifying innate and adaptive immunity during influenza infection</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/w7DAFCOVv-I/article</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Ada W. C. Yan, Sophie G. Zaloumis, Julie A. Simpson, James M. McCaw&lt;/p&gt;

Laboratory models are often used to understand the interaction of related pathogens via host immunity. For example, recent experiments where ferrets were exposed to two influenza strains within a short period of time have shown how the effects of cross-immunity vary with the time between exposures and the specific strains used. On the other hand, studies of the workings of different arms of the immune response, and their relative importance, typically use experiments involving a single infection. However, inferring the relative importance of different immune components from this type of data is challenging. Using simulations and mathematical modelling, here we investigate whether the sequential infection experiment design can be used not only to determine immune components contributing to cross-protection, but also to gain insight into the immune response during a single infection. We show that virological data from sequential infection experiments can be used to accurately extract the timing and extent of cross-protection. Moreover, the broad immune components responsible for such cross-protection can be determined. Such data can also be used to infer the timing and strength of some immune components in controlling a primary infection, even in the absence of serological data. By contrast, single infection data cannot be used to reliably recover this information. Hence, sequential infection data enhances our understanding of the mechanisms underlying the control and resolution of infection, and generates new insight into how previous exposure influences the time course of a subsequent infection.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/w7DAFCOVv-I&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Some mammalian lineages, such as primates, exhibit exceptionally large cortices relative to the amount of sensory inputs from the dorsal thalamus, and this expansion is associated with a larger number of distinct cortical areas, composing a larger proportion of the cortical sheet. We propose a link between the organization of the neocortex and its expansion relative to the size of the dorsal thalamus, based on a combination of work in comparative neuroanatomy and experimental research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded>

preferences pose serious challenges to {\it subjective expected utility theory}

decisions under uncertainty which satisfactorily copes with the Ellsberg
paradox and other puzzles of SEUT. We apply here the quantum-theoretic
framework to the {\it Ellsberg two-urn example}, showing that the paradox can
be explained by assuming a state change of the conceptual entity that is the
object of the decision ({\it decision-making}, or {\it DM}, {\it entity}) and
representing subjective probabilities by quantum probabilities. We also model
the empirical data we collected in a DM test on human participants within the
theoretic framework above. The obtained results are relevant, as they provide a
line to model real life, e.g., financial and medical, decisions that show the
same empirical patterns as the two-urn experiment.

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: A Proposed Mechanism for Spontaneous Transitions between Interictal and Ictal Activity</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/3/557?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Epileptic networks are characterized by two outputs: brief interictal spikes and rarer, more prolonged seizures. Although either output state is readily modeled &lt;i&gt;in silico&lt;/i&gt; and induced experimentally, the transition mechanisms are unknown, in part because no models exhibit both output states spontaneously. &lt;i&gt;In silico&lt;/i&gt; small-world neural networks were built using single-compartment neurons whose physiological parameters were derived from dual whole-cell recordings of pyramidal cells in organotypic hippocampal slice cultures that were generating spontaneous seizure-like activity. &lt;i&gt;In silico&lt;/i&gt;, neurons were connected by abundant local synapses and rare long-distance synapses. Activity-dependent synaptic depression and gradual recovery delimited synchronous activity. Full synaptic recovery engendered interictal population spikes that spread via long-distance synapses. When synaptic recovery was incomplete, postsynaptic neurons required coincident activation of multiple presynaptic terminals to reach firing threshold. Only local connections were sufficiently dense to spread activity under these conditions. This coalesced network activity into traveling waves whose velocity varied with synaptic recovery. Seizures were comprised of sustained traveling waves that were similar to those recorded during experimental and human neocortical seizures. Sustained traveling waves occurred only when wave velocity, network dimensions, and the rate of synaptic recovery enabled wave reentry into previously depressed areas at precisely ictogenic levels of synaptic recovery. Wide-field, cellular-resolution GCamP7b calcium imaging demonstrated similar initial patterns of activation in the hippocampus, although the anatomical distribution of traveling waves of synaptic activation was altered by the pattern of synaptic connectivity in the organotypic hippocampal cultures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; When computerized distributed neural network models are required to generate both features of epileptic networks (i.e., spontaneous interictal population spikes and seizures), the network structure is substantially constrained. These constraints provide important new hypotheses regarding the nature of epileptic networks and mechanisms of seizure onset.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Tau Accumulation in Clinically Normal Older Adults Is Associated with Hippocampal Hyperactivity</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/3/548?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Animal studies demonstrate that hyperactive neurons facilitate early accumulation and spread of tau and amyloid-β proteins in the pathological cascade of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Human neuroimaging studies have linked hippocampal hyperactivity to amyloid-β accumulation, apolipoprotein 4 (APOE4) and clinical progression from prodromal AD to clinical dementia. The relationship between hippocampal hyperactivity and early AD molecular pathology (amyloid-β and tau accumulation) before clinical symptoms remains to be elucidated. Here, we studied 120 clinically normal older humans (80 females/40 males) enrolled in the Harvard Aging Brain Study. We measured functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) activity during successful memory encoding and amyloid-β accumulation with PiB-positron emission tomography imaging. Additionally, we measured tau accumulation using AV1451 PET imaging in a subset of 87 participants. In this subset, we found that inferior temporal tau accumulation was associated with increased fMRI activity in the hippocampus, but showed no clear association with amyloid. Together, the findings support a hypothetical model of the evolution of preclinical AD that place hippocampal hyperactivity concurrent with spread of tau pathology to neocortical regions before clinical impairment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The circumstances under which the hippocampus becomes hyperactive in preclinical stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD) have thus far remained elusive. Recent advances in positron emission tomography (PET) tracers now enable &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; characterization of amyloid-β and tau accumulation. Here, we combine amyloid and tau PET with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to examine the association between Alzheimer's disease pathology and memory-related brain activity in clinically normal older adults. We found an association between increased hippocampal activity and tau accumulation in the inferior temporal cortex. These data suggest that the pathogenesis of hippocampal hyperactivity occurs concurrent with the spread of tau pathology from the entorhinal cortex to the neocortex, before the clinical manifestations of Alzheimer's disease.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Dopamine D2/3 Binding Potential Modulates Neural Signatures of Working Memory in a Load-Dependent Fashion</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/3/537?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Dopamine (DA) modulates corticostriatal connections. Studies in which imaging of the DA system is integrated with functional imaging during cognitive performance have yielded mixed findings. Some work has shown a link between striatal DA (measured by PET) and fMRI activations, whereas others have failed to observe such a relationship. One possible reason for these discrepant findings is differences in task demands, such that a more demanding task with greater prefrontal activations may yield a stronger association with DA. Moreover, a potential DA–BOLD association may be modulated by task performance. We studied 155 (104 normal-performing and 51 low-performing) healthy older adults (43% females) who underwent fMRI scanning while performing a working memory (WM) &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;-back task along with DA D&lt;sub&gt;2/3&lt;/sub&gt; PET assessment using [&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;C]raclopride. Using multivariate partial-least-squares analysis, we observed a significant pattern revealing positive associations of striatal as well as extrastriatal DA D&lt;sub&gt;2/3&lt;/sub&gt; receptors to BOLD response in the thalamo–striatal–cortical circuit, which supports WM functioning. Critically, the DA–BOLD association in normal-performing, but not low-performing, individuals was expressed in a load-dependent fashion, with stronger associations during 3-back than 1-/2-back conditions. Moreover, normal-performing adults expressing upregulated BOLD in response to increasing task demands showed a stronger DA–BOLD association during 3-back, whereas low-performing individuals expressed a stronger association during 2-back conditions. This pattern suggests a nonlinear DA–BOLD performance association, with the strongest link at the maximum capacity level. Together, our results suggest that DA may have a stronger impact on functional brain responses during more demanding cognitive tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Dopamine (DA) is a major neuromodulator in the CNS and plays a key role in several cognitive processes via modulating the blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signal. Some studies have shown a link between DA and BOLD, whereas others have failed to observe such a relationship. A possible reason for the discrepancy is differences in task demands, such that a more demanding task with greater prefrontal activations may yield a stronger association with DA. We examined the relationship of DA to BOLD response during working memory under three load conditions and found that the DA–BOLD association is expressed in a load-dependent fashion. These findings may help explain the disproportionate impairment evident in more effortful cognitive tasks in normal aging and in those suffering dopamine-dependent neurodegenerative diseases (e.g., Parkinson's disease).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Binding of small molecules to proteins often involves large conformational changes in the latter, which open up pathways to the binding site. Observing and pinpointing these rare events in large scale, all-atom, computations of specific protein-ligand complexes, is expensive and to a great extent serendipitous. Further, relevant collective variables which characterise specific binding or un-binding scenarios are still difficult to identify despite the large body of work on the subject. Here, we show that possible primary and secondary binding pathways can be discovered from short simulations of the apo-protein without waiting for an actual binding event to occur. We use a projection formalism, introduced earlier to study deformation in solids, to analyse local atomic displacements into two mutually orthogonal subspaces—those which are “affine” i.e. expressible as a homogeneous deformation of the native structure, and those which are not. The susceptibility to non-affine displacements among the various residues in the apo- protein is then shown to correlate with typical binding pathways and sites crucial for allosteric modifications. We validate our observation with all-atom computations of three proteins, T4-Lysozyme, Src kinase and Cytochrome P450.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/9DUt8CyJ4OU&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Modern optical imaging experiments not only measure single-cell and single-molecule dynamics with high precision, but they can also perturb the cellular environment in myriad controlled and novel settings. Techniques, such as single-molecule fluorescence in-situ hybridization, microfluidics, and optogenetics, have opened the door to a large number of potential experiments, which begs the question of how to choose the best possible experiment. The Fisher information matrix (FIM) estimates how well potential experiments will constrain model parameters and can be used to design optimal experiments. Here, we introduce the finite state projection (FSP) based FIM, which uses the formalism of the chemical master equation to derive and compute the FIM. The FSP-FIM makes no assumptions about the distribution shapes of single-cell data, and it does not require precise measurements of higher order moments of such distributions. We validate the FSP-FIM against well-known Fisher information results for the simple case of constitutive gene expression. We then use numerical simulations to demonstrate the use of the FSP-FIM to optimize the timing of single-cell experiments with more complex, non-Gaussian fluctuations. We validate optimal simulated experiments determined using the FSP-FIM with Monte-Carlo approaches and contrast these to experiment designs chosen by traditional analyses that assume Gaussian fluctuations or use the central limit theorem. By systematically designing experiments to use all of the measurable fluctuations, our method enables a key step to improve co-design of experiments and quantitative models.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/quvKzmVx9vA&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0415-18.2019v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;The neuropeptide arginine-vasopressin (AVP) has long been implicated in the regulation of social behavior and communication, but precisely which AVP cell groups are involved is largely unknown. To address if the sexually dimorphic AVP cell group in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) is important for social communication, we deleted BNST AVP cells by viral delivery of a Cre-dependent caspase-3 cell-death construct in AVP-iCre positive mice using AVP-iCre negative littermate as controls, and assessed social, sexual, aggressive and anxiety-related behaviors. In males, lesioning BNST AVP cells reduced social investigation of other males and increased urine marking in the presence of a live female, without altering ultrasonic vocalizations, resident-intruder aggression, copulatory behavior, anxiety, or investigation of females or their odor cues. In females, which have significantly fewer AVP cells in the BNST, these injections influenced copulatory behavior but otherwise had minimal effects on social behavior and communication, indicating that these cells contribute to sex differences in social behavioral function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Despite over thirty years of indirect evidence implicating sexually-dimorphic arginine vasopressin (AVP) cells within the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) in the control of social and anxiety-related behavior in mammals, the function of these cells has never been directly tested. Here, we show that deletion of these cells in male, but not female, mice reduce investigation of same-sex conspecifics and alter social communication without changing aggressive and anxiety-related behaviors. Although AVP cell deletion in the BNST did not alter male copulatory behavior, it impaired female sexual behavior. These results indicate that sexually-dimorphic AVP cells in the BNST drive specific aspects of sexually-differentiated social investigation, behavior, and communication.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

This sister group relationship gives them an informative phylogenetic position for understanding the fascinating morphological and molecular cell type diversity of bilaterian nervous systems. Moreover, cnidarians display novel features such as endodermal neurogenesis and independently evolved centralizations, which provide a platform for understanding the evolution of nervous system innovations. In recent years, the application of modern genomic tools has significantly advanced our understanding of cnidarian nervous system structure and function. For example, transgenic reporter lines and gene knockdown experiments in several cnidarian species reveal a significant degree of conservation in the neurogenesis gene regulatory program, while single cell RNA sequencing projects are providing a much deeper understanding of cnidarian neural cell type diversity. At the level of neural function, the physiological properties of ion channels have been described and calcium imaging of the nervous system in whole animals has allowed for the identification of neural circuits underlying specific behaviours. Cnidarians have arrived in the modern era of molecular neurobiology and are primed to provide exciting new insights into the early evolution of nervous systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: How to correctly quantify neuronal phase-response curves from noisy recordings. (arXiv:1901.04399v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1901.04399</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;At the level of individual neurons, various coding properties can be inferred
from the input-output relationship of a cell. For small inputs, this relation
is captured by the phase-response curve (PRC), which measures the effect of a
small perturbation on the timing of the subsequent spike. Experimentally,
however, an accurate experimental estimation of PRCs is challenging. Despite
elaborate measurement efforts, experimental PRC estimates often cannot be
related to those from modeling studies. In particular, experimental PRCs rarely
resemble the generic PRC expected close to spike initiation, which is
indicative of the underlying spike-onset bifurcation. Here, we show for
conductance-based model neurons that the correspondence between theoretical and
measured phase-response curve is lost when the stimuli used for the estimation
are too large. In this case, the derived phase-response curve is distorted
beyond recognition and takes on a generic shape that reflects the measurement
protocol, but not the real neuronal dynamics. We discuss how to identify
appropriate stimulus strengths for perturbation and noise-stimulation methods,
which permit to estimate PRCs that reliably reflect the spike-onset bifurcation
-- a task that is particularly difficult if a lower bound for the stimulus
amplitude is dictated by prominent intrinsic neuronal noise.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1901.04094</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Neural decoding may be formulated as dynamic state estimation (filtering)
based on point process observations, a generally intractable problem. Numerical
sampling techniques are often practically useful for the decoding of real
neural data. However, they are less useful as theoretical tools for modeling
and understanding sensory neural systems, since they lead to limited conceptual
insight about optimal encoding and decoding strategies. We consider sensory
neural populations characterized by a distribution over neuron parameters. We
develop an analytically tractable Bayesian approximation to optimal filtering
based on the observation of spiking activity, that greatly facilitates the
analysis of optimal encoding in situations deviating from common assumptions of
uniform coding. Continuous distributions are used to approximate large
populations with few parameters, resulting in a filter whose complexity does
not grow with the population size, and allowing optimization of population
parameters rather than individual tuning functions. Numerical comparison with
particle filtering demonstrates the quality of the approximation. The analytic
framework leads to insights which are difficult to obtain from numerical
algorithms, and is consistent with biological observations about the
distribution of sensory cells' preferred stimuli.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1901.03990</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Human listeners need to permanently interact with their three-dimensional
(3-D) environment. To this end, they require efficient perceptual mechanisms to
form a sufficiently accurate 3-D auditory space. In this chapter, we discuss
the formation of the 3-D auditory space from various perspectives. The aim is
to show the link between cognition, acoustics, neurophysiology, and
psychophysics, when it comes to spatial hearing. First, we present recent
cognitive concepts for creating internal models of the complex auditory
environment. Second, we describe the acoustic signals available at our ears and
discuss the spatial information they convey. Third, we look into
neurophysiology, seeking for the neural substrates of the 3-D auditory space.
Finally, we elaborate on psychophysical spatial tasks and percepts that are
possible just because of the formation of the auditory space.

Metabolomics is a powerful approach for discovering biomarkers and for characterizing the biochemical consequences of genetic variation. While untargeted metabolite profiling can measure thousands of signals in a single experiment, many biologically meaningful signals cannot be readily identified as known metabolites nor compared across datasets, making it difficult to infer biology and to conduct well-powered meta-analyses across studies. To overcome these challenges, we developed a suite of computational methods, PAIRUP-MS, to match metabolite signals across mass spectrometry-based profiling datasets and to generate metabolic pathway annotations for these signals. To pair up signals measured in different datasets, where retention times (RT) are often not comparable or even available, we implemented an imputation-based approach that only requires mass-to-charge ratios (m/z). As validation, we treated each shared known metabolite as an unmatched signal and showed that PAIRUP-MS correctly matched 70–88% of these metabolites from among thousands of signals, equaling or outperforming a standard m/z- and RT-based approach. We performed further validation using genetic data: the most stringent set of matched signals and shared knowns showed comparable consistency of genetic associations across datasets. Next, we developed a pathway reconstitution method to annotate unknown signals using curated metabolic pathways containing known metabolites. We performed genetic validation for the generated annotations, showing that annotated signals associated with gene variants were more likely to be enriched for pathways functionally related to the genes compared to random expectation. Finally, we applied PAIRUP-MS to study associations between metabolites and genetic variants or body mass index (BMI) across multiple datasets, identifying up to ~6 times more significant signals and many more BMI-associated pathways compared to the standard practice of only analyzing known metabolites. These results demonstrate that PAIRUP-MS enables analysis of unknown signals in a robust, biologically meaningful manner and provides a path to more comprehensive, well-powered studies of untargeted metabolomics data.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/HsKjvnq3E10&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

The mental contents of perception and imagery are thought to be encoded in hierarchical representations in the brain, but previous attempts to visualize perceptual contents have failed to capitalize on multiple levels of the hierarchy, leaving it challenging to reconstruct internal imagery. Recent work showed that visual cortical activity measured by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) can be decoded (translated) into the hierarchical features of a pre-trained deep neural network (DNN) for the same input image, providing a way to make use of the information from hierarchical visual features. Here, we present a novel image reconstruction method, in which the pixel values of an image are optimized to make its DNN features similar to those decoded from human brain activity at multiple layers. We found that our method was able to reliably produce reconstructions that resembled the viewed natural images. A natural image prior introduced by a deep generator neural network effectively rendered semantically meaningful details to the reconstructions. Human judgment of the reconstructions supported the effectiveness of combining multiple DNN layers to enhance the visual quality of generated images. While our model was solely trained with natural images, it successfully generalized to artificial shapes, indicating that our model was not simply matching to exemplars. The same analysis applied to mental imagery demonstrated rudimentary reconstructions of the subjective content. Our results suggest that our method can effectively combine hierarchical neural representations to reconstruct perceptual and subjective images, providing a new window into the internal contents of the brain.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/egFhcN5PfJ8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>RSS PAP: Postmeal optogenetic inhibition of dorsal or ventral hippocampal pyramidal neurons increases future intake</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0457-18.2018v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Memory of a recently eaten meal can serve as a powerful mechanism for controlling future eating behavior because it provides a record of intake that likely outlasts most physiological signals generated by the meal. In support, impairing the encoding of a meal in humans increases the amount ingested at the next eating episode. However, the brain regions that mediate the inhibitory effects of memory on future intake are unknown. In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that dorsal (dHC) and ventral hippocampal (vHC) glutamatergic pyramidal neurons play a critical role in the inhibition of energy intake during the postprandial period by optogenetically inhibiting these neurons at specific times relative to a meal. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were given viral vectors containing CaMKIIα-eArchT3.0-eYFP or CaMKIIα-GFP and fiber optic probes into dHC of one hemisphere and vHC of the other. Compared to intake on a day in which illumination was not given, inhibition of dHC or vHC glutamatergic neurons after the end of a chow, sucrose, or saccharin meal accelerated the onset of the next meal and increased the amount consumed during that next meal when the neurons were no longer inhibited. Inhibition given during a meal did not affect the amount consumed during that meal or the next one but did hasten meal initiation. These data show that dHC and vHC glutamatergic neuronal activity during the postprandial period is critical for limiting subsequent ingestion and suggest that these neurons inhibit future intake by consolidating the memory of the preceding meal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance statement&lt;/b&gt; Memory of a recently eaten meal provides a lasting record of recent intake and limits subsequent ingestion; however, the neural mechanisms underlying these mnemonic effects remain unknown. Here, we show that optogenetic inhibition of dorsal or ventral hippocampal pyramidal neurons induced after the end of a sucrose, chow or saccharin meal, when the memory of the meal would be undergoing consolidation, accelerated the initiation of the next meal and, importantly, increased the amount consumed during that next meal when the neurons were no longer inhibited. These findings show that principal hippocampal neurons limit future intake and suggest that they do so by consolidating the memory of the preceding meal.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Cell-Type-Specific Changes in Intrinsic Excitability in the Subiculum following Learning and Exposure to Novel Environmental Contexts</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/5/6/ENEURO.0484-18.2018?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;The subiculum is the main target of the hippocampal region CA1 and is the principle output region of the hippocampus. The subiculum is critical to learning and memory, although it has been relatively understudied. There are two functional types of principle neurons within the subiculum: regular spiking (RS) and burst spiking (BS) neurons. To determine whether these cell types are differentially modified by learning-related experience, we performed whole-cell patch clamp recordings from male mouse brain slices following contextual fear conditioning (FC) and memory retrieval relative to a number of control behavioral paradigms. RS cells, but not BS cells, displayed a greater degree of experience-related plasticity in intrinsic excitability measures [afterhyperpolarization (AHP), input resistance (R&lt;sub&gt;input&lt;/sub&gt;), current required to elicit a spike], with fear conditioned animals having generally more excitable RS cells compared to naïve controls. Furthermore, we found that the relative proportion of RS to BS neurons is modified by the type of exposure, with the lowest proportion of BS subicular cells occurring in animals that underwent contextual FC followed by a retrieval test. These studies indicate that pyramidal neurons in the subiculum undergo experience- and learning-related plasticity in intrinsic properties in a cell-type-specific manner. As BS and RS cells are thought to convey distinct types of information, this plasticity may be particularly important in encoding, consolidating, and recalling spatial information by modulating information flow from the hippocampus to cortical regions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: PINK1 Interacts with VCP/p97 and Activates PKA to Promote NSFL1C/p47 Phosphorylation and Dendritic Arborization in Neurons</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/5/6/ENEURO.0466-18.2018?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;While PTEN-induced kinase 1 (PINK1) is well characterized for its role in mitochondrial homeostasis, much less is known concerning its ability to prevent synaptodendritic degeneration. Using unbiased proteomic methods, we identified valosin-containing protein (VCP) as a major PINK1-interacting protein. RNAi studies demonstrate that both VCP and its cofactor NSFL1C/p47 are necessary for the ability of PINK1 to increase dendritic complexity. Moreover, PINK1 regulates phosphorylation of p47, but not the VCP co-factor UFD1. Although neither VCP nor p47 interact directly with PKA, we found that PINK1 binds and phosphorylates the catalytic subunit of PKA at T197 [PKA&lt;sub&gt;cat&lt;/sub&gt;(pT197)], a site known to activate the PKA holoenzyme. PKA in turn phosphorylates p47 at a novel site (S176) to regulate dendritic complexity. Given that PINK1 physically interacts with both the PKA holoenzyme and the VCP-p47 complex to promote dendritic arborization, we propose that PINK1 scaffolds a novel PINK1-VCP-PKA-p47 signaling pathway to orchestrate dendritogenesis in neurons. These findings highlight an important mechanism by which proteins genetically implicated in Parkinson’s disease (PD; PINK1) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD; VCP) interact to support the health and maintenance of neuronal arbors.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Longitudinal Changes in Semantic Concreteness in Semantic Variant Primary Progressive Aphasia (svPPA)</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/5/6/ENEURO.0197-18.2018?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;This study examines longitudinal changes in the concreteness of nouns produced by human patients with semantic variant primary progressive aphasia (svPPA). Cross-sectional studies show that patients with svPPA demonstrate severe loss of concrete noun knowledge linked to atrophy of the left ventral temporal lobe. It is unknown how disease spread and duration affect the magnitude of the concreteness impairment in svPPA. We evaluate longitudinal spoken production of concrete nouns in svPPA, and relate this to changes in longitudinal MRI measures of gray matter (GM). Noun concreteness in svPPA is compared to that of behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD) patients, who typically demonstrate highly concrete speech. We elicited naturalistic speech samples at two time points (time 1 and time 2) in patients with svPPA (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 11) and bvFTD (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 15) through descriptions of the Cookie Theft picture and evaluated each spoken noun for concreteness. Compared to bvFTD patients whose noun production remained highly concrete throughout the testing period, mixed-effects models revealed that noun concreteness significantly decreased as disease progressed in svPPA. We also measured longitudinal changes to GM in a subset of svPPA patients (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 7), who showed significant decline in the left and right temporal and frontal regions. Regression analyses revealed that longitudinal GM atrophy in the right fusiform and parahippocampal gyri and the left superior temporal gyrus was related to decreasing noun concreteness. These results suggest that progressive atrophy of the ventral temporal lobe in svPPA contributes to declining concrete noun production over time.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1901.03553</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Here we present DIVE: Data-driven Inference of Vertexwise Evolution. DIVE is
an image-based disease progression model with single-vertex resolution,
designed to reconstruct long-term patterns of brain pathology from short-term
longitudinal data sets. DIVE clusters vertex-wise biomarker measurements on the
cortical surface that have similar temporal dynamics across a patient
population, and concurrently estimates an average trajectory of vertex
measurements in each cluster. DIVE uniquely outputs a parcellation of the
cortex into areas with common progression patterns, leading to a new signature
for individual diseases. DIVE further estimates the disease stage and
progression speed for every visit of every subject, potentially enhancing
stratification for clinical trials or management. On simulated data, DIVE can
recover ground truth clusters and their underlying trajectory, provided the
average trajectories are sufficiently different between clusters. We
demonstrate DIVE on data from two cohorts: the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging
Initiative (ADNI) and the Dementia Research Centre (DRC), UK, containing
patients with Posterior Cortical Atrophy (PCA) as well as typical Alzheimer's
disease (tAD). DIVE finds similar spatial patterns of atrophy for tAD subjects
in the two independent datasets (ADNI and DRC), and further reveals distinct
patterns of pathology in different diseases (tAD vs PCA) and for distinct types
of biomarker data: cortical thickness from Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) vs
amyloid load from Positron Emission Tomography (PET). Finally, DIVE can be used
to estimate a fine-grained spatial distribution of pathology in the brain using
any kind of voxelwise or vertexwise measures including Jacobian compression
maps, fractional anisotropy (FA) maps from diffusion imaging or other PET
measures. DIVE source code is available online:

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Brain computer interfaces (BCI) provide a direct communication link between
the brain and a computer or other external devices. They offer an extended
degree of freedom either by strengthening or by substituting human peripheral
working capacity and have potential applications in various fields such as
rehabilitation, affective computing, robotics, gaming and artificial
intelligence. Significant research efforts on a global scale have delivered
common platforms for technology standardization and help tackle highly complex
and nonlinear brain dynamics and related feature extraction and classification
challenges. Psycho-neurophysiological phenomena and their impact on brain
signals impose another challenge for BCI researchers to transform the
technology from laboratory experiments to plug-and-play daily life. This review
summarizes progress in BCI field and highlights critical challenges.

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Pain-Related Fear--Dissociable Neural Sources of Different Fear Constructs</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/5/6/ENEURO.0107-18.2018?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Fear of pain demonstrates significant prognostic value regarding the development of persistent musculoskeletal pain and disability. Its assessment often relies on self-report measures of pain-related fear by a variety of questionnaires. However, based either on &quot;fear of movement/(re)injury/kinesiophobia,&quot; &quot;fear avoidance beliefs,&quot; or &quot;pain anxiety,&quot; pain-related fear constructs plausibly differ while it is unclear how specific the questionnaires are in assessing these different constructs. Furthermore, the relationship of pain-related fear to other anxiety measures such as state or trait anxiety remains ambiguous. Advances in neuroimaging such as machine learning on brain activity patterns recorded by functional magnetic resonance imaging might help to dissect commonalities or differences across pain-related fear constructs. We applied a pattern regression approach in 20 human patients with nonspecific chronic low back pain to reveal predictive relationships between fear-related neural pattern information and different pain-related fear questionnaires. More specifically, the applied multiple kernel learning approach allowed the generation of models to predict the questionnaire scores based on a hierarchical ranking of fear-related neural patterns induced by viewing videos of activities potentially harmful for the back. We sought to find evidence for or against overlapping pain-related fear constructs by comparing the questionnaire prediction models according to their predictive abilities and associated neural contributors. By demonstrating evidence of nonoverlapping neural predictors within fear-processing regions, the results underpin the diversity of pain-related fear constructs. This neuroscientific approach might ultimately help to further understand and dissect psychological pain-related fear constructs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Neuronal Correlations in MT and MST Impair Population Decoding of Opposite Directions of Random Dot Motion</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/5/6/ENEURO.0336-18.2018?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;The study of neuronal responses to random-dot motion patterns has provided some of the most valuable insights into how the activity of neurons is related to perception. In the opposite directions of motion paradigm, the motion signal strength is decreased by manipulating the coherence of random dot patterns to examine how well the activity of single neurons represents the direction of motion. To extend this paradigm to populations of neurons, studies have used modelling based on data from pairs of neurons, but several important questions require further investigation with larger neuronal datasets. We recorded neuronal populations in the middle temporal (MT) and medial superior temporal (MST) areas of anaesthetized marmosets with electrode arrays, while varying the coherence of random dot patterns in two opposite directions of motion (left and right). Using the spike rates of simultaneously recorded neurons, we decoded the direction of motion at each level of coherence with linear classifiers. We found that the presence of correlations had a detrimental effect to decoding performance, but that learning the correlation structure produced better decoding performance compared to decoders that ignored the correlation structure. We also found that reducing motion coherence increased neuronal correlations, but decoders did not need to be optimized for each coherence level. Finally, we showed that decoder weights depend of left-right selectivity at 100% coherence, rather than the preferred direction. These results have implications for understanding how the information encoded by populations of neurons is affected by correlations in spiking activity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>RSS PAP: Gamma oscillations in the basolateral amygdala: biophysical mechanisms and computational consequences</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0388-18.2018v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;The basolateral nucleus of the amygdala (BL) is thought to support numerous emotional behaviors through specific microcircuits. These are often thought to be comprised of feedforward networks of principal cells and interneurons. Neither well-understood nor often considered are recurrent and feedback connections, which likely engender oscillatory dynamics within BL. Indeed, oscillations in the gamma frequency range (40-100 Hz) are known to occur in the BL, and yet their origin and effect on local circuits remains unknown. To address this, we constructed a biophysically and anatomically detailed model of the rat BL and its local field potential based on the physiological and anatomical literature, along with &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; data we collected on the activities of neurons within the rat BL. Remarkably, the model produced intermittent gamma oscillations (~50-70 Hz) whose properties matched those recorded &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;, including their entrainment of spiking. BL gamma-band oscillations were generated by the intrinsic circuitry, depending upon reciprocal interactions between principal cells and fast-spiking interneurons, while connections within these cell types affected the rhythm’s frequency. The model allowed us to conduct experimentally impossible tests to characterize the synaptic and spatial properties of gamma. The entrainment of individual neurons to gamma depended on the number of afferent connections they received, and gamma bursts were spatially restricted in the BL. Importantly, the gamma rhythm synchronized principal cells and mediated competition between ensembles. Together, these results indicate that the recurrent connectivity of BL expands its computational and communication repertoire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significant Statement&lt;/b&gt; Using &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; data we develop the first large-scale biophysically and anatomically realistic model of the basolateral amygdala nucleus (BL), which reproduces the dynamics of the &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; local field potential (LFP). Significantly, it predicts that BL intrinsically generates the transient gamma oscillations observed &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. The model permitted exploration of the poorly understood synaptic mechanisms underlying gamma genesis in BL, and the model's ability to compute LFPs at arbitrary numbers of recording sites provided insights into the characteristics of the spatial properties of gamma bursts. Furthermore, we show how gamma synchronizes principal cells to overcome their low firing rates while simultaneously promoting competition, potentially impacting their afferent selectivity and efferent drive, and thus emotional behavior.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The P300 Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) is a well-established communication
channel for severely disabled people. The P300 event-related potential is
mostly characterized by its amplitude or its area, which correlate with the
spelling accuracy of the P300 speller. Here, we introduce a novel approach for
estimating the efficiency of this BCI by considering the P300 signal-to-noise
ratio (SNR), a parameter that estimates the spatial and temporal noise levels
and has a significantly stronger correlation with spelling accuracy.
Furthermore, we suggest a Gaussian noise model, which utilizes the P300
event-related potential SNR to predict spelling accuracy under various
conditions for LDA-based classification. We demonstrate the utility of this
analysis using real data and discuss its potential applications, such as
speeding up the process of electrode selection.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The brain stimulation and its widespread use is one of the most important
subjects in studies of neurophysiology. In brain electrical stimulation
methods, following the surgery and electrode implantation, electrodes send
electrical impulses to the specific targets in the brain. The use of this
stimulation method is provided therapeutic benefits for treatment chronic pain,
essential tremor, Parkinsons disease, major depression, and neurological
movement disorder syndrome (dystonia). One area in which advancements have been
recently made is in controlling the movement and navigation of animals in a
specific pathway. It is important to identify brain targets in order to
stimulate appropriate brain regions for all the applications listed above. An
animal navigation system based on brain electrical stimulation is used to
develop new behavioral models for the aim of creating a platform for
interacting with the animal nervous system in the spatial learning task. In the
context of animal navigation the electrical stimulation has been used either as
creating virtual sensation for movement guidance or virtual reward for movement
motivation. In this paper, different approaches and techniques of brain
electrical stimulation for this application has been reviewed.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;To study how mental object representations are related to behavior, we
estimated sparse, non-negative representations of objects using human
behavioral judgments on images representative of 1,854 object categories. These
representations predicted a latent similarity structure between objects, which
captured most of the explainable variance in human behavioral judgments.
Individual dimensions in the low-dimensional embedding were found to be highly
reproducible and interpretable as conveying degrees of taxonomic membership,
functionality, and perceptual attributes. We further demonstrated the
predictive power of the embeddings for explaining other forms of human
behavior, including categorization, typicality judgments, and feature ratings,
suggesting that the dimensions reflect human conceptual representations of
objects beyond the specific task.

Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) has the worst prognosis among solid malignancies and improved therapeutic strategies are needed to improve outcomes. Patient-derived xenografts (PDX) and patient-derived organoids (PDO) serve as promising tools to identify new drugs with therapeutic potential in PDAC. For these preclinical disease models to be effective, they should both recapitulate the molecular heterogeneity of PDAC and validate patient-specific therapeutic sensitivities. To date however, deep characterization of the molecular heterogeneity of PDAC PDX and PDO models and comparison with matched human tumour remains largely unaddressed at the whole genome level. We conducted a comprehensive assessment of the genetic landscape of 16 whole-genome pairs of tumours and matched PDX, from primary PDAC and liver metastasis, including a unique cohort of 5 ‘trios’ of matched primary tumour, PDX, and PDO. We developed a pipeline to score concordance between PDAC models and their paired human tumours for genomic events, including mutations, structural variations, and copy number variations. Tumour-model comparisons of mutations displayed single-gene concordance across major PDAC driver genes, but relatively poor agreement across the greater mutational load. Genome-wide and chromosome-centric analysis of structural variation (SV) events highlights previously unrecognized concordance across chromosomes that demonstrate clustered SV events. We found that polyploidy presented a major challenge when assessing copy number changes; however, ploidy-corrected copy number states suggest good agreement between donor-model pairs. Collectively, our investigations highlight that while PDXs and PDOs may serve as tractable and transplantable systems for probing the molecular properties of PDAC, these models may best serve &lt;i&gt;selective&lt;/i&gt; analyses across different levels of genomic complexity.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/I_DH2nH8efs&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

The high failure rate of therapeutics showing promise in mouse models to translate to patients is a pressing challenge in biomedical science. Though retrospective studies have examined the fidelity of mouse models to their respective human conditions, approaches for prospective translation of insights from mouse models to patients remain relatively unexplored. Here, we develop a semi-supervised learning approach for inference of disease-associated human differentially expressed genes and pathways from mouse model experiments. We examined 36 transcriptomic case studies where comparable phenotypes were available for mouse and human inflammatory diseases and assessed multiple computational approaches for inferring human biology from mouse datasets. We found that semi-supervised training of a neural network identified significantly more true human biological associations than interpreting mouse experiments directly. Evaluating the experimental design of mouse experiments where our model was most successful revealed principles of experimental design that may improve translational performance. Our study shows that when prospectively evaluating biological associations in mouse studies, semi-supervised learning approaches, combining mouse and human data for biological inference, provide the most accurate assessment of human &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; disease processes. Finally, we proffer a delineation of four categories of model system-to-human “Translation Problems” defined by the resolution and coverage of the datasets available for molecular insight translation and suggest that the task of translating insights from model systems to human disease contexts may be better accomplished by a combination of translation-minded experimental design and computational approaches.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/XOH4TEke77c&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>RSS PAP: Trigeminal nerve transection-induced neuroplastic changes in the somatosensory and insular cortices in a rat ectopic pain model</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0462-18.2019v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;The primary sensory cortex processes competitive sensory inputs. Ablation of these competitive inputs induces neuroplastic changes in local cortical circuits. However, information concerning cortical plasticity induced by a disturbance of competitive nociceptive inputs is limited. Nociceptive information from the maxillary and mandibular molar pulps converges at the border between the ventral secondary somatosensory cortex (S2) and insular oral region (IOR), therefore S2/IOR is a suitable target for examining the cortical changes induced by a disturbance of noxious inputs, which often causes neuropathic pain and allodynia. We focused on the plastic changes in S2/IOR excitation in a model of rats subjected to inferior alveolar nerve transection (IANX). Our optical imaging using a voltage-sensitive dye revealed that the maxillary molar pulp stimulation-induced excitatory propagation was expanded 1-2 weeks after IANX at the macroscopic level. At the cellular level, based on Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; imaging using two-photon microscopy, the amplitude of the Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; responses and the number of responding neurons in S2/IOR increased in both excitatory and inhibitory neurons. The &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; laser scanning photostimulation revealed that layer II/III pyramidal and GABAergic fast-spiking neurons in S2/IOR received larger excitatory inputs from layer IV in the IANX models, which supports the findings obtained by the macroscopic and microscopic optical imaging. Furthermore, the inhibitory postsynaptic inputs to the pyramidal neurons were decreased in the IANX models, suggesting suppression of inhibitory synaptic transmission onto excitatory neurons. These results suggest that IANX induces plastic changes in S2/IOR by changing the local excitatory and inhibitory circuits. (246/250 words)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance statement&lt;/b&gt; The inferior alveolar nerve (IAN), a mandibular branch of the trigeminal nerve, innervates the orofacial region, including the tooth pulps. IAN transection (IANX) induces allodynia in the maxillary nerve-projecting region. This study demonstrates the facilitation of excitatory propagation in the secondary somatosensory cortex (S2) and insular oral region (IOR) following maxillary molar tooth pulp stimulation in IANX rats. Both pyramidal and fast-spiking neurons in layer II/III S2/IOR of IANX rats received larger glutamatergic excitatory inputs from the deeper layers. Reduction of GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptor-mediated IPSCs in pyramidal neurons of IANX rats may contribute to the facilitated excitation in S2/IOR. These findings suggest that GABAergic neurons in S2/IOR could be a therapeutic target for ectopic pain in the orofacial region. (118/120 words)&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>RSS PAP: Methamphetamine self-administration elicits sex related changes in postsynaptic glutamate transmission in the prefrontal cortex</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0401-18.2018v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Pre-clinical and clinical research has shown that females are more vulnerable to the rewarding effects of stimulants, and it has been proposed that estrogens may play a role in this enhanced sensitivity; however sex differences in methamphetamine (METH)-induced neuroplasticity have not been explored. To address this gap in knowledge we recorded from the prelimbic area of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) of male and females rats following long access METH self-administration (SA) and investigated the resulting long-term synaptic neuroadaptations. Males and females took similar amounts of METH during self-administration; however, female rats exhibit significant synaptic baseline differences when compared to males. Furthermore, females exhibited a significant increase in evoked excitatory currents. This increase in evoked glutamate was correlated with increases in NMDA currents and was not affected by application of a GluN2B selective blocker. We propose that METH SA selectively upregulates GluN2B-lacking NMDAR in the PFC of female rats. Our results may provide a mechanistic explanation for the sex differences reported for METH addiction in females.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; The rate of methamphetamine (METH) addiction is second only to heroin, and use trends are on the rise. Like other drugs of abuse, there are known sex differences in METH addiction, however if these differences result from sex differences in pharmacokinetics, neurophysiology, and/or drug-induced neuroplasticity has not been established. Here we assessed METH self-administration induced neuroadaptations in synaptic physiology using electrophysiological measures in prefrontal cortical brain slices of male and female rats. We are the first to report, to our knowledge, that cortical baseline and METH-induced synaptic responses are different between male and female rats. Our results may provide a mechanistic explanation for the sex differences reported for METH addiction in females and highlight the possibility that sex-specific treatment strategies may be required to address METH-induced neuroplasticity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>RSS PAP: Isoflurane inhibits dopaminergic synaptic vesicle exocytosis coupled to CaV2.1 and CaV2.2 in rat midbrain neurons</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0278-18.2018v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>ABSTRACT&lt;p&gt;Volatile anesthetics affect neuronal signaling by poorly understood mechanisms. Activation of central dopaminergic pathways has been implicated in emergence from general anesthesia. The volatile anesthetic isoflurane differentially inhibits glutamatergic and GABAergic synaptic vesicle exocytosis by reducing presynaptic Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; influx without affecting the Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-exocytosis relationship, but its effects on dopaminergic exocytosis are unclear. We tested the hypothesis that isoflurane inhibits exocytosis in dopaminergic neurons. We used electrical stimulation or depolarization by elevated extracellular KCl to evoke exocytosis measured by quantitative live-cell fluorescence imaging in cultured rat ventral tegmental area neurons. Using trains of electrically evoked action potentials (APs), isoflurane inhibited exocytosis in dopaminergic neurons to a greater extent (30 ± 4% inhibition; p &amp;lt; 0.0001) than in non-dopaminergic neurons (15 ± 5% inhibition; p = 0.014). Isoflurane also inhibited exocytosis evoked by elevated KCl in dopaminergic neurons (35 ± 6% inhibition; p = 0.0007), but not in non-dopaminergic neurons (2 ± 4% inhibition). Pharmacological isolation of presynaptic Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; channel subtypes showed that isoflurane inhibited KCl-evoked exocytosis mediated exclusively by either Ca&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;2.1 (P/Q-type Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; channels) (30 ± 5% inhibition; p = 0.0002) or by Ca&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;2.2 (N-type Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; channels) (35 ± 11% inhibition; p = 0.015). Additionally, isoflurane inhibited single AP-evoked Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; influx by 41 ± 3% and single AP-evoked exocytosis by 34 ± 6%. Comparable reductions in exocytosis and Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; influx were produced by lowering extracellular [Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;]. Thus, isoflurane inhibits exocytosis from dopaminergic neurons by a mechanism distinct from that in non-dopaminergic neurons involving reduced Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; entry through Ca&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;2.1 and/or Ca&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;2.2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Despite their medical importance, the mechanisms of action of general anesthetics have not been fully elucidated. Isoflurane, a widely used volatile anesthetic, inhibits voltage-gated sodium channels and differentially inhibits synaptic vesicle exocytosis depending on neurotransmitter phenotype. Here we show that in dopaminergic neurons of the ventral tegmental area isoflurane acts via a sodium channel-independent mechanism to inhibit synaptic vesicle exocytosis in proportion to reduced presynaptic Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; flux mediated by Ca&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;2.1 and/or Ca&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;2.2, in contrast to its effects in non-dopaminergic neurons. These findings provide a synaptic mechanism for the observed role of reduced dopamine release in anesthetic-induced unconsciousness, and implicate presynaptic Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; channels of dopaminergic neurons as important targets of isoflurane.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/5/6/ENEURO.0187-18.2018?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Transparent and flexible materials are attractive for a wide range of emerging bioelectronic applications. These include neural interfacing devices for both recording and stimulation, where low electrochemical electrode impedance is valuable. Here the conducting polymer poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) is used to fabricate electrodes that are small enough to allow unencumbered optical access for imaging a large cell population with two-photon (2P) microscopy, yet provide low impedance for simultaneous high quality recordings of neural activity &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. To demonstrate this, pathophysiological activity was induced in the mouse cortex using 4-aminopyridine (4AP), and the resulting electrical activity was detected with the PEDOT:PSS-based probe while imaging calcium activity directly below the probe area. The induced calcium activity of the neuronal network as measured by the fluorescence change in the cells correlated well with the electrophysiological recordings from the cortical grid of PEDOT:PSS microelectrodes. Our approach provides a valuable vehicle for complementing classical high temporal resolution electrophysiological analysis with optical imaging.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Nociceptin/Orphanin-FQ Inhibits Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone Neurons via G-Protein-Gated Inwardly Rectifying Potassium Channels</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/5/6/ENEURO.0161-18.2018?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;The pulsatile release of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) is a key feature of the hypothalamic–pituitary–gonadal axis. Kisspeptin neurons in the arcuate nucleus (ARC) trigger GnRH neuronal activity, but how GnRH neurons return to baseline electrical activity is unknown. Nociceptin/orphanin-FQ (OFQ) is an inhibitory neuromodulator. ARC proopiomelanocortin (POMC) neurons, known to receive inputs from ARC kisspeptin neurons, contact GnRH neurons and coexpress OFQ in the rat. In the present study, the effect of OFQ(1-13) on GnRH neurons was determined in the mouse. We identified transcripts for the OFQ receptor [opioid receptor like 1 (ORL1)] in GnRH neurons, and, using two-model systems (explants and slices), we found that OFQ exerted a potent inhibition on GnRH neurons, with or without excitatory inputs. We confirmed that the inhibition was mediated by ORL1 via G&lt;sub&gt;i/o&lt;/sub&gt;-protein coupling. The inhibition, occurring independently of levels of intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate, was sensitive to inwardly rectifying potassium channels. The only specific blocker of G&lt;sub&gt;i/o&lt;/sub&gt;-protein-coupled inwardly rectifying potassium (GIRK) channels, tertiapin-Q (TPNQ), was ineffective in the inhibition of OFQ. Two GIRK activators, one sharing the binding site of TPNQ and one active only on GIRK1-containing GIRK channels, failed to trigger an inhibition. In contrast, protein kinase C phosphorylation activation, known to inhibit GIRK2-mediated currents, prevented the OFQ inhibition. These results indicate a specific combination of GIRK subunits, GIRK2/3 in GnRH neurons. &lt;i&gt;In vivo&lt;/i&gt;, double-labeled OFQ/POMC fibers were found in the vicinity of GnRH neurons, and OFQ fibers apposed GnRH neurons. Together, this study brings to light a potent neuromodulator of GnRH neurons.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

There has been considerable effort to use these profiles to understand cell diversity, primarily through unsupervised clustering and differential expression analysis. However, current practices to validate these findings vary. In this review, we describe recent efforts to evaluate clusters from single-cell RNA-sequencing data, and provide a framework for considering current evidence and practices in terms of their capacity to establish principles of cell biology. Single-cell RNA-sequencing has already transformed neuroscience. By facilitating detailed comparative and genetic perturbation analyses, it may provide the tools to uncover fundamental mechanisms of neural diversity throughout the tree of life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;This paper describes duneuro, a software toolbox for forward modeling in
neuroscience. Its purpose is to provide extendible and easy-to-use interfaces
and enable a closer integration into existing analysis pipelines. It provides
implementations of fitted and unfitted finite element methods and makes use of
the Dune framework. The forward problems consist of the electroencephalography
(EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG) forward problems. For the incorporation
into existing analysis pipelines, Python and Matlab interfaces are provided.
The practical use is demonstrated on a source analysis example of evoked
potentials.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A strong preference for novelty emerges in infancy and is prevalent across
the animal kingdom. When incorporated into reinforcement-based machine learning
algorithms, visual novelty can act as an intrinsic reward signal that vastly
increases the efficiency of exploration and expedites learning, particularly in
situations where external rewards are difficult to obtain. Here we review
parallels between recent developments in novelty-driven machine learning
algorithms and our understanding of how visual novelty is computed and signaled
in the primate brain. We propose that in the visual system, novelty
representations are not configured with the principal goal of detecting novel
objects, but rather with the broader goal of flexibly generalizing novelty
information across different states in the service of driving novelty-based
learning.

&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;aureus&lt;/i&gt; is classified as a serious threat pathogen and is a priority that guides the discovery and development of new antibiotics. Despite growing knowledge of &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;aureus&lt;/i&gt; metabolic capabilities, our understanding of its systems-level responses to different media types remains incomplete. Here, we develop a manually reconstructed genome-scale model (GEM-PRO) of metabolism with 3D protein structures for &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;aureus&lt;/i&gt; USA300 str. JE2 containing 854 genes, 1,440 reactions, 1,327 metabolites and 673 3-dimensional protein structures. Computations were in 85% agreement with gene essentiality data from random barcode transposon site sequencing (RB-TnSeq) and 68% agreement with experimental physiological data. Comparisons of computational predictions with experimental observations highlight: 1) cases of non-essential biomass precursors; 2) metabolic genes subject to transcriptional regulation involved in Staphyloxanthin biosynthesis; 3) the essentiality of purine and amino acid biosynthesis in synthetic physiological media; and 4) a switch to aerobic fermentation upon exposure to extracellular glucose elucidated as a result of integrating time-course of quantitative exo-metabolomics data. An up-to-date GEM-PRO thus serves as a knowledge-based platform to elucidate &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;aureus’&lt;/i&gt; metabolic response to its environment.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/2DiKjhA9eEg&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Using the drug-protein interactome to identify anti-ageing compounds for humans</title>

Advancing age is the dominant risk factor for most of the major killer diseases in developed countries. Hence, ameliorating the effects of ageing may prevent multiple diseases simultaneously. Drugs licensed for human use against specific diseases have proved to be effective in extending lifespan and healthspan in animal models, suggesting that there is scope for drug repurposing in humans. New bioinformatic methods to identify and prioritise potential anti-ageing compounds for humans are therefore of interest. In this study, we first used drug-protein interaction information, to rank 1,147 drugs by their likelihood of targeting ageing-related gene products in humans. Among 19 statistically significant drugs, 6 have already been shown to have pro-longevity properties in animal models (p &amp;lt; 0.001). Using the targets of each drug, we established their association with ageing at multiple levels of biological action including pathways, functions and protein interactions. Finally, combining all the data, we calculated a ranked list of drugs that identified tanespimycin, an inhibitor of HSP-90, as the top-ranked novel anti-ageing candidate. We experimentally validated the pro-longevity effect of tanespimycin through its HSP-90 target in &lt;i&gt;Caenorhabditis elegans&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Yjtn-ZF7ak8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Electrophysiological Correlates of Absolute Pitch in a Passive Auditory Oddball Paradigm: a Direct Replication Attempt</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/5/6/ENEURO.0333-18.2018?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Humans with absolute pitch (AP) are able to effortlessly name the pitch class of a sound without an external reference. The association of labels with pitches cannot be entirely suppressed even if it interferes with task demands. This suggests a high level of automaticity of pitch labeling in AP. The automatic nature of AP was further investigated in a study by Rogenmoser et al. (2015). Using a passive auditory oddball paradigm in combination with electroencephalography, they observed electrophysiological differences between musicians with and without AP in response to piano tones. Specifically, the AP musicians showed a smaller P3a, an event-related potential (ERP) component presumably reflecting early attentional processes. In contrast, they did not find group differences in the mismatch negativity (MMN), an ERP component associated with auditory memory processes. They concluded that early cognitive processes are facilitated in AP during passive listening and are more important for AP than the preceding sensory processes. In our direct replication study on a larger sample of musicians with (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 54, 27 females, 27 males) and without (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 50, 24 females, 26 males) AP, we successfully replicated the non-significant effects of AP on the MMN. However, we could not replicate the significant effects for the P3a. Additional Bayes factor analyses revealed moderate to strong evidence (Bayes factor &amp;gt; 3) for the null hypothesis for both MMN and P3a. Therefore, the results of this replication study do not support the postulated importance of cognitive facilitation in AP during passive tone listening.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1901.02270</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In the mammalian brain newly acquired memories depend on the hippocampus for
maintenance and recall, but over time these functions are taken over by the
neocortex through a process called systems consolidation. However, reactivation
of a consolidated memory can induce a brief period of temporary
hippocampus-dependence, followed by return to hippocampus-independence. Here we
present a computational model that uses simulation of recently described
mechanisms of synaptic plasticity to account for findings from the systems
consolidation/reconsolidation literature and to make predictions for future
research.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Extracting impedance changes from a frequency multiplexed signal during neural activity in sciatic nerve of rat: preliminary study in-vitro. (arXiv:1901.02068v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1901.02068</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Objective: Establish suitable frequency spacing and demodulation steps to use
when extracting impedance changes from frequency division multiplexed (FDM)
carrier signals in peripheral nerve. Approach: Experiments were performed
in-vitro on cadavers immediately following euthanasia. Neural activity was
evoked via stimulation of nerves in the hind paw, while carrier signals were
injected, and recordings obtained, with a dual ring nerve cuff implanted on the
sciatic nerve. Frequency analysis of recorded compound action potentials (CAPs)
and extracted impedance changes, with the latter obtained using established
demodulation methods, were used to determine suitable frequency spacing of
carrier signals, and bandpass filter (BPF) bandwidth and order, for a frequency
multiplexed signal. Main results: CAPs and impedance changes were dominant in
the frequency band 200 to 500 Hz and 100 to 200 Hz, respectively. A Tukey
window was introduced to remove ringing from Gibbs phenomena. A +/- 750 Hz BPF
bandwidth was selected to encompass 99.99 % of the frequency power of the
impedance change. Modelling predicted a minimum BPF order of 16 for 2 kHz
spacing, and 10 for 4 kHz spacing, were required to avoid ringing from the
neighbouring carrier signal, while FDM experiments verified BPF orders of 12
and 8, respectively, were required. With a notch filter centred on the
neighbouring signal, a BPF order of at least 6 or 4 was required for 2 and 4
kHz, respectively. Significance: The results establish drive frequency spacing
and demodulation settings for use in FDM electrical impedance tomography (EIT)
experiments, as well as a framework for their selection, and, for the first
time, demonstrates the viability of FDM-EIT of neural activity on peripheral
nerve, which will be a central aspect of future real-time neural-EIT systems
and EIT-based neural prosthetics interfaces.

	<title>eNeuro current issue: A Computational Model of Dual Competition between the Basal Ganglia and the Cortex</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/5/6/ENEURO.0339-17.2018?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;We propose a model that includes interactions between the cortex, the basal ganglia (BG), and the thalamus based on a dual competition. We hypothesize that the striatum, the subthalamic nucleus (STN), the internal globus pallidus (GPi), the thalamus, and the cortex are involved in closed feedback loops through the hyperdirect and direct pathways. These loops support a competition process that results in the ability of BG to make a cognitive decision followed by a motor one. Considering lateral cortical interactions, another competition takes place inside the cortex allowing the latter to make a cognitive and a motor decision. We show how this dual competition endows the model with two regimes. One is driven by reinforcement learning and the other by Hebbian learning. The final decision is made according to a combination of these two mechanisms with a gradual transfer from the former to the latter. We confirmed these theoretical results on primates (&lt;i&gt;Macaca mulatta&lt;/i&gt;) using a novel paradigm predicted by the model.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: The systemDrive: a Multisite, Multiregion Microdrive with Independent Drive Axis Angling for Chronic Multimodal Systems Neuroscience Recordings in Freely Behaving Animals</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/5/6/ENEURO.0261-18.2018?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A multielectrode system that can address widely separated targets at multiple sites across multiple brain regions with independent implant angling is needed to investigate neural function and signaling in systems and circuits of small animals. Here, we present the systemDrive, a novel multisite, multiregion microdrive that is capable of moving microwire electrode bundles into targets along independent and nonparallel drive trajectories. Our design decouples the stereotaxic surgical placement of individual guide cannulas for each trajectory from the placement of a flexible drive structure. This separation enables placement of many microwire multitrodes along widely spaced and independent drive axes with user-set electrode trajectories and depths from a single microdrive body, and achieves stereotaxic precision with each. The system leverages tight tube–cannula tolerances and geometric constraints on flexible drive axes to ensure concentric alignment of electrode bundles within guide cannulas. Additionally, the headmount and microdrive both have an open-center design to allow for the placement of additional sensing modalities. This design is the first, in the context of small rodent chronic research, to provide the capability to finely position microwires through multiple widely distributed cell groups, each with stereotaxic precision, along arbitrary and nonparallel trajectories that are not restricted to emanate from a single source. We demonstrate the use of the systemDrive in male Long–Evans rats to observe simultaneous single-unit and multiunit activity from multiple widely separated sleep–wake regulatory brainstem cell groups, along with cortical and hippocampal activity, during free behavior over multiple many-day continuous recording periods.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In this paper, we analyze the cognitive improvements that can be achieved
through hacking the brain and using neuroplasticity. Not all cases of
neuroplasticity are useful, but exposure to gaming, for example, has proven
conducive for learning. We will discuss cortical magnification and receptive
field sizes, as well as topographic brain maps in the context of
neuroplasticity. We finally propose more studies to be performed to improve
musical talent and musical abilities.

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Hemispheric Module-Specific Influence of the X Chromosome on White Matter Connectivity: Evidence from Girls with Turner Syndrome</title>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy335/5280093?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Turner syndrome (TS) is caused by the congenital absence of all or part of one of the X chromosomes in females, offering a valuable human “knockout model” to study the functioning patterns of the X chromosome in the human brain. Little is known about whether and how the loss of the X chromosome influences the brain structural wiring patterns in human. We acquired a multimodal MRI dataset and cognitive assessments from 22 girls with TS and 21 age-matched control girls to address these questions. Hemispheric white matter (WM) networks and modules were derived using refined diffusion MRI tractography. Statistical comparisons revealed a reduced topological efficiency of both hemispheric networks and bilateral parietal modules in TS girls. Specifically, the efficiency of right parietal module significantly mediated the effect of the X chromosome on working memory performance, indicating that X chromosome loss impairs working memory performance by disrupting this module. Additionally, TS girls showed structural and functional connectivity decoupling across specific within- and between-modular connections, predominantly in the right hemisphere. These findings provide novel insights into the functional pathways in the brain that are regulated by the X chromosome and highlight a module-specific genetic contribution to WM connectivity in the human brain.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: I See Your Effort: Force-Related BOLD Effects in an Extended Action Execution–Observation Network Involving the Cerebellum</title>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy322/5280097?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Action observation (AO) is crucial for motor planning, imitation learning, and social interaction, but it is not clear whether and how an action execution–observation network (AEON) processes the effort of others engaged in performing actions. In this functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study, we used a “squeeze ball” task involving different grip forces to investigate whether AEON activation showed similar patterns when executing the task or observing others performing it. Both in action execution, AE (subjects performed the visuomotor task) and action observation, AO (subjects watched a video of the task being performed by someone else), the fMRI signal was detected in cerebral and cerebellar regions. These responses showed various relationships with force mapping onto specific areas of the sensorimotor and cognitive systems. Conjunction analysis of AE and AO was repeated for the “0th” order and linear and nonlinear responses, and revealed multiple AEON nodes remapping the detection of actions, and also effort, of another person onto the observer’s own cerebrocerebellar system. This result implies that the AEON exploits the cerebellum, which is known to process sensorimotor predictions and simulations, performing an internal assessment of forces and integrating information into high-level schemes, providing a crucial substrate for action imitation.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Enhanced Population Coding for Rewarded Choices in the Medial Frontal Cortex of the Mouse</title>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy292/5280095?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Instrumental behavior is characterized by the selection of actions based on the degree to which they lead to a desired outcome. However, we lack a detailed understanding of how rewarded actions are reinforced and preferentially implemented. In rodents, the medial frontal cortex is hypothesized to play an important role in this process, based in part on its capacity to encode chosen actions and their outcomes. We therefore asked how neural representations of choice and outcome might interact to facilitate instrumental behavior. To investigate this question, we imaged neural ensemble activity in layer 2/3 of the secondary motor region (M2) while mice engaged in a two-choice auditory discrimination task with probabilistic outcomes. Correct choices could result in one of three reward amounts (single, double or omitted reward), which allowed us to measure neural and behavioral effects of reward magnitude, as well as its categorical presence or absence. Single-unit and population decoding analyses revealed a consistent influence of outcome on choice signals in M2. Specifically, rewarded choices were more robustly encoded relative to unrewarded choices, with little dependence on the exact magnitude of reinforcement. Our results provide insight into the integration of past choices and outcomes in the rodent brain during instrumental behavior.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>The mesolimbic hypothesis has been a central dogma of schizophrenia for decades, positing that aberrant functioning of midbrain dopamine projections to limbic regions causes psychotic symptoms. Recently, however, advances in neuroimaging techniques have led to the unanticipated finding that dopaminergic dysfunction in schizophrenia is greatest within nigrostriatal pathways, implicating the dorsal striatum in the pathophysiology and calling into question the mesolimbic theory. At the same time our knowledge of striatal anatomy and function has progressed, suggesting new mechanisms via which striatal dysfunction may contribute to the symptoms of schizophrenia.</content:encoded>

	<title>RSS PAP: Activity patterns in the neuropil of striatal cholinergic interneurons in freely moving mice represent their collective spiking dynamics</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0351-18.2018v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Cholinergic interneurons (CINs) are believed to form synchronous cell assemblies that modulate the striatal microcircuitry and possibly orchestrate local dopamine release. We expressed GCaMP6s, a genetically encoded calcium indicator (GECIs), selectively in CINs, and used microendoscopes to visualize the putative CIN assemblies in the dorsal striatum of freely moving mice. The GECI fluorescence signal from the dorsal striatum was composed of signals from individual CIN somata that were engulfed by a widespread fluorescent neuropil. Bouts of synchronous activation of the cholinergic neuropil revealed patterns of activity that preceded the signal from individual somata. To investigate the nature of the neuropil signal and why it precedes the somatic signal, we target-patched GECI-expressing CINs in acute striatal slices in conjunction with multiphoton imaging or wide-field imaging that emulates the microendoscopes’ specifications. The ability to detect fluorescent transients associated with individual action potential was constrained by the long decay constant of GECIs (relative to common inorganic dyes) to slowly firing (&amp;lt; 2 spikes/s) CINs. The microendoscopes’ resolving power and sampling rate further diminished this ability. Additionally, we found that only back-propagating action potentials but not synchronous optogenetic activation of thalamic inputs elicited observable calcium transients in CIN dendrites. Our data suggest that only bursts of CIN activity (but not their tonic firing) are visible using endoscopic imaging, and that the neuropil patterns are a physiological measure of the collective recurrent CIN network spiking activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Cholinergic interneurons (CINs) are key modulators of the striatal microcircuitry that are necessary for assigning action value and behavioral flexibility. We present a first endoscopic imaging study of multiple molecularly identified CINs in freely moving mice. We reveal the presence of activity patterns in the CIN neuropil. We then use &lt;i&gt;ex vivo&lt;/i&gt; electrophysiological and imaging techniques to show that the neuropil signal is the integrated fluorescence arising from the axo-dendritic arbors of CINs dispersed throughout the striatum. We conclude that the neuropil signal acts as a mean-field readout of the striatal CIN network activity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>RSS PAP: Neuron-Specific Gene 2 (NSG2) encodes an AMPA receptor interacting protein that modulates excitatory neurotransmission</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0292-18.2018v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Neurons have evolved a number of unique protein-coding genes that regulate trafficking of protein complexes within small organelles throughout dendrites axons. Neuron specific gene 2 (NSG2) encodes for one of the most abundant proteins in the nervous system during perinatal development. NSG2 belongs to a family of small neuronal endosomal proteins but its function has remained uncharacterized to date. Here we show that NSG2 is found in discrete punctae restricted to the somatodendritic arbors of developing mouse and human neurons, and a significant proportion of NSG2 punctae colocalize with postsynaptic HOMER1 and surface-expressed AMPARs at excitatory synapses. Immunoprecipitation revealed that NSG2 physically interacts with both the GluA1 and GluA2 AMPAR subunits in mouse brain. Knockout of NSG2 in mouse hippocampal neurons selectively impaired the frequency of miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs) and caused alterations in PSD95 expression at postsynaptic densities. In contrast, NSG2 overexpression caused a significant increase in the amplitude of mEPSCs as well as GluA2 surface expression. Thus, NSG2 functions as an AMPAR-binding protein that is required for normal synapse formation and/or maintenance, and has unique functions compared with other NSG family members.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Due to their morphological and functional complexity, neurons have evolved specialized proteins like those of the neuron-specific gene family (NSG1-3). Important developmental and synaptic functions have been attributed to NSG1/NEEP21 and NSG3/Calcyon while the function of NSG2/HMP19/NVTA2 has remained uncharacterized. Here we show that NSG2 localizes to a large proportion of excitatory synapses, interacts with AMPARs, and modulates their surface expression during synaptogenesis. Alterations of NSG2 expression affected both the amplitude and frequency of excitatory neurotransmission that is not compensated for by other NSG family members. Thus, NSG2 appears critical for excitatory synapse formation and/or maintenance and forced expression can promote increased synaptic efficacy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Congenital heart disease (CHD) is among the most common birth defects. Children with CHD frequently display long-term intellectual and behavioral disability. Emerging evidence indicates that cardiac anomalies lead to a reduction in cerebral oxygenation, which appears to profoundly impact on the maturation of cerebral regions responsible for higher-order cognitive functions. In this review we focus on the potential mechanisms by which dysregulation of cortical neuronal development during early life may lead to the significant cognitive impairments that commonly occur in children with CHD.</content:encoded>
