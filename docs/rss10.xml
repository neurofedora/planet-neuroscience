	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: No substantial change in the balance between model-free and model-based control via training on the two-step task</title>

Human decisions can be habitual or goal-directed, also known as model-free (MF) or model-based (MB) control. Previous work suggests that the balance between the two decision systems is impaired in psychiatric disorders such as compulsion and addiction, via overreliance on MF control. However, little is known whether the balance can be altered through task training. Here, 20 healthy participants performed a well-established two-step task that differentiates MB from MF control, across five training sessions. We used computational modelling and functional near-infrared spectroscopy to assess changes in decision-making and brain hemodynamic over time. Mixed-effects modelling revealed overall no substantial changes in MF and MB behavior across training. Although our behavioral and brain findings show task-induced changes in learning rates, these parameters have no direct relation to either MF or MB control or the balance between the two systems, and thus do not support the assumption of training effects on MF or MB strategies. Our findings indicate that training on the two-step paradigm in its current form does not support a shift in the balance between MF and MB control. We discuss these results with respect to implications for restoring the balance between MF and MB control in psychiatric conditions.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/eKPfhfz7iQA&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Origin and functions of intermittent transitions among sleep stages, including short awakenings and arousals, constitute a challenge to the current homeostatic framework for sleep regulation, focusing on factors modulating sleep over large time scales. Here we propose that the complex micro-architecture characterizing the sleep-wake cycle results from an underlying non-equilibrium critical dynamics, bridging collective behaviors across spatio-temporal scales. We investigate &lt;i&gt;θ&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;δ&lt;/i&gt; wave dynamics in control rats and in rats with lesions of sleep-promoting neurons in the parafacial zone. We demonstrate that intermittent bursts in &lt;i&gt;θ&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;δ&lt;/i&gt; rhythms exhibit a complex temporal organization, with long-range power-law correlations and a robust duality of power law (&lt;i&gt;θ&lt;/i&gt;-bursts, active phase) and exponential-like (&lt;i&gt;δ&lt;/i&gt;-bursts, quiescent phase) duration distributions, typical features of non-equilibrium systems self-organizing at criticality. Crucially, such temporal organization relates to anti-correlated coupling between &lt;i&gt;θ&lt;/i&gt;- and &lt;i&gt;δ&lt;/i&gt;-bursts, and is independent of the dominant physiologic state and lesions, a solid indication of a basic principle in sleep dynamics.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/C9mDoTk7BgQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: A coupled autoencoder approach for multi-modal analysis of cell types. (arXiv:1911.05663v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1911.05663</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Recent developments in high throughput profiling of individual neurons have
spurred data driven exploration of the idea that there exist natural groupings
of neurons referred to as cell types. The promise of this idea is that the
immense complexity of brain circuits can be reduced, and effectively studied by
means of interactions between cell types. While clustering of neuron
populations based on a particular data modality can be used to define cell
types, such definitions are often inconsistent across different
characterization modalities. We pose this issue of cross-modal alignment as an
optimization problem and develop an approach based on coupled training of
autoencoders as a framework for such analyses. We apply this framework to a
Patch-seq dataset consisting of transcriptomic and electrophysiological
profiles for the same set of neurons to study consistency of representations
across modalities, and evaluate cross-modal data prediction ability. We explore
the problem where only a subset of neurons is characterized with more than one
modality, and demonstrate that representations learned by coupled autoencoders
can be used to identify types sampled only by a single modality.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Decoding Neural Responses in Mouse Visual Cortex through a Deep Neural Network. (arXiv:1911.05479v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1911.05479</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Finding a code to unravel the population of neural responses that leads to a
distinct animal behavior has been a long-standing question in the field of
neuroscience. With the recent advances in machine learning, it is shown that
the hierarchically Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) perform optimally in decoding
unique features out of complex datasets. In this study, we utilize the power of
a DNN to explore the computational principles in the mammalian brain by
exploiting the Neuropixel data from Allen Brain Institute. We decode the neural
responses from mouse visual cortex to predict the presented stimuli to the
animal for natural (bear, trees, cheetah, etc.) and artificial (drifted
gratings, orientated bars, etc.) classes. Our results indicate that neurons in
mouse visual cortex encode the features of natural and artificial objects in a
distinct manner, and such neural code is consistent across animals. We
investigate this by applying transfer learning to train a DNN on the neural
responses of a single animal and test its generalized performance across
multiple animals. Within a single animal, DNN is able to decode the neural
responses with as much as 100% classification accuracy. Across animals, this
accuracy is reduced to 91%. This study demonstrates the potential of utilizing
the DNN models as a computational framework to understand the neural coding
principles in the mammalian brain.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Self-organized bistability: is it relevant for brain dynamics?. (arXiv:1911.05382v1 [cond-mat.stat-mech])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1911.05382</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Self-organized bistability is the counterpart of &quot;self-organized criticality&quot;
(SOC), for systems tuning themselves to the edge of bistability of a
discontinuous/first-order phase transition, rather than to the critical point
of a continuous/second order one. The equations defining the theory of SOB turn
out to be very similar to a mesoscopic (Landau-Ginzburg) theory recently
proposed to describe the dynamics in the cerebral cortex. This theory describes
the bistable/oscillating neuronal activity of coupled mesoscopic patches of
cortex, homeostatically regulated by short-term synaptic plasticity. However,
the theory for cortex dynamics entails significant differences with respect to
SOB, including the lack of a (bulk) conservation law, the absence of a perfect
separation of timescales between driving and dissipation and, the fact that in
the former there is a parameter that controls the overall system state (in
blatant contrast with the very idea of self-organization). Here, we scrutinize
--by employing a combination of analytical and computational tools-- the
analogies and differences between both theories and explore whether in some
limit SOB could play an important role to explain the emergence of
scale-invariant neuronal avalanches observed empirically in the cortex. We
conclude that actually, in the limit of infinitely slow synaptic-dynamics, the
two theories behave identically, but the separation of timescales required for
the self-organization mechanism to be effective does not seem to be
biologically plausible. We discuss the key differences between
self-organization mechanisms with or without conservation and separated
timescales, and in particular, we scrutinize the implications of our findings
in neuroscience, hopefully shedding new light into the problem of scale
invariance in cortical dynamics.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Learning From Brains How to Regularize Machines. (arXiv:1911.05072v1 [cs.LG])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1911.05072</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Despite impressive performance on numerous visual tasks, Convolutional Neural
Networks (CNNs) --- unlike brains --- are often highly sensitive to small
perturbations of their input, e.g. adversarial noise leading to erroneous
decisions. We propose to regularize CNNs using large-scale neuroscience data to
learn more robust neural features in terms of representational similarity. We
presented natural images to mice and measured the responses of thousands of
neurons from cortical visual areas. Next, we denoised the notoriously variable
neural activity using strong predictive models trained on this large corpus of
responses from the mouse visual system, and calculated the representational
similarity for millions of pairs of images from the model's predictions. We
then used the neural representation similarity to regularize CNNs trained on
image classification by penalizing intermediate representations that deviated
from neural ones. This preserved performance of baseline models when
classifying images under standard benchmarks, while maintaining substantially
higher performance compared to baseline or control models when classifying
noisy images. Moreover, the models regularized with cortical representations
also improved model robustness in terms of adversarial attacks. This
demonstrates that regularizing with neural data can be an effective tool to
create an inductive bias towards more robust inference.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Quantum-Inspired Computing: Can it be a Microscopic Computing Model of the Brain?. (arXiv:1904.10508v2 [q-bio.NC] UPDATED)</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1904.10508</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Quantum computing and the workings of the brain have many aspects in common
and have been attracting increasing attention in academia and industry. The
computation in both is parallel and non-discrete. Though the underlying
physical dynamics (e.g., equation of motion) may be deterministic, the observed
or interpreted outcomes are often probabilistic. Consequently, various
investigations have been undertaken to understand and reproduce the brain on
the basis of quantum physics and computing. However, there have been arguments
on whether the brain can and have to take advantage of quantum phenomena that
need to survive in the macroscopic space-time region at room temperature. This
paper presents a unique microscopic computational model for the brain based on
an ansatz that the brain computes in a manner similar to quantum computing, but
with classical waves. Log-scale encoding of information in the context of
computing with waves is shown to play a critical role in bridging the computing
models with classical and quantum waves. Our quantum-inspired computing model
opens up a possibility of unifying the computing framework of artificial
intelligence and quantum computing beyond quantum machine learning approaches.

	<title>Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Activation of Brainstem Neurons During Mesencephalic Locomotor Region-Evoked Locomotion in the Cat</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2019.00069</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The distribution of locomotor-activated neurons in the brainstem of the cat was studied by c-Fos immunohistochemistry in combination with antibody-based cellular phenotyping following electrical stimulation of the mesencephalic locomotor region (MLR) – the anatomical constituents of which remain debated today, primarily between the cuneiform (CnF) and the pedunculopontine tegmental nuclei (PPT). Effective MLR sites were co-extensive with the CnF nucleus. Animals subject to the locomotor task showed abundant Fos labeling in the CnF, parabrachial nuclei of the subcuneiform region, periaqueductal gray, locus ceruleus (LC)/subceruleus (SubC), Kölliker–Fuse, magnocellular and lateral tegmental fields, raphe, and the parapyramidal region. Labeled neurons were more abundant on the side of stimulation. In some animals, Fos-labeled cells were also observed in the ventral tegmental area, medial and intermediate vestibular nuclei, dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus, n. tractus solitarii, and retrofacial nucleus in the ventrolateral medulla. Many neurons in the reticular formation were innervated by serotonergic fibers. Numerous locomotor-activated neurons in the parabrachial nuclei and LC/SubC/Kölliker–Fuse were noradrenergic. Few cholinergic neurons within the PPT stained for Fos. In the medulla, serotonergic neurons within the parapyramidal region and the nucleus raphe magnus were positive for Fos. Control animals, not subject to locomotion, showed few Fos-labeled neurons in these areas. The current study provides positive evidence for a role for the CnF in the initiation of locomotion while providing little evidence for the participation of the PPT. The results also show that MLR-evoked locomotion involves the parallel activation of reticular and monoaminergic neurons in the pons/medulla, and provides the anatomical and functional basis for spinal monoamine release during evoked locomotion. Lastly, the results indicate that vestibular, cardiovascular, and respiratory centers are centrally activated during MLR-evoked locomotion. Altogether, the results show a complex pattern of neuromodulatory influences of brainstem neurons by electrical activation of the MLR.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2019.00277</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The brain is a genomic mosaic. Cell-to-cell genomic differences, which are the result of somatic mutations during development and aging, contribute to cellular diversity in the nervous system. This genomic diversity has important implications for nervous system development, function, and disease. Brain somatic mosaicism might contribute to individualized behavioral phenotypes and has been associated with several neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders. Therefore, understanding the causes and consequences of somatic mosaicism in neural circuits is of great interest. Recent advances in 3D cell culture technology have provided new means to study human organ development and various human pathologies in vitro. Cerebral organoids (“mini-brains”) are pluripotent stem cell-derived 3D culture systems that recapitulate, to some extent, the developmental processes and organization of the developing human brain. Here, I discuss the application of these neural organoids for modeling brain somatic mosaicism in a lab dish. Special emphasis is given to the potential role of microglial mutations in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Integrative Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Mild Mechanic Stimulate on Acupoints Regulation of CGRP-Positive Cells and Microglia Morphology in Spinal Cord of Sciatic Nerve Injured Rats</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnint.2019.00058</link>
	<content:encoded>Objective&lt;p&gt;The objective of this study is to observe the effects of mild mechanical stimulation on acupuncture points of spinal motor neurons and active substances of sciatic nerve injury in rats, and to explore the morphological basis for the recovery of motor function in rats with sciatic nerve injury, using mild acupuncture. Acupuncture in the local area of injury may cause further damage to the peripheral nerve injury. We believe that mild mechanical stimulation on the surface, using some specific acupuncture points can also have a positive effect on nerve repair. This method, called Chinese tuina, has existed for more than 2,000 years in China.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;This study establishes a rat model using sciatic nerve crush injury. Rats received Chinese tuina in accordance with the principle of the three methods and three points, once a day, for 20 days. The rats’ status of hindlimb recovery was detected by a sciatic functional index. The labeled neuronal cell body was used to evaluate the fiber recovery after the rats’ sciatic nerve injury, using a neural tracing technique. Our team studied motor neuronal cell bodies, CGRP-positive cells, and the microglia of damaged sciatic nerves which were stained with fluorescent triple staining, adopting a confocal multi-layer scanning technique, and then the changes in neuronal activity distribution and expression, and changes of time and treatment were described, using the method of morphological description.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Sciatic nerve injury decreased the survival rate of motor neurons, affected CGRP-positive cells, and activated microglia in the ventral horn of the spinal cord. Compared with the model group, the survival of spinal ventral horn motor neurons was increased through tuina intervention. The swelling of CGRP-positive cells was alleviated, and the degree of microglia activation was less than that of the model group.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;This study used visual morphological findings to assess changes in neurons and active substances with time after injury of the peripheral nerve, and demonstrated that peripheral mild acupuncture intervention improved the capacity of neurofibrillary axoplasmic transport, regulated microglia activation, and significantly promoted the recovery of sciatic nerve injury.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.01224</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;As the number of older adults increases, the prevalence of dementias, such as Alzheimer’s dementia (AD), vascular dementia, dementia with Lewy bodies, and frontotemporal dementias, also increases. Despite research into pharmacological approaches for treating diverse diseases, there is still no cure. Recently, novel non-pharmacological interventions are attracting attention. Non-pharmacological approaches include cognitive stimulation, alterations in diet, physical activity, and social engagement. Cognitive stimulating activities protect against the negative effects of cognitive decline caused by age-related neurogenerative diseases. Bilingualism is one form of cognitive stimulation that requires multiple aspects of brain activity and has been shown to delay the onset of dementia symptoms in patients by approximately 4–5 years as compared with monolingual patients through cognitive reserve. The purpose of this review was to bilingualism protects against cognitive decline associated with AD and other dementias. We discuss potential underlying neurological mechanisms, including: (1) stimulating adult neurogenesis, (2) enhancing synaptogenesis, (3) strengthening functional connectivity that bilingualism may delay clinical AD symptoms, (4) protecting white matter integrity, and (5) preserving gray matter density.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Brain Imaging Methods section | New and Recent Articles: Unfolding the Effects of Acute Cardiovascular Exercise on Neural Correlates of Motor Learning Using Convolutional Neural Networks</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.01215</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Cardiovascular exercise is known to promote the consolidation of newly acquired motor skills. Previous studies seeking to understand the neural correlates underlying motor memory consolidation that is modulated by exercise, have relied so far on using traditional statistical approaches for a priori selected features from neuroimaging data, including EEG. With recent advances in machine learning, data-driven techniques such as deep learning have shown great potential for EEG data decoding for brain-computer interfaces, but have not been explored in the context of exercise. Here, we present a novel Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based pipeline for analysis of EEG data to study the brain areas and spectral EEG measures modulated by exercise. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first one to demonstrate the ability of CNNs to be trained in a limited sample size setting. Our approach revealed discriminative spectral features within a refined frequency band (27–29 Hz) as compared to the wider beta bandwidth (15–30 Hz), which is commonly used in data analyses, as well as corresponding brain regions that were modulated by exercise. These results indicate the presence of finer EEG spectral features that could have been overlooked using conventional hypothesis-driven statistical approaches. Our study thus demonstrates the feasibility of using deep network architectures for neuroimaging analysis, even in small-scale studies, to identify robust brain biomarkers and investigate neuroscience-based questions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Neural Technology section | New and Recent Articles: Effect of Theta Transcranial Alternating Current Stimulation and Phase-Locked Transcranial Pulsed Current Stimulation on Learning and Cognitive Control</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.01181</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) is emerging as a robust treatment alternative for major depressive disorder, with a potential for achieving higher remission rates by providing targeted stimulation to underlying brain networks, such as the salience network (SN). Growing evidence suggests that these therapeutic effects are dependent on the frequency and phase synchrony between SN oscillations and stimulation as well as the task-specific state of the SN during stimulation. However, the development of phase-synchronized non-invasive stimulation has proved challenging until recently. Here, we use a phase-locked pulsed brain stimulation approach to study the effects of two NIBS methods: transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) versus phase-locked transcranial pulsed current stimulation (tPCS), on the SN during an SN activating task. 20 healthy volunteers participated in the study. Each volunteer partook in four sessions, receiving one stimulation type at random (theta-tACS, peak tPCS, trough tPCS or sham) while undergoing a learning game, followed by an unstimulated test based on learned material. Each session lasted approximately 1.5 h, with an interval of at least 2 days to allow for washout and to avoid cross-over effects. Our results showed no statistically significant effect of stimulation on the event related potential (ERP) recordings, resting electroencephalogram (EEG), and the performance of the volunteers. While stimulation effects were not apparent in this study, the nominal performance of the phase-locking algorithm offers a technical foundation for further research in determining effective stimulation paradigms and conditions. Specifically, future work should investigate stronger stimulation and true task-specific stimulation of SN nodes responsible for the task as well as their recording. If refined, NIBS could offer an effective, homebased treatment option.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Neural Processes of Proactive and Reactive Controls Modulated by Motor-Skill Experiences</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2019.00404</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;This study investigated the experience of open and closed motor skills on modulating proactive and reactive control processes in task switching. Fifty-four participants who were open-skilled (n = 18) or closed-skilled athletes (n = 18) or non-athletic adults (n = 18) completed a cued task-switching paradigm task. This task tapped into proactive or reactive controls of executive functions under different validity conditions. Electroencephalograms of the participants were captured during the task. In the 100% validity condition, the open-skilled participants showed significantly lower switch cost of response time than the closed-skilled and control participants. Results showed that the open-skilled participants had less positive-going parietal cue-locked P3 in the switch than repeat trials. Participants in the control group showed more positive-going cue-locked P3 in the switch than repeat trials, whereas the closed-skilled participants had no significant differences between the two types of trials. In the 50% validity condition, the open- and closed-skilled participants had less switch cost of response time than the control participants. Participants in the open- and closed-skilled groups showed less positive-going parietal stimulus-locked P3 in the switch than repeat trials, which was not the case for those in the control group. Our findings confirm the dissociation between proactive and reactive controls in relation to their modulations by the different motor-skill experiences. Both proactive and reactive controls of executive functions could be strengthened by exposing individuals to anticipatory or non-anticipatory enriched environments, suggesting proactive and reactive controls involved in motor-skill development seem to be transferable to domain-general executive functions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Estimating Cognitive Workload in an Interactive Virtual Reality Environment Using EEG</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2019.00401</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;With the recent surge of affordable, high-performance virtual reality (VR) headsets, there is unlimited potential for applications ranging from education, to training, to entertainment, to fitness and beyond. As these interfaces continue to evolve, passive user-state monitoring can play a key role in expanding the immersive VR experience, and tracking activity for user well-being. By recording physiological signals such as the electroencephalogram (EEG) during use of a VR device, the user's interactions in the virtual environment could be adapted in real-time based on the user's cognitive state. Current VR headsets provide a logical, convenient, and unobtrusive framework for mounting EEG sensors. The present study evaluates the feasibility of passively monitoring cognitive workload via EEG while performing a classical n-back task in an interactive VR environment. Data were collected from 15 participants and the spatio-spectral EEG features were analyzed with respect to task performance. The results indicate that scalp measurements of electrical activity can effectively discriminate three workload levels, even after suppression of a co-varying high-frequency activity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Distinguishing Old From New Referents During Discourse Comprehension: Evidence From ERPs and Oscillations</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2019.00398</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In this EEG study, we used pre-registered and exploratory ERP and time-frequency analyses to investigate the resolution of anaphoric and non-anaphoric noun phrases during discourse comprehension. Participants listened to story contexts that described two antecedents, and subsequently read a target sentence with a critical noun phrase that lexically matched one antecedent (‘old’), matched two antecedents (‘ambiguous’), partially matched one antecedent in terms of semantic features (‘partial-match’), or introduced another referent (non-anaphoric, ‘new’). After each target sentence, participants judged whether the noun referred back to an antecedent (i.e., an ‘old/new’ judgment), which was easiest for ambiguous nouns and hardest for partially matching nouns. The noun-elicited N400 ERP component demonstrated initial sensitivity to repetition and semantic overlap, corresponding to repetition and semantic priming effects, respectively. New and partially matching nouns both elicited a subsequent frontal positivity, which suggested that partially matching anaphors may have been processed as new nouns temporarily. ERPs in an even later time window and ERPs time-locked to sentence-final words suggested that new and partially matching nouns had different effects on comprehension, with partially matching nouns incurring additional processing costs up to the end of the sentence. In contrast to the ERP results, the time-frequency results primarily demonstrated sensitivity to noun repetition, and did not differentiate partially matching anaphors from new nouns. In sum, our results show the ERP and time-frequency effects of referent repetition during discourse comprehension, and demonstrate the potentially demanding nature of establishing the anaphoric meaning of a novel noun.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Prediction and Mismatch Negativity Responses Reflect Impairments in Action Semantic Processing in Adults With Autism Spectrum Disorders</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2019.00395</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The neurophysiological mechanisms underlying motor and language difficulties in autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are still largely unclear. The present work investigates biological indicators of sound processing, (action-) semantic understanding and predictive coding and their correlation with clinical symptoms of ASD. Twenty-two adults with high-functioning ASD and 25 typically developed (TD) participants engaged in an auditory, passive listening, Mismatch Negativity (MMN) task while high-density electroencephalography (EEG) was recorded. Action and non-action words were presented in the context of sounds, which were either semantically congruent with regard to the body part they relate to or semantically incongruent or unrelated. The anticipatory activity before sound onset, the Prediction Potential (PP), was significantly reduced in the ASD group specifically for action, but not for non-action sounds. The early-MMN-like responses to words (latency: 120 ms) were differentially modulated across groups: controls showed larger amplitudes for words in action-sound compared to non-action contexts, whereas ASD participants demonstrated enlarged early-MMN-like responses only in a pure tone context, with no other modulation dependent on action sound context. Late-MMN-like responses around 560 ms post-stimulus onset revealed body-part-congruent action-semantic priming for words in control participants, but not in the ASD group. Importantly, neurophysiological indices of semantic priming in ASD participants correlated with the extent of autistic traits as revealed by the Autism Spectrum Quotient (AQ). The data suggest that high-functioning adults with ASD show a specific deficit in semantic processing and predictive coding of sounds and words related to action, which is absent for neutral, non-action, sounds.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Phonological awareness skills in children with reading difficulty (RD) may reflect impaired automatic integration of orthographic and phonological representations. However, little is known about the underlying neural mechanisms involved in phonological awareness for children with RD. Eighteen children with RD, ages 9–13, participated in a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study designed to assess the relationship of two constructs of phonological awareness, phoneme synthesis, and phoneme analysis, with crossmodal rhyme judgment. Participants completed a rhyme judgment task presented in two modality conditions; unimodal auditory only and crossmodal audiovisual. Measures of phonological awareness were correlated with unimodal, but not crossmodal, lexical processing. Moreover, these relationships were found only in unisensory brain regions, and not in multisensory brain areas. The results of this study suggest that children with RD rely on unimodal representations and unisensory brain areas, and provide insight into the role of phonemic awareness in mapping between auditory and visual modalities during literacy acquisition.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: EEG-Based Brain Functional Connectivity in First-Episode Schizophrenia Patients, Ultra-High-Risk Individuals, and Healthy Controls During P50 Suppression</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2019.00379</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Dysfunctional processing of auditory sensory gating has generally been found in schizophrenic patients and ultra-high-risk (UHR) individuals. The aim of the study was to investigate the differences of functional interaction between brain regions and performance during the P50 sensory gating in UHR group compared with those in first-episode schizophrenia patients (FESZ) and healthy controls (HC) groups. The study included 128-channel scalp Electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings during the P50 auditory paradigm for 35 unmedicated FESZ, 30 drug-free UHR, and 40 HC. Cortical sources of scalp electrical activity were recomputed using exact low-resolution electromagnetic tomography (eLORETA), and functional brain networks were built at the source level and compared between the groups (FESZ, UHR, HC). A classifier using decision tree was designed for differentiating the three groups, which uses demographic characteristics, MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery parameters, behavioral features in P50 paradigm, and the measures of functional brain networks based on graph theory during P50 sensory gating. The results showed that very few brain connectivities were significantly different between FESZ and UHR groups during P50 sensory gating, and that a large number of brain connectivities were significantly different between FESZ and HC groups and between UHR and HC groups. Furthermore, the FESZ group had a stronger connection in the right superior frontal gyrus and right insula than the HC group. And the UHR group had an enhanced connection in the paracentral lobule and the middle temporal gyrus compared with the HC group. Moreover, comparison of classification analysis results showed that brain network metrics during P50 sensory gating can improve the accuracy of the classification for FESZ, UHR and HC groups. Our findings provide insight into the mechanisms of P50 suppression in schizophrenia and could potentially improve the performance of early identification and diagnosis of schizophrenia for the earliest intervention.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2019.00511</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The amygdala is an important center of fear learning and memory and plays a critical role in regulating stress disorders. Previous studies have shown that changes in the amygdala caused by stress are an important cause of mental disorders including anxiety, but the specific mechanism remains unclear. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate whether mental disorders induced by stress are related to γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic neuron damage in the basolateral amygdala (BLA) and whether endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS) is involved in the injury process. Rat models of different durations of stress were established by restraint and forced ice-water swimming. Behavioral tests and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) were used to detect anxiety in rats and changes in neurotransmitter levels in the BLA. Morphological approaches and microscopy-based multicolor tissue cytometry (MMTC) were used to detect the damage-induced changes in GABAergic neurons in the BLA. Immunofluorescence double labeling was used to detect the expression of ERS-related proteins before and after the inhibition of protein kinase R-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK) pathway. Stress resulted in damage to GABAergic neurons in the BLA, decreased GABA and increased glutamic acid (GLU) levels, perturbation of the excitation/inhibition (E/I) ratio in the BLA, and obvious anxiety disorders in rats. Moreover, ERS-mediated GABAergic neuron injury was an important cause of neurotransmitter level changes in the BLA. These results suggested that ERS-mediated GABAergic neuron injury in the BLA may be an important cause of stress-induced mental disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: NMDAR and JNK Activation in the Spinal Trigeminal Nucleus Caudalis Contributes to Masseter Hyperalgesia Induced by Stress</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2019.00495</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;It is commonly accepted that psychological stress is closely associated with the occurrence and development of chronic orofacial pain. However, the pathogenesis underlying this process has not been fully elucidated. In the present study, we explored the role of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) and Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) mediated intercellular communication between neurons and astrocytes in the spinal trigeminal nucleus caudalis (Vc) in the induction of masseter hyperalgesia by psychological stress in rats. We found that subjecting rats to 14 days of restraint stress (8 h/d) caused a significant decrease in body weight gain, behavioral changes and marked masseter hyperalgesia in the rats. We also found that exposure to restraint stress for 14 days caused the expression of pJNK in astrocytes in the Vc to significantly increase, and intrathecally infusing a JNK inhibitor significantly prevented restraint stress-induced masseter hyperalgesia in the rats. In addition, after exposure to restraint stress for 14 days, the stressed group exhibited a noticeably increased expression level of pNR2B in neurons in the Vc. Then, we intrathecally injected MK-801 (an NMDAR inhibitor) and ifenprodil (a selective NR2B subunit antagonist) and observed that the two types of inhibitors not only alleviated masseter hyperalgesia but also significantly inhibited the phosphorylation of JNK in the Vc after restraint stress; this indicates that the effect of NMDAR antagonists may influence the activation of astrocytic JNK. Furthermore, inhibitors of neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) activation and guanylate cyclase (GC) inhibitor could not only inhibit the expression of pJNK in the Vc, but also effectively alleviate masseter hyperalgesia induced by restraint stress. Taken together, our results suggest that NMDAR activation could increase JNK phosphorylation in astrocytes after restraint stress, which may depend on the nNOS-GC pathway. The intercellular communication between neurons and astrocytes in the Vc may play a key role in the induction of masseter muscle hyperalgesia by psychological stress in rats.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/51401</link>
	<content:encoded>Cholesterol is a major structural component of the plasma membrane (PM). The majority of PM cholesterol forms complexes with other PM lipids, making it inaccessible for intracellular transport. Transition of PM cholesterol between accessible and inaccessible pools maintains cellular homeostasis, but how cells monitor PM cholesterol accessibility remains unclear. We show that endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-anchored lipid transfer proteins, the GRAMD1s, sense and transport accessible PM cholesterol to the ER. GRAMD1s bind one another and populate at ER-PM contacts by sensing a transient expansion of the accessible pool of PM cholesterol via GRAM domains and facilitate its transport via StART-like domains. Cells lacking all three GRAMD1s exhibit striking expansion of the accessible pool of PM cholesterol due to less efficient PM to ER transport of accessible cholesterol. Thus, GRAMD1s facilitate movement of accessible PM cholesterol to the ER in order to counteract acute increase of PM cholesterol, activating non-vesicular cholesterol transport.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: latest articles: The ion selectivity filter is not an activation gate in TRPV1-3 channels</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/51212</link>
	<content:encoded>Activation of TRPV1 channels in sensory neurons results in opening of a cation permeation pathway that triggers the sensation of pain. Opening of TRPV1 has been proposed to involve two gates that appear to prevent ion permeation in the absence of activators: the ion selectivity filter on the external side of the pore and the S6 helices that line the cytosolic half of the pore. Here we measured the access of thiol-reactive ions and compounds across the selectivity filters in rodent TRPV1-3 channels. Although our results are consistent with structural evidence that the selectivity filters in these channels are dynamic, they demonstrate that cations can permeate the ion selectivity filters even when channels are closed. Our results suggest that the selectivity filters in TRPV1-3 channels do not function as activation gates but might contribute to coupling structural rearrangements in the external pore to those in the cytosolic S6 gate.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: latest articles: Direct binding of phosphatidylglycerol at specific sites modulates desensitization of a ligand-gated ion channel</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/50766</link>
	<content:encoded>Pentameric ligand-gated ion channels (pLGICs) are essential determinants of synaptic transmission, and are modulated by specific lipids including anionic phospholipids. The exact modulatory effect of anionic phospholipids in pLGICs and the mechanism of this effect are not well understood. Using native mass spectrometry, coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations and functional assays, we show that the anionic phospholipid, 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl phosphatidylglycerol (POPG), preferentially binds to and stabilizes the pLGIC, Erwinia ligand-gated ion channel (ELIC), and decreases ELIC desensitization. Mutations of five arginines located in the interfacial regions of the transmembrane domain (TMD) reduce POPG binding, and a subset of these mutations increase ELIC desensitization. In contrast, a mutation that decreases ELIC desensitization, increases POPG binding. The results support a mechanism by which POPG stabilizes the open state of ELIC relative to the desensitized state by direct binding at specific sites.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: latest articles: Shifts in myeloarchitecture characterise adolescent development of cortical gradients</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/50482</link>
	<content:encoded>We studied an accelerated longitudinal cohort of adolescents and young adults (n = 234, two time points) to investigate dynamic reconfigurations in myeloarchitecture. Intracortical profiles were generated using magnetization transfer (MT) data, a myelin-sensitive magnetic resonance imaging contrast. Mixed-effect models of depth specific intracortical profiles demonstrated two separate processes i) overall increases in MT, and ii) flattening of the MT profile related to enhanced signal in mid-to-deeper layers, especially in heteromodal and unimodal association cortices. This development was independent of morphological changes. Enhanced MT in mid-to-deeper layers was found to spatially co-localise specifically with gene expression markers of oligodendrocytes. Interregional covariance analysis revealed that these intracortical changes contributed to a gradual differentiation of higher-order from lower-order systems. Depth-dependent trajectories of intracortical myeloarchitectural development contribute to the maturation of structural hierarchies in the human neocortex, providing a model for adolescent development that bridges microstructural and macroscopic scales of brain organisation.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/49787</link>
	<content:encoded>The β-barrel assembly machine (Bam) complex in Gram-negative bacteria and its counterparts in mitochondria and chloroplasts fold and insert outer membrane β-barrel proteins. BamA, an essential component of the complex, is itself a β-barrel and is proposed to play a central role in assembling other barrel substrates. Here, we map the path of substrate insertion by the Bam complex using site-specific crosslinking to understand the molecular mechanisms that control β-barrel folding and release. We find that the C-terminal strand of the substrate is stably held by BamA and that the N-terminal strands of the substrate are assembled inside the BamA β-barrel. Importantly, we identify contacts between the assembling β-sheet and the BamA interior surface that determine the rate of substrate folding. Our results support a model in which the interior wall of BamA acts as a chaperone to catalyze β-barrel assembly.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: latest articles: Stimulating the hippocampal posterior-medial network enhances task-dependent connectivity and memory</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/49458</link>
	<content:encoded>Successful episodic memory involves dynamic increases in activity across distributed hippocampal networks, including the posterior-medial (PMN) and the anterior-temporal (ATN) networks. We tested whether this up-regulation of functional connectivity during memory processing can be enhanced within hippocampal networks by noninvasive stimulation, and whether such task-dependent connectivity enhancement predicts memory improvement. Participants received stimulation targeting the PMN or an out-of-network control location. We compared the effects of stimulation on fMRI connectivity during an autobiographical retrieval task versus during rest within the PMN and the ATN. PMN-targeted stimulation significantly increased connectivity during autobiographical retrieval versus rest within the PMN. This effect was not observed in the ATN, or in either network following control stimulation. Task-dependent increases in connectivity within the medial temporal lobe predicted improved performance of a separate episodic memory test. It is therefore possible to enhance the task-dependent regulation of hippocampal network connectivity that supports memory processing using noninvasive stimulation.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: latest articles: Nitric oxide acts as a cotransmitter in a subset of dopaminergic neurons to diversify memory dynamics</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/49257</link>
	<content:encoded>Animals employ diverse learning rules and synaptic plasticity dynamics to record temporal and statistical information about the world. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying this diversity are poorly understood. The anatomically defined compartments of the insect mushroom body function as parallel units of associative learning, with different learning rates, memory decay dynamics and flexibility (Aso &amp;amp; Rubin 2016). Here we show that nitric oxide (NO) acts as a neurotransmitter in a subset of dopaminergic neurons in &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt;. NO's effects develop more slowly than those of dopamine and depend on soluble guanylate cyclase in postsynaptic Kenyon cells. NO acts antagonistically to dopamine; it shortens memory retention and facilitates the rapid updating of memories. The interplay of NO and dopamine enables memories stored in local domains along Kenyon cell axons to be specialized for predicting the value of odors based only on recent events. Our results provide key mechanistic insights into how diverse memory dynamics are established in parallel memory systems.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Cortical state transitions and stimulus response evolve along stiff and sloppy parameter dimensions, respectively</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/839365v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Previous research showed that spontaneous neuronal activity presents sloppiness: the collective behavior is strongly determined by a small number of parameter combinations, defined as &quot;stiff&quot; dimensions, while it is insensitive to many others (&quot;sloppy&quot; dimensions). Here, we analyzed neural population activity from the auditory cortex of anesthetized rats while the brain spontaneously transited through different synchronized and desynchronized states and intermittently received sensory inputs. We showed that cortical state transitions were determined by changes in stiff parameters associated with the activity of a core of neurons with low responses to stimuli and high centrality within the observed network. In contrast, stimulus-evoked responses evolved along sloppy dimensions associated with the activity of neurons with low centrality and displaying large ongoing and stimulus-evoked fluctuations without affecting the integrity of the network. Our results shed light on the interplay among stability, flexibility, and responsiveness of neuronal collective dynamics during intrinsic and induced activity.</content:encoded>

Modeling cell differentiation from omics data is an essential problem in systems biology research. Although many algorithms have been established to analyze scRNA-seq data, approaches to infer the pseudo-time of cells or quantify their potency have not yet been satisfactorily solved. Here, we propose the Landscape of Differentiation Dynamics (LDD) method, which calculates cell potentials and constructs their differentiation landscape by a continuous birth-death process from scRNA-seq data. From the viewpoint of stochastic dynamics, we exploited the features of the differentiation process and quantified the differentiation landscape based on the source-sink diffusion process. In comparison with other scRNA-seq methods in seven benchmark datasets, we found that LDD could accurately and efficiently build the evolution tree of cells with pseudo-time, in particular quantifying their differentiation landscape in terms of potency. This study provides not only a computational tool to quantify cell potency or the Waddington potential landscape based on scRNA-seq data, but also novel insights to understand the cell differentiation process from a dynamic perspective.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/uxtx5LmmfKg&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Impairment of Sharp-Wave Ripples in a Murine Model of Dravet Syndrome</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/46/9251?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Dravet syndrome (DS) is a severe early-onset epilepsy associated with heterozygous loss-of-function mutations in &lt;i&gt;SCN1A&lt;/i&gt;. Animal models of DS with global &lt;i&gt;Scn1a&lt;/i&gt; haploinsufficiency recapitulate the DS phenotype, including seizures, premature death, and impaired spatial memory performance. Spatial memory requires hippocampal sharp-wave ripples (SPW-Rs), which consist of high-frequency field potential oscillations (ripples, 100–260 Hz) superimposed on a slower SPW. Published &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; electrophysiologic recordings in DS mice demonstrate reduced firing of GABAergic inhibitory neurons, which are essential for the formation of SPW-R complexes. Here, &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; electrophysiologic recordings of hippocampal local field potential in both male and female mice demonstrate that &lt;i&gt;Scn1a&lt;/i&gt; haploinsufficiency slows intrinsic ripple frequency and reduces the rate of SPW-R occurrence. In DS mice, peak ripple-band power is shifted to lower frequencies, average intertrough intervals of individually detected ripples are slower, and the rate of SPW-R generation is reduced, while SPW amplitude remains unaffected. These alterations in SPW-R properties, in combination with published reductions in interneuron function in DS, suggest a direct link between reduced inhibitory neuron excitability and impaired SPW-R function. A simple interconnected, conductance-based &lt;i&gt;in silico&lt;/i&gt; interneuron network model was used to determine whether reduced sodium conductance is sufficient to slow ripple frequency, and stimulation with a modeled SPW demonstrates that reduced sodium conductance alone is sufficient to slow oscillatory frequencies. These findings forge a potential mechanistic link between impaired SPW-R generation and &lt;i&gt;Scn1a&lt;/i&gt; mutation in DS mice, expanding the set of disorders in which SPW-R dysfunction contributes to impaired memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Disruption of sharp-wave ripples, a characteristic hippocampal rhythm coordinated by the precise timing of GABAergic interneurons, impairs spatial learning and memory. Prior &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; patch-clamp recordings in brain slices from genetic mouse models of Dravet syndrome (DS) reveal reduced sodium current and excitability in GABAergic interneurons but not excitatory cells, suggesting a causal role for impaired interneuron activity in seizures and cognitive impairment. Here, heterozygous &lt;i&gt;Scn1a&lt;/i&gt; mutation in DS mice reduces hippocampal sharp-wave ripple occurrence and slows internal ripple frequency &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; and a simple &lt;i&gt;in silico&lt;/i&gt; model demonstrates reduction in interneuron function alone is sufficient to slow model oscillations. Together, these findings provide a plausible pathophysiologic mechanism for &lt;i&gt;Scn1a&lt;/i&gt; gene mutation to impair spatial memory.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Minimizing Precision-Weighted Sensory Prediction Errors via Memory Formation and Switching in Motor Adaptation</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/46/9237?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Humans predict the sensory consequences of motor commands by learning internal models of the body and of environment perturbations. When facing a sensory prediction error, should we attribute this error to a change in our body, and update the body internal model, or to a change in the environment? In the latter case, should we update an existing perturbation model or create a new model? Here, we propose that a decision-making process compares the models' prediction errors, weighted by their precisions, to select and update either the body model or an existing perturbation model. When no model can predict a perturbation, a new perturbation model is created and selected. When a model is selected, both the prediction's mean estimate and uncertainty are updated to minimize future prediction errors and to increase the precision of the predictions. Results from computer simulations, which we verified in an arm visuomotor adaptation experiment with subjects of both sexes, account for short aftereffects and large savings after adaptation to large, but not small, perturbations. Results also clarify previous data in the absence of errors (error-clamp): motor memories show an initial lack of decay after a large perturbation, but gradual decay after a small perturbation. Finally, qualitative individual differences in adaptation were explained by subjects selecting and updating either the body model or a perturbation model. Our results suggest that motor adaptation belongs to a general class of learning according to which memories are created when no existing memories can predict sensory data accurately and precisely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; When movements are followed by unexpected outcomes, such as following the introduction of a visuomotor or a force field perturbation, or the sudden removal of such perturbations, it is unclear whether the CNS updates existing memories or creates new memories. Here, we propose a novel model of adaptation, and investigate, via computer simulations and behavioral experiments, how the amplitude and schedule of the perturbation, as well as the characteristics of the learner, lead to the selection and update of existing memories or the creation of new memories. Our results provide insights into a number of puzzling and contradictory motor adaptation data, as well as into qualitative individual differences in adaptation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Hemispheric Asymmetry of Globus Pallidus Relates to Alpha Modulation in Reward-Related Attentional Tasks</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/46/9221?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Whereas subcortical structures such as the basal ganglia have been widely explored in relation to motor control, recent evidence suggests that their mechanisms extend to the domain of attentional switching. We here investigated the subcortical involvement in reward related top-down control of visual alpha-band oscillations (8–13 Hz), which have been consistently linked to mechanisms supporting the allocation of visuospatial attention. Given that items associated with contextual saliency (e.g., monetary reward or loss) attract attention, it is not surprising that the acquired salience of visual items further modulates. The executive networks controlling such reward-dependent modulations of oscillatory brain activity have yet to be fully elucidated. Although such networks have been explored in terms of corticocortical interactions, subcortical regions are likely to be involved. To uncover this, we combined MRI and MEG data from 17 male and 11 female participants, investigating whether derived measures of subcortical structural asymmetries predict interhemispheric modulation of alpha power during a spatial attention task. We show that volumetric hemispheric lateralization of globus pallidus (GP) and thalamus (Th) explains individual hemispheric biases in the ability to modulate posterior alpha power. Importantly, for the GP, this effect became stronger when the value saliency parings in the task increased. Our findings suggest that the GP and Th in humans are part of a subcortical executive control network, differentially involved in modulating posterior alpha activity in the presence of saliency. Further investigation aimed at uncovering the interaction between subcortical and neocortical attentional networks would provide useful insight in future studies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Whereas the involvement of subcortical regions into higher level cognitive processing, such as attention and reward attribution, has been already indicated in previous studies, little is known about its relationship with the functional oscillatory underpinnings of said processes. In particular, interhemispheric modulation of alpha band (8–13 Hz) oscillations, as recorded with magnetoencephalography, has been previously shown to vary as a function of salience (i.e., monetary reward/loss) in a spatial attention task. We here provide novel insights into the link between subcortical and cortical control of visual attention. Using the same reward-related spatial attention paradigm, we show that the volumetric lateralization of subcortical structures (specifically globus pallidus and thalamus) explains individual biases in the modulation of visual alpha activity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: The Abused Inhalant Toluene Impairs Medial Prefrontal Cortex Activity and Risk/Reward Decision-Making during a Probabilistic Discounting Task</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/46/9207?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Inhalant (e.g., toluene) misuse is linked to behavioral and cognitive deficits in humans, yet preclinical studies of the effect of inhalants on higher-order cognition are limited. We addressed this gap in the literature by examining the effect of toluene vapor exposure on risk/reward decision-making in male and female Sprague-Dawley rats using a probabilistic discounting task. In this task, rodents chose a risky/large reward or a safe/small reward, with the odds of risky reinforcement descending or ascending throughout the test session. We observed a dose-dependent, sex-independent deficit in behavioral flexibility during probabilistic discounting caused by acute toluene exposure. Rats exposed to toluene vapor during adolescence and tested as adults performed comparably to air-treated controls and were susceptible to the effects of an acute toluene challenge. These behavioral flexibility deficits observed suggests dysfunctional medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) activity. To address this hypothesis, we virally expressed the genetically encoded calcium sensor GCaMP6f in glutamatergic mPFC neurons and monitored calcium transients in real-time using &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; fiber photometry. mPFC activity peaked before either lever press during free-choice trials in toluene- and air-treated animals. During forced-choice trials, GCaMP6f transients shifted from pre-risky to pre-safe choice, an effect mitigated by acute toluene exposure. mPFC activity decreased during rewarded trials, with larger decreases following risky/large wins compared with safe/small wins. Toluene-treated animals also had decreased mPFC activity during rewarded trials, but there was no distinction between risky/large wins and safe/small wins. These results provide physiological evidence for mPFC-dependent behavioral deficits caused by toluene.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Inhalants (e.g., toluene) are an understudied class of drugs of abuse that cause devastating behavioral and cognitive deficits in humans. Understanding the neurobiological interactions of toluene vapor using animal models is important for developing effective treatment strategies for inhalant addicts. Here we find that toluene vapor reduces behavioral flexibility in rodents making risk/reward-based decisions. The medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) drives behavioral flexibility during this type of decision-making and we show that toluene reduces the ability of mPFC neurons to track optimal choices as reward probabilities change. Toluene also reduces these neurons' ability to distinguish between small and large rewards. A combination of these factors likely leads to the impaired performance in probabilistic discounting following acute toluene exposure.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Functional Localization of the Frontal Eye Fields in the Common Marmoset Using Microstimulation</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/46/9197?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The frontal eye field (FEF) is a critical region for the deployment of overt and covert spatial attention. Although investigations in the macaque continue to provide insight into the neural underpinnings of the FEF, due to its location within a sulcus, the macaque FEF is virtually inaccessible to electrophysiological techniques such as high-density and laminar recordings. With a largely lissencephalic cortex, the common marmoset (&lt;i&gt;Callithrix jacchus&lt;/i&gt;) is a promising alternative primate model for studying FEF microcircuitry. Putative homologies have been established with the macaque FEF on the basis of cytoarchitecture and connectivity; however, physiological investigation in awake, behaving marmosets is necessary to physiologically locate this area. Here, we addressed this gap using intracortical microstimulation in a broad range of frontal cortical areas in three adult marmosets (two males, one female). We implanted marmosets with 96-channel Utah arrays and applied microstimulation trains while they freely viewed video clips. We evoked short-latency fixed vector saccades at low currents (&amp;lt;50 μA) in areas 45, 8aV, 8C, and 6DR. We observed a topography of saccade direction and amplitude consistent with findings in macaques and humans: small saccades in ventrolateral FEF and large saccades combined with contralateral neck and shoulder movements encoded in dorsomedial FEF. Our data provide compelling evidence supporting homology between marmoset and macaque FEF and suggest that the marmoset is a useful primate model for investigating FEF microcircuitry and its contributions to oculomotor and cognitive functions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The frontal eye field (FEF) is a critical cortical region for overt and covert spatial attention. The microcircuitry of this area remains poorly understood because in the macaque, the most commonly used model, it is embedded within a sulcus and is inaccessible to modern electrophysiological and imaging techniques. The common marmoset is a promising alternative primate model due to its lissencephalic cortex and potential for genetic manipulation. However, evidence for homologous cortical areas in this model remains limited and unclear. Here, we applied microstimulation in frontal cortical areas in marmosets to physiologically identify FEF. Our results provide compelling evidence for an FEF in the marmoset and suggest that the marmoset is a useful model for investigating FEF microcircuitry.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Fine-Grained Mapping of Cortical Somatotopies in Chronic Complex Regional Pain Syndrome</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/46/9185?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;It has long been thought that severe chronic pain conditions, such as complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS), are not only associated with, but even maintained by a reorganization of the somatotopic representation of the affected limb in primary somatosensory cortex (S1). This notion has driven treatments that aim to restore S1 representations in CRPS patients, such as sensory discrimination training and mirror therapy. However, this notion is based on both indirect and incomplete evidence obtained with imaging methods with low spatial resolution. Here, we used fMRI to characterize the S1 representation of the affected and unaffected hand in humans (of either sex) with unilateral CRPS. The cortical area, location, and geometry of the S1 representation of the CRPS hand were largely comparable with those of both the unaffected hand and healthy controls. We found no differential relation between affected versus unaffected hand map measures and clinical measures (pain severity, upper limb disability, disease duration). Thus, if any map reorganization occurs, it does not appear to be directly related to pain and disease severity. These findings compel us to reconsider the cortical mechanisms underlying CRPS and the rationale for interventions that aim to &quot;restore&quot; somatotopic representations to treat pain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; This study shows that the spatial map of the fingers in somatosensory cortex is largely preserved in chronic complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS). These findings challenge the treatment rationale for restoring somatotopic representations in complex regional pain syndrome patients.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Dendritic Spikes Expand the Range of Well Tolerated Population Noise Structures</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/46/9173?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The brain operates surprisingly well despite the noisy nature of individual neurons. The central mechanism for noise mitigation in the nervous system is thought to involve averaging over multiple noise-corrupted inputs. Subsequently, there has been considerable interest in identifying noise structures that can be integrated linearly in a way that preserves reliable signal encoding. By analyzing realistic synaptic integration in biophysically accurate neuronal models, I report a complementary denoising approach that is mediated by focal dendritic spikes. Dendritic spikes might seem to be unlikely candidates for noise reduction due to their miniscule integration compartments and poor averaging abilities. Nonetheless, the extra thresholding step introduced by dendritic spike generation increases neuronal tolerance for a broad category of noise structures, some of which cannot be resolved well with averaging. This property of active dendrites compensates for compartment size constraints and expands the repertoire of conditions that can be processed by neuronal populations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Noise, or random variability, is a prominent feature of the neuronal code and poses a fundamental challenge for information processing. To reconcile the surprisingly accurate output of the brain with the inherent noisiness of biological systems, previous work examined signal integration in idealized neurons. The notion that emerged from this body of work is that accurate signal representation relies largely on input averaging in neuronal dendrites. In contrast to the prevailing view, I show that denoising in simulated neurons with realistic morphology and biophysical properties follows a different strategy: dendritic spikes act as classifiers that assist in extracting information from a variety of noise structures that have been considered before to be particularly disruptive for reliable brain function.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Aversive Training Induces Both Presynaptic and Postsynaptic Suppression in Drosophila</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/46/9164?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The α'β' subtype of &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; mushroom body neurons (MBn) is required for memory acquisition, consolidation and early memory retrieval after aversive olfactory conditioning. However, &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; functional imaging studies have failed to detect an early forming memory trace in these neurons as reflected by an enhanced G-CaMP signal in response to presentation of the learned odor. Moreover, whether cellular memory traces form early after conditioning in the mushroom body output neurons (MBOn) downstream of the α'β' MBn remains unknown. Here, we show that aversive olfactory conditioning suppresses the calcium responses to the learned odor in both α'3 and α'2 axon segments of α'β' MBn and in the dendrites of α'3 MBOn immediately after conditioning using female flies. Notably, the cellular memory traces in both α'3 MBn and α'3 MBOn are short-lived and persist for &amp;lt;30 min. The suppressed response in α'3 MBn is accompanied by a reduction of acetylcholine (ACh) release, suggesting that the memory trace in postsynaptic α'3 MBOn may simply reflect the suppression in presynaptic α'3 MBn. Furthermore, we show that the α'3 MBn memory trace does not occur from the inhibition of GABAergic neurons via GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptor activation. Because activation of the α'3 MBOn drives approach behavior of adult flies, our results demonstrate that aversive conditioning promotes avoidance behavior through suppression of the α'3 MBn–MBOn circuit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; learn to avoid an odor if that odor is repeatedly paired with electric shock. Mushroom body neurons (MBns) are known to be major cell types that mediate this form of aversive conditioning. Here we show that aversive conditioning causes a reduced response to the conditioned odor in an axon branch of one subtype of the MBn for no more than 30 min after conditioning, and in the dendrites of postsynaptic, MB output neurons (MBOns). Because experimenter-induced activation of the MBOn induces approach behavior by the fly, our data support a model that aversive learning promotes avoidance by suppressing the MBn–MBOn synapses that normally promote attraction.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Diversity of Ocular Dominance Patterns in Visual Cortex Originates from Variations in Local Cortical Retinotopy</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/46/9145?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The primary visual cortex contains a detailed map of retinal stimulus position (retinotopic map) and eye input (ocular dominance map) that results from the precise arrangement of thalamic afferents during cortical development. For reasons that remain unclear, the patterns of ocular dominance are very diverse across species and can take the shape of highly organized stripes, convoluted beads, or no pattern at all. Here, we use a new image-processing algorithm to measure ocular dominance patterns more accurately than in the past. We use these measurements to demonstrate that ocular dominance maps follow a common organizing principle that makes the cortical axis with the slowest retinotopic gradient orthogonal to the ocular dominance stripes. We demonstrate this relation in multiple regions of the primary visual cortex from individual animals, and different species. Moreover, consistent with the increase in the retinotopic gradient with visual eccentricity, we demonstrate a strong correlation between eccentricity and ocular dominance stripe width. We also show that an eye/polarity grid emerges within the visual cortical map when the representation of light and dark stimuli segregates along an axis orthogonal to the ocular dominance stripes, as recently demonstrated in cats. Based on these results, we propose a developmental model of visual cortical topography that sorts thalamic afferents by eye input and stimulus polarity, and then maximizes the binocular retinotopic match needed for depth perception and the light-dark retinotopic mismatch needed to process stimulus orientation. In this model, the different ocular dominance patterns simply emerge from differences in local retinotopic cortical topography.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Thalamocortical afferents segregate in primary visual cortex by eye input and light-dark polarity. This afferent segregation forms cortical patterns that vary greatly across species for reasons that remain unknown. Here we show that the formation of ocular dominance patterns follows a common organizing principle across species that aligns the cortical axis of ocular dominance segregation with the axis of slowest retinotopic gradient. Based on our results, we propose a model of visual cortical topography that sorts thalamic afferents by eye input and stimulus polarity along orthogonal axes with the slowest and fastest retinotopic gradients, respectively. This organization maximizes the binocular retinotopic match needed for depth perception and the light-dark retinotopic mismatch needed to process stimulus orientation in carnivores and primates.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Activation of the Intrinsic Pain Inhibitory Circuit from the Midcingulate Cg2 to Zona Incerta Alleviates Neuropathic Pain</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/46/9130?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Neuropathic pain is one of the most common and notorious neurological diseases. The changes in cerebral structures after nerve injury and the corresponding contributions to neuropathic pain are not well understood. Here we found that the majority of glutamatergic neurons in the area 2 of midcingulate cortex (MCC Cg2&lt;sup&gt;Glu&lt;/sup&gt;) were inhibited by painful stimulation in male mice. Optogenetic manipulation revealed that these neurons were tonically involved in the inhibitory modulation of multimodal nociception. We further identified the projections to GABAergic neurons in the zona incerta (ZI&lt;sup&gt;GABA&lt;/sup&gt;) mediated the pain inhibitory role. However, MCC Cg2&lt;sup&gt;Glu&lt;/sup&gt; became hypoactive after nerve injury. Although a brief activation of the MCC Cg2&lt;sup&gt;Glu&lt;/sup&gt; to ZI&lt;sup&gt;GABA&lt;/sup&gt; circuit was able to relieve the aversiveness associated with spontaneous ongoing pain, consecutive activation of the circuit was required to alleviate neuropathic allodynia. In contrast, glutamatergic neurons in the area 1 of MCC played opposite roles in pain modulation. They became hyperactive after nerve injury and only consecutive inhibition of their activity relieved allodynia. These results demonstrate that MCC Cg2&lt;sup&gt;Glu&lt;/sup&gt; constitute a component of intrinsic pain inhibitory circuitry and their hypoactivity underlies neuropathic pain. We propose that selective and persistent activation of the MCC Cg2&lt;sup&gt;Glu&lt;/sup&gt; to ZI&lt;sup&gt;GABA&lt;/sup&gt; circuit may serve as a potential therapeutic strategy for this disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Glutamatergic neurons in the area 2 of midcingulate cortex (MCC Cg2&lt;sup&gt;Glu&lt;/sup&gt;) are tonically involved in the intrinsic pain inhibition via projecting to GABAergic neurons in the zona incerta. They are hypoactive after nerve injury. Selective activation of the circuit compensates the reduction of its analgesic strength and relieves neuropathic pain. Therefore, MCC Cg2&lt;sup&gt;Glu&lt;/sup&gt; and the related analgesic circuit may serve as therapeutic targets for neuropathic pain. In contrast, MCC Cg1&lt;sup&gt;Glu&lt;/sup&gt; have an opposite role in pain modulation and become hyperactive after nerve injury. The present study provides novel evidence for the concept that neuropathic pain is associated with the dysfunction of endogenous pain modulatory system and new perspective on the treatment of neuropathic pain.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: The p75NTR Influences Cerebellar Circuit Development and Adult Behavior via Regulation of Cell Cycle Duration of Granule Cell Progenitors</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/46/9119?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Development of brain circuitry requires precise regulation and timing of proliferation and differentiation of neural progenitor cells. The p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75NTR) is highly expressed in the proliferating granule cell precursors (GCPs) during development of the cerebellum. In a previous paper, we showed that proNT3 promoted GCP cell cycle exit via p75NTR. Here we used genetically modified rats and mice of both sexes to show that p75NTR regulates the duration of the GCP cell cycle, requiring activation of RhoA. Rats and mice lacking p75NTR have dysregulated GCP proliferation, with deleterious effects on cerebellar circuit development and behavioral consequences persisting into adulthood. In the absence of p75NTR, the GCP cell cycle is accelerated, leading to delayed cell cycle exit, prolonged GCP proliferation, increased glutamatergic input to Purkinje cells, and a deficit in delay eyeblink conditioning, a cerebellum-dependent form of learning. These results demonstrate the necessity of appropriate developmental timing of the cell cycle for establishment of proper connectivity and associated behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The cerebellum has been shown to be involved in numerous behaviors in addition to its classic association with motor function. Cerebellar function is disrupted in a variety of psychiatric disorders, including those on the autism spectrum. Here we show that the p75 neurotrophin receptor, which is abundantly expressed in the proliferating cerebellar granule cell progenitors, regulates the cell cycle of these progenitors. In the absence of this receptor, the cell cycle is dysregulated, leading to excessive progenitor proliferation, which alters the balance of inputs to Purkinje cells, disrupting the circuitry and leading to functional deficits that persist into adulthood.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Although several genes have been identified to promote axon regeneration in the CNS, our understanding of the molecular mechanisms by which mammalian axon regeneration is regulated is still limited and fragmented. Here by using female mouse sensory axon and optic nerve regeneration as model systems, we reveal an unexpected role of telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) in regulation of axon regeneration. We also provide evidence that TERT and p53 act downstream of c-Myc to control sensory axon regeneration. More importantly, overexpression of p53 in sensory neurons and retinal ganglion cells is sufficient to promote sensory axon and optic never regeneration, respectively. The study reveals a novel c-Myc-TERT-p53 signaling pathway, expanding horizons for novel approaches promoting CNS axon regeneration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Despite significant progress during the past decade, our understanding of the molecular mechanisms by which mammalian CNS axon regeneration is regulated is still fragmented. By using sensory axon and optic nerve regeneration as model systems, the study revealed an unexpected role of telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) in regulation of axon regeneration. The results also delineated a c-Myc-TERT-p53 pathway in controlling axon growth. Last, our results demonstrated that p53 alone was sufficient to promote sensory axon and optic nerve regeneration &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. Collectively, the study not only revealed a new mechanisms underlying mammalian axon regeneration, but also expanded the pool of potential targets that can be manipulated to enhance CNS axon regeneration.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Hair Bundle Stimulation Mode Modifies Manifestations of Mechanotransduction Adaptation</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/46/9098?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Sound detection in auditory sensory hair cells depends on the deflection of the stereocilia hair bundle which opens mechano-electric transduction (MET) channels. Adaptation is hypothesized to be a critical property of MET that contributes to the auditory system's wide dynamic range and sharp frequency selectivity. Our recent work using a stiff probe to displace hair bundles showed that the fastest adaptation mechanism (fast adaptation) does not require calcium entry. Using fluid-jet stimuli, others obtained data showing only a calcium-dependent fast adaptation response. Because cochlear stereocilia do not move coherently and the hair cell response depends critically on the magnitude and time course of the hair bundle deflection, we developed a high-speed imaging technique to quantify this deflection in rat cochlear hair cells. The fluid jet delivers a force stimulus, and force steps lead to a complex time course of hair bundle displacement (mechanical creep), which affects the hair cell's macroscopic MET current response by masking the time course of the fast adaptation response. Modifying the fluid-jet stimulus to generate a hair bundle displacement step produced rapidly adapting currents that did not depend on membrane potential, confirming that fast adaptation does not depend on calcium entry. MET current responses differ with stimulus modality and will shape receptor potentials of different hair cell types based on their &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; stimulus mode. These transformations will directly affect how stimuli are encoded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Mechanotransduction by sensory hair cells represents a key first step for the sound sensing ability in vertebrates. The sharp frequency tuning and wide dynamic range of sound sensation are hypothesized to require a mechanotransduction adaptation mechanism. Recent work indicated that the apparent calcium dependence of the fastest adaptation differs with the method of cochlear hair cell stimulation. Here, we reconcile existing data and show that calcium entry does not drive the fastest adaptation process, independent of the stimulation method. With force stimulation of the hair bundle, adaptation manifests differently than with displacement stimulation, indicating that the stimulation mode of the hair bundle will affect the hair cell receptor current and stimulus coding.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Tumor Necrosis Factor-{alpha}-Mediated Metaplastic Inhibition of LTP Is Constitutively Engaged in an Alzheimer's Disease Model</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/46/9083?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;LTP, a fundamental mechanism of learning and memory, is a highly regulated process. One form of regulation is metaplasticity (i.e., the activity-dependent and long-lasting changes in neuronal state that orchestrate the direction, magnitude, and persistence of future synaptic plasticity). We have previously described a heterodendritic metaplasticity effect, whereby strong high-frequency priming stimulation in stratum oriens inhibits subsequent LTP in the stratum radiatum of hippocampal area CA1, potentially by engagement of the enmeshed astrocytic network. This effect may occur due to neuron-glia interactions in response to priming stimulation that leads to the release of gliotransmitters. Here we found in male rats that TNFα and associated signal transduction enzymes, but not interleukin-1β (IL-1β), were responsible for mediating the metaplasticity effect. Replacing priming stimulation with TNFα incubation reproduced these effects. As TNFα levels are elevated in Alzheimer's disease, we examined whether heterodendritic metaplasticity is dysregulated in a transgenic mouse model of the disease, either before or after amyloid plaque formation. We showed that TNFα and IL-1β levels were significantly increased in aged but not young transgenic mice. Although control LTP was impaired in the young transgenic mice, it was not TNFα-dependent. In the older transgenic mice, however, LTP was impaired in a way that occluded further reduction by heterosynaptic metaplasticity, whereas LTP was entirely rescued by incubation with a TNFα antibody, but not an IL-1β antibody. Thus, TNFα mediates a heterodendritic metaplasticity in healthy rodents that becomes constitutively and selectively engaged in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The proinflammatory cytokine TNFα is known to be capable of inhibiting LTP and is upregulated several-fold in brain tissue, serum, and CSF of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. However, the mechanistic roles played by TNFα in plasticity and AD remain poorly understood. Here we show that TNFα and its downstream signaling molecules p38 MAPK, ERK, and JNK contribute fundamentally to a long-range metaplastic inhibition of LTP in rats. Moreover, the impaired LTP in aged &lt;i&gt;APP/PS1&lt;/i&gt; mice is rescued by incubation with a TNFα antibody. Thus, there is an endogenous engagement of the metaplasticity mechanism in this mouse model of AD, supporting the idea that blocking TNFα might be of therapeutic benefit in the disease.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Modeling a Neurexin-3{alpha} Human Mutation in Mouse Neurons Identifies a Novel Role in the Regulation of Transsynaptic Signaling and Neurotransmitter Release at Excitatory Synapses</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/46/9065?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Presynaptic α-neurexins are highly expressed and more frequently linked to neuropsychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders than β-neurexins. However, how extracellular sequences specific to α-neurexins enable synaptic transmission is poorly understood. We identified a mutation in an extracellular region of neurexin-3α (A687T), located in a region conserved among α-neurexins and throughout vertebrate evolution, in a patient diagnosed with profound intellectual disability and epilepsy. We systematically interrogated this mutation using a knockdown-replacement approach, and discovered that the A687T mutation enhanced presynaptic morphology and increased two critical presynaptic parameters: (1) presynaptic release probability, and (2) the size of the readily releasable pool exclusively at excitatory synapses in mixed sex primary mouse hippocampal cultures. Introduction of the mutation &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; and subsequent analysis in &lt;i&gt;ex vivo&lt;/i&gt; brain slices made from male and female mice revealed a significant increase in excitatory presynaptic neurotransmission that occluded presynaptic but not postsynaptic LTP. Mechanistically, neurexin-3α&lt;sup&gt;A687T&lt;/sup&gt; enhanced binding to LRRTM2 without altering binding to postsynaptic neuroligin-1. Thus, neurexin-3α&lt;sup&gt;A687T&lt;/sup&gt; unexpectedly produced the first neurexin presynaptic gain-of-function phenotype and revealed unanticipated novel insights into how α-neurexin extracellular sequences govern both transsynaptic adhesion and presynaptic neurotransmitter release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Despite decades of scientific scrutiny, how precise α-neurexin extracellular sequences control synapse function remains enigmatic. One largely unpursued avenue to identify the role of precise extracellular sequences is the interrogation of naturally occurring missense mutations. Here, we identified a neurexin-3α missense mutation in a compound heterozygous patient diagnosed with profound intellectual disability and epilepsy and systematically interrogated this mutation. Using &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; molecular replacement, electrophysiology, electron microscopy, and structure–function analyses, we reveal a novel role for neurexin-3α, unanticipated based on α-neurexin knock-out models, in controlling presynaptic morphology and neurotransmitter release at excitatory synapses. Our findings represent the first neurexin gain-of-function phenotype and provide new fundamentally important insight into the synaptic biology of α-neurexins.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/46/9053?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A major cue to infer sound direction is the difference in arrival time of the sound at the left and right ears, called interaural time difference (ITD). The neural coding of ITD and its similarity across species have been strongly debated. In the barn owl, an auditory specialist relying on sound localization to capture prey, ITDs within the physiological range determined by the head width are topographically represented at each frequency. The topographic representation suggests that sound direction may be inferred from the location of maximal neural activity within the map. Such topographical representation of ITD, however, is not evident in mammals. Instead, the preferred ITD of neurons in the mammalian brainstem often lies outside the physiological range and depends on the neuron's best frequency. Because of these disparities, it has been assumed that how spatial hearing is achieved in birds and mammals is fundamentally different. However, recent studies reveal ITD responses in the owl's forebrain and midbrain premotor area that are consistent with coding schemes proposed in mammals. Particularly, sound location in owls could be decoded from the relative firing rates of two broadly and inversely ITD-tuned channels. This evidence suggests that, at downstream stages, the code for ITD may not be qualitatively different across species. Thus, while experimental evidence continues to support the notion of differences in ITD representation across species and brain regions, the latest results indicate notable commonalities, suggesting that codes driving orienting behavior in mammals and birds may be comparable.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/46/9042?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Multiphoton microscopy (MPM) has emerged as one of the most powerful and widespread technologies to monitor the activity of neuronal networks in awake, behaving animals over long periods of time. MPM development spanned across decades and crucially depended on the concurrent improvement of calcium indicators that report neuronal activity as well as surgical protocols, head fixation approaches, and innovations in optics and microscopy technology. Here we review the last decade of MPM development and highlight how &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; imaging has matured and diversified, making it now possible to concurrently monitor thousands of neurons across connected brain areas or, alternatively, small local networks with sampling rates in the kilohertz range. This review includes different laser scanning approaches, such as multibeam technologies as well as recent developments to image deeper into neuronal tissues using new, long-wavelength laser sources. As future development will critically depend on our ability to resolve and discriminate individual neuronal spikes, we will also describe a simple framework that allows performing quantitative comparisons between the reviewed MPM instruments. Finally, we provide our own opinion on how the most recent MPM developments can be leveraged at scale to enable the next generation of discoveries in brain function.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25644?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Otaplimastat is a neuroprotectant that inhibits matrix metalloproteases pathway, and reduces edema and intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) induced by recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rtPA) in animal stroke models. We aimed to assess the safety and efficacy of otaplimastat in patients receiving rtPA.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was a phase 2, two‐part, multicenter trial in stroke patients (19–80 years) receiving rtPA. Intravenous otaplimastat was administered &amp;lt;30 min after rtPA. Stage 1 was a single‐arm, open‐label safety study in 11 patients. Otaplimastat 80 mg was administered twice daily for 3 days. Stage 2 was a randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled study involving 69 patients, assigned (1:1:1) to otaplimastat 40 mg, 80 mg or a placebo. The primary endpoint was the occurrence of parenchymal hematoma (PH) on day 1. Secondary endpoints included serious adverse events (SAE), mortality, and modified Rankin scale (mRS) distribution at 90 days (&lt;a href=&quot;http://clinicaltrials.gov&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Link to external resource&quot;&gt;clinicaltrials.gov&lt;/a&gt; Identifier: NCT02787278).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No safety issues were encountered in stage 1. The incidence of PH during stage 2 was comparable: 0/22 with the placebo, 0/22 with otaplimastat 40 mg, and 1/21 with the 80 mg dose. No differences in the SAE (13%, 17%, 14%) or death (8.3%, 4.2%, 4.8%) were observed among the three groups. Three adverse events (chills, muscle rigidity, hepatotoxicity) were judged to be related to otaplimastat.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intravenous otaplimastat adjunctive therapy in patients receiving rtPA is feasible and generally safe. The functional efficacy of otaplimastat needs to be investigated with further large trials.&lt;/p&gt;

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1911.05031</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Network neuroscience represents the brain as a collection of regions and
inter-regional connections. Given its ability to formalize systems-level
models, network neuroscience has generated unique explanations of neural
function and behavior. The mechanistic status of these explanations and how
they can contribute to and fit within the field of neuroscience as a whole has
received careful treatment from philosophers. However, these philosophical
contributions have not yet reached many neuroscientists. Here we complement
formal philosophical efforts by providing an applied perspective from and for
neuroscientists. We discuss the mechanistic status of the explanations offered
by network neuroscience and how they contribute to, enhance, and interdigitate
with other types of explanations in neuroscience. In doing so, we rely on
philosophical work concerning the role of causality, scale, and mechanisms in
scientific explanations. In particular, we make the distinction between an
explanation and the evidence supporting that explanation, and we argue for a
scale-free nature of mechanistic explanations. In the course of these
discussions, we hope to provide a useful applied framework in which network
neuroscience explanations can be exercised across scales and combined with
other fields of neuroscience to gain deeper insights into the brain and
behavior.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1911.04895</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Both action potentials and mechanosensitive signalling are an important
communication mechanisms in plants. Considering an information theoretic
framework, this paper explores the effective range of multiple action
potentials for a long chain of cells (i.e., up to 100) in different
configurations, and introduces the study of multiple mechanosensitive
activation signals (generated due to a mechanical stimulus) in plants. For both
these signals, we find that the mutual information per cell and information
propagation speed tends to increase up to a certain number of receiver cells.
However, as the number of cells increase beyond 10 to 12, the mutual
information per cell starts to decrease. To validate our model and results, we
include an experimental verification of the theoretical model, using a
PhytlSigns biosignal amplifier, allowing us to measure the magnitude of the
voltage associated with the multiple AP and mechanosensitive activation signals
induced by different stimulus in plants. Experimental data is used to calculate
the mutual information and information propagation speed, which is compared
with corresponding numerical results. Since these signals are used for a
variety of important tasks within the plant, understanding them may lead to new
bioengineering methods for plants.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The interplay between cognitive and oculomotor processes during reading can
be explored when the spatial layout of text deviates from the typical display.
In this study, we investigate various eye-movement measures during reading of
text with experimentally manipulated layout (word-wise and letter-wise
mirrored-reversed text as well as inverted and scrambled text). While typical
findings (e.g., longer mean fixation times, shorter mean saccades lengths) in
reading manipulated texts compared to normal texts were reported in earlier
work, little is known about changes of oculomotor targeting observed in
within-word landing positions under the above text layouts. Here we carry out
precise analyses of landing positions and find substantial changes in the
so-called launch-site effect in addition to the expected overall slow-down of
reading performance. Specifically, during reading of our manipulated text
conditions with reversed letter order (against overall reading direction), we
find a reduced launch-site effect, while in all other manipulated text
conditions, we observe an increased launch-site effect. Our results clearly
indicate that the oculomotor system is highly adaptive when confronted with
unusual reading conditions.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In many daily tasks we make multiple decisions before reaching a goal. In
order to learn such sequences of decisions, a mechanism to link earlier actions
to later reward is necessary. Reinforcement learning theory suggests two
classes of algorithms solving this credit assignment problem: In classic
temporal-difference learning, earlier actions receive reward information only
after multiple repetitions of the task, whereas models with eligibility traces
reinforce entire sequences of actions from a single experience (one-shot). Here
we asked whether humans use eligibility traces. We developed a novel paradigm
to directly observe which actions and states along a multi-step sequence are
reinforced after a single reward. By focusing our analysis on those states for
which RL with and without eligibility trace make qualitatively distinct
predictions, we find direct behavioral (choice probability) and physiological
(pupil dilation) signatures of reinforcement learning with eligibility trace
across multiple sensory modalities.

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2019.00068</link>
	<content:encoded>Background&lt;p&gt;Compression of myofascial trigger points (MTrPs) in muscles is reported to reduce chronic musculoskeletal pain. Although the prefrontal cortex (PFC) is implicated in development of chronic pain, the mechanisms of how MTrP compression at low back regions affects PFC activity remain under debate. In this study, we investigated effects of MTrP compression on brain hemodynamics and EEG oscillation in subjects with chronic low back pain.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;The study was a prospective, randomized, parallel-group trial and an observer and subject-blinded clinical trial. Thirty-two subjects with chronic low back pain were divided into two groups: subjects with compression at MTrPs (n = 16) or those with non-MTrPs (n = 16). Compression at MTrP or non-MTrP for 30 s was applied five times, and hemodynamic activity (near-infrared spectroscopy; NIRS) and EEGs were simultaneously recorded during the experiment.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;The results indicated that compression at MTrPs significantly (1) reduced subjective pain (P &amp;lt; 0.05) and increased the pressure pain threshold (P &amp;lt; 0.05), (2) decreased the NIRS hemodynamic activity in the frontal polar area (pPFC) (P &amp;lt; 0.05), and (3) increased the current source density (CSD) of EEG theta oscillation in the anterior part of the PFC (P &amp;lt; 0.05). CSD of EEG theta oscillation was negatively correlated with NIRS hemodynamic activity in the pPFC (P &amp;lt; 0.05). Furthermore, functional connectivity in theta bands between the medial pPFC and insula cortex was significantly decreased in the MTrP group (P &amp;lt; 0.05). The functional connectivity between those regions was positively correlated with subjective low back pain (P &amp;lt; 0.05).&lt;/p&gt;Discussion&lt;p&gt;The results suggest that MTrP compression at the lumbar muscle modulates pPFC activity and functional connectivity between the pPFC and insula, which may relieve chronic musculoskeletal pain.&lt;/p&gt;Trial registration&lt;p&gt;This trial was registered at University Hospital Medical Information Network Clinical Trials Registry (UMIN000033913) on 27 August 2018, at https://upload.umin.ac.jp/cgi-open-bin/ctr/ctr_view.cgi?recptno=R000038660.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2019.00059</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Understanding the origin of the main physiological processes involved in consciousness is a major challenge of contemporary neuroscience, with crucial implications for the study of Disorders of Consciousness (DOC). The difficulties in achieving this task include the considerable quantity of experimental data in this field, along with the non-intuitive, nonlinear nature of neuronal dynamics. One possibility of integrating the main results from the experimental literature into a cohesive framework, while accounting for nonlinear brain dynamics, is the use of physiologically-inspired computational models. In this study, we present a physiologically-grounded computational model, attempting to account for the main micro-circuits identified in the human cortex, while including the specificities of each neuronal type. More specifically, the model accounts for thalamo-cortical (vertical) regulation of cortico-cortical (horizontal) connectivity, which is a central mechanism for brain information integration and processing. The distinct neuronal assemblies communicate through feedforward and feedback excitatory and inhibitory synaptic connections implemented in a template brain accounting for long-range connectome. The EEG generated by this physiologically-based simulated brain is validated through comparison with brain rhythms recorded in humans in two states of consciousness (wakefulness, sleep). Using the model, it is possible to reproduce the local disynaptic disinhibition of basket cells (fast GABAergic inhibition) and glutamatergic pyramidal neurons through long-range activation of vasoactive intestinal-peptide (VIP) interneurons that induced inhibition of somatostatin positive (SST) interneurons. The model (COALIA) predicts that the strength and dynamics of the thalamic output on the cortex control the local and long-range cortical processing of information. Furthermore, the model reproduces and explains clinical results regarding the complexity of transcranial magnetic stimulation TMS-evoked EEG responses in DOC patients and healthy volunteers, through a modulation of thalamo-cortical connectivity that governs the level of cortico-cortical communication. This new model provides a quantitative framework to accelerate the study of the physiological mechanisms involved in the emergence, maintenance and disruption (sleep, anesthesia, DOC) of consciousness.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Brain Imaging Methods section | New and Recent Articles: Contactless Assessment of Cerebral Autoregulation by Photoplethysmographic Imaging at Green Illumination</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.01235</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Accurate and practical assessment of the brain circulation is needed to adequately estimate the viability of cerebral blood flow regulatory mechanisms in various physiological conditions. The objective of our study was to examine feasibility of the contactless green-light imaging photoplethysmography (PPG) for assessing cerebral autoregulation by revealing the dynamic relationships between cortical microcirculation assessed by PPG and changes in systemic blood pressure caused by visceral and somatic peripheral stimuli. In anesthetized male Wistar rats, the PPG video images of the open parietal cortex (either with unimpaired or dissected dura mater), electrocardiogram, and systemic arterial blood pressure (ABP) in the femoral artery were continuously recorded before, during and after visceral (colorectal distension) or somatic (tail squeezing) stimulation. In the vast majority of experiments with intact and removed dura mater, both spontaneous and peripheral stimulation-evoked changes in ABP negatively correlated with the accompanying alterations in the amplitude of pulsatile PPG component (APC), i.e., an increase of ABP resulted in a decrease of APC and vice versa. The most pronounced ABP and APC alterations were induced by noxious stimuli. Visceral painful stimulation in all cases caused short-term hypotension with simultaneous increase in cortical APC, whereas somatic noxious stimuli in 8 of 21 trials produced hypertensive effect with decreased APC. Animals with pressure 50-70 mmHg possessed higher negative cerebrovascular response rate of ABP-APC gradients than rats with either lower or higher pressure. Severe hypotension reversed the negative ratio to positive one, which was especially evident under visceral pain stimulation. Amplitude of the pulsatile PPG component probably reflects the regulation of vascular tone of cerebral cortex in response to systemic blood pressure fluctuations. When combined with different kinds of peripheral stimuli, the technique is capable for evaluation of normal and elucidation of impaired cerebrovascular system reactivity to particular physiological events, for example pain. The reported contactless PPG monitoring of cortical circulatory dynamics during neurosurgical interventions in combination with recordings of changes in other physiological parameters, such as systemic blood pressure and ECG, has the appealing potential to monitor viability of the cortex vessels and determine the state of patient’s cerebrovascular autoregulation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.01204</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Cerebral small vessel diseases play a crucial role in both vascular and non-vascular dementias. The location of white matter hyperintensities (WMHs), a neuroimaging marker of cerebral small vessel disease, has been found to vary between different types of dementias, and those in the basal ganglia (BG) have been particularly associated with vascular cognitive impairment (VCI). However, anatomical variation of WMHs across BG nuclei and its effect on brain network dysconnectivity has not been clearly elucidated. The study sample consisted of 40 patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI), 40 with subcortical vascular MCI (SVMCI), and 40 healthy control subjects. We examined the volume of WMH using T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging. We also assessed the disturbances in BG-cortical communication by measuring resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) from the functional magnetic resonance imaging signal. WMHs were more pronounced in the SVMCI group particularly in the caudate regions. In SVMCI patients, while higher WMHs in the dorsal caudate correlated with weaker FC with executive control regions and worse immediate recall performance, WMHs in the ventral caudate were associated with weaker FC with anterior default mode regions and worse delayed recall performance. In contrast, in aMCI patients, BG WMHs were not correlated with their changes in functional connectivity changes, which showed weaker connectivity with almost all BG structures, rather than restricting to specific BG subdivisions as observed in the SVMCI group. Our findings demonstrate that heterogeneously distributed BG WMHs are associated with changes in functional network interactions and verbal episodic memory performance only in SVMCI patients, which establishes a link between cerebrovascular-related structural abnormality, functional integrity of BG circuits, and episodic memory impairments in SVMCI, and may reflect a differential role of the cerebrovascular pathology in disrupting network-level communications and cognition between Alzheimer’s and subcortical vascular dementia.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.01191</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Myelin plays a crucial role in axon function recovery following nerve damage, and the interaction between Schwann cells (SCs) and regenerating axons profoundly affects myelin formation. Eph receptor A4 (EphA4), a member of the Eph tyrosine kinase receptor family, regulates cell-cell interactions via its ligand ephrins. However, our current knowledge on how EphA4 regulates the formation of myelin sheaths remains limited. In order to explore the roles of EphA4 in myelination in the peripheral nervous system, we used a combination of (1) a co-culture model of dorsal root ganglion (DRG) explants and SCs, (2) a SC differentiation model induced by db-cAMP, and (3) a regeneration model of crushed sciatic nerves in rats. Our results demonstrated that EphA4 inhibited myelination by inhibiting SC differentiation and facilitating SC proliferation in vitro. The in vivo experiments revealed that EphA4 expression in SCs is upregulated following nerve crush injury and then downregulated during remyelination. Moreover, silencing of EphA4 by siRNA or overexpression of EphA4 by genetic manipulation can accelerate or slow down nerve remyelination in crushed sciatic nerves. Taken together, our results suggest that EphA4 may negatively regulate myelination by abrogating SC differentiation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Moderate-Intensity Aerobic Exercise Restores Appetite and Prefrontal Brain Activity to Images of Food Among Persons Dependent on Methamphetamine: A Functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy Study</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2019.00400</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The brain prefrontal control system is critical to successful recovery from substance use disorders, and the prefrontal cortex (PFC) regulates striatal reward-related processes. Substance-dependent individuals exhibit an increased response to drug rewards and decreased response to natural, nondrug rewards. Short-term aerobic exercise can ameliorate craving and inhibitory deficits in methamphetamine users, but the effect of exercise on food reward is unknown. This study used functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) to measure the effects of moderate- and high-intensity short-term aerobic exercise on prefrontal activity related to food images and recorded the subjective feelings of appetite in methamphetamine-dependent users. In total, 56 men who met the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (Fifth Edition) criteria for methamphetamine dependence, with a mean (SD) body mass index of 24.7 (3.5) kg/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and age of 30.2 (5.1) years, were randomly assigned to one of two exercise groups: moderate intensity (n = 28; 65%–75% of maximum heart rate) and high intensity (n = 28; 76%–85% of heart rate maximum). Each group also performed a resting control session for 35 min 1 week before or after the exercise, in a counterbalanced order. Mean oxygenated hemoglobin concentration changes in the PFC when viewing visual food cues were assessed by fNIRS, and subjective feelings of appetite were self-rated using visual analog scales after moderate- or high-intensity aerobic exercise and after the resting control session. A continuous-wave NIRS device was used to obtain functional data: eight sources and seven detectors were placed on the scalp covering the PFC, resulting in 20 channels per participant. We found that moderate-intensity aerobic exercise significantly increased both, the activation of the left orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) to images of high-calorie food (P = 0.02) and subjective sensations of hunger (F&lt;sub&gt;(1,54)&lt;/sub&gt; = 7.16, P = 0.01). To our knowledge, this study provides the first evidence that moderate-intensity aerobic exercise increases OFC activity associated with high-calorie food images and stimulates appetite in methamphetamine-dependent individuals. These changes suggest that exercise may reestablish the food reward pathway hijacked by drugs and restore sensitivity to natural rewards. This evidence may contribute to the development of specific exercise programs for populations with methamphetamine dependence.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2019.00397</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The field of second language acquisition (SLA) is by nature of its subject a highly interdisciplinary area of research. Learning a (foreign) language, for example, involves encoding new words, consolidating and committing them to long-term memory, and later retrieving them. All of these processes have direct parallels in the domain of human memory and have been thoroughly studied by researchers in that field. Yet, despite these clear links, the two fields have largely developed in parallel and in isolation from one another. The present article aims to promote more cross-talk between SLA and memory science. We focus on foreign language (FL) attrition as an example of a research topic in SLA where the parallels with memory science are especially apparent. We discuss evidence that suggests that competition between languages is one of the mechanisms of FL attrition, paralleling the interference process thought to underlie forgetting in other domains of human memory. Backed up by concrete suggestions, we advocate the use of paradigms from the memory literature to study these interference effects in the language domain. In doing so, we hope to facilitate future cross-talk between the two fields and to further our understanding of FL attrition as a memory phenomenon.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Synaptic changes induced by neural activity need to be consolidated to maintain memory over a timescale of hours. In experiments, synaptic consolidation can be induced by repeating a stimulation protocol several times and the effectiveness of consolidation depends crucially on the repetition frequency of the stimulations. We address the question: is there an understandable reason why induction protocols with repetitions at some frequency work better than sustained protocols—even though the accumulated stimulation strength might be exactly the same in both cases? In real synapses, plasticity occurs on multiple time scales from seconds (induction), to several minutes (early phase of long-term potentiation) to hours and days (late phase of synaptic consolidation). We use a simplified mathematical model of just two times scales to elucidate the above question in a purified setting. Our mathematical results show that, even in such a simple model, the repetition frequency of stimulation plays an important role for the successful induction, and stabilization, of potentiation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Distinct Functional Connectivity Patterns Are Associated With Social and Cognitive Lifestyle Factors: Pathways to Cognitive Reserve</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2019.00310</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The importance of diverse lifestyle factors in sustaining cognition during aging and delaying the onset of decline in Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias cannot be overstated. We explored the influence of cognitive, social, and physical lifestyle factors on resting-state lagged linear connectivity (LLC) in high-density electroencephalography (EEG) in adults, ages 35–75 years. Diverse lifestyle factors build cognitive reserve (CR), protecting cognition in the presence of physical brain decline. Differences in LLC were examined between high- and low-CR groups formed using cognitive, social, and exercise lifestyle factors. LLC is a measure of lagged coherence that excludes zero phase contributions and limits the effects of volume conduction on connectivity estimates. Significant differences in LLC were identified for cognitive and social factors, but not exercise. Participants high in social CR possessed greater local and long-range connectivity in theta and low alpha for eyes-open and eyes-closed recording conditions. In contrast, participants high in cognitive CR exhibited greater eyes-closed long-range connectivity between the occipital lobe and other cortical regions in low alpha. Greater eyes-closed local LLC in delta was also present in men high in cognitive CR. Cognitive factor scores correlated with sustained attention, whereas social factors scores correlated with spatial working memory. Gender was a significant covariate in our analyses, with women displaying higher local and long-range LLC in low beta. Our findings support distinct relationships between CR and LLC, as well as CR and cognitive function for cognitive and social subcomponents. These patterns reflect the importance of diverse lifestyle factors in building CR.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Distinct Disruptive Patterns of Default Mode Subnetwork Connectivity Across the Spectrum of Preclinical Alzheimer’s Disease</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2019.00307</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Background: The early progression continuum of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) has been considered to advance through subjective cognitive decline (SCD), non-amnestic mild cognitive impairment (naMCI), and amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI). Altered functional connectivity (FC) in the default mode network (DMN) is regarded as a hallmark of AD. Furthermore, the DMN can be divided into two subnetworks, the anterior and posterior subnetworks. However, little is known about distinct disruptive patterns in the subsystems of the DMN across the preclinical AD spectrum. This study investigated the connectivity patterns of anterior DMN (aDMN) and posterior DMN (pDMN) across the preclinical AD spectrum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) was used to investigate the FC in the DMN subnetworks in 20 healthy controls (HC), eight SCD, 11 naMCI, and 28 aMCI patients. Moreover, a correlation analysis was used to examine associations between the altered connectivity of the DMN subnetworks and the neurocognitive performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Compared to the HC, SCD patients showed increased FC in the bilateral superior frontal gyrus (SFG), naMCI patients showed increased FC in the left inferior parietal lobule (IPL), and aMCI patients showed increased FC in the bilateral IPL in the aDMN; while SCD patients showed decreased FC in the precuneus, naMCI patients showed increased FC in the left middle temporal gyrus (MTG), and aMCI patients also showed increased FC in the right middle frontal gyrus (MFG) in the pDMN. Notably, the FC between the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) and the left MFG and the IPL in the aDMN was associated with episodic memory in the SCD and aMCI groups. Interestingly, the FC between the posterior cingulated cortex (PCC) and several regions in the pDMN was associated with other cognitive functions in the SCD and naMCI groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: This study demonstrates that the three preclinical stages of AD exhibit distinct FC alternations in the DMN subnetworks. Furthermore, the patient group data showed that the altered FC involves cognitive function. These findings can provide novel insights for tailored clinical intervention across the preclinical AD spectrum.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: latest articles: Reliability of an interneuron response depends on an integrated sensory state</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/50566</link>
	<content:encoded>The central nervous system transforms sensory information into representations that are salient to the animal. Here we define the logic of this transformation in a &lt;i&gt;Caenorhabditis elegans&lt;/i&gt; integrating interneuron. AIA interneurons receive input from multiple chemosensory neurons that detect attractive odors. We show that reliable AIA responses require the coincidence of two sensory inputs: activation of AWA olfactory neurons that are activated by attractive odors, and inhibition of one or more chemosensory neurons that are inhibited by attractive odors. AWA activates AIA through an electrical synapse, while the disinhibitory pathway acts through glutamatergic chemical synapses. AIA interneurons have bistable electrophysiological properties consistent with their calcium dynamics, suggesting that AIA activation is a stereotyped response to an integrated stimulus. Our results indicate that AIA interneurons combine sensory information using AND-gate logic, requiring coordinated activity from multiple chemosensory neurons. We propose that AIA encodes positive valence based on an integrated sensory state.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: latest articles: Efa6 protects axons and regulates their growth and branching by inhibiting microtubule polymerisation at the cortex</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/50319</link>
	<content:encoded>Cortical collapse factors affect microtubule (MT) dynamics at the plasma membrane. They play important roles in neurons, as suggested by inhibition of axon growth and regeneration through the Arf activator Efa6 in &lt;i&gt;C. elegans&lt;/i&gt;, and by neurodevelopmental disorders linked to the mammalian kinesin Kif21A. How cortical collapse factors influence axon growth is little understood. Here we studied them, focussing on the function of &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; Efa6 in experimentally and genetically amenable fly neurons. First, we show that &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; Efa6 can inhibit MTs directly without interacting molecules via an N-terminal 18 amino acid motif (MT elimination domain/MTED) that binds tubulin and inhibits microtubule growth&lt;i&gt; in vitro&lt;/i&gt; and cells. If N-terminal MTED-containing fragments are in the cytoplasm they abolish entire microtubule networks of mouse fibroblasts and whole axons of fly neurons. Full-length Efa6 is membrane-attached, hence primarily blocks MTs in the periphery of fibroblasts, and explorative MTs that have left axonal bundles in neurons. Accordingly, loss of Efa6 causes an increase of explorative MTs: in growth cones they enhance axon growth, in axon shafts they cause excessive branching, as well as atrophy through perturbations of MT bundles. Efa6 over-expression causes the opposite phenotypes. Taken together, our work conceptually links molecular and sub-cellular functions of cortical collapse factors to axon growth regulation and reveals new roles in axon branching and in the prevention of axonal atrophy. Furthermore, the MTED delivers a promising tool that can be used to inhibit MTs in a compartmentalised fashion when fusing it to specifically localising protein domains.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: latest articles: Auto-regulation of Rab5 GEF activity in Rabex5 by allosteric structural changes, catalytic core dynamics and ubiquitin binding</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/46302</link>
	<content:encoded>Intracellular trafficking depends on the function of Rab GTPases, whose activation is regulated by guanine exchange factors (GEFs). The Rab5 GEF, Rabex5, was previously proposed to be auto-inhibited by its C-terminus. Here, we studied full-length Rabex5 and Rabaptin5 proteins as well as domain deletion Rabex5 mutants using hydrogen deuterium exchange mass spectrometry. We generated a structural model of Rabex5, using chemical cross-linking mass spectrometry and integrative modeling techniques. By correlating structural changes with nucleotide exchange activity for each construct, we uncovered new auto-regulatory roles for the ubiquitin binding domains and the Linker connecting those domains to the catalytic core of Rabex5. We further provide evidence that enhanced dynamics in the catalytic core are linked to catalysis. Our results suggest a more complex auto-regulation mechanism than previously thought and imply that ubiquitin binding serves not only to position Rabex5 but to also control its Rab5 GEF activity through allosteric structural alterations.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Stimulus reliability automatically biases temporal integration of discrete perceptual targets yielding suboptimal decisions</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/841353v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Decision making is a ubiquitous cognitive process that determines choice behaviour. In recent years there has been increased interest in how information about multiple discrete sensory events are combined in support of single, integrated decisions. Previous studies have shown that integrative decision-making is biased in favour of more reliable stimuli. As reliability-weighted integration typically mimics statistically optimal integration, it remains unclear whether reliability biases are automatic or strategic. To dissociate reliability-weighting and optimal decisions, we developed a task that required participants to monitor two successive epochs containing brief, suprathreshold coherent motion signals which varied in their reliability. Rather than judging the individual target motion directions, however, participants had to reproduce the average motion direction of the two targets. Using mixture distribution modelling and linear regression to model behavioural data, we found robust biases in favour of the more reliable stimulus, despite the fact that unbiased responses were optimal in our paradigm. Using population-tuning modelling to characterise feature specific brain activity recorded using electroencephalography, we observed robust and sustained feature-specific responses to target signals in both epochs. Using the same method, we were able to capture the temporal dynamics of integrated decision making by characterising tuning to the average motion direction. Critically, the tuning profiles to the average motion direction exhibited biases in favour of the more reliable signal, in keeping with the modelled behavioural responses. Taken together, our findings reveal that temporal integration of discrete sensory events is automatically and suboptimally weighted according to stimulus reliability.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/841247v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>A decline in cognitive functions due to aging has led to critical problems in modern society, and it is imperative to develop a method to predict the decline or related diseases, including dementia. Although it has been expected that language could be a sign of the cognitive decline, it remains less understood, especially in natural conditions. In this study, we recorded the large-scale data of one million words from group conversations among healthy elderly people and analysed the relationship between spoken language and cognitive functions based on scaling laws, namely, Zipf's law and Heaps' law. We found that word patterns followed these scaling laws irrespective of cognitive function, but the variations in scaling laws were associated with cognitive functions. Moreover, using generative models, we uncovered the relationship between the variations and cognitive functions. These results indicate that scaling laws in language can be a biomarker for the cognitive decline.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Altered updating of bodily and spatial representations following tool-use in Complex Regional Pain Syndrome</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/841205v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Distorted representations of the body and peripersonal space are common in Complex Regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS), and might modulate its symptoms (e.g. asymmetric limb temperature). In pain-free people, such representations are malleable, and update when we interact with objects in our environment (e.g. during tool-use). Distortions are also common after immobilisation, but quickly normalise once movement is regained. We tested the hypothesis that people with CRPS have problems updating bodily and spatial representations, which contributes to the maintenance of their distorted representations by preventing normalization. We also explored spatially defined modulations of hand temperature asymmetries, and any influence of updating bodily and spatial representations on this effect. Thirty-six people with unilateral CRPS (18 upper limb, 18 lower limb) and 36 pain-free controls completed tool-use tasks considered to alter body and peripersonal space representations (measured using tactile distance judgements and a visuotactile crossmodal congruency task, respectively). We also tested how the arrangement (crossed, uncrossed) of the hands and tools affected hand temperature. In upper limb CRPS the non-affected arm representation updated normally, but the affected arm representation updated in the opposite to normal direction. A similar pattern was seen in lower limbs CRPS, although not significant. Furthermore, people with CRPS showed more pronounced updating of peripersonal space than the controls. We did not observe any modulation of hand temperature asymmetries by the arrangement of hands or tools. Our findings suggest enhanced malleability of bodily and spatial representations in CRPS, potentially implicating central mechanisms in the aetiology of this condition.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Inter-subject phase synchronization differentiates neural networks underlying physical pain empathy</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/841197v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Recent approaches for understanding the neural basis of pain empathy emphasize the dynamic construction of neural networks underlying this multifaceted social cognitive process. Inter-subject phase synchronization (ISPS) is an approach for exploratory analysis of task-based fMRI data that reveals brain networks dynamically synchronized to task-features across subjects. We applied ISPS to task-fMRI data assessing vicarious pain empathy in healthy subjects (n=238). The task employed physical (limb) and affective (faces) painful and corresponding non-painful visual stimuli. ISPS revealed two distinct networks synchronized during physical pain observation, one encompassing anterior insula and midcingulate regions strongly engaged in (vicarious) pain, and another encompassing parietal and inferior frontal regions associated with social cognitive processes which may further modulate and support the pain empathic response. No robust network synchronization was observed while processing facial expressions of pain, possibly reflecting high inter-individual variation in response to socially transmitted pain experience. ISPS also revealed networks related to task onset or general processing of physical (limb) or affective (face) stimuli which encompassed networks engaged in object manipulation or face processing, respectively. Together, the ISPS approach permits segregation of networks engaged in different psychological processes, providing additional insight into shared neural mechanisms of empathy for physical pain across individuals.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/841106v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>The brain adapts to a changing environment or growing body size by structural growth and synaptic plasticity. Mechanisms studied to date promote synaptic growth between partner neurons, while negative counterparts that inhibit such interactions have so far remained elusive. Here, we investigate the role of Jeb-Alk signaling in coordinating motor circuit growth during larval stages of Drosophila. We quantify neuronal growth dynamics by intra-vital imaging, and synaptogenesis at nanometer resolution using endogenously labeled synaptic proteins, conditionally tagged with a fluorophore, and link changes in circuit anatomy with altered synaptic physiology and behavior. We find that loss of Jeb-Alk signaling leads to increased strengthening of synaptic excitation by developmental addition of additional postsynaptic but not pre-synaptic specializations. These changes ultimately lead to an epilepsy-like seizure behavior. We thus demonstrate that trans-synaptic anterograde Jeb-Alk signaling acts to stabilize developmental plasticity and circuit function, and that it does so specifically during postembryonic growth.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Olfactory Response as a Marker for Alzheimer\'s Disease: Evidence from Perception and Frontal Oscillation Coherence Deficit</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/840934v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>High-frequency oscillations of the frontal cortex are involved in functions of the brain that fuse processed data from different sensory modules or bind them with elements stored in the memory. These oscillations also provide inhibitory connections to neural circuits that perform lower-level processes. The deficit in the performance of these oscillations has been examined as a marker for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Additionally, the neurodegenerative processes associated with AD, such as the deposition of amyloid-beta plaques, do not occur in a spatially homogeneous fashion and progress more prominently in the medial temporal lobe in the early stages of the disease. This region of the brain contains neural circuitry involved in olfactory perception. Several studies have suggested that olfactory deficit can be used as a marker for early diagnosis of AD. A quantitative assessment of the performance of the olfactory system can hence serve as a potential biomarker for Alzheimer's disease, offering a relatively convenient and inexpensive diagnosis method. This study examines the decline in the perception of olfactory stimuli and the deficit in the performance of high-frequency frontal oscillations in response to olfactory stimulation as markers for AD. Two measurement modalities are employed for assessing the olfactory performance: 1) An interactive smell identification test is used to sample the response to a sizable variety of odorants, and 2) Electrophysiological data are collected in an olfactory perception task with a pair of selected odorants in order to assess the connectivity of frontal cortex regions. Statistical analysis methods are used to assess the significance of selected features extracted from the recorded modalities as Alzheimer's biomarkers. Olfactory decline regressed to age in both healthy and AD groups are evaluated, and single- and multi-modal classifiers are also developed. The novel aspects of this study include: 1) Combining EEG response to olfactory stimulation with behavioral assessment of olfactory perception as a marker of AD, 2) Identification of odorants most significantly affected in AD patients, 3) Identification of odorants which are still adequately perceived by AD patients, 4) Analysis of the decline in the spatial coherence of different oscillatory bands in response to olfactory stimulation, 5) Being the first study to quantitatively assess the performance of olfactory decline due to aging and AD in the Iranian population.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Synaptogenic activity of the axon guidance molecule Robo2 is critical for hippocampal circuit function</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/840710v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>The developmental transition between axon guidance and synapse formation is critical for circuit assembly but still poorly understood at the molecular level. We hypothesized that this key transition could be regulated by axon guidance cues switching their function to regulate synaptogenesis with subcellular specificity. Here, we report evidence for such a functional switch, describing a novel role for the axon guidance molecule Robo2 in excitatory synapse formation onto dendrites of CA1 pyramidal neurons (PNs) in the mouse hippocampus. Cell-autonomous deletion of Robo2 from CA1 PNs leads to a drastic reduction of the number of excitatory synapses specifically in proximal dendritic compartments. At the molecular level, we show that this novel postsynaptic function of Robo2 depends on both its canonical ligand Slit and a novel interaction with presynaptic Neurexins. Biophysical analysis reveals that Robo2 binds directly to Neurexins via its Ig4-5 domains. In vivo 2-photon Ca2+ imaging of CA1 PNs during spatial navigation in mice shows that sparse deletion of Robo2 during development drastically reduces the likelihood of place cell emergence and alters spatial coding properties of the remaining place cells. Our results identify Robo2 as a novel molecular effector linking synaptic specificity to the acquisition of spatial coding properties characterizing hippocampal circuits.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/840645v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Focused attention to spontaneous sensations is a phenomenon that demands interoceptive abilities and a dynamic character of attentive processes. The lack of its control has been linked to neuropsychiatric disorders, such as illness-anxiety disorder. Regulatory strategies, like focused attention meditation, may enhance the ability to control attention particularly to body sensations, which can be reflected on functional neuroanatomy. Adopting a systems-level approach, we aimed at estimating the recurring fMRI functional connectivity (FC) patterns between regions of the dorsal attention network, default mode network, and frontoparietal network during 20 minutes of an attentional task to spontaneous sensations, and during rest before and after the task, in fifteen experienced meditators. Dynamic functional connectivity analysis was performed using sliding windows and k-means clustering. On the rest data, we observed three FC patterns. The task data were associated to five FC patterns, three of them presenting the rest patterns characteristics. The time spent in the rest states varied depending on whether the subjects had or not performed the task. We conclude that interoception performance does not suppress the FC found at rest. Rather, is associated to a more diverse FC organization in time, probably to achieve the task-cognitive demands. The impact of task performance over the subsequent rest period suggests an underlying mechanism probably involved in the learning process linked to cognitive training.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/840629v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Structural plasticity of dendritic spines is considered to be the basis of synaptic plasticity, learning and memory. Here, we performed ultrastructural analysis of spines undergoing LTP using a novel high throughput correlative light-electron microscopy approach. We found that the PSD displays rapid (&amp;lt; 3 min) reorganization of its nanostructure, including perforation and segmentation. This increased structural complexity is maintained over intermediate and late phases of LTP (20 and 120 min). In a few spines, segmented PSDs are connected to different presynaptic terminals, producing a multi-innervated spine in the intermediate and late phases. In addition, the area of extrasynaptic axon-spine interface (eASI) displayed a pronounced, rapid and sustained increase. Finally, presynaptic vesicle number increased slowly and became significantly higher at late phases of LTP. These rapid ultrastructural changes in PSD and surrounding membrane, together with the slow increase in presynaptic vesicle number, likely support the rapid and sustained increase in synaptic transmission during LTP.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Presynaptic depression maintains stable synaptic strength in developmentally arrested Drosophila larvae</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/840470v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Positive and negative modes of regulation typically constrain synaptic growth and function within narrow physiological ranges. However, it is unclear how synaptic strength is maintained when both pre- and post-synaptic compartments continue to grow beyond stages imposed by typical developmental programs. To address whether and how synapses can adjust to a novel life stage for which they were never molded by evolution, we have characterized synaptic growth, structure and function at the Drosophila neuromuscular junction (NMJ) under conditions where larvae are terminally arrested at the third instar stage. While wild type larvae transition to pupae after 5 days, arrested third instar (ATI) larvae persist for up to 35 days, during which NMJs exhibit extensive overgrowth. Remarkably, stable neurotransmission is maintained throughout the ATI lifespan through a potent homeostatic reduction in presynaptic neurotransmitter release. Arrest of the larval stage in stathmin mutants reveals a degree of progressive instability and neurodegeneration that was not apparent during the typical larval period. Hence, during a period of unconstrained synaptic growth through an extended developmental period, a robust and adaptive form of presynaptic homeostatic depression can stabilize neurotransmission. More generally, the ATI manipulation provides an attractive system for studying neurodegeneration and plasticity across longer time scales.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Objective: Redox stress, c-Abl activation, and alpha-synuclein aggregates each independently contribute to neurodegeneration in Parkinson's disease. Interactions between these factors may underlie convergent and feed-forward mechanisms of disease progression. Methods: Alpha-synuclein aggregate formation was induced in neuronal cultures and mouse substantia nigra by exposure to pre-formed human alpha-synuclein fibrils or by AAV-mediated over-expression of alpha-synuclein. Aggregate formation, c-Abl activation, redox stress, and neurodegeneration were evaluated by immunohistochemistry and Western blots, and mouse motor function was evaluated using the rota-rod and pole tests. To suppress redox stress, cultures and mice were treated with N-acetyl cysteine, a thiol repletion agent that supports neuronal glutathione metabolism. Results: In primary neuron cultures, the formation of alpha-synuclein aggregates led to redox stress and c-Abl activation. Redox stress alone, in the absence of alpha-synuclein aggregates, was also sufficient to induced c-Abl activation. N-acetyl cysteine suppressed redox stress, and likewise suppressed both c-Abl activation and alpha-synuclein aggregation. A similar pattern was observed in the two mouse models of Parkinson's disease. In both models, alpha-synuclein aggregates in the substantia nigra were accompanied by redox stress, c-Abl activation, dopaminergic neurodegeneration and motor impairment, all of which were attenuated in mice treated with oral N-acetyl cysteine. Interpretation: These results indicate that alpha-synuclein aggregates induce c-Abl activation by a redox stress mechanism. c-Abl in turn promotes alpha-synuclein aggregation, and this potentially feed-forward process can be blocked by N-acetyl cysteine. The findings thus add mechanistic support for N-acetyl cysteine as a therapeutic for Parkinson's disease.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Hippocampal ensembles represent sequential relationships among discrete nonspatial events</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/840199v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>The hippocampus is critical to the temporal organization of our experiences, including the ability to remember past event sequences and predict future ones. Although this fundamental capacity is conserved across modalities and species, its underlying neuronal mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here we recorded hippocampal ensemble activity as rats remembered a sequence of nonspatial events (5 odor presentations unfolding over several seconds), using a task with established parallels in humans. Using novel statistical methods and deep learning techniques, we then identified new forms of sequential organization in hippocampal activity linked with task performance. We discovered that sequential firing fields (&quot;time cells&quot;) provided temporal information within and across events in the sequence, and that distinct types of task-critical information (stimulus identity, temporal order, and trial outcome) were also sequentially differentiated within event presentations. Finally, as previously only observed with spatial information, we report that the representations of past, present and future events were sequentially activated within individual event presentations, and that these sequential representations could be compressed within an individual theta cycle. These findings strongly suggest that a fundamental function of the hippocampal network is to encode and preserve the sequential order of experiences, and use these representations to generate predictions to inform decision-making.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: The Degree Distribution of Human Brain Functional Connectivity is Generalized Pareto: A Multi-Scale Analysis</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/840066v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Are degree distributions of human brain functional connectivity networks heavy-tailed? Initial claims based on least-square fitting suggested that brain functional connectivity networks obey power law scaling in their degree distributions. This interpretation has been challenged on methodological grounds. Subsequently, estimators based on maximum-likelihood and non-parametric tests involving surrogate data have been proposed. No clear consensus has emerged as results especially depended on data resolution. To identify the underlying topological distribution of brain functional connectivity calls for a closer examination of the relationship between resolution and statistics of model fitting. In this study, we analyze high-resolution functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data from the Human Connectome Project to assess its degree distribution across resolutions. We consider resolutions from one thousand to eighty thousand regions of interest (ROIs) and test whether they follow a heavy or short-tailed distribution. We analyze power law, exponential, truncated power law, log-normal, Weibull and generalized Pareto probability distributions. Notably, the Generalized Pareto distribution is of particular interest since it interpolates between heavy-tailed and short-tailed distributions, and it provides a handle on estimating the tail's heaviness or shortness directly from the data. Our results show that the statistics support the short-tailed limit of the generalized Pareto distribution, rather than a power law or any other heavy-tailed distribution. Working across resolutions of the data and performing cross-model comparisons, we further establish the overall robustness of the generalized Pareto model in explaining the data. Moreover, we account for earlier ambiguities by showing that down-sampling the data systematically affects statistical results. At lower resolutions models cannot easily be differentiated on statistical grounds while their plausibility consistently increases up to an upper bound. Indeed, more power law distributions are reported at low resolutions (5K) than at higher ones (50K or 80K). However, we show that these positive identifications at low resolutions fail cross-model comparisons and that down-sampling data introduces the risk of detecting spurious heavy-tailed distributions. This dependence of the statistics of degree distributions on sampling resolution has broader implications for neuroinformatic methodology, especially, when several analyses rely on down-sampled data, for instance, due to a choice of anatomical parcellations or measurement technique. Our findings that node degrees of human brain functional networks follow a short-tailed distribution have important implications for claims of brain organization and function. Our findings do not support common simplistic representations of the brain as a generic complex system with optimally efficient architecture and function, modeled with simple growth mechanisms. Instead these findings reflect a more nuanced picture of a biological system that has been shaped by longstanding and pervasive developmental and architectural constraints, including wiring-cost constraints on the centrality architecture of individual nodes.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/839514v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Human perception features stable biases, such as perceiving visual events as later than synchronous auditory events. The origin of such perceptual biases is unknown, they could be innate or shaped by sensory experience during a sensitive period. To investigate the role of sensory experience, we tested whether a congenital, transient loss of vision, caused by bilateral dense cataracts, has sustained effects on the ability to order events spatio-temporally within and across sensory modalities. Most strikingly, individuals with reversed congenital cataracts showed a bias towards perceiving visual stimuli as occurring earlier than auditory (Exp. 1) and tactile (Exp. 2) stimuli. In contrast, both normally sighted controls and individuals who could see at birth but developed cataracts during childhood reported the typical bias of perceiving vision as delayed compared to audition. Thus, we provide strong evidence that cross-modal temporal perceptual biases depend on sensory experience and emerge during an early sensitive period.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To investigate if midlife atherosclerosis is associated with different dementia subtypes and related underlying pathologies.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Participants comprised the cardiovascular cohort of the Swedish prospective population‐based Malmö Diet and Cancer Study (n=6103). Carotid plaques and intima media thickness (IMT) were measured at baseline (1991‐1994). Dementia incidence until 2014 was obtained from national registers. Diagnoses were reviewed and validated in medical records.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a cognitively unimpaired subcohort (n=330), β‐amyloid&lt;sub&gt;42&lt;/sub&gt; and tau were quantified in CSF and white matter hyperintensity volume, lacunar infarcts, and cerebral microbleeds were estimated on MRI (2009‐2015).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During 20 years of follow‐up, 462 individuals developed dementia (mean age at baseline 57.5±5.9 years, 58% women). Higher IMT in midlife was associated with an increased hazard ratio (HR) of all‐cause dementia (adjusted HR 1.14 [95% CI 1.03‐1.26]) and vascular dementia (adjusted HR 1.32 [1.10‐1.57]), but not Alzheimer's dementia (AD) (adjusted HR 0.95 [0.77‐1.17]). Carotid plaques were associated with vascular dementia when assessed as a three graded score (adjusted HR 1.90 [1.07‐3.38]).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the cognitively unimpaired subcohort (53.8±4.6 years at baseline, 60% women) higher IMT in midlife was associated with development of small vessel disease (adjusted OR 1.47 [1.05‐2.06]) but not significantly with abnormal CSF AD biomarkers (adjusted OR 1.28 [0.87‐1.90] and 1.35 [0.86‐2.13]). Carotid plaques revealed no significant association with any of the underlying brain pathologies.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our findings support an association between midlife atherosclerosis and development of vascular dementia and cerebral small vessel disease, but not between atherosclerosis and subsequent AD or AD pathology.&lt;/p&gt;

	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25643?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To analyze why numerous acute stroke treatments were successful in the laboratory but failed in large clinical trials.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We searched all phase III trials of medical treatments for acute ischemic stroke and corresponding early clinical and experimental studies. We compared the overall efficacy and assessed the impact of publication bias and study design on the efficacy. Furthermore, we estimated power and true report probability of experimental studies.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We identified 50 phase III trials with 46,008 subjects, 75 early clinical trials with 12,391 subjects, and 209 experimental studies with &amp;gt;7,141 subjects. Three (6%) phase III, 24 (32%) early clinical, and 143 (69.08%) experimental studies were positive. The mean treatment effect was 0.76 (0.70‐0.83) in experimental studies, 0.87 (0.71‐1.06) in early and 1.00 (0.95‐1.06) in phase III trials. Funnel plot asymmetry and trim‐and‐fill revealed a clear publication bias in experimental studies and early clinical trials. Study design and adherence to quality criteria had a considerable impact on estimated effect sizes. The mean power of experimental studies was 17%. Assuming a bias of 30% and pre‐study odds of 0.5‐0.7, this leads to a true report probability of less than 50%.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pivotal study design differences between experimental studies and clinical trials, including different primary endpoints and time‐to‐treatment, publication bias, neglected quality criteria and low power contribute to the stepwise efficacy decline of stroke treatments from experimental studies to phase III clinical trials. Even under conservative estimates, less than half of published positive experimental stroke studies are truly positive.&lt;/p&gt;

	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25642?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To examine whether genetic variation affecting the expression or function of lipid‐lowering drug targets is associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) risk, to evaluate the potential impact of long‐term exposure to corresponding therapeutics.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We conducted Mendelian randomization analyses using variants in genes that encode the protein targets of several approved lipid‐lowering drug classes: &lt;i&gt;HMGCR&lt;/i&gt; (encoding the target for statins); &lt;i&gt;PCSK9&lt;/i&gt; (encoding the target for PCSK9 inhibitors e.g. evolocumab and alirocumab), &lt;i&gt;NPC1L1&lt;/i&gt; (encoding the target for ezetimibe); &lt;i&gt;APOB&lt;/i&gt; (encoding the target of mipomersen). Variants were weighted by associations with low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL‐C) using data from lipid genetics consortia (N up to 295 826). We meta‐analysed MR estimates for regional variants weighted by LDL‐C on AD risk from two large samples (total N = 24718 cases, 56685 controls).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Models for &lt;i&gt;HMGCR, APOB&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;NPC1L1&lt;/i&gt; did not suggest that the use of related lipid‐lowering drug classes would affect AD risk. In contrast, exposure to PCSK9 inhibitors was predicted to increase AD risk in both of the AD samples (combined odds ratio per standard deviation lower LDL‐C inducible by the drug target = 1.45; 95% confidence interval: 1.23, 1.69). This risk increase was opposite to, though more modest than, the degree of protection from coronary artery disease predicted by these same methods for PCSK9 inhibition.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We did not identify genetic support for the repurposing of statins, ezetimibe or mipomersen for AD prevention. Notwithstanding caveats to this genetic evidence, pharmacovigilance for AD risk among users of PCSK9 inhibitors may be warranted.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: Therapeutic drug monitoring newer antiepileptic drugs: a randomised trial for dosage adjustment</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25641?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) is widely established for older generation AEDs, whereas there is limited evidence about newer AEDs. Our aim is to assess the benefit of newer generation AEDs TDM in epilepsy.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We performed a randomised, controlled trial comparing &lt;i&gt;systematic&lt;/i&gt; with &lt;i&gt;rescue&lt;/i&gt; TDM of lamotrigine, levetiracetam, oxcarbazepine, topiramate, brivaracetam, zonisamide, or pregabalin. Participants were adults with epilepsy, in whom treatment with newer generation AEDs was initiated or needed adjustment. In the &lt;i&gt;systematic&lt;/i&gt; TDM arm, AED plasma levels were available at each appointment, whereas in the &lt;i&gt;rescue TDM&lt;/i&gt; arm, levels were known only if a study endpoint was reached (inefficacy or adverse events). The primary outcome was the proportion of participants followed over one year without reaching one of the predefined endpoint.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;151 participants were enrolled; global retention in the study was similar in both arms (56% overall, 58% in the systematic and 53% in rescue TDM arm, p=0.6 Cox regression). There was no difference in term of outcome regarding treatment efficacy or tolerability. Partial adherence of clinicians to TDM (adjusting or not AED dosage based on blood levels) did not explain this lack of benefit.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study provides Class A evidence that systematic drug level monitoring of newer generation AEDs does not bring tangible benefits in the management of patients with epilepsy. Poor correlation between clinical effects and drug levels likely accounts for this finding. However, TDM is useful in several situations, such as pregnancy, as well as compliance issues.&lt;/p&gt;

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1911.02931</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Transfer entropy is an established method for quantifying directed
statistical dependencies in neuroimaging and complex systems datasets. The
pairwise (or bivariate) transfer entropy from a source to a target node in a
network does not depend solely on the local source-target link weight, but on
the wider network structure that the link is embedded in. This relationship is
studied using a discrete-time linearly-coupled Gaussian model, which allows us
to derive the transfer entropy for each link from the network topology. It is
shown analytically that the dependence on the directed link weight is only a
first approximation, valid for weak coupling. More generally, the transfer
entropy increases with the in-degree of the source and decreases with the
in-degree of the target, indicating an asymmetry of information transfer
between hubs and low-degree nodes. In addition, the transfer entropy is
directly proportional to weighted motif counts involving common parents or
multiple walks from the source to the target, which are more abundant in
networks with a high clustering coefficient than in random networks. Our
findings also apply to Granger causality, which is equivalent to transfer
entropy for Gaussian variables. Moreover, similar empirical results on random
Boolean networks suggest that the dependence of the transfer entropy on the
in-degree extends to nonlinear dynamics.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1906.07067</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;We present a neural algorithm for the rapid online learning and
identification of odorant samples under noise, based on the architecture of the
mammalian olfactory bulb and implemented on the Intel Loihi neuromorphic
system. As with biological olfaction, the spike timing-based algorithm utilizes
distributed, event-driven computations and rapid (one-shot) online learning.
Spike timing-dependent plasticity rules are employed iteratively over
sequential gamma-frequency packets to construct odor representations from the
activity of chemosensor arrays mounted in a wind tunnel. Learned odorants then
are reliably identified despite strong destructive interference. Noise
resistance is further enhanced by neuromodulation and contextual priming.
Lifelong learning capabilities are enabled by adult neurogenesis. The algorithm
is applicable to any signal identification problem in which high-dimensional
signals are embedded in unknown backgrounds.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The ability of humans and animals to quickly adapt to novel tasks is
difficult to reconcile with the standard paradigm of learning by slow synaptic

thereafter continue to achieve them without further teacher feedback. We

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Network structure of cascading neural systems predicts stimulus propagation and recovery. (arXiv:1812.09361v2 [q-bio.NC] UPDATED)</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1812.09361</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Many neural systems display cascading behavior characterized by uninterrupted
sequences of neuronal firing. This gap precludes an understanding of how
variations in network structure manifest in neural dynamics and either support
or impinge upon information processing. Here, we develop a theoretical
understanding of how network structure supports information processing through
network dynamics, and we validate our theory with empirical data. Using a
generalized spiking model and mathematical tools from linear systems theory,
network control theory, and information theory, we show how network structure
can be designed to temporally extend the propagation and recovery of certain
stimulus patterns. Moreover, we observe cycles as structural and dynamic motifs
that are prevalent in such networks. Broadly, our results demonstrate how
cascading neural networks could contribute to cognitive faculties that require
lasting activation of neuronal patterns, such as working memory or attention.

	<title>Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Acetylcholine Mediates Dynamic Switching Between Information Coding Schemes in Neuronal Networks</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2019.00064</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Rate coding and phase coding are the two major coding modes seen in the brain. For these two modes, network dynamics must either have a wide distribution of frequencies for rate coding, or a narrow one to achieve stability in phase dynamics for phase coding. Acetylcholine (ACh) is a potent regulator of neural excitability. Acting through the muscarinic receptor, ACh reduces the magnitude of the potassium M-current, a hyperpolarizing current that builds up as neurons fire. The M-current contributes to several excitability features of neurons, becoming a major player in facilitating the transition between Type 1 (integrator) and Type 2 (resonator) excitability. In this paper we argue that this transition enables a dynamic switch between rate coding and phase coding as levels of ACh release change. When a network is in a high ACh state variations in synaptic inputs will lead to a wider distribution of firing rates across the network and this distribution will reflect the network structure or pattern of external input to the network. When ACh is low, network frequencies become narrowly distributed and the structure of a network or pattern of external inputs will be represented through phase relationships between firing neurons. This work provides insights into how modulation of neuronal features influences network dynamics and information processing across brain states.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Internalized GPCRs as Potential Therapeutic Targets for the Management of Pain</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2019.00273</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Peripheral and central neurons in the pain pathway are well equipped to detect and respond to extracellular stimuli such as pro-inflammatory mediators and neurotransmitters through the cell surface expression of receptors that can mediate rapid intracellular signaling. Following injury or infection, activation of cell surface G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) initiates cell signaling processes that lead to the generation of action potentials in neurons or inflammatory responses such as cytokine secretion by immune cells. However, it is now appreciated that cell surface events alone may not be sufficient for all receptors to generate their complete signaling repertoire. Following an initial wave of signaling at the cell surface, active GPCRs can engage with endocytic proteins such as the adaptor protein β-arrestin (βArr) to promote clathrin-mediated internalization. Classically, βArr-mediated internalization of GPCRs was hypothesized to terminate signaling, yet for multiple GPCRs known to contribute to pain, it has been demonstrated that endocytosis can also promote a unique “second wave” of signaling from intracellular membranes, including those of endosomes and the Golgi, that is spatiotemporally distinct from initial cell-surface events. In the context of pain, understanding the cellular and molecular mechanisms that drive spatiotemporal signaling of GPCRs is invaluable for understanding how pain occurs and persists, and how current analgesics achieve efficacy or promote side-effects. This review article discusses the importance of receptor localization for signaling outcomes of pro- and anti-nociceptive GPCRs, and new analgesic opportunities emerging through the development of “location-biased” ligands that favor binding with intracellular GPCR populations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2019.00271</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;There is a growing body of evidence that prionoid protein behaviors are a core element of neurodegenerative diseases (NDs) that afflict humans. Common elements in pathogenesis, pathological effects and protein-level behaviors exist between Alzheimer’s Disease (AD), Parkinson’s Disease (PD), Huntington’s Disease (HD) and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS). These extend beyond the affected neurons to glial cells and processes. This results in a complicated system of disease progression, which often takes advantage of protective processes to promote the propagation of pathological protein aggregates. This review article provides a current snapshot of knowledge on these proteins and their intrinsic role in the pathogenesis and disease progression seen across NDs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Re-innervation of the Denervated Dentate Gyrus by Sprouting Associational and Commissural Mossy Cell Axons in Organotypic Tissue Cultures of Entorhinal Cortex and Hippocampus</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2019.00270</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Collateral sprouting of surviving axons contributes to the synaptic reorganization after brain injury. To study this clinically relevant phenomenon, we used complex organotypic tissue cultures of mouse entorhinal cortex (EC) and hippocampus (H). Single EC-H cultures were generated to analyze associational sprouting, and double EC-H cultures were used to evaluate commissural sprouting of mossy cells in the dentate gyrus (DG) following entorhinal denervation. Entorhinal denervation (transection of the perforant path) was performed at 14 days in vitro (DIV) and associational/commissural sprouting was assessed at 28 DIV. First, associational sprouting was studied in genetically hybrid EC-H cultures of beta-actin-GFPtg and wild-type mice. Using calretinin as a marker, associational axons were found to re-innervate almost the entire entorhinal target zone. Denervation experiments performed with EC-H cultures of Thy1-YFPtg mice, in which mossy cells are YFP-positive, confirmed that the overwhelming majority of sprouting associational calretinin-positive axons are mossy cell axons. Second, we analyzed associational/commissural sprouting by combining wild-type EC-H cultures with calretinin-deficient EC-H cultures. In these cultures, only wild-type mossy cells contain calretinin, and associational and commissural mossy cell collaterals can be distinguished using calretinin as a marker. Nearly the entire DG entorhinal target zone was re-innervated by sprouting of associational and commissural mossy cell axons. Finally, viral labeling of newly formed associational/commissural axons revealed a rapid post-lesional sprouting response. These findings demonstrate extensive and rapid re-innervation of the denervated DG outer molecular layer by associational and commissural mossy cell axons, similar to what has been reported to occur in juvenile rodent DG in vivo.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Integrative Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Effectiveness of Noise-Attenuating Headphones on Physiological Responses for Children With Autism Spectrum Disorders</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnint.2019.00065</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Objective: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the proof of concept of an intervention to decrease sympathetic activation as measured by skin conductivity (electrodermal activity, EDA) in children with an autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and auditory hypersensitivity (hyperacusis). In addition, researchers examined if the intervention provided protection against the negative effects of decibel level of environmental noises on electrodermal measures between interventions. The feasibility of implementation and outcome measures within natural environments were evaluated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Method: A single-subject multi-treatment design was used with six children, aged 8–16 years, with a form of Autism (i.e., Autism, PDD-NOS). Participants used in-ear (IE) and over-ear (OE) headphones for two randomly sequenced treatment phases. Each child completed four phases: (1) a week of baseline data collection; (2) a week of an intervention; (3) a week of no intervention; and (4) a week of the other intervention. Empatica E4 wristbands collected EDA data. Data was collected on 16–20 occasions per participant, with five measurements per phase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Separated tests for paired study phases suggested that regardless of intervention type, noise attenuating headphones led to a significance difference in both skin conductance levels (SCL) and frequency of non-specific conductance responses (NS-SCRs) between the baseline measurement and subsequent phases. Overall, SCL and NS-SCR frequency significantly decreased between baseline and the first intervention phase. A protective effect of the intervention was tested by collapsing intervention results into three phases. Slope correlation suggested constant SCL and NS-SCR frequency after initial use of the headphones regardless of the increase in environmental noises. A subsequent analysis of the quality of EDA data identified that later phases of data collection were associated with better data quality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: Many children with ASD have hypersensitivities to sound resulting in high levels of sympathetic nervous system reactivity, which is associated with problematic behaviors and distress. The findings of this study suggest that the use of noise attenuating headphones for individuals with ASD and hyperacusis may reduce sympathetic activation. Additionally, results suggest that the use of wearable sensors to collect physiological data in natural environments is feasible with established protocols and training procedures.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Neurogenesis section | New and Recent Articles: Aged Opossums Show Alterations in Spatial Learning Behavior and Reduced Neurogenesis in the Dentate Gyrus</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.01210</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In many mammalian species including opossums, adult neurogenesis, the function of which is not completely understood, declines with aging. Aging also causes impairment of cognition. To understand whether new neurons contribute to learning and memory, we performed experiments on young and aged laboratory opossums, Monodelphis domestica, and examined the association between spatial memory using the Morris water maze test and the rate of adult neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus (DG). Modification of this test allowed us to assess how both young and aged opossums learn and remember the location of the platform in the water maze. We found that both young and aged opossums were motivated to perform this task. However, aged opossums needed more time to achieve the test than young opossums. Classical parameters measuring spatial learning in a water maze during a probe test showed that young opossums spent more time in the platform zone crossing it more often than aged opossums. Additionally, hippocampal neurogenesis was lower in the aged opossums than in the young animals but new neurons were still generated in the DG of aged opossums. Our data revealed individual differences in the levels of doublecortin in relation to memory performance across aged opossums. These differences were correlated with distinct behaviors, particularly, aged opossums with high levels of DCX achieved high performance levels in the water maze task. We, therefore suggest that new neurons in the DG of Monodelphis opossums contribute to learning and memory.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Brain Imaging Methods section | New and Recent Articles: Enhancing Attention by Synchronizing Respiration and Fingertip Pressure: A Pilot Study Using Functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.01209</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Sustained attention is a fundamental ability ensuring effective cognitive processing and can be enhanced by meditation practice. However, keeping a focused meditative state is challenging for novices because involuntary mind-wandering frequently occurs during their practice. Inspired by the potential of force-control tasks in invoking internal somatic attention, we proposed a haptics-assisted meditation (HAM) to help reduce mind-wandering and enhance attention. During HAM, participants were instructed to maintain awareness on the respiration and meanwhile adjust bimanual fingertip pressures to keep synchronized with the respiration. This paradigm required somatosensory attention as a physiological foundation, aiming to help novices meditate starting with the body and gradually gain essential meditation skills. A cross-sectional study on 12 novices indicated that the participants reported less mind-wandering during HAM compared with the classic breath-counting meditation (BCM). In a further longitudinal study, the experimental group with 10 novices showed significantly improved performance in several attentional tests after 5 days’ practice of HAM. They tended to show more significant improvements in a few tests than did the control group performing the 5-day BCM practice. To investigate the brain activities related to HAM, we applied functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) to record cerebral hemodynamic responses from the prefrontal and sensorimotor cortices when performing HAM, and we assessed the changes in cerebral activation and functional connectivity (FC) after the 5-day HAM practice. The prefrontal and sensorimotor regions demonstrated a uniform activation when performing HAM, and there was a significant increase in the right prefrontal activation after the practice. We also observed significant changes in the FC between the brain regions related to the attention networks. These behavioral and neural findings together provided preliminary evidence for the effectiveness of HAM on attention enhancement in the early stage of meditation learning.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.01178</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is the principal cause of death and disability in children and young adults. Clinical and preclinical research efforts have been carried out to understand the acute, life-threatening pathophysiological events happening after TBI. In the past few years, however, it was recognized that TBI causes significant morbidity weeks, months, or years after the initial injury, thereby contributing substantially to the overall burden of TBI and the decrease of life expectancy in these patients. Long-lasting sequels of TBI include cognitive decline/dementia, sensory-motor dysfunction, and psychiatric disorders, and most important for patients is the need for socio-economic rehabilitation affecting their quality of life. Cerebrovascular alterations have been described during the first week after TBI for direct consequence development of neuroinflammatory process in relation to brain edema. Within the brain–immune interactions, the complement system, which is a family of blood and cell surface proteins, participates in the pathophysiology process. In fact, the complement system is part of the primary defense and clearance component of innate and adaptive immune response. In this review, the complement activation after TBI will be described in relation to the activation of the microglia and astrocytes as well as the blood–brain barrier dysfunction during the first week after the injury. Considering the neuroinflammatory activity as a causal element of neurological handicaps, some major parallel lines of complement activity in multiple sclerosis and Alzheimer pathologies with regard to cognitive impairment will be discussed for chronic TBI. A better understanding of the role of complement activation could facilitate the development of new therapeutic approaches for TBI.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Propriospinal interneurons (INs) communicate information over short and long distances within the spinal cord. They act to coordinate different parts of the body by linking motor circuits that control muscles across the forelimbs, trunk, and hindlimbs. Their role in coordinating locomotor circuits near and far may be invaluable to the recovery of locomotor function lost due to injury to the spinal cord where the flow of motor commands from the brain and brainstem to spinal motor circuits is disrupted. The formation and activation of circuits established by spared propriospinal INs may promote the re-emergence of locomotion. In light of progress made in animal models of spinal cord injury (SCI) and in human patients, we discuss the role of propriospinal INs in the intact spinal cord and describe recent studies investigating the assembly and/or activation of propriospinal circuits to promote recovery of locomotion following SCI.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2019.00509</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Brain mitochondrial dysfunction is involved in the development of neurological and neurodegenerative diseases. Mitochondria specifically located at synapses play a key role in providing energy to support synaptic functions and plasticity, thus their defects may lead to synaptic failure, which is a common hallmark of neurodegenerative diseases. High-Fat Diet (HFD) consumption increases brain oxidative stress and impairs brain mitochondrial functions, although the underlying mechanisms are not completely understood. The aim of our study is to analyze neuroinflammation and mitochondrial dysfunctions in brain cortex and synaptosomal fraction isolated from a mouse model of diet-induced obesity. Male C57Bl/6 mice were divided into two groups fed a standard diet or HFD for 18 weeks. At the end of the treatment, inflammation (detected by ELISA), antioxidant state (measured by enzymatic activity), mitochondrial functions and efficiency (detected by oxidative capacity and Seahorse analysis), and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) pathway (analyzed by western blot) were determined in brain cortex and synaptosomal fraction. In HFD animals, we observed an increase in inflammatory parameters and oxidative stress and a decrease in mitochondrial oxidative capacity both in the brain cortex and synaptosomal fraction. These alterations parallel with modulation of BDNF, a brain key signaling molecule that is linking synaptic plasticity and energy metabolism. Neuroinflammation HFD-dependent negatively affects BDNF pathway and mitochondrial activity in the brain cortex. The effect is even more pronounced in the synaptic region, where the impaired energy supply may have a negative impact on neuronal plasticity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2019.00508</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Oriens-lacunosum moleculare (OLM) cells are hippocampal inhibitory interneurons that are implicated in the regulation of information flow in the CA1 circuit, inhibiting cortical inputs to distal pyramidal cell dendrites, whilst disinhibiting CA3 inputs to pyramidal cells. OLM cells express metabotropic cholinergic (mAChR) and glutamatergic (mGluR) receptors, so modulation of these cells via these receptors may contribute to switching between functional modes of the hippocampus. Using a transgenic mouse line to identify OLM cells, we found that both mAChR and mGluR activation caused the cells to exhibit long-lasting depolarizing plateau potentials following evoked spike trains. Both mAChR- and mGluR-induced plateau potentials were eliminated by blocking transient receptor potential (TRP) channels, and were dependent on intracellular calcium concentration and calcium entry. Pharmacological tests indicated that Group I mGluRs are responsible for the glutamatergic induction of plateaus. There was also a pronounced synergy between the cholinergic and glutamatergic modulation, plateau potentials being generated by agonists applied together at concentrations too low to elicit any change when applied individually. This synergy could enable OLM cells to function as coincidence detectors of different neuromodulatory systems, leading to their enhanced and prolonged activation and a functional change in information flow within the hippocampus.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Activation of α7 Nicotinic Acetylcholine Receptor Protects Against 1-Methyl-4-Phenylpyridinium-Induced Astroglial Apoptosis</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2019.00507</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Astrocytes, as the largest population of glial subtype, play crucial roles in normal brain function and pathological conditions, such as Parkinson’s disease (PD). Restoring the functions of astrocyte is a promising new therapeutic target for PD. Astrocytes can express multiple types of neurotransmitter receptors, including functional α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (α7nAChR). Previously, we found that a non-selective α7nAChR agonist nicotine exerted a protective effect against H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-induced astrocyte apoptosis via an α7nAChR-dependent pathway. However, the molecular mechanism of the antiapoptotic response of astroglial α7nAChR has not been studied. In the present study, using pharmacological inhibition and genetic knockout of α7nAChR, we assessed the antiapoptotic effects of an α7nAChR agonist PNU-282987 in primary cultured astrocytes treated with 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;). PNU-282987 promoted the viability of astrocytes, alleviated MPP&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; induced apoptosis, and decreased the number of GFAP&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/TUNEL&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cells. Meanwhile, PNU-282987 upregulated the expression of the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2 and downregulated the expression of the apoptotic protein Bax and cleaved-caspase-3. Moreover, the suppression of the JNK-p53-caspase-3 signaling may underlie the neuroprotective property of PNU-282987. Therefore, PNU-282987 ameliorates astroglial apoptosis induced by MPP&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; through α7nAChR-JNK-p53 signaling. Our findings suggest that PNU-282987 may be a potential drug for restoring astroglial functions in the treatment of PD.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Astrocyte Changes in the Prefrontal Cortex From Aged Non-suicidal Depressed Patients</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2019.00503</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Glia alterations in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) have been postulated to play an important role in the pathophysiology of psychiatric disorders. Astroglia is the most abundant type of glial cells in the central nervous system. The expression levels of astrocyte markers (glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), synemin-α, synemin-β, vimentin, nestin) in isolated gray matter from postmortem ACC and DLPFC were determined to investigate the possible involvement of astrocytes in depression. Donors were aged non-suicidal subjects with bipolar disorder (BPD) or major depressive disorder (MDD), and matched controls. GFAP mRNA levels were significantly increased in the ACC of BPD patients. However, GFAP immunohistochemistry showed that the area fraction of GFAP immunoreactive astrocytes was decreased in the ACC of BPD patients, while there were no changes in the cell density and integrated optical density (IOD), indicating that there might be a reduction of GFAP-positive astrocyte processes and remodeling of the astrocyte network in BPD. Furthermore, in controls, DLPFC GFAP mRNA levels were significantly lower with a time of death at daytime (08:01–20:00 h) compared to nighttime (20:01–08:00 h). In depression, such a diurnal pattern was not present. These findings in BPD and MDD subjects warrant further studies given the crucial roles of astrocytes in the central nervous system.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Biosensors Show the Pharmacokinetics of S-Ketamine in the Endoplasmic Reticulum</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2019.00499</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The target for the “rapid” (&amp;lt;24 h) antidepressant effects of S-ketamine is unknown, vitiating programs to rationally develop more effective rapid antidepressants. To describe a drug’s target, one must first understand the compartments entered by the drug, at all levels—the organ, the cell, and the organelle. We have, therefore, developed molecular tools to measure the subcellular, organellar pharmacokinetics of S-ketamine. The tools are genetically encoded intensity-based S-ketamine-sensing fluorescent reporters, iSKetSnFR1 and iSKetSnFR2. In solution, these biosensors respond to S-ketamine with a sensitivity, S-slope = delta(F/F&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;)/(delta[S-ketamine]) of 0.23 and 1.9/μM, respectively. The iSKetSnFR2 construct allows measurements at &amp;lt;0.3 μM S-ketamine. The iSKetSnFR1 and iSKetSnFR2 biosensors display &amp;gt;100-fold selectivity over other ligands tested, including R-ketamine. We targeted each of the sensors to either the plasma membrane (PM) or the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Measurements on these biosensors expressed in Neuro2a cells and in human dopaminergic neurons differentiated from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) show that S-ketamine enters the ER within a few seconds after appearing in the external solution near the PM, then leaves as rapidly after S-ketamine is removed from the extracellular solution. In cells, S-slopes for the ER and PM-targeted sensors differ by &amp;lt;2-fold, indicating that the ER [S-ketamine] is less than 2-fold different from the extracellular [S-ketamine]. Organelles represent potential compartments for the engagement of S-ketamine with its antidepressant target, and potential S-ketamine targets include organellar ion channels, receptors, and transporters.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Generation and Characterization of Specific Monoclonal Antibodies and Nanobodies Directed Against the ATP-Gated Channel P2X4</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2019.00498</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The P2X4 channel is involved in different physiological and pathological conditions and functions in the nervous system. Despite the existence of several mouse models for which the expression of the gene was manipulated, there is still little information on the expression of the protein at the cellular level. In particular, supposedly specific available antibodies have often proved to recognize unrelated proteins in P2X4-deficient mice. Here, we used an in vivo DNA vaccine approach to generate a series of monoclonal antibodies and nanobodies specific for human, mouse, and rat P2X4 channels. We further characterized these antibodies and show that they solely recognize the native form of the proteins both in biochemical and cytometric applications. Some of these antibodies prove to specifically recognize P2X4 channels by immunostaining in brain or sensory ganglia slices, as well as at the cellular and subcellular levels. Due to their clonality, these different antibodies should represent versatile tools for further characterizing the cellular functions of P2X4 in the nervous system as well as at the periphery.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The most commonly studied form of synaptic plasticity is long-term potentiation (LTP). Over the last 15 years, it has been possible to induce structural and functional LTP in dendritic spines using two-photon glutamate uncaging, allowing for studying the signaling mechanisms of LTP with single synapse resolution. In this review, we compare different stimulation methods to induce single synapse LTP and discuss how LTP is expressed. We summarize the underlying signaling mechanisms that have been studied with high spatiotemporal resolution. Finally, we discuss how LTP in a single synapse can be affected by excitatory and inhibitory synapses nearby. We argue that single synapse LTP is highly dependent on context: the choice of induction method, the history of the dendritic spine and the dendritic vicinity crucially affect signaling pathways and expression of single synapse LTP.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: SIRT3 Regulation of Mitochondrial Quality Control in Neurodegenerative Diseases</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2019.00313</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Neurodegenerative diseases are disorders that are characterized by a progressive decline of motor and/or cognitive functions caused by the selective degeneration and loss of neurons within the central nervous system. The most common neurodegenerative diseases are Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Parkinson’s disease (PD), and Huntington’s disease (HD). Neurons have high energy demands, and dysregulation of mitochondrial quality and function is an important cause of neuronal degeneration. Mitochondrial quality control plays an important role in maintaining mitochondrial integrity and ensuring normal mitochondrial function; thus, defects in mitochondrial quality control are also significant causes of neurodegenerative diseases. The mitochondrial deacetylase SIRT3 has been found to have a large effect on mitochondrial function. Recent studies have also shown that SIRT3 has a role in mitochondrial quality control, including in the refolding or degradation of misfolded/unfolded proteins, mitochondrial dynamics, mitophagy, and mitochondrial biogenesis, all of which are affected in neurodegenerative diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Tau Phosphorylation in a Mouse Model of Temporal Lobe Epilepsy</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2019.00308</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Hyperphosphorylation of the microtubule-associated protein tau and its resultant aggregation into neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) is a pathological characteristic of neurodegenerative disorders known as tauopathies. Tau is a neuronal protein involved in the stabilization of microtubule structures of the axon and the aberrant phosphorylation of tau is associated with several neurotoxic effects. The discovery of tau pathology and aggregates in the cortex of Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) patients has focused interest on hyperphosphorylation of tau as a potential mechanism contributing to increased states of hyperexcitability and cognitive decline. Previous studies using animal models of status epilepticus and tissue from patients with TLE have shown increased tau phosphorylation in the brain following acute seizures and during epilepsy, with tau phosphorylation correlating with cognitive deficits in patients. Suggesting a functional role of tau during epilepsy, studies in tau-deficient and tau-overexpressing mice have demonstrated a causal role of tau during seizure generation. Previous studies, analyzing the impact of seizures on tau hyperphosphorylation, have mainly used animal models of acute seizures. These models, however, do not replicate all aspects of chronic epilepsy. In this study, we investigated the effects of acute seizures (status epilepticus) and chronic epilepsy upon the expression and phosphorylation of tau using the intra-amygdala kainic acid (KA)-induced status epilepticus mouse model. Status epilepticus resulted in an immediate increase in total tau levels in the hippocampus, in particular, the dentate gyrus, and phosphorylation of the AT8 epitope (Ser202, Thr205), with phosphorylated tau mainly localizing to the mossy fibers of the dentate gyrus. During epilepsy, abnormal phosphorylation of tau was detected again at the AT8 epitope with lower total tau levels in the CA3 and CA1 subfields of the hippocampus. Chronic epilepsy in mice also resulted in a strong localization of AT8 phospho-tau to microglia, indicating a distinct pattern of tau hyperphosphorylation during chronic epilepsy compared to status epilepticus. Our results reaffirm previous observations of tau phosphorylation post-status epilepticus, but also elaborate on tau alterations in epileptic mice which more faithfully mimic TLE. Our results confirm seizures affect tau hyperphosphorylation, however, suggest epitope-specific phosphorylation of tau and differences in cell-specific localization according to disease progression.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Differences in Semantic Memory Encoding Strategies in Young, Healthy Old and MCI Patients</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2019.00306</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Associative processes, such as the encoding of associations between words in a list, can enhance episodic memory performance and are thought to deteriorate with age. Here, we examine the nature of age-related deficits in the encoding of associations, by using a free recall paradigm with visual arrays of objects. Fifty-five participants (26 young students; 20 cognitive healthy older adults; nine patients with Mild Cognitive Impairment, MCI) were shown multiple slides (experimental trials), each containing an array of nine common objects for recall. Most of the arrays contained three objects from three semantic categories, each. In the remaining arrays, the nine objects were unrelated. Eye fixations were also monitored during the viewing of the arrays, in a subset of the participants. While for young participants the immediate recall was higher for the semantically related arrays, this effect was diminished in healthy elderly and totally absent in MCI patients. Furthermore, only in the young group did the sequence of eye fixations show a semantic scanning pattern during encoding, even when the related objects were non- adjacent in the array. Healthy elderly and MCI patients were not influenced by the semantic relatedness of items during the array encoding, to the same extent as young subjects, as observed by a lack of (or reduced) semantic scanning. The results support a version of the encoding of the association aging-deficit hypothesis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: latest articles: Insights into the evolution of social systems and species from baboon studies</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/50989</link>
	<content:encoded>Baboons, members of the genus &lt;i&gt;Papio,&lt;/i&gt; comprise six closely related species distributed throughout sub-Saharan Africa and southwest Arabia. The species exhibit more ecological flexibility and a wider range of social systems than many other primates. This article summarizes our current knowledge of the natural history of baboons and highlights directions for future research. We suggest that baboons can serve as a valuable model for complex evolutionary processes, such as speciation and hybridization. The evolution of baboons has been heavily shaped by climatic changes and population expansion and fragmentation in the African savanna environment, similar to the processes that acted during human evolution. With accumulating long-term data, and new data from previously understudied species, baboons are ideally suited for investigating the links between sociality, health, longevity and reproductive success. To achieve these aims, we propose a closer integration of studies at the proximate level, including functional genomics, with behavioral and ecological studies.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/50903</link>
	<content:encoded>Misfolded proteins in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) are retrotranslocated into the cytosol and polyubiquitinated before being degraded by the proteasome. The multi-spanning ubiquitin ligase Hrd1 forms the retrotranslocation channel and associates with three other membrane proteins (Hrd3, Usa1, Der1) of poorly defined function. The Hrd1 channel is gated by autoubiquitination, but how Hrd1 escapes degradation by the proteasome and returns to its inactive ground state is unknown. Here, we show that autoubiquitination of Hrd1 is counteracted by Ubp1, a deubiquitinating enzyme that requires its N-terminal transmembrane segment for activity towards Hrd1. The Hrd1 partner Hrd3 serves as a brake for autoubiquitination, while Usa1 attenuates Ubp1's deubiquitination activity through an inhibitory effect of its UBL domain. These results lead to a model in which the Hrd1 channel is regulated by cycles of autoubiquitination and deubiquitination, reactions that are modulated by the other components of the Hrd1 complex.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: latest articles: DNA damage checkpoint activation impairs chromatin homeostasis and promotes mitotic catastrophe during aging</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/50778</link>
	<content:encoded>Genome instability is a hallmark of aging and contributes to age-related disorders such as cancer and Alzheimer’s disease. The accumulation of DNA damage during aging has been linked to altered cell cycle dynamics and the failure of cell cycle checkpoints. Here, we use single cell imaging to study the consequences of increased genomic instability during aging in budding yeast and identify striking age-associated genome missegregation events. This breakdown in mitotic fidelity results from the age-related activation of the DNA damage checkpoint and the resulting degradation of histone proteins. Disrupting the ability of cells to degrade histones in response to DNA damage increases replicative lifespan and reduces genomic missegregations. We present several lines of evidence supporting a model of antagonistic pleiotropy in the DNA damage response where histone degradation, and limited histone transcription are beneficial to respond rapidly to damage but reduce lifespan and genomic stability in the long term.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/50776</link>
	<content:encoded>The functional mechanisms of membrane proteins are extensively investigated with cysteine mutagenesis. To complement cysteine-based approaches, we engineered a membrane protein with thiol-independent crosslinkable groups using azidohomoalanine (AHA), a non-canonical methionine analogue containing an azide group that can selectively react with cycloalkynes through a strain-promoted azide-alkyne cycloaddition (SPAAC) reaction. We demonstrate that AHA can be readily incorporated into the Shaker Kv channel in place of methionine residues and modified with azide-reactive alkyne probes in &lt;i&gt;Xenopus&lt;/i&gt; oocytes. Using voltage-clamp fluorometry, we show that AHA incorporation permits site-specific fluorescent labeling to track voltage-dependent conformational changes similar to cysteine-based methods. By combining AHA incorporation and cysteine mutagenesis in an orthogonal manner, we were able to site-specifically label the Shaker Kv channel with two different fluorophores simultaneously. Our results identify a facile and straightforward approach for chemical modification of membrane proteins with bioorthogonal chemistry to explore their structure-function relationships in live cells.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/49511</link>
	<content:encoded>The basal ganglia are critical for the control of motor behaviors and for reinforcement learning. Here, we demonstrate in rats that primary and secondary motor areas (M1 and M2) make functional synaptic connections in the globus pallidus (GP), not usually thought of as an input site of the basal ganglia. Morphological observation revealed that the density of axonal boutons from motor cortices in the GP was 47% and 78% of that in the subthalamic nucleus (STN) from M1 and M2, respectively. Cortical excitation of GP neurons was comparable to that of STN neurons in slice preparations. FoxP2-expressing arkypallidal neurons were preferentially innervated by the motor cortex. The connection probability of cortico-pallidal innervation was higher for M2 than M1. These results suggest that cortico-pallidal innervation is an additional excitatory input to the basal ganglia, and that it can affect behaviors via the cortex-basal ganglia-thalamus motor loop.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/49190</link>
	<content:encoded>Nociceptive information is relayed through the spinal cord dorsal horn, a critical area in sensory processing. The neuronal circuits in this region that underpin sensory perception must be clarified to better understand how dysfunction can lead to pathological pain. This study used an optogenetic approach to selectively activate spinal interneurons that express the calcium-binding protein calretinin (CR). We show that these interneurons form an interconnected network that can initiate and sustain enhanced excitatory signaling, and directly relay signals to lamina I projection neurons. Photoactivation of CR interneurons in vivo resulted in a significant nocifensive behavior that was morphine sensitive, caused a conditioned place aversion, and was enhanced by spared nerve injury. Furthermore, halorhodopsin-mediated inhibition of these interneurons elevated sensory thresholds. Our results suggest that dorsal horn circuits that involve excitatory CR neurons are important for the generation and amplification of pain and identify these interneurons as a future analgesic target.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/840074v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Mounting evidence suggests that perception depends on a largely-feedforward brain network. However, the discrepancy between (i) the latency of the corresponding feedforward responses (150-200 ms) and (ii) the time it takes human subjects to recognize brief images (often &amp;gt;500 ms) suggests that recurrent neuronal activity is critical to visual processing. Here, we use magneto-encephalography to localize, track and decode the feedforward and recurrent responses elicited by brief presentations of variably-ambiguous letters and digits. We first confirm that these stimuli trigger, within the first 200 ms, a feedforward response in the ventral and dorsal cortical pathways. The subsequent activity is distributed across temporal, parietal and prefrontal cortices and leads to a slow and incremental cascade of representations culminating in action-specific motor signals. We introduce an analytical framework to show that these brain responses are best accounted for by a hierarchy of recurrent neural assemblies. An accumulation of computational delays across specific processing stages explains subjects reaction times. Finally, the slow convergence of neural representations towards perceptual categories is quickly followed by all-or-none motor decision signals. Together, these results show how recurrent processes generate, over extended time periods, a cascade of hierarchical decisions that ultimately predicts subjects perceptual reports.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Pseudoreplication occurs when the number of measured values or data points exceeds the number of genuine replicates, and when the statistical analysis treats all data points as independent and thus fully contributing to the result. By artificially inflating the sample size, pseudoreplication contributes to irreproducibility, and it is a pervasive problem in biological research. In some fields, more than half of published experiments have pseudoreplication - making it one of the biggest threats to inferential validity. Researchers may be reluctant to use appropriate statistical methods if their hypothesis is about the pseudoreplicates and not the genuine replicates; for example, when an intervention is applied to pregnant female rodents (genuine replicates) but the hypothesis is about the effect on the multiple offspring (pseudoreplicates). We propose using a Bayesian predictive approach, which enables researchers to make valid inferences about biological entities of interest, even if they are pseudoreplicates, and show the benefits of this approach using two in vivo data sets.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/839852v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Epilepsy is a serious neurological disorder and characterized by recurrent and unprovoked seizures. A critical pathological factor in the seizure genesis is neuronal loss. However, mechanisms which lead to neuronal death remain elusive. Our present investigation depicted that ferroptosis, a recently discovered iron- and lipid peroxidation-dependent cell death, probably served as a mechanism in murine models of kainic acid (KA)-induced seizures. And treatment with ferroptosis inhibitors ferrostatin-1 (Fer-1), liproxstatin-1 (Lipo-1) or deferoxamine (DFO) significantly suppressed seizure severity and frequency. Using gene expression profiling in HT22 cells after glutamate exposure (a validated ferroptotic cell death model), we identified lysyl oxidase (Lox) as a novel inducer of ferroptosis. Mechanistically, Lox promoted ferroptosis via activation of extracellular regulated protein kinase (ERK)-dependent 5-lipoxygenase (Alox5) phosphorylation at serine 663 residue signaling, subsequent leading to lipid reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation. In a murine model of KA-induced seizure, we illustrated that administration of {beta}-aminopropionitrile (BAPN), a specific Lox inhibitor, remarkably prevented seizure generation. Overall, these findings highlight Lox, a novel identified ferroptotic regulator in neurons, serves as a potential target for seizure-related disease including epilepsy.</content:encoded>

Cancer is driven by genetic mutations that dysregulate pathways important for proper cell function. Therefore, discovering these cancer pathways and their dysregulation order is key to understanding and treating cancer. However, the heterogeneity of mutations between different individuals makes this challenging and requires that cancer progression is studied in a subtype-specific way. To address this challenge, we provide a mathematical model, called Subtype-specific Pathway Linear Progression Model (SPM), that simultaneously captures cancer subtypes and pathways and order of dysregulation of the pathways within each subtype. Experiments with synthetic data indicate the robustness of SPM to problem specifics including noise compared to an existing method. Moreover, experimental results on glioblastoma multiforme and colorectal adenocarcinoma show the consistency of SPM’s results with the existing knowledge and its superiority to an existing method in certain cases. The implementation of our method is available at https://github.com/Dalton386/SPM.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/4xYNLSR_9MM&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

However, these methods suffer from both false positive and false negative reports, and the candidates identified with different methods are often inconsistent with each other. We propose that a biological cause of this problem can be population subdivision, and a technical cause can be incomplete, or inaccurate, modeling of the dynamic process associated with sweeps. Here we used simulations to show how these effects interact and potentially cause bias. In particular, we show that sweeps maybe misclassified as either hard or soft, when the true time stage of a sweep and that implied, or pre-supposed, by the model do not match. We call this “temporal misclassification”. Similarly, “spatial misclassification (softening)” can occur when hard sweeps, which are imported by migration into a new subpopulation, are falsely identified as soft. This can easily happen in case of local adaptation, i.e. when the sweeping allele is not under positive selection in the new subpopulation, and the underlying model assumes panmixis instead of substructure. The claim that most sweeps in the evolutionary history of humans were soft, may have to be reconsidered in the light of these findings.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Uo3Uonzh4A4&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

The titre of virus in a dengue patient and the duration of this viraemia has a profound effect on whether or not a mosquito will become infected when it feeds on the patient and this, in turn, is a key driver of the magnitude of a dengue outbreak. The assessment of the heterogeneity of viral dynamics in dengue-infected patients and its precise treatment are still uncertain. Infection onset, patient physiology and immune response are thought to play major roles in the development of the viral load. Research has explored the interference and spontaneous generation of defective virus particles, but have not examined both the antibody and defective particles during natural infection. We explore the intrinsic variability in the within-host dynamics of viraemias for a population of patients using the method of population of models (POMs). A dataset from 208 patients is used to initially calibrate 20,000 models for the infection kinetics for each of the four dengue virus serotypes. The calibrated POMs suggests that naturally generated defective particles may interfere with the viraemia, but the generated defective virus particles are not adequate to reduce high fever and viraemia duration. The effect of adding excess defective dengue virus interfering particles to patients as a therapeutic is evaluated using the calibrated POMs in a bang-bang (on-off or two-step) optimal control setting. Bang-bang control is a class of binary feedback control that turns either ‘ON’ or ‘OFF’ at different time points, determined by the system feedback. Here, the bang-bang control estimates the mathematically optimal dose and duration of the intervention for each model in the POM set.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/DRPp8QCaKbw&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>RSS PAP: Developmental nicotine exposure alters synaptic input to hypoglossal motoneurons, and is associated with altered function of upper airway muscles</title>
	<link>http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0299-19.2019v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Nicotine exposure during the fetal and neonatal periods (Developmental nicotine exposure, DNE) is associated with ineffective upper airway protective reflexes in infants. This could be explained by desensitized chemoreceptors and/or mechanoreceptors, diminished neuromuscular transmission or altered synaptic transmission among central neurons, as each of these systems depend in part on cholinergic signaling through nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs). Here we showed that DNE blunts the response of the genioglossus muscle to nasal airway occlusion in lightly anesthetized rat pups. The genioglossus muscle helps keep the upper airway open and is innervated by hypoglossal motoneurons (XIIMNs). Experiments using the phrenic nerve-diaphragm preparation showed that DNE does not alter transmission across the neuromuscular junction. Accordingly, we used whole cell recordings from XIIMNs in brainstem slices to examine the influence of DNE on glutamatergic synaptic transmission under baseline conditions and in response to an acute nicotine challenge. DNE did not alter excitatory transmission under baseline conditions. Analysis of cumulative probability distributions revealed that acute nicotine challenge of P1-P2 preparations resulted in an increase in the frequency of nicotine-induced glutamatergic inputs to XIIMNs in both control and DNE. By contrast, P3-P5 DNE pups showed a decrease, rather than an increase in frequency. We suggest that this, together with previous studies showing that DNE is associated with a compensatory increase in inhibitory synaptic input to XIIMNs, leads to an excitatory-inhibitory imbalance. This imbalance may contribute to the blunting of airway protective reflexes observed in nicotine exposed animals and human infants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance statement&lt;/b&gt; The number one risk factor for sudden infant death (SIDS) is maternal smoking. While the use of nicotine delivery devices such as e-cigarettes is increasing among women of childbearing age, reflecting the belief that the use of nicotine alone is safer than tobacco, SIDS deaths are not decreasing, suggesting that nicotine is the link between maternal smoking and SIDS. Here we show that perinatal nicotine exposure alters a major motor pathway responsible for upper airway patency during sleep. We also introduce an animal model that is well suited to probing the mechanisms underlying the link between maternal nicotine consumption and SIDS, and a phenotype that nicely models key aspects of the events believed to give rise to SIDS.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Towards Monitoring Parkinson's Disease Following Drug Treatment: CGP Classification of rs-MRI Data. (arXiv:1911.03439v1 [cs.NE])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1911.03439</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Background and Objective: It is commonly accepted that accurate monitoring of
neurodegenerative diseases is crucial for effective disease management and
delivery of medication and treatment. This research develops automatic clinical
monitoring techniques for PD, following treatment, using the novel application
of EAs. Specifically, the research question addressed was: Can accurate
monitoring of PD be achieved using EAs on rs-fMRI data for patients prescribed
Modafinil (typically prescribed for PD patients to relieve physical fatigue)?
Methods: This research develops novel clinical monitoring tools using data from
a controlled experiment where participants were administered Modafinil versus
placebo, examining the novel application of EAs to both map and predict the
functional connectivity in participants using rs-fMRI data. Specifically, CGP
was used to classify DCM analysis and timeseries data. Results were validated
with two other commonly used classification methods (ANN and SVM) and via
k-fold cross-validation. Results: Findings revealed a maximum accuracy of
74.57% for CGP. Furthermore, CGP provided comparable performance accuracy
relative to ANN and SVM. Nevertheless, EAs enable us to decode the classifier,
in terms of understanding the data inputs that are used, more easily than in
ANN and SVM. Conclusions: These findings underscore the applicability of both
DCM analyses for classification and CGP as a novel classification technique for
brain imaging data with medical implications for medication monitoring.
Furthermore, classification of fMRI data for research typically involves
statistical modelling techniques being often hypothesis driven, whereas EAs use
data-driven explanatory modelling methods resulting in numerous benefits. DCM
analysis is novel for classification and advantageous as it provides
information on the causal links between different brain regions.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1911.03268</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Progress in natural language processing (NLP) models that estimate
representations of word sequences has recently been leveraged to improve the
understanding of language processing in the brain. However, these models have
not been specifically designed to capture the way the brain represents language
meaning. We hypothesize that fine-tuning these models to predict recordings of
brain activity of people reading text will lead to representations that encode
more brain-activity-relevant language information. We demonstrate that a
version of BERT, a recently introduced and powerful language model, can improve
the prediction of brain activity after fine-tuning. We show that the
relationship between language and brain activity learned by BERT during this
fine-tuning transfers across multiple participants. We also show that, for some
participants, the fine-tuned representations learned from both
magnetoencephalography (MEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)
are better for predicting fMRI than the representations learned from fMRI
alone, indicating that the learned representations capture
brain-activity-relevant information that is not simply an artifact of the
modality. While changes to language representations help the model predict
brain activity, they also do not harm the model's ability to perform downstream
NLP tasks. Our findings are notable for research on language understanding in
the brain.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1911.02926</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Characterizing time-evolving networks is a challenging task, but it is
crucial for understanding the dynamic behavior of complex systems such as the
brain. For instance, how spatial networks of functional connectivity in the
brain evolve during a task is not well-understood. A traditional approach in
neuroimaging data analysis is to make simplifications through the assumption of
static spatial networks. In this paper, without assuming static networks in
time and/or space, we arrange the temporal data as a higher-order tensor and
use a tensor factorization model called PARAFAC2 to capture underlying patterns
(spatial networks) in time-evolving data and their evolution. Numerical
experiments on simulated data demonstrate that PARAFAC2 can successfully reveal
the underlying networks and their dynamics. We also show the promising
performance of the model in terms of tracing the evolution of task-related
functional connectivity in the brain through the analysis of functional
magnetic resonance imaging data.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Our interest focuses on developing statistical methods for analysis of brain
structural connectomes. Nodes in the brain connectome graph correspond to
different regions of interest (ROIs) while edges correspond to white matter
fiber connections between these ROIs. Due to the high-dimensionality and
non-Euclidean nature of the data, it becomes challenging to conduct analyses of
the population distribution of brain connectomes and relate connectomes to
other factors, such as cognition. Current approaches focus on summarizing the
graph using either pre-specified topological features or principal components
analysis (PCA). In this article, we instead develop a nonlinear latent factor
model for summarizing the brain graph in both unsupervised and supervised
settings. The proposed approach builds on methods for hierarchical modeling of
replicated graph data, as well as variational auto-encoders that use neural
networks for dimensionality reduction. We refer to our method as Graph
AuTo-Encoding (GATE). We compare GATE with tensor PCA and other competitors
through simulations and applications to data from the Human Connectome Project
(HCP).

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: A Numerical Study of the Time of Extinction in a Class of Systems of Spiking Neurons. (arXiv:1911.02609v1 [cs.NE])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1911.02609</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In this paper we present a numerical study of a mathematical model of spiking
neurons introduced by Ferrari et al. in an article entitled Phase transition
forinfinite systems of spiking neurons. In this model we have a countable
number of neurons linked together in a network, each of them having a membrane
potential taking value in the integers, and each of them spiking over time at a
rate which depends on the membrane potential through some rate function $\phi$.
Beside being affected by a spike each neuron can also be affected by leaking.
At each of these leak times, which occurs for a given neuron at a fixed rate
$\gamma$, the membrane potential of the neuron concerned is spontaneously reset
to $0$. A wide variety of versions of this model can be considered by choosing
different graph structures for the network and different activation functions.
It was rigorously shown that when the graph structure of the network is the
one-dimensional lattice with a hard threshold for the activation function, this
model presents a phase transition with respect to $\gamma$, and that it also
presents a metastable behavior. By the latter we mean that in the sub-critical
regime the re-normalized time of extinction converges to an exponential random
variable of mean 1. It has also been proven that in the super-critical regime
the renormalized time of extinction converges in probability to 1. Here, we
investigate numerically a richer class of graph structures and activation
functions. Namely we investigate the case of the two dimensional and the three
dimensional lattices, as well as the case of a linear function and a sigmoid
function for the activation function. We present numerical evidence that the
result of metastability in the sub-critical regime holds for these graphs and
activation functions as well as the convergence in probability to $1$ in the
super-critical regime.

Neurites (axons and dendrites) from the same neuron recognize and avoid self, but engage in synaptic interactions with other neurons. Vertebrate neural self-avoidance requires the expression of distinct repertoires of clustered Protocadherin (Pcdh) cell-surface protein isoforms, which act as cell-surface molecular barcodes that mediate highly specific homophilic self-recognition, followed by repulsion. The generation of sufficiently diverse cell-surface barcodes is achieved by the stochastic and combinatorial activation of a subset of clustered Pcdh promoters in individual neurons. This remarkable mechanism leads to the generation of enormous molecular diversity at the cell surface. Here we review recent studies showing that stochastic expression of individual Pcdhα isoforms is accomplished through an extraordinary mechanism involving the activation of ‘antisense strand’ promoter within Pcdhα ‘variable’ exons, antisense transcription of a long non-coding RNA through the upstream ‘sense strand’ promoter, demethylation of this promoter, binding of the CTCF/cohesin complex and DNA looping to a distant enhancer through a mechanism of chromatin ‘extrusion’.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Tonic exploration governs both flexibility and lapses</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/riovzsj8kfU/article</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by R. Becket Ebitz, Brianna J. Sleezer, Hank P. Jedema, Charles W. Bradberry, Benjamin Y. Hayden&lt;/p&gt;

In many cognitive tasks, lapses (spontaneous errors) are tacitly dismissed as the result of nuisance processes like sensorimotor noise, fatigue, or disengagement. However, some lapses could also be caused by exploratory noise: randomness in behavior that facilitates learning in changing environments. If so, then strategic processes would need only up-regulate (rather than generate) exploration to adapt to a changing environment. This view predicts that more frequent lapses should be associated with greater flexibility because these behaviors share a common cause. Here, we report that when rhesus macaques performed a set-shifting task, lapse rates were negatively correlated with perseverative error frequency across sessions, consistent with a common basis in exploration. The results could not be explained by local failures to learn. Furthermore, chronic exposure to cocaine, which is known to impair cognitive flexibility, did increase perseverative errors, but, surprisingly, also improved overall set-shifting task performance by reducing lapse rates. We reconcile these results with a state-switching model in which cocaine decreases exploration by deepening attractor basins corresponding to rule states. These results support the idea that exploratory noise contributes to lapses, affecting rule-based decision-making even when it has no strategic value, and suggest that one key mechanism for regulating exploration may be the depth of rule states.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/riovzsj8kfU&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>RSS PAP: Loss of Tiparp results in aberrant layering of the cerebral cortex</title>
	<link>http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0239-19.2019v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;TCDD-inducible poly-ADP-ribose polymerase (TIPARP) is an enzyme that adds a single ADP-ribose moiety to itself or other proteins. Tiparp is highly expressed in the brain; however, its function in this organ is unknown. Here we used &lt;i&gt;Tiparp&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt; mice to determine Tiparp’s role in the development of the prefrontal cortex. Loss of Tiparp resulted in an aberrant organization of the mouse cortex, where the upper layers presented increased cell density in the knockout mice compared with wildtype. Tiparp loss predominantly affected the correct distribution and number of GABAergic neurons. Furthermore, neural progenitor cell proliferation was significantly reduced. Neural stem cells derived from &lt;i&gt;Tiparp&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt; mice showed a slower rate of migration. Cytoskeletal components, such as α-tubulin are key regulators of neuronal differentiation and cortical development. α-tubulin mono-ADP-ribosylation levels were reduced in &lt;i&gt;Tiparp&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt; cells, suggesting the Tiparp plays a role in the mono-ADP-ribosylation of α-tubulin. Despite the mild phenotype presented by &lt;i&gt;Tiparp&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt; mice, our findings reveal an important function for Tiparp and mono-ADP-ribosylation in the correct development of the cortex. Unravelling Tiparp’s role in the cortex, could pave the way to a better understanding of a wide spectrum of neurological diseases which are known to have increased expression of the TIPARP gene.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; TCDD-inducible poly-ADP-ribose polymerase (TIPARP) is an enzyme which adds a single ADP-ribose moiety to itself or other proteins and is highly expressed in the brain. However, its function in this organ remains unknown. Here we show that Tiparp affects neural progenitor cell proliferation and migration, and its loss leads to aberrant organization of the mouse cortex, predominantly by disrupting the correct distribution and number of GABAergic neurons. Cytoskeletal components, such as α-tubulin, are key regulators of neuronal differentiation and cortical development, here we show that Tiparp is part of a complex that interacts with α-tubulin and plays a role in its mono-ADP-ribosylation. Despite the mild phenotype presented by the &lt;i&gt;Tiparp&lt;/i&gt; knockout mouse our findings reveal an important function of mono-ADP-ribosylation by this enzyme in the correct development of the cortex.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Short-Term Attractive Tilt Aftereffects Predicted by a Recurrent Network Model of Primary Visual Cortex</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2019.00067</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Adaptation is a multi-faceted phenomenon that is of interest in terms of both its function and its potential to reveal underlying neural processing. Many behavioral studies have shown that after exposure to an oriented adapter the perceived orientation of a subsequent test is repulsed away from the orientation of the adapter. This is the well-known Tilt Aftereffect (TAE). Recently, we showed that the dynamics of recurrently connected networks may contribute substantially to the neural changes induced by adaptation, especially on short time scales. Here we extended the network model and made the novel behavioral prediction that the TAE should be attractive, not repulsive, on a time scale of a few 100 ms. Our experiments, using a novel adaptation protocol that specifically targeted adaptation on a short time scale, confirmed this prediction. These results support our hypothesis that recurrent network dynamics may contribute to short-term adaptation. More broadly, they show that understanding the neural processing of visual inputs that change on the time scale of a typical fixation requires a detailed analysis of not only the intrinsic properties of neurons, but also the slow and complex dynamics that emerge from their recurrent connectivity. We argue that this is but one example of how even simple recurrent networks can underlie surprisingly complex information processing, and are involved in rudimentary forms of memory, spatio-temporal integration, and signal amplification.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Modeling the Ongoing Dynamics of Short and Long-Range Temporal Correlations in Broadband EEG During Movement</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2019.00066</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Electroencephalogram (EEG) undergoes complex temporal and spectral changes during voluntary movement intention. Characterization of such changes has focused mostly on narrowband spectral processes such as Event-Related Desynchronization (ERD) in the sensorimotor rhythms because EEG is mostly considered as emerging from oscillations of the neuronal populations. However, the changes in the temporal dynamics, especially in the broadband arrhythmic EEG have not been investigated for movement intention detection. The Long-Range Temporal Correlations (LRTC) are ubiquitously present in several neuronal processes, typically requiring longer timescales to detect. In this paper, we study the ongoing changes in the dynamics of long- as well as short-range temporal dependencies in the single trial broadband EEG during movement intention. We obtained LRTC in 2 s windows of broadband EEG and modeled it using the Autoregressive Fractionally Integrated Moving Average (ARFIMA) model which allowed simultaneous modeling of short- and long-range temporal correlations. There were significant (p &amp;lt; 0.05) changes in both broadband long- and short-range temporal correlations during movement intention and execution. We discovered that the broadband LRTC and narrowband ERD are complementary processes providing distinct information about movement because eliminating LRTC from the signal did not affect the ERD and conversely, eliminating ERD from the signal did not affect LRTC. Exploring the possibility of applications in Brain Computer Interfaces (BCI), we used hybrid features with combinations of LRTC, ARFIMA, and ERD to detect movement intention. A significantly higher (p &amp;lt; 0.05) classification accuracy of 88.3 ± 4.2% was obtained using the combination of ARFIMA and ERD features together, which also predicted the earliest movement at 1 s before its onset. The ongoing changes in the long- and short-range temporal correlations in broadband EEG contribute to effectively capturing the motor command generation and can be used to detect movement successfully. These temporal dependencies provide different and additional information about the movement.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Differential Properties of the Synaptogenic Activities of the Neurexin Ligands Neuroligin1 and LRRTM2</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2019.00269</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Synaptic cell adhesion molecules are well established to exhibit synaptogenic activity when overexpressed in target cells, indicating that they are involved in formation and functional maturation of synapses. The postsynaptic adhesion proteins Neuroligin1 and LRRTM2 both induce synaptic vesicle clusters in presynaptic axons in vitro by transsynaptically interacting with neurexins. In neurons, this is accompanied by the induction of glutamatergic, but not GABAergic synapses. Although the synaptogenic activity of Neuroligin1 has been well characterized, the properties of the synaptogenic activities of other synaptic adhesion molecules are largely unknown. In this paper, we now compared characteristics of the synaptogenic activities of Neuroligin1 and LRRTM2 upon overexpression in cultured mouse cortical neurons. Individual cortical neurons were transfected with Neuroligin1 and LRRTM2 expression plasmids, respectively, and synaptic vesicle clustering in contacting axons was examined by immunostaining for the vesicle membrane protein VAMP2. In immature neurons at 6–7 days in vitro (DIV) both Neuroligin1 and LRRTM2 exhibited strong synaptogenic activity. However, upon further neuronal differentiation only LRRTM2 retained significant synaptogenic activity at 12–13 DIV. A similar differential developmental maturation of the synaptogenic activities of Neuroligin1 and LRRTM2 was observed for the induction of glutamatergic synapses, which were detected by co-immunostaining for VGLUT1 and Homer1. Most interestingly, the synaptogenic activity of Neuroligin1 was strongly dependent on the expression and function of the synaptic adhesion molecule N-cadherin in immature neurons. In contrast, the synaptogenic activity of LRRTM2 was independent of N-cadherin expression and function in both immature (6–7 DIV) and more mature neurons (14–15 DIV). Taken together, our results with overexpression in cultured cortical neurons revealed striking differences in the properties of the synaptogenic activities of Neuroligin1 and LRRTM2, although both transsynaptically interact with presynaptic neurexins.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Different Amyloid-β Self-Assemblies Have Distinct Effects on Intracellular Tau Aggregation</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2019.00268</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s disease (AD) pathology is characterized by the aggregation of beta-amyloid (Aβ) and tau in the form of amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles in the brain. It has been found that a synergistic relationship between these two proteins may contribute to their roles in disease progression. However, how Aβ and tau interact has not been fully characterized. Here, we analyze how tau seeding or aggregation is influenced by different Aβ self-assemblies (fibrils and oligomers). Our cellular assays utilizing tau biosensor cells show that transduction of Aβ oligomers into the cells greatly enhances seeded tau aggregation in a concentration-dependent manner. In contrast, transduced Aβ fibrils slightly reduce tau seeding while untransduced Aβ fibrils promote it. We also observe that the transduction of α-synuclein fibrils, another amyloid protein, has no effect on tau seeding. The enhancement of tau seeding by Aβ oligomers was confirmed using tau fibril seeds derived from both recombinant tau and PS19 mouse brain extracts containing human tau. Our findings highlight the importance of considering the specific form and cellular location of Aβ self-assembly when studying the relationship between Aβ and tau in future AD therapeutic development.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: The Calmodulin Binding Region of the Synaptic Vesicle Protein Mover Is Required for Homomeric Interaction and Presynaptic Targeting</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2019.00249</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Neurotransmitter release is mediated by an evolutionarily conserved machinery. The synaptic vesicle (SV) associated protein Mover/TPRGL/SVAP30 does not occur in all species and all synapses. Little is known about its molecular properties and how it may interact with the conserved components of the presynaptic machinery. Here, we show by deletion analysis that regions required for homomeric interaction of Mover are distributed across the entire molecule, including N-terminal, central and C-terminal regions. The same regions are also required for the accumulation of Mover in presynaptic terminals of cultured neurons. Mutating two phosphorylation sites in N-terminal regions did not affect these properties. In contrast, a point mutation in the predicted Calmodulin (CaM) binding sequence of Mover abolished both homomeric interaction and presynaptic targeting. We show that this sequence indeed binds Calmodulin, and that recombinant Mover increases Calmodulin signaling upon heterologous expression. Our data suggest that presynaptic accumulation of Mover requires homomeric interaction mediated by regions distributed across large areas of the protein, and corroborate the hypothesis that Mover functionally interacts with Calmodulin signaling.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Brain Imaging Methods section | New and Recent Articles: Performance Evaluation of Visual Noise Imposed Stochastic Resonance Effect on Brain-Computer Interface Application: A Comparison Between Motion-Reversing Simple Ring and Complex Checkerboard Patterns</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.01192</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Adding noise to a weak input signal can enhance the response of a non-linear system, a phenomenon known as stochastic resonance (SR). SR has been demonstrated in a variety of diverse sensory systems including the visual system, where visual noise enhances human motion perception and detection performance. The SR effect has not been extensively studied in brain-computer interface (BCI) applications. This study compares the performance of BCIs based on SR-influenced steady-state motion visual evoked potentials. Stimulation paradigms were used between a periodically monochromatic motion-reversing simple ring and complex alternating checkerboard stimuli. To induce the SR effect, dynamic visual noise was masked on both the periodic simple and complex stimuli. Offline results showed that the recognition accuracy of different stimulation targets followed an inverted U-shaped function of noise level, which is a hallmark of SR. With the optimal visual noise level, the proposed visual noise masked checkerboard BCI paradigm achieved faster and more stable detection performance due to the noise-enhanced brain responses. This work demonstrates that the SR effect can be employed in BCI applications and can achieve considerable performance improvements.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Neurodegeneration section | New and Recent Articles: Spastin MIT Domain Disease-Associated Mutations Disrupt Lysosomal Function</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.01179</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The hereditary spastic paraplegias (HSPs) are genetic motor neuron diseases characterized by progressive degeneration of corticospinal tract axons. Mutations in SPAST, encoding the microtubule-severing ATPase spastin, are the most common causes of HSP. The broad SPAST mutational spectrum indicates a haploinsufficiency pathogenic mechanism in most cases. Most missense mutations cluster in the ATPase domain, where they disrupt the protein's ability to sever microtubules. However, several putative missense mutations in the protein's microtubule interacting and trafficking (MIT) domain have also been described, but the pathogenicity of these mutations has not been verified with functional studies. Spastin promotes endosomal tubule fission, and defects in this lead to lysosomal enzyme mistrafficking and downstream lysosomal abnormalities. We investigated the function of three disease-associated spastin MIT mutants and found that none was able to promote normal endosomal tubule fission, lysosomal enzyme receptor trafficking, or lysosomal morphology. One of the mutations affected recruitment of spastin to endosomes, a property that requires the canonical function of the MIT domain in binding endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT)-III proteins. However, the other mutants did not affect spastin's endosomal recruitment, raising the possibility of pathologically important non-canonical roles for the MIT domain. In conclusion, we demonstrate that spastin MIT mutants cause functional abnormalities related to the pathogenesis of HSP. These mutations do not directly affect spastin's microtubule-severing capacity, and so we identify a new molecular pathological mechanism by which spastin mutations may cause disease.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Neurodegeneration section | New and Recent Articles: Relationships Between Neurodegeneration and Vascular Damage in Diabetic Retinopathy</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.01172</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a common complication of diabetes and constitutes a major cause of vision impairment and blindness in the world. DR has long been described exclusively as a microvascular disease of the eye. However, in recent years, a growing interest has been focused on the contribution of neuroretinal degeneration to the pathogenesis of the disease, and there are observations suggesting that neuronal death in the early phases of DR may favor the development of microvascular abnormalities, followed by the full manifestation of the disease. However, the mediators that are involved in the crosslink between neurodegeneration and vascular changes have not yet been identified. According to our hypothesis, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) could probably be the most important connecting link between the death of retinal neurons and the occurrence of microvascular lesions. Indeed, VEGF is known to play important neuroprotective actions; therefore, in the early phases of DR, it may be released in response to neuronal suffering, and it would act as a double-edged weapon inducing both neuroprotective and vasoactive effects. If this hypothesis is correct, then any retinal stress causing neuronal damage should be accompanied by VEGF upregulation and by vascular changes. Similarly, any compound with neuroprotective properties should also induce VEGF downregulation and amelioration of the vascular lesions. In this review, we searched for a correlation between neurodegeneration and vasculopathy in animal models of retinal diseases, examining the effects of different neuroprotective substances, ranging from nutraceuticals to antioxidants to neuropeptides and others and showing that reducing neuronal suffering also prevents overexpression of VEGF and vascular complications. Taken together, the reviewed evidence highlights the crucial role played by mediators such as VEGF in the relationship between retinal neuronal damage and vascular alterations and suggests that the use of neuroprotective substances could be an efficient strategy to prevent the onset or to retard the development of DR.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Visuospatial Attention and Saccadic Inhibitory Control in Children With Cerebral Palsy</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2019.00392</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Cerebral palsy (CP) is a non-progressive syndrome due to a pre-, peri- or post-natal brain injury, which frequently involves an impairment of non-motor abilities. The aim of this article was to examine visuospatial attention and inhibitory control of prepotent motor responses in children with CP showing a normal IQ or mild cognitive impairment, measuring their performance in oculomotor tasks. Ten children (9–16-year-old) with spastic CP and 13 age-matched, typically developing children (TDC) participated in the study. Subjects performed a simple visually-guided saccade task and a cue-target task, in which they performed a saccade towards a peripheral target, after a non-informative visual cue was flashed 150 ms before the imperative target, either at the same (valid) or at a different (invalid) spatial position. Children with CP showed severe executive deficits in maintaining sustained attention and complying with task instructions. Furthermore, saccadic inhibitory control appeared to be significantly impaired in the presence of both stimulus-driven and goal-directed captures of attention. In fact, patients showed great difficulties in suppressing saccades not only to the cue stimuli but also to the always-present target placeholders, which represented powerful attentional attractors that had to be covertly attended throughout the task execution. Moreover, impairment did not affect in equal manner the whole visual field but showed a marked spatial selectivity in each individual subject. Saccade latencies in the cue-target task were faster in the valid than in the invalid condition in both child groups, indicating the preservation of low-level visuospatial attentive capabilities. Finally, this study provides evidence that these impairments of executive skills and in inhibitory control, following early brain injuries, manifest in childhood but recover to virtually normal level during adolescence.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Dual-Task Interference on Early and Late Stages of Facial Emotion Detection Is Revealed by Human Electrophysiology</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2019.00391</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Rapid and accurate processing of potential social threats is paramount to social thriving, and provides a clear evolutionary advantage. Though automatic processing of facial expressions has been assumed for some time, some researchers now question the extent to which this is the case. Here, we provide electrophysiological data from a psychological refractory period (PRP) dual-task paradigm in which participants had to decide whether a target face exhibited a neutral or fearful expression, as overlap with a concurrent auditory tone categorization task was experimentally manipulated. Specifically, we focused on four event-related potentials (ERP) linked to emotional face processing, covering distinct processing stages and topography: the early posterior negativity (EPN), early frontal positivity (EFP), late positive potential (LPP), and also the face-sensitive N170. As expected, there was an emotion modulation of each ERP. Most importantly, there was a significant attenuation of this emotional response proportional to the degree of task overlap for each component, except the N170. In fact, when the central overlap was greatest, this emotion-specific amplitude was statistically null for the EFP and LPP, and only marginally different from zero for the EPN. N170 emotion modulation was, on the other hand, unaffected by central overlap. Thus, our results show that emotion-specific ERPs for three out of four processing stages—i.e., perceptual encoding (EPN), emotion detection (EFP), or content evaluation (LPP)—are attenuated and even eliminated by central resource scarcity. Models assuming automatic processing should be revised to account for these results.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: The Dynamics of Attention Shifts Among Concurrent Speech in a Naturalistic Multi-speaker Virtual Environment</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2019.00386</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Focusing attention on one speaker on the background of other irrelevant speech can be a challenging feat. A longstanding question in attention research is whether and how frequently individuals shift their attention towards task-irrelevant speech, arguably leading to occasional detection of words in a so-called unattended message. However, this has been difficult to gauge empirically, particularly when participants attend to continuous natural speech, due to the lack of appropriate metrics for detecting shifts in internal attention. Here we introduce a new experimental platform for studying the dynamic deployment of attention among concurrent speakers, utilizing a unique combination of Virtual Reality (VR) and Eye-Tracking technology. We created a Virtual Café in which participants sit across from and attend to the narrative of a target speaker. We manipulated the number and location of distractor speakers by placing additional characters throughout the Virtual Café. By monitoring participant’s eye-gaze dynamics, we studied the patterns of overt attention-shifts among concurrent speakers as well as the consequences of these shifts on speech comprehension. Our results reveal important individual differences in the gaze-pattern displayed during selective attention to speech. While some participants stayed fixated on a target speaker throughout the entire experiment, approximately 30% of participants frequently shifted their gaze toward distractor speakers or other locations in the environment, regardless of the severity of audiovisual distraction. Critically, preforming frequent gaze-shifts negatively impacted the comprehension of target speech, and participants made more mistakes when looking away from the target speaker. We also found that gaze-shifts occurred primarily during gaps in the acoustic input, suggesting that momentary reductions in acoustic masking prompt attention-shifts between competing speakers, in line with “glimpsing” theories of processing speech in noise. These results open a new window into understanding the dynamics of attention as they wax and wane over time, and the different listening patterns employed for dealing with the influx of sensory input in multisensory environments. Moreover, the novel approach developed here for tracking the locus of momentary attention in a naturalistic virtual-reality environment holds high promise for extending the study of human behavior and cognition and bridging the gap between the laboratory and real-life.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Robustness of Radiomics for Survival Prediction of Brain Tumor Patients Depending on Resection Status</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2019.00073</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Prediction of overall survival based on multimodal MRI of brain tumor patients is a difficult problem. Although survival also depends on factors that cannot be assessed via preoperative MRI such as surgical outcome, encouraging results for MRI-based survival analysis have been published for different datasets. We assess if and how established radiomic approaches as well as novel methods can predict overall survival of brain tumor patients on the BraTS challenge dataset. This dataset consists of multimodal preoperative images of 211 glioblastoma patients from several institutions with reported resection status and known survival. In the official challenge setting, only patients with a reported gross total resection (GTR) are taken into account. We therefore evaluated previously published methods as well as different machine learning approaches on the BraTS dataset. For different types of resection status, these approaches are compared to a baseline, a linear regression on patient age only. This naive approach won the 3rd place out of 26 participants in the BraTS survival prediction challenge 2018. Previously published radiomic signatures show significant correlations and predictiveness to patient survival for patients with a reported subtotal resection. However, for patients with reported GTR, none of the evaluated approaches was able to outperform the age-only baseline in a cross-validation setting, explaining the poor performance of approaches based on radiomics in the BraTS challenge 2018.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Intraspinal Plasticity Associated With the Development of Autonomic Dysreflexia After Complete Spinal Cord Injury</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2019.00505</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI) leads to disruption of sensory, motor and autonomic function, and triggers structural, physiological and biochemical changes that cause reorganization of existing circuits that affect functional recovery. Propriospinal neurons (PN) appear to be very plastic within the inhibitory microenvironment of the injured spinal cord by forming compensatory circuits that aid in relaying information across the lesion site and, thus, are being investigated for their potential to promote locomotor recovery after experimental SCI. Yet the role of PN plasticity in autonomic dysfunction is not well characterized, notably, the disruption of supraspinal modulatory signals to spinal sympathetic neurons after SCI at the sixth thoracic spinal segment or above resulting in autonomic dysreflexia (AD). This condition is characterized by unmodulated sympathetic reflexes triggering sporadic hypertension associated with baroreflex mediated bradycardia in response to noxious yet unperceived stimuli below the injury to reduce blood pressure. AD is frequently triggered by pelvic visceral distension (bowel and bladder), and there are documented structural relationships between injury-induced sprouting of pelvic visceral afferent C-fibers. Their excitation of lumbosacral PN, in turn, sprout and relay noxious visceral sensory stimuli to rostral disinhibited thoracic sympathetic preganglionic neurons (SPN) that manifest hypertension. Herein, we review evidence for maladaptive plasticity of PN in neural circuits mediating heightened sympathetic reflexes after complete high thoracic SCI that manifest cardiovascular dysfunction, as well as contemporary research methodologies being employed to unveil the precise contribution of PN plasticity to the pathophysiology underlying AD development.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2019.00497</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Massive activation of γ-amino butyric acid A (GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;) receptors during pathophysiological activity induces an increase in the intracellular Cl&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;-concentration ([Cl&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;), which is sufficient to render GABAergic responses excitatory. However, to what extent physiological levels of GABAergic activity can influence [Cl&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; is not known. Aim of the present study is to reveal whether moderate activation of GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptors mediates functionally relevant [Cl&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; changes and whether these changes can be augmented by coincident glutamatergic activity. To address these questions, we used whole-cell patch-clamp recordings from cultured cortical neurons [at days in vitro (DIV) 6–22] to determine changes in the GABA reversal potential (E&lt;sub&gt;GABA&lt;/sub&gt;) induced by short bursts of GABAergic and/or synchronized glutamatergic stimulation. These experiments revealed that pressure-application of 10 short muscimol pulses at 10 Hz induced voltage-dependent [Cl&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; changes. Under current-clamp conditions this muscimol burst induced a [Cl&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; increase of 3.1 ± 0.4 mM (n = 27), which was significantly enhanced to 4.6 ± 0.5 mM (n = 27) when glutamate was applied synchronously with the muscimol pulses. The muscimol-induced [Cl&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; increase significantly attenuated the inhibitory effect of GABA, as determined by the GABAergic rheobase shift. The synchronous coapplication of glutamate pulses had no additional effect on the attenuation of GABAergic inhibition, despite the larger [Cl&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; transients under these conditions. In summary, these results indicate that moderate GABAergic activity can induce functionally relevant [Cl&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; transients, which were enhanced by coincident glutamate pulses. This ionic plasticity of [Cl&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; may contribute to short-term plasticity of the GABAergic system.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2019.00476</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by decreased dopamine bioavailability in the substantia nigra and the striatum. Taking into account that adenosine-5’-triphosphate (ATP) and its metabolites are intensely released in the 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) animal model of PD, screening of purinergic receptor gene expression was performed. Effects of pharmacological P2Y6 or P2X7 receptor antagonism were studied in preventing or reversing hemiparkinsonian behavior and dopaminergic deficits in this animal model. P2X7 receptor antagonism with Brilliant Blue G (BBG) at a dose of 75 mg/kg re-established the dopaminergic nigrostriatal pathway in rats injured with 6-OHDA. Selective P2Y6 receptor antagonism by MRS2578 prevented dopaminergic neuron death in SH-SY5Y cells in vitro and in vivo in the substantia nigra of rats injured with 6-OHDA. Moreover, in vivo analysis showed that both treatments were accompanied by a reduction of microglial activation in the substantia nigra. Altogether, these data provide evidence that antagonism of P2X7 or P2Y6 receptors results in neuroregenerative or neuroprotective effects, respectively, possibly through modulation of neuroinflammatory responses.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2019.00305</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Background: A potential evidence from previous epidemiological studies remains conflicting findings regarding the association between atrial fibrillation (AF) and dementia risk. We, therefore, carried out a meta-analysis of relevant studies to investigate the magnitude of the association between AF and dementia risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: We performed a systematic literature search of PubMed, EMBASE, and Google Scholar for potential studies between January 1, 1990, and December 31, 2018, with no restriction on the publication language. All potential studies were independently assessed by two reviewers. We only included observational studies that calculated the odds ratio (OR)/hazards ratio (HR) for dementia associated with atrial fibrillation. We first assessed the heterogeneity among study-specific HRs using the Q statistic and I&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; statistic. We then used the random-effects model to obtain the overall HR and its 95% CI for all studies. We also tested and corrected for publication bias by funnel plot–based methods. The quality of each study was assessed with the Newcastle Ottawa Scale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: A total of 16 studies with 2,415,356 individuals, and approximately 200,653 cases of incidence dementia were included in this study. Patients with AF had a greater risk of incidence dementia than those without AF (random-effect hazard ratio HR: 1.36, 95% CI: 1.23–1.51, p &amp;lt; 0.0001; I&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 83.58). Funnel plot and Egger test did not reveal significant publication bias. However, limitations of the study included high heterogeneity and varying degrees of confounder adjustment across individual studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: This study serves as added evidence supporting the hypothesis that AF is associated with an increased risk of dementia. More studies are needed to establish whether optimal treatment of AF can reduce or mitigate the risk of dementia.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a common feature in Parkinson’s Disease (PD), even at the time of diagnosis. Some levels of heterogeneity in nature and severity of cognitive impairment and risk of conversion to Parkinson’s Disease Dementia (PDD) exist. This brief overview summarized the current understanding of MCI in PD, by considering the following major points: historical development of the clinical entity, evaluation, epidemiology, predictors and outcomes, neuroimaging findings, pathophysiology, treatment, and pharmacological and non-pharmacological intervention. MCI in PD represents a concept in evolution and plays a pivotal role in advancing our understanding of the disease mechanisms, with the ultimate goal of building effective strategies to prevent conversion into PDD. Challenges for future research are also discussed.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Diabetes, a Contemporary Risk for Parkinson’s Disease: Epidemiological and Cellular Evidences</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2019.00302</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Diabetes mellitus (DM), a group of diseases characterized by defective glucose metabolism, is the most widespread metabolic disorder affecting over 400 million adults worldwide. This pathological condition has been implicated in the pathogenesis of a number of central encephalopathies and peripheral neuropathies. In further support of this notion, recent epidemiological evidence suggests a link between DM and Parkinson’s disease (PD), with hyperglycemia emerging as one of the culprits in neurodegeneration involving the nigrostriatal pathway, the neuroanatomical substrate of the motor symptoms affecting parkinsonian patients. Indeed, dopaminergic neurons located in the mesencephalic substantia nigra appear to be particularly vulnerable to oxidative stress and degeneration, likely because of their intrinsic susceptibility to mitochondrial dysfunction, which may represent a direct consequence of hyperglycemia and hyperglycemia-induced oxidative stress. Other pathological pathways induced by increased intracellular glucose levels, including the polyol and the hexosamine pathway as well as the formation of advanced glycation end-products, may all play a pivotal role in mediating the detrimental effects of hyperglycemia on nigral dopaminergic neurons. In this review article, we will examine the epidemiological as well as the molecular and cellular clues supporting the potential susceptibility of nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons to hyperglycemia.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Aging Impairs Cerebrovascular Reactivity at Preserved Resting Cerebral Arteriolar Tone and Vascular Density in the Laboratory Rat</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2019.00301</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The age-related (mal)adaptive modifications of the cerebral microvascular system have been implicated in cognitive impairment and worse outcomes after ischemic stroke. The magnitude of the hyperemic response to spreading depolarization (SD), a recognized principle of ischemic lesion development has also been found to be reduced by aging. Here, we set out to investigate whether the SD-coupled reactivity of the pial arterioles is subject to aging, and whether concomitant vascular rarefaction may contribute to the age-related insufficiency of the cerebral blood flow (CBF) response. CBF was assessed with laser-speckle contrast analysis (LASCA), and the tone adjustment of pial arterioles was followed with intrinsic optical signal (IOS) imaging at green light illumination through a closed cranial window created over the parietal cortex of isoflurane-anesthetized young (2 months old) and old (18 months old) male Sprague–Dawley rats. Global forebrain ischemia and later reperfusion were induced by the bilateral occlusion and later release of both common carotid arteries. SDs were elicited repeatedly with topical 1M KCl. Pial vascular density was measured in green IOS images of the brain surface, while the density and resting diameter of the cortical penetrating vasculature was estimated with micro-computed tomography of paraformaldehyde-fixed cortical samples. Whilst pial arteriolar dilation in response to SD or ischemia induction were found reduced in the old rat brain, the density and resting diameter of pial cortical vessels, and the degree of SD-related oligemia emerged as variables unaffected by age in our experiments. Spatial flow distribution analysis identified an age-related shift to a greater representation of higher flow ranges in the reperfused cortex. According to our data, impairment of functional arteriolar dilation, at preserved vascular density and resting vascular tone, may be implicated in the age-related deficit of the CBF response to SD, and possibly in the reduced efficacy of neurovascular coupling in the aging brain. SD has been recognized as a potent pathophysiological contributor to ischemic lesion expansion, in part because of the insufficiency of the associated CBF response. Therefore, the age-related impairment of cerebral vasoreactivity as shown here is suggested to contribute to the age-related acceleration of ischemic lesion development.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: &quot;Females Are Not Just 'Protected Males&quot;: Sex-Specific Vulnerabilities in Placenta and Brain after Prenatal Immune Disruption</title>
	<link>http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/6/6/ENEURO.0358-19.2019?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Current perceptions of genetic and environmental vulnerabilities in the developing fetus are biased toward male outcomes. An argument is made that males are more vulnerable to gestational complications and neurodevelopmental disorders, the implication being that an understanding of disrupted development in males is sufficient to understand causal mechanisms that are assumed to be similar but attenuated in females. Here we examine this assumption in the context of immune-driven alterations in fetal brain development and related outcomes in female and male mice. Pregnant C57BL/6 mice were treated with low-dose lipopolysaccharide at embryonic day 12.5. Placental pathology, acute fetal brain inflammation and hypoxia, long-term changes in adult cortex cytoarchitecture, altered densities and ratio of excitatory (Satb2&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) to inhibitory (parvalbumin&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) neuronal subtypes, postnatal growth, and behavior outcomes were compared between male and female offspring. We find that while males experience more pronounced placental pathology, fetal brain hypoxia, depleted PV and Satb2&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; densities, and social and learning-related behavioral abnormalities, females exhibit unique acute inflammatory signaling in fetal brain, postnatal growth delay, opposite alterations in cortical PV densities, changes in juvenile behavior, delayed postnatal body growth, and elevated anxiety-related behavior as adults. While males are more severely impacted by prenatal immune disruption by several measures, females exposed to the same insult exhibit a unique set of vulnerabilities and developmental consequences that is not present in males. Our results clearly outline disparate sex-specific features of prenatal vulnerability to inflammatory insults and warn against the casual extrapolation of male disease mechanisms to females.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;The ability to delay the execution of a goal until the appropriate time, prospective memory (PM), can be supported by the following two different cognitive control strategies: proactive control involving working memory maintenance of the goal and active monitoring of the environment; or reactive control relying on timely retrieval of goal information from episodic memory. Certain situations tend to favor each strategy, but the manner in which individuals adjust their strategy in response to changes in the environment is unknown. Across two experiments, human participants performed a delayed-recognition PM task embedded in an ongoing visual search task that fluctuated in difficulty. A control strategy was identified from moment to moment using reaction time costs and fMRI measures of goal maintenance. We found that people fluidly modified control strategies in accordance with changes in task demands (e.g., shifting toward proactive control when task difficulty decreased). This cognitive flexibility proved adaptive as it was associated with improved PM performance.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Optogenetically-Induced Population Discharge Threshold as a Sensitive Measure of Network Excitability</title>
	<link>http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/6/6/ENEURO.0229-18.2019?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Network excitability is governed by synaptic efficacy, intrinsic excitability, and the circuitry in which these factors are expressed. The complex interplay between these factors determines how circuits function and, at the extreme, their susceptibility to seizure. We have developed a sensitive, quantitative estimate of network excitability in freely behaving mice using a novel optogenetic intensity-response procedure. Synchronous activation of deep sublayer CA1 pyramidal cells produces abnormal network-wide epileptiform population discharges (PDs) that are nearly indistinguishable from spontaneously-occurring interictal spikes (IISs). By systematically varying light intensity, and therefore the magnitude of the optogenetically-mediated current, we generated intensity-response curves using the probability of PD as the dependent variable. Manipulations known to increase excitability, such as sub-convulsive doses (20 mg/kg) of the chemoconvulsant pentylenetetrazol (PTZ), produced a leftward shift in the curve compared to baseline. The anti-epileptic drug levetiracetam (LEV; 40 mk/kg), in combination with PTZ, produced a rightward shift. Optogenetically-induced PD threshold (oPDT) baselines were stable over time, suggesting the metric is appropriate for within-subject experimental designs with multiple pharmacological manipulations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Excitation of Diverse Classes of Cholecystokinin Interneurons in the Basal Amygdala Facilitates Fear Extinction</title>
	<link>http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/6/6/ENEURO.0220-19.2019?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;There is growing evidence that interneurons (INs) orchestrate neural activity and plasticity in corticoamygdala circuits to regulate fear behaviors. However, defining the precise role of cholecystokinin-expressing INs (CCK INs) remains elusive due to the technical challenge of parsing this population from CCK-expressing principal neurons (CCK PNs). Here, we used an intersectional genetic strategy in CCK-Cre;Dlx5/6-Flpe double-transgenic mice to study the anatomical, molecular and electrophysiological properties of CCK INs in the basal amygdala (BA) and optogenetically manipulate these cells during fear extinction. Electrophysiological recordings confirmed that this strategy targeted GABAergic cells and that a significant proportion expressed functional cannabinoid CB1 receptors; a defining characteristic of CCK-expressing basket cells. However, immunostaining showed that subsets of the genetically-targeted cells expressed either neuropeptide Y (NPY; 29%) or parvalbumin (PV; 17%), but not somatostatin (SOM) or Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII)-α. Further morphological and electrophysiological analyses showed that four IN types could be identified among the EYFP-expressing cells: CCK/cannabinoid receptor type 1 (CB1R)-expressing basket cells, neurogliaform cells, PV+ basket cells, and PV+ axo-axonic cells. At the behavioral level, &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; optogenetic photostimulation of the targeted population during extinction acquisition led to reduced freezing on a light-free extinction retrieval test, indicating extinction memory facilitation; whereas photosilencing was without effect. Conversely, non-selective (i.e., inclusive of INs and PNs) photostimulation or photosilencing of CCK-targeted cells, using CCK-Cre single-transgenic mice, impaired extinction. These data reveal an unexpectedly high degree of phenotypic complexity in a unique population of extinction-modulating BA INs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>RSS PAP: Reward devaluation attenuates cue-evoked sucrose seeking and is associated with the elimination of excitability differences between ensemble and non-ensemble neurons in the nucleus accumbens</title>
	<link>http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0338-19.2019v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Animals must learn relationships between foods and the environmental cues that predict their availability for survival. Such cue-food associations are encoded in sparse sets of neurons or ‘neuronal ensembles’ in the nucleus accumbens (NAc). For these ensemble-encoded, cue-controlled appetitive responses to remain adaptive, they must allow for their dynamic updating depending on acute changes in internal states such as physiological hunger or the perceived desirability of food. However, how these neuronal ensembles are recruited and physiologically modified following the update of such learned associations is unclear. To investigate this, we examined the effects of devaluation on ensemble plasticity at the levels of recruitment, intrinsic excitability, and synaptic physiology in sucrose conditioned &lt;i&gt;Fos-GFP&lt;/i&gt; mice that express green fluorescent protein (GFP) in recently activated neurons. Neuronal ensemble activation patterns and their physiology were examined using immunohistochemistry and slice electrophysiology, respectively. Reward-specific devaluation following four days of &lt;i&gt;ad lib&lt;/i&gt; sucrose consumption, but not general caloric devaluation, attenuated cue-evoked sucrose seeking. This suggests that changes in the hedonic and/or incentive value of sucrose, and not caloric need drove this behavior. Moreover, devaluation attenuated the size of the neuronal ensemble recruited by the cue in the NAc shell. Finally, it eliminated the relative enhanced excitability of ensemble (GFP+) neurons against non-ensemble (GFP–) neurons observed under Non-devalued conditions, and did not induce any ensemble-specific changes in excitatory synaptic physiology. Our findings provide new insights into neuronal ensemble mechanisms that underlie the changes in the incentive and/or hedonic impact of cues that support adaptive food seeking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance statement&lt;/b&gt; Learned associations between food and the cues that predict their availability are encoded in neuronal ensembles in reward-relevant brain areas, such as the nucleus accumbens. Such learning is often accompanied by synaptic and intrinsic plasticity within these ensemble neurons. However, it is unclear how these plasticity changes manifest specifically in cue-activated neurons in response to decreases in reward value, e.g. following reward-specific or general (caloric) devaluation. We reveal that shifts in excitability, but not excitatory synaptic physiology between ensemble and non-ensemble neurons in the nucleus accumbens shell coincide with reward-specific devaluation. Our findings provide new insights into how changes in the perceived properties of food reward update cue-food associations by potentially fine-tuning neuronal excitability.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>RSS PAP: Noninvasive brain stimulation enhances memory acquisition and is associated with synaptoneurosome modification in the rat hippocampus</title>
	<link>http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0311-19.2019v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>ABSTRACT&lt;p&gt;Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a non-invasive brain stimulation approach previously shown to enhance memory acquisition, but more studies are needed to elucidate the underlying mechanisms. Here, we examined the effects of anodal tDCS (0.25 mA for 30 minutes) on the memory performance of male Sprague Dawley rats in the passive avoidance test (PAT) and the associated modifications to the hippocampal proteomes. Results indicate anodal tDCS applied before the acquisition period significantly enhanced memory performance in the PAT. Following passive avoidance testing, synaptoneurosomes were biochemically purified from the hippocampi of tDCS- or sham-treated rats and individual protein abundances were determined by bottom-up liquid chromatography mass spectrometry analysis. Proteomic analysis identified 184 differentially expressed hippocampal proteins when comparing the sham to the tDCS before memory acquisition treatment group. Ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA) showed anodal tDCS before memory acquisition significantly enhanced pathways associated with memory, cognition, learning, transmission, neuritogenesis, and long-term potentiation. IPA identified significant upstream regulators including &lt;i&gt;bdnf&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;shank3&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;gsk3b&lt;/i&gt;. Protein-protein interaction and protein sequence similarity networks show that glutamate receptor pathways, ion channel activity, memory, learning, cognition and long-term memory were significantly associated with anodal tDCS. Centrality measures from both networks identified key proteins including &lt;i&gt;dlg&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;shank&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;grin&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;gria&lt;/i&gt; that were significantly modified by tDCS applied before the acquisition period. Together, our results provide descriptive molecular evidence that anodal tDCS enhances memory performance in the passive avoidance test by modifying hippocampal synaptic plasticity related proteins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; We investigated whether anodal tDCS affects memory performance and the underlying protein modifications in hippocampal synaptoneurosomes. We found that anodal tDCS administered before memory acquisition significantly enhanced memory performance by enhancing the expression of hippocampal proteins associated with glutamate signaling and ion channel activity. Our results identify molecular targets for tDCS-induced memory enhancement and the associated signaling pathways. Our behavioral and proteomics study further elucidates the mechanism for tDCS effects on acquisition memory and may lead to the development of therapeutics to enhance memory and learning process for neurological diseases and psychological disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2019.00267</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Neuronal inhibition can be defined as a spatiotemporal restriction or suppression of local microcircuit activity. The importance of inhibition relies in its fundamental role in shaping signal processing in single neurons and neuronal circuits. In this context, the activity of inhibitory interneurons proved the key to endow networks with complex computational and dynamic properties. In the last 50 years, the prevailing view on the functional role of cerebellar cortical inhibitory circuits was that excitatory and inhibitory inputs sum spatially and temporally in order to determine the motor output through Purkinje cells (PCs). Consequently, cerebellar inhibition has traditionally been conceived in terms of restricting or blocking excitation. This assumption has been challenged, in particular in the cerebellar cortex where all neurons except granule cells (and unipolar brush cells in specific lobules) are inhibitory and fire spontaneously at high rates. Recently, a combination of electrophysiological recordings in vitro and in vivo, imaging, optogenetics and computational modeling, has revealed that inhibitory interneurons play a much more complex role in regulating cerebellar microcircuit functions: inhibition shapes neuronal response dynamics in the whole circuit and eventually regulate the PC output. This review elaborates current knowledge on cerebellar inhibitory interneurons [Golgi cells, Lugaro cells (LCs), basket cells (BCs) and stellate cells (SCs)], starting from their ontogenesis and moving up to their morphological, physiological and plastic properties, and integrates this knowledge with that on the more renown granule cells and PCs. We will focus on the circuit loops in which these interneurons are involved and on the way they generate feed-forward, feedback and lateral inhibition along with complex spatio-temporal response dynamics. In this perspective, inhibitory interneurons emerge as the real controllers of cerebellar functioning.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2019.00263</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Spinal dorsal interneurons, which are generated during embryonic development, relay and process sensory inputs from the periphery to the central nervous system. Proper integration of these cells into neuronal circuitry depends on their correct positioning within the spinal parenchyma. Molecular cues that control neuronal migration have been extensively characterized but the genetic programs that regulate their production remain poorly investigated. Onecut (OC) transcription factors have been shown to control the migration of the dorsal interneurons (dINs) during spinal cord development. Here, we report that the OC factors moderate the expression of Pou2f2, a transcription factor essential for B-cell differentiation, in spinal dINs. Overexpression or inactivation of Pou2f2 leads to alterations in the differentiation of dI2, dI3 and Phox2a-positive dI5 populations and to defects in the distribution of dI2-dI6 interneurons. Thus, an OC-Pou2f2 genetic cascade regulates adequate diversification and distribution of dINs during embryonic development.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2019.00261</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by a deep deficit in language and social interaction, accompanied by restricted, stereotyped and repetitive behaviors. The use of genetic autism animal models has revealed that the alteration of the mechanisms controlling the formation and maturation of neural circuits are points of convergence for the physiopathological pathways in several types of autism. Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF), a key multifunctional regulator of brain development, has been related to autism in several ways. However, its precise role is still elusive, in part, due to its extremely complex posttranscriptional regulation. In order to contribute to this topic, we treated prenatal rats with Valproate, a well-validated model of autism, to analyze BDNF levels in the hippocampus of juvenile rats. Valproate-treated rats exhibited an autism-like behavioral profile, characterized by a deficit in social interaction, anxiety-like behavior and repetitive behavior. In situ hybridization (ISH) experiments revealed that Valproate reduced BDNF mRNA, especially long-3′UTR-containing transcripts, in specific areas of the dentate gyrus (DG) and CA3 regions. At the same time, Valproate reduced BDNF immunoreactivity in the suprapyramidal and lucidum layers of CA3, but improved hippocampus-dependent spatial learning. The molecular changes reported here may help to explain the cognitive and behavioral signs of autism and reinforce BDNF as a potential molecular target for this neurodevelopmental disorder.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.01203</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been proposed as a source of information for automatic prediction of individual diagnosis in schizophrenia. Optimal integration of data from different MRI modalities is an active area of research aimed at increasing diagnostic accuracy. Based on a sample of 96 patients with schizophrenia and a matched sample of 115 healthy controls that had undergone a single multimodal MRI session, we generated individual brain maps of gray matter vbm, 1back, and 2back levels of activation (nback fMRI), maps of amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (resting-state fMRI), and maps of weighted global brain connectivity (resting-state fMRI). Four unimodal classifiers (Ridge, Lasso, Random Forests, and Gradient boosting) were applied to these maps to evaluate their classification accuracies. Based on the assignments made by the algorithms on test individuals, we quantified the amount of predictive information shared between maps (what we call redundancy analysis). Finally, we explored the added accuracy provided by a set of multimodal strategies that included post-classification integration based on probabilities, two-step sequential integration, and voxel-level multimodal integration through one-dimensional-convolutional neural networks (1D-CNNs). All four unimodal classifiers showed the highest test accuracies with the 2back maps (80% on average) achieving a maximum of 84% with the Lasso. Redundancy levels between brain maps were generally low (overall mean redundancy score of 0.14 in a 0–1 range), indicating that each brain map contained differential predictive information. The highest multimodal accuracy was delivered by the two-step Ridge classifier (87%) followed by the Ridge maximum and mean probability classifiers (both with 85% accuracy) and by the 1D-CNN, which achieved the same accuracy as the best unimodal classifier (84%). From these results, we conclude that from all MRI modalities evaluated task-based fMRI may be the best unimodal diagnostic option in schizophrenia. Low redundancy values point to ample potential for accuracy improvements through multimodal integration, with the two-step Ridge emerging as a suitable strategy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.01199</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Microglial cells, the resident macrophages of the brain, are important players in the pathological process of numerous neurodegenerative disorders, including tauopathies, a heterogeneous class of diseases characterized by intraneuronal Tau aggregates. However, microglia response in Tau pathologies remains poorly understood. Here, we exploit a genetic zebrafish model of tauopathy, combined with live microglia imaging, to investigate the behavior of microglia in vivo in the disease context. Results show that while microglia were almost immobile and displayed long and highly dynamic branches in a wild-type context, in presence of diseased neurons, cells became highly mobile and displayed morphological changes, with highly mobile cell bodies together with fewer and shorter processes. We also imaged, for the first time to our knowledge, the phagocytosis of apoptotic tauopathic neurons by microglia in vivo and observed that microglia engulfed about as twice materials as in controls. Finally, genetic ablation of microglia in zebrafish tauopathy model significantly increased Tau hyperphosphorylation, suggesting that microglia provide neuroprotection to diseased neurons. Our findings demonstrate for the first time the dynamics of microglia in contact with tauopathic neurons in vivo and open perspectives for the real-time study of microglia in many neuronal diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Neural Technology section | New and Recent Articles: A Custom Microcontrolled and Wireless-Operated Chamber for Auditory Fear Conditioning</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.01193</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Animal behavioral paradigms, such as classical conditioning and operant conditioning, are an important tool to study the neural basis of cognition and behavior. These paradigms involve manipulating sensory stimuli in a way that learning processes are induced under controlled experimental conditions. However, the majority of the commercially available equipment did not offer flexibility to manipulate stimuli. Therefore, the development of most versatile devices would allow the study of more complex cognitive functions. The purpose of this work is to present a low-cost, customized and wireless-operated chamber for animal behavior conditioning, based on the joint operation of two microcontroller modules: Arduino Due and ESP8266-12E. Our results showed that the auditory stimulation system allows setting the carrier frequency in the range of 1 Hz up to more than 100 kHz and the sound stimulus can be modulated in amplitude, also over a wide range of frequencies. Likewise, foot-shock could be precisely manipulated regarding its amplitude (from ∼200 μA to ∼1500 μA) and frequency (up to 20 pulses per second). Finally, adult rats exposed to a protocol of cued fear conditioning in our device showed consistent behavioral response and electrophysiological evoked responses in the midbrain auditory pathway. Furthermore, the device developed in the current study represents an open source alternative to develop customized protocols to study fear memory under conditions of varied sensory stimuli.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Neurodegeneration section | New and Recent Articles: Opposite Effects of Neuroprotective Cannabinoids, Palmitoylethanolamide, and 2-Arachidonoylglycerol on Function and Morphology of Microglia</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.01180</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Various studies performed in cultured cells and in in vivo models of neuronal damage showed that cannabinoids exert a neuroprotective effect. The increase in cannabinoids and cannabinoid like substances after stroke has been postulated to limit the content of neuronal injury. As well-accepted, inflammation, and neuronal damage are coupled processes and microglial cells as the main intrinsic immunological effector within the brain play a central role in their regulation. Treatment with the endocannabinoid, 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) or the endocannabinoid-like substance, palmitoylethanolamide (PEA) affected microglial cells and led to a decrease in the number of damaged neurons after excitotoxical lesion in organotypic hippocampal slice cultures (OHSC). 2-AG activated abnormal cannabidiol (abn-CBD) receptor, PEA was shown to mediate neuroprotection via peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)α. Despite the known neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory properties, the potential synergistic effect, namely possible entourage effect after treatment with the combination of these two protective cannabinoids has not been examined yet. After excitotoxical lesion OHSC were treated with PEA, 2-AG or a combination of both and the number of damaged neurons was evaluated. To investigate the role of microglial cells in PEA and 2-AG mediated protection, primary microglial cell cultures were treated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and 2-AG, PEA or a combination of those. Thereafter, we measured NO production, ramification index, proliferation and PPARα distribution in microglial cells. While PEA or 2-AG alone were neuroprotective, their co-application vanished the protective effect. This behavior was independent of microglial cells. Furthermore, PEA and 2-AG had contrary effects on ramification index and on NO production. No significant changes were observed in the proliferation rate of microglial cells after treatment. The expression of PPARα was not changed upon stimulation with PEA or 2-AG, but the distribution was significantly altered. 2-AG and PEA mediated neuroprotection was abolished when co-applied. Both cannabinoids exert contrary effects on morphology and function of microglial cells. Co-application of both cannabinoids with different targets did not lead to a positive additive effect as expected, presumably due to the contrary polarization of microglial cells.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Neurodegeneration section | New and Recent Articles: Bioscaffold-Induced Brain Tissue Regeneration</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.01156</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Brain tissue lost after a stroke is not regenerated, although a repair response associated with neurogenesis does occur. A failure to regenerate functional brain tissue is not caused by the lack of available neural cells, but rather the absence of structural support to permit a repopulation of the lesion cavity. Inductive bioscaffolds can provide this support and promote the invasion of host cells into the tissue void. The putative mechanisms of bioscaffold degradation and its pivotal role to permit invasion of neural cells are reviewed and discussed in comparison to peripheral wound healing. Key differences between regenerating and non-regenerating tissues are contrasted in an evolutionary context, with a special focus on the neurogenic response as a conditio sine qua non for brain regeneration. The pivotal role of the immune system in biodegradation and the formation of a neovasculature are contextualized with regeneration of peripheral soft tissues. The application of rehabilitation to integrate newly forming brain tissue is suggested as necessary to develop functional tissue that can alleviate behavioral impairments. Pertinent aspects of brain tissue development are considered to provide guidance to produce a metabolically and functionally integrated de novo tissue. Although little is currently known about mechanisms involved in brain tissue regeneration, this review outlines the various components and their interplay to provide a framework for ongoing and future studies. It is envisaged that a better understanding of the mechanisms involved in brain tissue regeneration will improve the design of biomaterials and the methods used for implantation, as well as rehabilitation strategies that support the restoration of behavioral functions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Neurodegeneration section | New and Recent Articles: The Beta Amyloid Dysfunction (BAD) Hypothesis for Alzheimer’s Disease</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.01154</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Beta amyloid, Aβ 1–42, originally named as Amyloid A4 protein, is one of the most investigated peptides in neuroscience and has attracted substantial interest since its discovery as the main insoluble fibril-type protein in cerebrovascular amyloid angiopathy (Glenner and Wong, 1984; Masters et al., 1985) of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). From the very beginning, Aβ was regarded per se as a “bad molecule,” triggering the so-called “beta amyloid cascade hypothesis” (Hardy and Higgins, 1992). This hypothesis ignored any physiological function for in situ generated Aβ monomer with normal production and turnover rate (Bateman et al., 2006). Accordingly, pan-Aβ-related therapeutic approaches were designed to eliminate or lower the three structural isoforms in parallel: (1) the pre-amyloid monomer, (2) the misfolded oligomer, and (3) the final fibril. While we already knew about poor correlations between plaques and cognitive decline quite early (Terry et al., 1991), data for an essential benign physiological role for Aβ monomer at low concentrations were also not considered to be relevant. Here, a different Beta Amyloid hypothesis is described, the so-called “Beta Amyloid Dysfunction hypothesis,” which, in contrast to the “Beta Amyloid Cascade hypothesis,” builds on the homeostasis of essential Aβ monomer in the synaptic vesicle cycle (SVC). Disease-relevant early pathology emerges through disturbance of the Aβ homeostasis by so far unknown factors leading to the formation of misfolded Aβ oligomers. These early species interfere with the synaptic physiological Aβ monomer regulation and exert their neurotoxicity via various receptors for sticky oligomer-type Aβ aggregates. The Beta Amyloid Dysfunction (BAD) hypothesis is introduced and shown to explain negative clinical results of Gamma-secretase and Beta-secretase (BACE) inhibitors as well as pan-Aβ isotype unselective immunotherapies. This hypothesis gives guidance to what needs to be done therapeutically to revive successful clinical testing in AD for this highly validated target. The BAD hypothesis will need further refinement in particular through more detailed exploration for the role of physiological Aβ monomer.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Do Walking Muscle Synergies Influence Propensity of Severe Slipping?</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2019.00383</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Slipping is frequently responsible for falling injuries. Preventing slips, and more importantly severe slips, is of importance in fall prevention. Our previous study characterized mild slipping and severe slipping by the analysis of muscle synergies. Significant discrepancies in motor control of slipping have been observed between mild and severe slippers. We are further interested in whether differences exist in baseline motor control patterns between persons who experience mild and severe slips when exposed to a slippery contaminant. This study investigated walking with a muscle synergy approach to detect if walking muscle synergies differ between groups experiencing different slip severities. Twenty healthy young adults (eight mild slippers and 12 severe slippers) participated in this study and their muscle synergies of walking were extracted. Muscle synergy analysis showed that mild slippers had a higher contribution of hamstring and quadriceps during walking while severe slippers had increased contribution of the tibialis group. This study provides novel information that may contribute to identifying diagnostic techniques for identifying persons or populations with a high risk of fall based on their walking patterns.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Neural Network Model for Detection of Edges Defined by Image Dynamics</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2019.00076</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Insects can detect the presence of discrete objects in their visual fields based on a range of differences in spatiotemporal characteristics between the images of object and background. This includes but is not limited to relative motion. Evidence suggests that edge detection is an integral part of this capability, and this study examines the ability of a bio-inspired processing model to detect the presence of boundaries between two regions of a one-dimensional visual field, based on general differences in image dynamics. The model consists of two parts. The first is an early vision module inspired by insect visual processing, which implements adaptive photoreception, ON and OFF channels with transient and sustained characteristics, and delayed and undelayed signal paths. This is replicated for a number of photoreceptors in a small linear array. It is followed by an artificial neural network trained to discriminate the presence vs. absence of an edge based on the array output signals. Input data are derived from natural imagery and feature both static and moving edges between regions with moving texture, flickering texture, and static patterns in all possible combinations. The model can discriminate the presence of edges, stationary or moving, at rates far higher than chance. The resources required (numbers of neurons and visual signals) are realistic relative to those available in the insect second optic ganglion, where the bulk of such processing would be likely to take place.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Mitoautophagy: A Unique Self-Destructive Path Mitochondria of Upper Motor Neurons With TDP-43 Pathology Take, Very Early in ALS</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2019.00489</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Mitochondrial dysfunction is one of the converging paths for many neurodegenerative diseases, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and TDP-43 pathology is the most common proteinopathy detected in ALS and ALS/Frontotemporal lobar degeneration (ALS/FTLD). We recently identified mitochondrial problems in corticospinal motor neurons (CSMN) and in Betz cells of patients with TDP-43 pathology. However, the timing and the extent of mitochondrial defects, and their mode of degeneration have not been revealed. Because it is important to reveal when problems first begin to emerge and whether they are shared or unique, we investigated the health and integrity of mitochondria in CSMN of prpTDP-43&lt;sup&gt;A315T&lt;/sup&gt;, PFN1&lt;sup&gt;G118V&lt;/sup&gt;, and hSOD1&lt;sup&gt;G93A&lt;/sup&gt; mice at P15 (post-natal day 15)—a very early age in mice without any sign of cellular degeneration.Utilization of immuno-coupled electron microscopy for a detailed surveillance of mitochondria in CSMN and other non-CSMN cells revealed presence of a novel self-destructive path of mitochondrial degeneration, which we named mitoautophagy. Mitoauthopgy is different from mitophagy, as it does not require autophagosome-mediated degradation. In contrast, in this novel path, mitochondria can clear themselves independently. We find that even at this early age, all diseased CSMN begin to display mitochondrial defects, whereas mitochondria in non-CSMN cells are healthy. Our findings not only reveal mitoautophagy as a novel path of mitochondrial clearance that occurs prior to neuronal vulnerability, but it also highlights that it is present mainly in the upper motor neurons of prpTDP-43&lt;sup&gt;A315T&lt;/sup&gt; and PFN1&lt;sup&gt;G118V&lt;/sup&gt; mice, which mimic many aspects of the disease in patients with TDP-43 pathology.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Longitudinal Changes in Functional Connectivity of the Caudate Is Associated With Recovery From Bell’s Palsy</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2019.00295</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Several studies have demonstrated through resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) that functional connectivity changes are important in the recovery from Bell’s palsy (BP); however, these studies have only focused on the cortico-cortical connectivity. It is unclear how corticostriatal connectivity relates to the recovery process of patients with BP. In the present study, we evaluated the relationship between longitudinal changes of caudate-based functional connectivity and longitudinal changes of facial performance in patients with intractable BP. Twenty-one patients with intractable BP underwent resting-state fMRI as well as facial behavioral assessments prior to treatment (PT) and at the middle stage of treatment (MT); and 21 age- and sex-matched healthy controls (HC) were recruited and received the same protocol. The caudate was divided into dorsal and ventral sub-regions and separate functional connectivity was calculated. Compared with HC, patients with intractable BP at the PT stage showed decreased functional connectivity of both the dorsal and ventral caudate mainly distributed in the somatosensory network, including the bilateral precentral gyrus (MI), left postcentral gyrus, media frontal gyrus, and superior temporal gyrus (STG). Alternatively, patients in the MT stage showed decreased functional connectivity primarily distributed in the executive network and somatosensory network, including the bilateral cingulate cortex (CC), left anterior cingulate cortex (LACC), inferior prefrontal gyrus (IFG), MI, STG, and paracentral lobe. The longitudinal changes in functional connectivity of both the dorsal and ventral caudate were mainly observed in the executive network, including the right ACC, left CC, and IFG. Functional connectivity changes in the right ACC and left IFG were significantly correlated with changes in facial behavioral performance. These findings indicated that corticostriatal connectivity changes are associated with recovery from BP.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

The novel therapies with immune checkpoint inhibitors hold great promises for patients with chronic virus infections and cancers. This is based mainly on the partial reversal of the exhausted phenotype of antigen-specific cytotoxic CD8 T cells (CTL). Recently, we have shown that the restoration of HIV-specific T cell function depends on the HIV infection stage of an infected individual. Here we aimed to answer two fundamental questions: (i) Can one estimate growth parameters for the HIV-specific proliferative responsiveness upon PD-L1 blockade ex vivo? (ii) Can one use these parameter estimates to predict clinical benefit for HIV-infected individuals displaying diverse infection phenotypes? To answer these questions, we first analyzed HIV-1 Gag-specific CD8 T cell proliferation by time-resolved CFSE assays and estimated the effect of PD-L1 blockade on division and death rates, and specific precursor frequencies. These values were then incorporated into a model for CTL-mediated HIV control and the effects on CTL frequencies, viral loads and CD4 T cell counts were predicted for different infection phenotypes. The biggest absolute increase in CD4 T cell counts was in the group of slow progressors while the strongest reduction in virus loads was observed in progressor patients. These results suggest a significant clinical benefit only for a subgroup of HIV-infected individuals. However, as PD1 is a marker of lymphocyte activation and expressed on several lymphocyte subsets including also CD4 T cells and B cells, we subsequently examined the multiple effects of anti-PD-L1 blockade beyond those on CD8 T cells. This extended model then predicts that the net effect on HIV load and CD4 T cell number depends on the interplay between positive and negative effects of lymphocyte subset activation. For a physiologically relevant range of affected model parameters, PD-L1 blockade is likely to be overall beneficial for HIV-infected individuals.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/zB4g3kpIFzg&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clinical outcomes in multiple sclerosis (MS) are highly variable. We aim to determine the long‐term clinical outcomes in MS, and to identify &lt;i&gt;early&lt;/i&gt; prognostic features of these outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;132 people presenting with a clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) were prospectively recruited between 1984‐87, and followed up clinically and radiologically 1, 5, 10, 14, 20 and now 30 years later. All available notes and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans were reviewed, and MS was defined according to the 2010 McDonald criteria.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clinical outcome data was obtained in 120 participants at 30 years. Eighty were known to have developed MS by 30 years. Expanded disability status scale (EDSS) scores were available in 107 participants, of whom 77 had MS: thirty‐two (42%) remained fully ambulatory (EDSS ≤3.5) all of whom had relapsing‐remitting MS (RRMS), three (4%) had RRMS and EDSS &amp;gt;3.5, 26 (34%) had secondary progressive MS (all had EDSS &amp;gt;3.5), and MS contributed to death in 16 (20%). Of those with MS, 11 have been treated with a DMT. The strongest early predictors (within 5 years of presentation) of secondary progressive MS (SPMS) at 30 years were presence of baseline infratentorial lesions and deep white matter lesions at one year.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thirty years after onset, in a largely untreated cohort, there was a divergence of MS outcomes; some people accrued substantial disability early on, while others ran a more favourable long‐term course. These outcomes could, in part, be predicted by radiological findings from within a year of first presentation.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: PiRNA-DQ541777 Contributes to Neuropathic Pain via Targeting Cdk5rap1</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/45/9028?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Piwi-Interacting RNA (piRNA) is the largest class of small noncoding RNA and is involved in various physiological and pathological processes. However, whether it has a role in pain modulation remains unknown. In the present study, we found that spinal piRNA-DQ541777 (piR-DQ541777) was significantly increased in the male mouse model of sciatic nerve chronic constriction injury (CCI)-induced neuropathic pain. Knockdown of spinal piR-DQ541777 alleviated CCI-induced thermal hyperalgesia and mechanical allodynia and spinal neuronal sensitization. However, the overexpression of spinal piR-DQ541777 in naive mice produced pain behaviors and increased spinal neuron sensitization. Furthermore, we found that piR-DQ541777 regulates pain behaviors by targeting CDK5 regulatory subunit-associated protein 1 (Cdk5rap1). CCI increased the methylation level of CpG islands in the &lt;i&gt;cdk5rap1&lt;/i&gt; promoter and consequently reduced the expression of Cdk5rap1, which was reversed by the knockdown of piR-DQ541777 and mimicked by the overexpression of piR-DQ541777 in naive mice. Finally, piR-DQ541777 increased the methylation level of CpG islands by recruiting DNA methyltransferase 3A (DNMT3a) to &lt;i&gt;cdk5rap1&lt;/i&gt; promoter. In conclusion, this study represents a novel role of piR-DQ541777 in the regulation of neuropathic pain through the methylation of &lt;i&gt;cdk5rap1&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Chronic pain affects ~20% of the population of the world and is a major global public health problem. Although we have studied the neurobiological mechanism of neuropathic pain for decades, there is still no ideal drug available to treat it. This work indicates that a novel role of Piwi-interacting RNA (piRNA) DQ541777 in the regulation of neuropathic pain through the methylation of &lt;i&gt;cdk5rap1&lt;/i&gt;. Our findings provide the first evidence of the regulatory effect of piRNAs on neuropathic pain, which may improve our understanding of pain mechanisms and lead to the discovery of novel drug targets for the prevention and treatment of neuropathic pain.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>RSS PAP: Threat anticipation in pulvinar and in superficial layers of primary visual cortex (V1). Evidence from layer-specific ultra-high field 7T fMRI</title>
	<link>http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0429-19.2019v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;The perceptual system gives priority to threat-relevant signals with survival value. In addition to the processing initiated by sensory inputs of threat signals, prioritization of threat signals may also include processes related to threat anticipation. These neural mechanisms remain largely unknown. Using ultra-high-field 7T fMRI, we show that anticipatory processing takes place in the early stages of visual processing, specifically in the pulvinar and V1. When anticipation of a threat-relevant fearful face target triggered false perception of not-presented target, there was enhanced activity in the pulvinar as well as in the V1 superficial-cortical-depth (layers 1–3). The anticipatory activity was absent in the LGN or higher visual cortical areas (V2-4). The effect in V1 was specific to the perception of fearful face targets and did not generalize to happy face targets. A preliminary analysis showed that the connectivity between the pulvinar and V1 superficial-cortical-depth was enhanced during false perception of threat, indicating that the pulvinar and V1 may interact in preparation of anticipated threat. The anticipatory processing supported by the pulvinar and V1 may play an important role in non-sensory-input driven anxiety states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significant statement&lt;/b&gt; States of anxiety may typically be triggered by mere anticipation of threatening sensory inputs even without actual presentation. However, the mechanisms which mere anticipation of threat modulates the processing of incoming sensory inputs remains poorly understood, partly because the neural mechanisms underlying anxiety are often examined by measuring the effects initiated by visual presentation of actual threat stimuli. This study addresses how anticipation of threat modulates our visual system in its earliest stages. Specifically, this study shows that activity in the pulvinar and V1 is modulated based on anticipation of threat signals (fearful faces), leading to false perception of anticipated-yet-not presented threat signals.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>RSS PAP: From state-to-trait meditation: Reconfiguration of central executive and default mode networks</title>
	<link>http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0335-18.2019v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;While brain default mode network (DMN) activation in human subjects has been associated with mind wandering, meditation practice has been found to suppress it and to increase psychological well-being. Additionally to DMN activity reduction, experienced meditators during meditation practice show and increased connectivity between the DMN and the central executive network (CEN). However, the gradual change between DMN and CEN configuration from pre-meditation, during meditation, and post-meditation are unknown. Here we investigated the change in DMN and CEN configuration by means of brain activity and functional connectivity analyses in experienced meditators across three back-to-back functional magnetic resonance imaging scans: Pre-meditation baseline (trait), meditation (state), and post-meditation (state-to-trait). Pre-meditation baseline group comparison was also performed between experienced meditators and healthy controls. Meditation trait was characterized by a significant reduction in activity and functional connectivity within DMN and increased anticorrelations between DMN and CEN. Conversely, meditation state and meditation state-to-trait periods showed increased activity and functional connectivity within the DMN and between DMN and CEN. However, the latter anticorrelations were only present in experienced meditators with limited practice. The interactions between networks during these states by means of Positive Diametric Activity (PDA) of the fractional Amplitude of Low-Frequency Fluctuations (fALFF) defined as  revealed no trait differences, but significant increases during meditation state that persisted in meditation state-to-trait. The gradual reconfiguration in DMN and CEN suggest a neural mechanism by which the CEN negatively regulates the DMN and is probably responsible for the long-term trait changes seen in meditators and reported psychological well-being.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; We introduce a Positive Diametric Activity (PDA) metric to measure the relation between two anticorrelated rs-fMRI networks in experienced meditators. PDA as well as functional connectivity (FC) are increased during meditation compared to resting state and persists in the post meditation resting state. Conversely, meditation trait is characterized by positive PDA but with significant reduction in activity and functional connectivity within Default Mode Network (DMN) and increased anticorrelations between DMN and central executive network (CEN). PDA and FC between DMN and CEN distinguish meditation state-to-trait effects.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: Self‐reported head trauma predicts poor dual task gait in retired NFL players</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25638?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Symptomatic head trauma associated with American‐style football (ASF) has been linked to brain pathology, along with physical and mental distress in later life. Still, the longer‐term effects of such trauma on objective metrics of cognitive‐motor function remain poorly understood. We hypothesized that ASF‐related symptomatic head trauma would predict worse gait performance, particularly during dual task conditions (i.e., walking while performing an additional cognitive task), in later life.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sixty‐six retired professional ASF players aged 29‐75 years completed a health and wellness questionnaire. They also completed a validated smartphone‐based assessment in their own homes, during which gait was monitored while walking normally and while performing a verbalized serial‐subtraction cognitive task.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Participants who reported more symptomatic head trauma, defined as the total number of impacts to the head or neck followed by concussion‐related symptoms, exhibited greater dual task cost (i.e., percent increase) to stride time variability (i.e., the coefficient of variation of mean stride time). Those who reported ≥1 hit followed by loss of consciousness, compared to those who did not, also exhibited greater dual task costs to this metric. Relationships between reported trauma and dual task costs were independent of age, BMI, NFL career duration, and history of musculoskeletal surgery. Symptomatic head trauma was not correlated with average stride times in either walking condition.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remote, smartphone‐based assessments of dual task walking may be utilized to capture meaningful data sensitive to the long‐term impact of symptomatic head trauma in former professional ASF players and other contact sport athletes.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Seizure Susceptibility Corrupts Inferior Colliculus Acoustic Integration</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2019.00063</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Evidence suggests that the pathophysiology associated with epileptic susceptibility may disturb the functional connectivity of neural circuits and compromise the brain functions, even when seizures are absent. Although memory impairment is a common comorbidity found in patients with epilepsy, it is still unclear whether more caudal structures may play a role in cognitive deficits, particularly in those cases where there is no evidence of hippocampal sclerosis. This work used a genetically selected rat strain for seizure susceptibility (Wistar audiogenic rat, WAR) and distinct behavioral (motor and memory-related tasks) and electrophysiological (inferior colliculus, IC) approaches to access acoustic primary integrative network properties. The IC neural assemblies’ response was evaluated by auditory transient (focusing on bottom-up processing) and steady-state evoked response (ASSR, centering on feedforward and feedback forces over neural circuitry). The results show that WAR displayed no disturbance in motor performance or hippocampus-dependent memory tasks. Nonetheless, WAR animals exhibited significative impairment for auditory fear conditioning (AFC) along with no indicative of IC plastic changes between the pre-conditioning and test phases (ASSR coherence analysis). Furthermore, WAR’s IC response to transient stimuli presented shorter latency and higher amplitude compared with Wistar; and the ASSR analysis showed similar results for WAR and Wistar animals under subthreshold dose of pentylenetetrazol (pro-convulsive drug) for seizure-induction. Our work demonstrated alterations at WAR IC neural network processing, which may explain the associated disturbance on AFC memory.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Pre-treatment With Fasudil Prevents Neomycin-Induced Hair Cell Damage by Reducing the Accumulation of Reactive Oxygen Species</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2019.00264</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Ototoxic drug-induced hair cell (HC) damage is one of the main causes of sensorineural hearing loss, which is one of the most common sensory disorders in humans. Aminoglycoside antibiotics are common ototoxic drugs, and these can cause the accumulation of intracellular oxygen free radicals and lead to apoptosis in HCs. Fasudil is a Rho kinase inhibitor and vasodilator that has been widely used in the clinic and has been shown to have neuroprotective effects. However, the possible application of fasudil in protecting against aminoglycoside-induced HC loss and hearing loss has not been investigated. In this study, we investigated the ability of fasudil to protect against neomycin-induced HC loss both in vitro and in vivo. We found that fasudil significantly reduced the HC loss in cochlear whole-organ explant cultures and reduced the cell death of auditory HEI-OC1 cells after neomycin exposure in vitro. Moreover, we found that fasudil significantly prevented the HC loss and hearing loss of mice in the in vivo neomycin damage model. Furthermore, we found that fasudil could significantly inhibit the Rho signaling pathway in the auditory HEI-OC1 cells after neomycin exposure, thus further reducing the neomycin-induced accumulation of reactive oxygen species and subsequent apoptosis in HEI-OC1 cells. This study suggests that fasudil might contribute to the increased viability of HCs after neomycin exposure by inhibition of the Rho signaling pathway and suggests a new therapeutic target for the prevention of aminoglycoside-induced HC loss and hearing loss.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Integrative Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Selectively Enhanced Development of Working Memory in Musically Trained Children and Adolescents</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnint.2019.00062</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In the current longitudinal study, we investigated the development of working memory in musically trained and nontrained children and adolescents, aged 9–20. We measured working memory with the Digit Span (DS) forwards and backwards tests (N = 106) and the Trail-Making A and B (TMT-A and B; N = 104) tests three times, in 2011, 2013, and 2016. We expected that musically trained participants would outperform peers with no musical training. Indeed, we found that the younger musically trained participants, in particular, outperformed their nontrained peers in the TMT-A, TMT-B and DS forwards tests. These tests all primarily require active maintenance of a rule in memory or immediate recall. In contrast, we found no group differences in the backwards test that requires manipulation and updating of information in working memory. These results suggest that musical training is more strongly associated with heightened working memory capacity and maintenance than enhanced working memory updating, especially in late childhood and early adolescence.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Neurodegeneration section | New and Recent Articles: Disease-Associated PNPLA6 Mutations Maintain Partial Functions When Analyzed in Drosophila</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.01207</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Mutations in patatin-like phospholipase domain-containing protein 6 (PNPLA6) have been linked with a number of inherited diseases with clinical symptoms that include spastic paraplegia, ataxia, and chorioretinal dystrophy. PNPLA6 is an evolutionary conserved protein whose ortholog in Drosophila is Swiss-Cheese (SWS). Both proteins are phospholipases hydrolyzing lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) and phosphatidylcholine (PC). Consequently, loss of SWS/PNPLA6 in flies and mice increases both lipids and leads to locomotion deficits and neurodegeneration. PNPLA6 knock-out mice are embryonic lethal, and a mutation creating an early stop codon in human PNPLA6 has only been identified in compound heterozygote patients. In contrast, disease-causing point mutations are found in homozygous patients, with some localized in the phospholipase domain while others are in a region that contains several cNMP binding sites. To investigate how different mutations affect the function of PNPLA6 in an in vivo model, we expressed them in the Drosophila sws&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; null mutant. Expressing wild-type PNPLA6 suppressed the locomotion and degenerative phenotypes in sws&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; and restored lipid levels, confirming that the human protein can replace fly SWS. In contrast, none of the mutant proteins restored lipid levels, although they suppressed the behavioral and degenerative phenotypes, at least in early stages. These results show that these mutant forms of PNPLA6 retain some biological function, indicating that disruption of lipid homeostasis is only part of the pathogenic mechanism. Furthermore, our finding that mutations in the cNMP binding sites prevented the restoration of normal lipid levels supports previous evidence that cNMP regulates the phospholipase activity of PNPLA6.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Brain Imaging Methods section | New and Recent Articles: More Reliable EEG Electrode Digitizing Methods Can Reduce Source Estimation Uncertainty, but Current Methods Already Accurately Identify Brodmann Areas</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.01159</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Electroencephalography (EEG) and source estimation can be used to identify brain areas activated during a task, which could offer greater insight on cortical dynamics. Source estimation requires knowledge of the locations of the EEG electrodes. This could be provided with a template or obtained by digitizing the EEG electrode locations. Operator skill and inherent uncertainties of a digitizing system likely produce a range of digitization reliabilities, which could affect source estimation and the interpretation of the estimated source locations. Here, we compared the reliabilities of five digitizing methods (ultrasound, structured-light 3D scan, infrared 3D scan, motion capture probe, and motion capture) and determined the relationship between digitization reliability and source estimation uncertainty, assuming other contributors to source estimation uncertainty were constant. We digitized a mannequin head using each method five times and quantified the reliability and validity of each method. We created five hundred sets of electrode locations based on our reliability results and applied a dipole fitting algorithm (DIPFIT) to perform source estimation. The motion capture method, which recorded the locations of markers placed directly on the electrodes had the best reliability with an average electrode variability of 0.001 cm. Then, in order of decreasing reliability were the method using a digitizing probe in the motion capture system, an infrared 3D scanner, a structured-light 3D scanner, and an ultrasound digitization system. Unsurprisingly, uncertainty of the estimated source locations increased with greater variability of EEG electrode locations and less reliable digitizing systems. If EEG electrode location variability was ∽1 cm, a single source could shift by as much as 2 cm. To help translate these distances into practical terms, we quantified Brodmann area accuracy for each digitizing method and found that the average Brodmann area accuracy for all digitizing methods was &amp;gt;80%. Using a template of electrode locations reduced the Brodmann area accuracy to ∽50%. Overall, more reliable digitizing methods can reduce source estimation uncertainty, but the significance of the source estimation uncertainty depends on the desired spatial resolution. For accurate Brodmann area identification, any of the digitizing methods tested can be used confidently.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Toward a Hybrid Passive BCI for the Modulation of Sustained Attention Using EEG and fNIRS</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2019.00393</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;We report results of a study that utilizes a BCI to drive an interactive interface countermeasure that allows users to self-regulate sustained attention while performing an ecologically valid, long-duration business logistics task. An engagement index derived from EEG signals was used to drive the BCI while fNIRS measured hemodynamic activity for the duration of the task. Participants (n = 30) were split into three groups (1) no countermeasures (NOCM), (2) continuous countermeasures (CCM), and (3) event synchronized, level-dependent countermeasures (ECM). We hypothesized that the ability to self-regulate sustained attention through a neurofeedback mechanism would result in greater task engagement, decreased error rate and improved task performance. Data were analyzed by wavelet coherence analysis, statistical analysis, performance metrics and self-assessed cognitive workload via RAW-TLX. We found that when the BCI was used to deliver continuous interface countermeasures (CCM), task performance was moderately enhanced in terms of total 14,785 (σ = 423) and estimated missed sales 7.46% (σ = 1.76) when compared to the NOCM 14,529 (σ = 510), 9.79% (σ = 2.75), and the ECM 14,180 (σ = 875), 9.62% (σ = 4.91) groups. An “actions per minute” (APM) metric was used to determine interface interaction activity which showed that overall the CCM and ECM groups had a higher APM of 3.460 (SE = 0.140) and 3.317 (SE = 0.139) respectively when compared with the NOCM group 2.65 (SE = 0.097). Statistical analysis showed a significant difference between ECM - NOCM and CCM - NOCM (p &amp;lt; 0.001) groups, but no significant difference between the ECM – CCM groups. Analysis of the RAW-TLX scores showed that the CCM group had lowest total score 7.27 (σ = 3.1) when compared with the ECM 9.7 (σ = 3.3) and NOCM 9.2 (σ = 3.4) groups. No statistical difference was found between the RAW-TLX or the subscales, except for self-perceived performance (p &amp;lt; 0.028) comparing the CCM and ECM groups. The results suggest that providing a means to self-regulate sustained attention has the potential to keep operators engaged over long periods, and moderately increase on-task performance while decreasing on-task error.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Effects of Expressive Writing on Neural Processing During Learning</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2019.00389</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Expressive writing about past negative events has been shown to lead to a slew of positive outcomes. However, little is known about why writing about something negative would have positive effects. While some have posited that telling a narrative of a past negative event or current anxiety “frees up” cognitive resources, allowing individuals to focus more on the task at hand, there is little neural evidence suggesting that expressive writing has an effect on cognitive load. Moreover, little is known about how individual differences in the content of expressive writing could affect neural processing and the cognitive benefits writing confers. In our experiment, we compared brain activity in a group that had engaged in expressive writing vs. a control group, during performance on a feedback-based paired-associate word-learning task. We found that across groups, differential activation in the dorsal striatum in response to positive vs. negative feedback significantly predicted better later memory. Moreover, writing about a past failure resulted in more activation relative to the control group during the learning task in the mid-cingulate cortex (MCC), an area of the brain crucial to processing negative emotion. While our results do not provide support for the assertion that expressive writing alters attentional processing, our findings suggest that choosing to write about particularly intense past negative experiences like a difficult past failure may have resulted in changes in neural activation during task processing.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncir.2019.00072</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Recent evidence suggests that the cerebellum is related to motor and non-motor cognitive functions, and that several coupled cerebro-cerebellar networks exist, including links with the limbic network. Since several limbic structures are affected by Alzheimer pathology, even in the preclinical stages of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), we aimed to investigate the cerebral limbic network activity from the perspective of the cerebellum. Twenty patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), 18 patients with AD, and 26 healthy controls (HC) were recruited to acquire Resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI). We used seed-based approach to construct the cerebro-cerebellar limbic network. Two-sample t-tests were carried out to explore the differences of the cerebellar limbic network connectivity. The first result, a sub-scale network including the bilateral posterior part of the orbitofrontal cortex (POFC) extending to the anterior insular cortex (AIC) and left inferior parietal lobule (L-IPL), showed greater functional connectivity in MCI than in HC and less functional connectivity in AD than in MCI. The location of this sub-scale network was in accordance with components of the ventral attention network. Second, there was decreased functional connectivity to the right mid-cingulate cortex (MCC) in the AD and MCI patient groups relative to the HC group. As the cerebellum is not compromised by Alzheimer pathology in the prodromal stage of AD, this pattern indicates that the sub-scale ventral attention network may play a pivotal role in functional compensation through the coupled cerebro-cerebellar limbic network in MCI, and the cerebellum may be a key node in the modulation of social cognition.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2019.00493</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Sensorineural hearing loss affects millions of people worldwide and is a growing concern in the aging population. Treatment using aminoglycoside antibiotics for infection and exposure to loud sounds contribute to the degeneration of cochlear hair cells and spiral ganglion neurons. Cell loss impacts cochlear function and causes hearing loss in ∼ 15% of adult Americans (∼36 million). The number of individuals with hearing loss will likely grow with increasing lifespans. Current prosthesis such as hearing aids and cochlear implants can ameliorate hearing loss. However, hearing aids are ineffective if hair cells or spiral ganglion neurons are severely damaged, and cochlear implants are ineffective without properly functioning spiral ganglion neurons. As such, strategies that alleviate hearing loss by preventing degeneration or promoting cell replacement are urgently needed. Despite showing great promise from in vitro studies, the complexity and delicate nature of the inner ear poses a huge challenge for delivering therapeutics. To mitigate risks and complications associated with surgery, new technologies and methodologies have emerged for efficient delivery of therapeutics. We will focus on biomaterials that allow controlled and local drug delivery into the inner ear. The rapid development of microsurgical techniques in conjunction with novel bio- and nanomaterials for sustained drug delivery appears bright for hearing loss treatment.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Beneficial and Detrimental Remodeling of Glial Connexin and Pannexin Functions in Rodent Models of Nervous System Diseases</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2019.00491</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A variety of glial cell functions are supported by connexin and pannexin proteins. These functions include the modulation of synaptic gain, the control of excitability through regulation of the ion and neurotransmitter composition of the extracellular milieu and the promotion of neuronal survival. Connexins and pannexins support these functions through diverse molecular mechanisms, including channel and non-channel functions. The former comprise the formation of gap junction-mediated networks supported by connexin intercellular channels and the formation of pore-like membrane structures or hemichannels formed by both connexins and pannexins. Non-channel functions involve adhesion properties and the participation in signaling intracellular cascades. Pathological conditions of the nervous system such as ischemia, neurodegeneration, pathogen infection, trauma and tumors are characterized by distinctive remodeling of connexin expression and function. However, whether these changes can be interpreted as part of the pathogenesis, or as beneficial compensatory effects, remains under debate. Here we review the available evidence addressing this matter with a special emphasis in mouse models with selective manipulation of glial connexin and pannexin proteins in vivo. We postulate that the beneficial vs. detrimental effects of glial connexin remodeling in pathological conditions depend on the impact of remodeling on the different connexin and pannexin channel and non-channel functions, on the characteristics of the inflammatory environment and on the type of interaction among glial cells types.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Delayed Azithromycin Treatment Improves Recovery After Mouse Spinal Cord Injury</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2019.00490</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;After spinal cord injury (SCI), macrophages infiltrate into the lesion and can adopt a wide spectrum of activation states. However, the pro-inflammatory, pathological macrophage activation state predominates and contributes to progressive neurodegeneration. Azithromycin (AZM), an FDA approved macrolide antibiotic, has been demonstrated to have immunomodulatory properties in a variety of inflammatory conditions. Indeed, we previously observed that post-SCI AZM treatment reduces pro-inflammatory macrophage activation. Further, a combined pre- and post-injury treatment paradigm improved functional recovery from SCI. Therefore, for the current study, we hypothesize that post-injury AZM treatment will improve recovery from SCI. To test this hypothesis, we examined the therapeutic potential of delayed AZM treatment on locomotor, sensory, and anatomical recovery. We administered AZM beginning 30-min, 3-h, or 24-h following contusion SCI in female mice, and then daily for 7 days. AZM administration beginning 30-min and 3-h post-injury improved locomotor recovery with increased stepping function relative to vehicle controls. Further, delaying treatment for 30-min after SCI significantly reduced lesion pathology. Initiating AZM treatment 24-h post-injury was not therapeutically effective. Regardless of the timing of the initial treatment, AZM did not statistically reduce the development of neuropathic pain (mechanical allodynia) nor increase neuron survival. Collectively, these results add to a growing body of evidence supporting AZM’s translational potential as a therapeutic agent for SCI and other neuroinflammatory conditions in which patients currently have very few options.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Closed-Loop Acoustic Stimulation Enhances Sleep Oscillations But Not Memory Performance</title>
	<link>http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/6/6/ENEURO.0306-19.2019?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Slow oscillations and spindle activity during non-rapid eye movement sleep have been implicated in memory consolidation. Closed-loop acoustic stimulation has previously been shown to enhance slow oscillations and spindle activity during sleep and improve verbal associative memory. We assessed the effect of closed-loop acoustic stimulation during a daytime nap on a virtual reality spatial navigation task in 12 healthy human subjects in a randomized within-subject crossover design. We show robust enhancement of slow oscillation and spindle activity during sleep. However, no effects on behavioral performance were observed when comparing real versus sham stimulation. To explore whether memory enhancement effects were task specific and dependent on nocturnal sleep, in a second experiment with 19 healthy subjects, we aimed to replicate a previous study that used closed-loop acoustic stimulation to enhance memory for word pairs. The methods used were as close as possible to those used in the original study, except that we used a double-blind protocol, in which both subject and experimenter were unaware of the test condition. Again, we successfully enhanced slow oscillation and spindle power, but again did not strengthen associative memory performance with stimulation. We conclude that enhancement of sleep oscillations may be insufficient to enhance memory performance in spatial navigation or verbal association tasks, and provide possible explanations for lack of behavioral replication.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Inhibitory Synapse Formation at the Axon Initial Segment</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2019.00266</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The axon initial segment (AIS) is the site of action potential (AP) initiation in most neurons and is thus a critical site in the regulation of neuronal excitability. Normal function within the discrete AIS compartment requires intricate molecular machinery to ensure the proper concentration and organization of voltage-gated and ligand-gated ion channels; in humans, dysfunction at the AIS due to channel mutations is commonly associated with epileptic disorders. In this review, we will examine the molecular mechanisms underlying the formation of the only synapses found at the AIS: synapses containing γ-aminobutyric type A receptors (GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;Rs). GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;Rs are heteropentamers assembled from 19 possible subunits and are the primary mediators of fast synaptic inhibition in the brain. Although the total GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;R population is incredibly heterogeneous, only one specific GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;R subtype—the α2-containing receptor—is enriched at the AIS. These AIS synapses are innervated by GABAergic chandelier cells, and this inhibitory signaling is thought to contribute to the tight control of AP firing. Here, we will summarize the progress made in understanding the regulation of GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;R synapse formation, concentrating on post-translational modifications of subunits and on interactions with intracellular proteins. We will then discuss subtype-specific synapse formation, with a focus on synapses found at the AIS, and how these synapses influence neuronal excitation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI) is being widely used for charting brain connectivity and dynamics in healthy and diseased brains. However, the resting state paradigm allows an unconstrained fluctuation of brain arousal, which may have profound effects on resting-state fMRI signals and associated connectivity/dynamic metrics. Here, we review current understandings of the relationship between resting-state fMRI and brain arousal, in particular the effect of a recently discovered event of arousal modulation on resting-state fMRI. We further discuss potential implications of arousal-related fMRI modulation with a focus on its potential role in mediating spurious correlations between resting-state connectivity/dynamics with physiology and behavior. Multiple hypotheses are formulated based on existing evidence and remain to be tested by future studies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Brain Imaging Methods section | New and Recent Articles: Brain–Blood Partition Coefficient and Cerebral Blood Flow in Canines Using Calibrated Short TR Recovery (CaSTRR) Correction Method</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.01189</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The brain–blood partition coefficient (BBPC) is necessary for quantifying cerebral blood flow (CBF) when using tracer based techniques like arterial spin labeling (ASL). A recent improvement to traditional MRI measurements of BBPC, called calibrated short TR recovery (CaSTRR), has demonstrated a significant reduction in acquisition time for BBPC maps in mice. In this study CaSTRR is applied to a cohort of healthy canines (n = 17, age = 5.0 – 8.0 years) using a protocol suited for application in humans at 3T. The imaging protocol included CaSTRR for BBPC maps, pseudo-continuous ASL for CBF maps, and high resolution anatomical images. The standard CaSTRR method of normalizing BBPC to gadolinium-doped deuterium oxide phantoms was also compared to normalization using hematocrit (Hct) as a proxy value for blood water content. The results show that CaSTRR is able to produce high quality BBPC maps with a 4 min acquisition time. The BBPC maps demonstrate significantly higher BBPC in gray matter (0.83 ± 0.05 mL/g) than in white matter (0.78 ± 0.04 mL/g, p = 0.006). Maps of CBF acquired with pCASL demonstrate a negative correlation between gray matter perfusion and age (p = 0.003). Voxel-wise correction for BBPC is also shown to improve contrast to noise ratio between gray and white matter in CBF maps. A novel aspect of the study was to show that that BBPC measurements can be calculated based on the known Hct of the blood sample placed in scanner. We found a strong correlation (R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.81 in gray matter, R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.59 in white matter) established between BBPC maps normalized to the doped phantoms and BBPC maps normalized using Hct. This obviates the need for doped water phantoms which simplifies both the acquisition protocol and the post-processing methods. Together this suggests that CaSTRR represents a feasible, rapid method to account for BBPC variability when quantifying CBF. As canines have been used widely for aging and Alzheimer’s disease studies, the CaSTRR method established in the animals may further improve CBF measurements and advance our understanding of cerebrovascular changes in aging and neurodegeneration.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Brain Imaging Methods section | New and Recent Articles: Divide and Conquer: Stratifying Training Data by Tumor Grade Improves Deep Learning-Based Brain Tumor Segmentation</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.01182</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;It is a general assumption in deep learning that more training data leads to better performance, and that models will learn to generalize well across heterogeneous input data as long as that variety is represented in the training set. Segmentation of brain tumors is a well-investigated topic in medical image computing, owing primarily to the availability of a large publicly-available dataset arising from the long-running yearly Multimodal Brain Tumor Segmentation (BraTS) challenge. Research efforts and publications addressing this dataset focus predominantly on technical improvements of model architectures and less on properties of the underlying data. Using the dataset and the method ranked third in the BraTS 2018 challenge, we performed experiments to examine the impact of tumor type on segmentation performance. We propose to stratify the training dataset into high-grade glioma (HGG) and low-grade glioma (LGG) subjects and train two separate models. Although we observed only minor gains in overall mean dice scores by this stratification, examining case-wise rankings of individual subjects revealed statistically significant improvements. Compared to a baseline model trained on both HGG and LGG cases, two separately trained models led to better performance in 64.9% of cases (p &amp;lt; 0.0001) for the tumor core. An analysis of subjects which did not profit from stratified training revealed that cases were missegmented which had poor image quality, or which presented clinically particularly challenging cases (e.g., underrepresented subtypes such as IDH1-mutant tumors), underlining the importance of such latent variables in the context of tumor segmentation. In summary, we found that segmentation models trained on the BraTS 2018 dataset, stratified according to tumor type, lead to a significant increase in segmentation performance. Furthermore, we demonstrated that this gain in segmentation performance is evident in the case-wise ranking of individual subjects but not in summary statistics. We conclude that it may be useful to consider the segmentation of brain tumors of different types or grades as separate tasks, rather than developing one tool to segment them all. Consequently, making this information available for the test data should be considered, potentially leading to a more clinically relevant BraTS competition.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Neural Technology section | New and Recent Articles: Comparison of Multi-Compartment Cable Models of Human Auditory Nerve Fibers</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.01173</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Background: Multi-compartment cable models of auditory nerve fibers have been developed to assist in the improvement of cochlear implants. With the advancement of computational technology and the results obtained from in vivo and in vitro experiments, these models have evolved to incorporate a considerable degree of morphological and physiological details. They have also been combined with three-dimensional volume conduction models of the cochlea to simulate neural responses to electrical stimulation. However, no specific rules have been provided on choosing the appropriate cable model, and most models adopted in recent studies were chosen without a specific reason or by inheritance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Three of the most cited biophysical multi-compartment cable models of the human auditory nerve, i.e., Rattay et al. (2001b), Briaire and Frijns (2005), and Smit et al. (2010), were implemented in this study. Several properties of single fibers were compared among the three models, including threshold, conduction velocity, action potential shape, latency, refractory properties, as well as stochastic and temporal behaviors. Experimental results regarding these properties were also included as a reference for comparison.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: For monophasic single-pulse stimulation, the ratio of anodic vs. cathodic thresholds in all models was within the experimental range despite a much larger ratio in the model by Briaire and Frijns. For biphasic pulse-train stimulation, thresholds as a function of both pulse rate and pulse duration differed between the models, but none matched the experimental observations even coarsely. Similarly, for all other properties including the conduction velocity, action potential shape, and latency, the models presented different outcomes and not all of them fell within the range observed in experiments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: While all three models presented similar values in certain single fiber properties to those obtained in experiments, none matched all experimental observations satisfactorily. In particular, the adaptation and temporal integration behaviors were completely missing in all models. Further extensions and analyses are required to explain and simulate realistic auditory nerve fiber responses to electrical stimulation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.01155</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A number of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) protocols have been developed for modulating brain function non-invasively. To identify the most powerful one, these protocols have been compared in the context of the motor system. However, to what extent the conclusions could be generalized to high-level functions is largely unknown. In this study, we compared the modulatory effect of three excitatory rTMS protocols on high-level cognition represented by response inhibition ability. Our first experiment revealed that intermittent theta-burst stimulation (iTBS) could significantly improve reaction time in a stop signal task, while 5-Hz and 25-Hz stimuli were ineffective. This iTBS effect was significantly higher than that for the sham simulation and only occurred in the second session of the stop signal task after iTBS in the first experiment. However, this aftereffect of iTBS was not reproduced in the second experiment, indicating high variability across subjects. Thus, on the one hand, our findings indicate that iTBS on the pre-SMA could improve inhibitory control, but on the other hand, the reliability and reproducibility of this effect needs further investigation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;African Americans have double the prevalence of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), as compared to European Americans. However, the underlying causes of this health disparity are due to a multitude of environmental, lifestyle, and genetic factors that are not yet fully understood.

We will describe the direct effects of genetic variation on neural correlates of cognitive function and report the indirect modulating effects of genetic variation on modifiable AD risk factors, such as aerobic fitness. As a means of integrating previous findings, we present a novel schematic diagram to illustrate the many factors that contribute to AD risk and impaired cognitive function in older African Americans. Finally, we discuss areas that require further inquiry, and stress the importance of racially diverse and representative study populations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Beta-Band Resonance and Intrinsic Oscillations in a Biophysically Detailed Model of the Subthalamic Nucleus-Globus Pallidus Network</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2019.00077</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Increased beta-band oscillatory activity in the basal ganglia network is associated with Parkinsonian motor symptoms and is suppressed with medication and deep brain stimulation (DBS). The origins of the beta-band oscillations, however, remains unclear with both intrinsic oscillations arising within the subthalamic nucleus (STN)—external globus pallidus (GPe) network and exogenous beta-activity, originating outside the network, proposed as potential sources of the pathological activity. The aim of this study was to explore the relative contribution of autonomous oscillations and exogenous oscillatory inputs in the generation of pathological oscillatory activity in a biophysically detailed model of the parkinsonian STN-GPe network. The network model accounts for the integration of synaptic currents and their interaction with intrinsic membrane currents in dendritic structures within the STN and GPe. The model was used to investigate the development of beta-band synchrony and bursting within the STN-GPe network by changing the balance of excitation and inhibition in both nuclei, and by adding exogenous oscillatory inputs with varying phase relationships through the hyperdirect cortico-subthalamic and indirect striato-pallidal pathways. The model showed an intrinsic susceptibility to beta-band oscillations that was manifest in weak autonomously generated oscillations within the STN-GPe network and in selective amplification of exogenous beta-band synaptic inputs near the network's endogenous oscillation frequency. The frequency at which this resonance peak occurred was determined by the net level of excitatory drive to the network. Intrinsic or endogenously generated oscillations were too weak to support a pacemaker role for the STN-GPe network, however, they were considerably amplified by sparse cortical beta inputs and were further amplified by striatal beta inputs that promoted anti-phase firing of the cortex and GPe, resulting in maximum transient inhibition of STN neurons. The model elucidates a mechanism of cortical patterning of the STN-GPe network through feedback inhibition whereby intrinsic susceptibility to beta-band oscillations can lead to phase locked spiking under parkinsonian conditions. These results point to resonance of endogenous oscillations with exogenous patterning of the STN-GPe network as a mechanism of pathological synchronization, and a role for the pallido-striatal feedback loop in amplifying beta oscillations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

To fill this knowledge gap, we investigated the effect of a single intraperitoneal lipopolysaccharide (LPS) administration in adult and aged mice. We assessed the expression of different inflammatory mediators, and the microglial response through binding of [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]-VC701 tracer to translocator protein (TSPO) receptors in the male and female brain. Aged female brain showed a higher pro-inflammatory response to LPS compared to adult female and to aged male, as revealed by ex vivo binding to TSPO receptors and pro-inflammatory mediator transcript levels. The highest astroglial reaction was observed in the brain of aged females. Differently to the other groups of animals, in aged males LPS challenge did not affect transcription of triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2). In conclusion, our study shows that in the mouse’s brain the neuro-inflammatory response to an acute peripheral insult is sex- and age-dependent. Moreover, our results might set the basis for further studies aimed at identifying sex-related targets involved in the modulation of the aberrant neuro-inflammatory response that characterizes aging. This knowledge could be relevant for the treatment of conditions such as delirium and dementia.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: The Ventricular System Enlarges Abnormally in the Seventies, Earlier in Men, and First in the Frontal Horn: A Study Based on More Than 3,000 Scans</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2019.00294</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Objectives: To detect on computed tomography (CT) brain scans the trajectories of normal and abnormal ventricular enlargement during aging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: For each 1-year age cohort, we assessed in 3,193 axial CT scans the Evans’ index (EI) in the anterior frontal horns and the parieto-occipital (POR) and temporal ratio (TR) in the posterior and inferior horns. Cut-off values for abnormal enlargement were based on previous clinical studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: The mean age associated with normal linear measures was 71 years. Values for all three measures increased with age, showing a linear relationship below—but not above—each cut-off value. The mean age of participants with abnormal enlargement on CT progressed from 79 years for EI to 83 years for POR to 87 years for TR. These results suggested that ventricular dilatation progresses in an age–location relationship. First comes enlargement of the frontal horns (13.8% of scans), followed by the parieto-occipital horns (15.1% of scans) and then temporal horn enlargement (6.8% of scans). Scans from men displayed abnormal values earlier than scans from women (on average 6 years). Risk increased 5.1% annually for abnormal EI, 9.0% for abnormal POR, and 11% for abnormal TR (all p &amp;lt; 0.001). The most frequent agreement between categories (normal–abnormal) for values of neuroimaging measures was identified for POR–TR.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: The results of this large radiological study suggest that the ventricular system enlarges progressively during aging, and in a subset of patients follows an abnormal consecutive geometric dilatation, influenced by age and sex.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Network-based analysis of prostate cancer cell lines reveals novel marker gene candidates associated with radioresistance and patient relapse</title>

Radiation therapy is an important and effective treatment option for prostate cancer, but high-risk patients are prone to relapse due to radioresistance of cancer cells. Molecular mechanisms that contribute to radioresistance are not fully understood. Novel computational strategies are needed to identify radioresistance driver genes from hundreds of gene copy number alterations. We developed a network-based approach based on lasso regression in combination with network propagation for the analysis of prostate cancer cell lines with acquired radioresistance to identify clinically relevant marker genes associated with radioresistance in prostate cancer patients. We analyzed established radioresistant cell lines of the prostate cancer cell lines DU145 and LNCaP and compared their gene copy number and expression profiles to their radiosensitive parental cells. We found that radioresistant DU145 showed much more gene copy number alterations than LNCaP and their gene expression profiles were highly cell line specific. We learned a genome-wide prostate cancer-specific gene regulatory network and quantified impacts of differentially expressed genes with directly underlying copy number alterations on known radioresistance marker genes. This revealed several potential driver candidates involved in the regulation of cancer-relevant processes. Importantly, we found that ten driver candidates from DU145 (&lt;i&gt;ADAMTS9&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;AKR1B10&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;CXXC5&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;FST&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;FOXL1&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;GRPR&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;ITGA2&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;SOX17&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;STARD4&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;VGF&lt;/i&gt;) and four from LNCaP (&lt;i&gt;FHL5&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;LYPLAL1&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;PAK7&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;TDRD6&lt;/i&gt;) were able to distinguish irradiated prostate cancer patients into early and late relapse groups. Moreover, in-depth &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; validations for &lt;i&gt;VGF&lt;/i&gt; (Neurosecretory protein VGF) showed that siRNA-mediated gene silencing increased the radiosensitivity of DU145 and LNCaP cells. Our computational approach enabled to predict novel radioresistance driver gene candidates. Additional preclinical and clinical studies are required to further validate the role of &lt;i&gt;VGF&lt;/i&gt; and other candidate genes as potential biomarkers for the prediction of radiotherapy responses and as potential targets for radiosensitization of prostate cancer.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/dAhbTS4BSUQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Large-scale neural recording methods now allow us to observe large populations of identified single neurons simultaneously, opening a window into neural population dynamics in living organisms. However, distilling such large-scale recordings to build theories of emergent collective dynamics remains a fundamental statistical challenge. The neural field models of Wilson, Cowan, and colleagues remain the mainstay of mathematical population modeling owing to their interpretable, mechanistic parameters and amenability to mathematical analysis. Inspired by recent advances in biochemical modeling, we develop a method based on moment closure to interpret neural field models as latent state-space point-process models, making them amenable to statistical inference. With this approach we can infer the intrinsic states of neurons, such as active and refractory, solely from spiking activity in large populations. After validating this approach with synthetic data, we apply it to high-density recordings of spiking activity in the developing mouse retina. This confirms the essential role of a long lasting refractory state in shaping spatiotemporal properties of neonatal retinal waves. This conceptual and methodological advance opens up new theoretical connections between mathematical theory and point-process state-space models in neural data analysis.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/XgxYx7yRJWI&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Drug resistance is a major cause for the failure of cancer chemotherapy or targeted therapy. However, the molecular regulatory mechanisms controlling the dynamic evolvement of drug resistance remain poorly understood. Thus, it is important to develop methods for identifying key gene regulatory mechanisms of the resistance to specific drugs. In this study, we developed a data-driven computational framework, DryNetMC, using a differential regulatory network-based modeling and characterization strategy to quantify and prioritize key genes underlying cancer drug resistance. The DryNetMC does not only infer gene regulatory networks (GRNs) via an integrated approach, but also characterizes and quantifies dynamical network properties for measuring node importance. We used time-course RNA-seq data from glioma cells treated with dbcAMP (a cAMP activator) as a realistic case to reconstruct the GRNs for sensitive and resistant cells. Based on a novel node importance index that comprehensively quantifies network topology, network entropy and expression dynamics, the top ranked genes were verified to be predictive of the drug sensitivities of different glioma cell lines, in comparison with other existing methods. The proposed method provides a quantitative approach to gain insights into the dynamic adaptation and regulatory mechanisms of cancer drug resistance and sheds light on the design of novel biomarkers or targets for predicting or overcoming drug resistance.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/dIawfvYo2e4&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Modern biological tools generate a wealth of data on metabolite and protein concentrations that can be used to help inform new strain designs. However, learning from these data to predict how a cell will respond to genetic changes, a key need for engineering, remains challenging. A promising technique for leveraging omics measurements in metabolic modeling involves the construction of kinetic descriptions of the enzymatic reactions that occur within a cell. Parameterizing these models from biological data can be computationally difficult, since methods must also quantify the uncertainty in model parameters resulting from the observed data. While the field of Bayesian inference offers a wide range of methods for efficiently estimating distributions in parameter uncertainty, such techniques are poorly suited to traditional kinetic models due to their complex rate laws and resulting nonlinear dynamics. In this paper, we employ linear-logarithmic kinetics to simplify the calculation of steady-state flux distributions and enable efficient sampling and inference methods. We demonstrate that detailed information on the posterior distribution of parameters can be obtained efficiently at a variety of problem scales, including nearly genome-scale kinetic models trained on multiomics datasets. These results allow modern Bayesian machine learning tools to be leveraged in understanding biological data and in developing new, efficient strain designs.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/NGNzbo-8y0U&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Novel comparison of evaluation metrics for gene ontology classifiers reveals drastic performance differences</title>

Automated protein annotation using the Gene Ontology (GO) plays an important role in the biosciences. Evaluation has always been considered central to developing novel annotation methods, but little attention has been paid to the evaluation metrics themselves. Evaluation metrics define how well an annotation method performs and allows for them to be ranked against one another. Unfortunately, most of these metrics were adopted from the machine learning literature without establishing whether they were appropriate for GO annotations. We propose a novel approach for comparing GO evaluation metrics called &lt;i&gt;Artificial Dilution Series&lt;/i&gt; (ADS). Our approach uses existing annotation data to generate a series of annotation sets with different levels of correctness (referred to as their signal level). We calculate the evaluation metric being tested for each annotation set in the series, allowing us to identify whether it can separate different signal levels. Finally, we contrast these results with several &lt;i&gt;false positive annotation sets&lt;/i&gt;, which are designed to expose systematic weaknesses in GO assessment. We compared 37 evaluation metrics for GO annotation using ADS and identified drastic differences between metrics. We show that some metrics struggle to differentiate between different signal levels, while others give erroneously high scores to the false positive data sets. Based on our findings, we provide guidelines on which evaluation metrics perform well with the Gene Ontology and propose improvements to several well-known evaluation metrics. In general, we argue that evaluation metrics should be tested for their performance and we provide software for this purpose (https://bitbucket.org/plyusnin/ads/). ADS is applicable to other areas of science where the evaluation of prediction results is non-trivial.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/cyB2HoMU5KA&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

A recent hemodynamic model is extended and applied to simulate and explore the feasibility of detecting ocular dominance (OD) and orientation preference (OP) columns in primary visual cortex by means of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). The stimulation entails a short oriented bar stimulus being presented to one eye and mapped to cortical neurons with corresponding OD and OP selectivity. Activated neurons project via patchy connectivity to excite other neurons with similar OP in nearby visual fields located preferentially along the direction of stimulus orientation. The resulting blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) response is estimated numerically via the model’s spatiotemporal hemodynamic response function. The results are then used to explore the feasibility of detecting spatial OD-OP modulation, either directly measuring BOLD or by using Wiener deconvolution to filter the image and estimate the underlying neural activity. The effect of noise is also considered and it is estimated that direct detection can be robust for fMRI resolution of around 0.5 mm, whereas detection with Wiener deconvolution is possible at a broader range from 0.125 mm to 1 mm resolution. The detection of OD-OP features is strongly dependent on hemodynamic parameters, such as low velocity and high damping reduce response spreads and result in less blurring. The short-bar stimulus that gives the most detectable response is found to occur when neural projections are at 45 relative to the edge of local OD boundaries, which provides a constraint on the OD-OP architecture even when it is not fully resolved.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/9xO3EcnAYnA&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Genome segmentation approaches allow us to characterize regulatory states in a given cell type using combinatorial patterns of histone modifications and other regulatory signals. In order to analyze regulatory state differences across cell types, current genome segmentation approaches typically require that the same regulatory genomics assays have been performed in all analyzed cell types. This necessarily limits both the numbers of cell types that can be analyzed and the complexity of the resulting regulatory states, as only a small number of histone modifications have been profiled across many cell types. Data imputation approaches that aim to estimate missing regulatory signals have been applied before genome segmentation. However, this approach is computationally costly and propagates any errors in imputation to produce incorrect genome segmentation results downstream. We present an extension to the IDEAS genome segmentation platform which can perform genome segmentation on incomplete regulatory genomics dataset collections without using imputation. Instead of relying on imputed data, we use an expectation-maximization approach to estimate marginal density functions within each regulatory state. We demonstrate that our genome segmentation results compare favorably with approaches based on imputation or other strategies for handling missing data. We further show that our approach can accurately impute missing data after genome segmentation, reversing the typical order of imputation/genome segmentation pipelines. Finally, we present a new 2D genome segmentation analysis of 127 human cell types studied by the Roadmap Epigenomics Consortium. By using an expanded set of chromatin marks that have been profiled in subsets of these cell types, our new segmentation results capture a more complex picture of combinatorial regulatory patterns that appear on the human genome.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/N6lt84v5eJ0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Intracellular thermometry has recently demonstrated temperatures in the nucleus, mitochondria, and centrosome to be significantly higher than those of the cytoplasm and cell membrane. This local thermogenesis and the resulting temperature gradient could facilitate the development of persistent, self-organizing convection currents in the cytoplasm of large eukaryotes. Using 3-dimensional computational simulations of intracellular fluid motion, we quantify the convective velocities that could result from the temperature differences observed experimentally. Based on these velocities, we identify the conditions necessary for this temperature-driven bulk flow to dominate over random thermal diffusive motion at the scale of a single eukaryotic cell. With temperature gradients of the order 1°C and diffusion coefficients comparable to those described in the literature, Péclet numbers ≥ 1 are feasible and permit comparable or greater effects of convection than diffusion in determining intracellular mass flux. In addition to the temperature gradient, the resulting flow patterns would also depend on the spatial localization of the heat source, the shape of the cell membrane, and the complex intracellular structure including the cytoskeleton. While this intracellular convection would be highly context-dependent, in certain settings, convective motion could provide a previously unrecognized mechanism for directed, bulk transport within eukaryotic cells.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/_QBuR-tS69s&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Gene expression governs cell fate, and is regulated via a complex interplay of transcription factors and molecules that change chromatin structure. Advances in sequencing-based assays have enabled investigation of these processes genome-wide, leading to large datasets that combine information on the dynamics of gene expression, transcription factor binding and chromatin structure as cells differentiate. While numerous studies focus on the effects of these features on broader gene regulation, less work has been done on the mechanisms of gene-specific transcriptional control. In this study, we have focussed on the latter by integrating gene expression data for the &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; differentiation of murine ES cells to macrophages and cardiomyocytes, with dynamic data on chromatin structure, epigenetics and transcription factor binding. Combining a novel strategy to identify communities of related control elements with a penalized regression approach, we developed individual models to identify the potential control elements predictive of the expression of each gene. Our models were compared to an existing method and evaluated using the existing literature and new experimental data using embryonic stem cell differentiation reporter assays. Our method is able to identify transcriptional control elements in a gene specific manner that reflect known regulatory relationships and to generate useful hypotheses for further testing.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/SCR5bY7z7ho&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Rapid advances in single-cell assays have outpaced methods for analysis of those data types. Different single-cell assays show extensive variation in sensitivity and signal to noise levels. In particular, scATAC-seq generates extremely sparse and noisy datasets. Existing methods developed to analyze this data require cells amenable to pseudo-time analysis or require datasets with drastically different cell-types. We describe a novel approach using self-organizing maps (SOM) to link scATAC-seq regions with scRNA-seq genes that overcomes these challenges and can generate draft regulatory networks. Our SOMatic package generates chromatin and gene expression SOMs separately and combines them using a linking function. We applied SOMatic on a mouse pre-B cell differentiation time-course using controlled Ikaros over-expression to recover gene ontology enrichments, identify motifs in genomic regions showing similar single-cell profiles, and generate a gene regulatory network that both recovers known interactions and predicts new Ikaros targets during the differentiation process. The ability of linked SOMs to detect emergent properties from multiple types of highly-dimensional genomic data with very different signal properties opens new avenues for integrative analysis of heterogeneous data.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/-83mDO3zsf0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder associated with impaired motor function and several non-motor symptoms, with no available disease modifying treatment. Intracellular accumulation of pathological α-synuclein inclusions is a hallmark of idiopathic PD, whereas, dominant mutations in Leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) are associated with familial PD that is clinically indistinguishable from idiopathic PD. Recent evidence supports the hypothesis that an increase in LRRK2 kinase activity is associated with the development of not only familial LRRK2 PD, but also idiopathic PD. Previous reports have shown preclinical effects of LRRK2 modulation on α-synuclein-induced neuropathology. Increased subthalamic nucleus (STN) burst firing in preclinical neurotoxin models and PD patients is hypothesized to be causally involved in the development of the motor deficit in PD. To study a potential pathophysiological relationship between α-synuclein pathology and LRRK2 kinase activity in PD, we investigated the effect of chronic LRRK2 inhibition in an AAV-α-synuclein overexpression rat model. In this study, we report that chronic LRRK2 inhibition using PFE-360 only induced a marginal effect on motor function. In addition, the aberrant STN burst firing and associated neurodegenerative processes induced by α-synuclein overexpression model remained unaffected by chronic LRRK2 inhibition. Our findings do not strongly support LRRK2 inhibition for the treatment of PD. Therefore, the reported beneficial effects of LRRK2 inhibition in similar α-synuclein overexpression rodent models must be considered with prudence and additional studies are warranted in alternative α-synuclein-based models.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance statement&lt;/b&gt; Mutations in LRRK2 and α-synuclein are known risk factors for Parkinson’s disease. α-synuclein aggregates at autopsies in both idiopathic and most G2019S cases is suggestive of a common disease pathogenesis. LRRK2 and α-synuclein interaction is hypothesized to play a pivotal role in the pathological mechanisms. Preclinical &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; evidence of a beneficial effect of LRRK2 inhibition is mixed and limited. This study increases our understanding but underlines the complexity of LRRK2 as a mediator of neuronal dysfunction; importantly, the present findings further outline some of the limitations inherent to the PD model used, and warrant additional preclinical studies in animal models with better relevance to the clinical pathophysiology to draw conclusion on the therapeutic potential of LRRK2 modulation in PD.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;The role of neuro-inflammation in the mechanisms of epilepsy development is important because inflammatory mediators provide tractable targets for intervention. Inflammation is intrinsically involved in the generation of childhood febrile seizures (FS), and prolonged FS (febrile status epilepticus, FSE) precede a large proportion of adult temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). As TLE is often refractory to therapy and associated with serious cognitive and emotional problems, we investigated if its development can be prevented using anti-inflammatory strategies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Employing an immature rat model of FSE (eFSE), we administered dexamethasone (DEX), a broad anti-inflammatory agent, over three days following eFSE. We assessed eFSE-provoked hippocampal network hyperexcitability by quantifying the presence, frequency and duration of hippocampal spike series, as these precede and herald the development of TLE-like epilepsy. We tested whether eFSE provoked hippocampal microgliosis, astrocytosis and pro-inflammatory cytokine production in male and female rats and investigated blood-brain barrier (BBB) breaches as a potential contributor. We then evaluated if DEX attenuated these eFSE sequelae.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spike series were not observed in control rats given vehicle or DEX, but occurred in 41.6% of eFSE-Vehicle rats, associated with BBB leakage and elevated hippocampal cytokines. eFSE did not induce astrocytosis or microgliosis but provoked BBB disruption in 60% of animals. DEX significantly reduced spike-series prevalence (to 7.6%) and frequency, and abrogated eFSE-induced cytokine production and BBB leakage (to 20%).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These findings suggest that a short, post-insult intervention with a clinically available anti-inflammatory agent potently attenuates epilepsy-predicting hippocampal hyperexcitability, potentially by minimizing BBB disruption and related neuro-inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Epilepsy is the third most common brain disorder. Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) involves limbic circuits and commonly provokes serious cognitive and emotional problems. Because TLE is often refractory to therapy, its prevention would be a powerful and clinically important strategy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;To accurately detect, track progression of, and develop novel treatments for mental illnesses, a diagnostic framework is needed that is grounded in biological features. Here we present the case for utilizing personalized neuroimaging, computational modeling, standardized computing, and ecologically valid neuroimaging to anchor psychiatric nosology in biology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; There is a growing recognition that the boundaries of human neuroimaging data acquisition and analysis must be pushed to ground psychiatric diagnosis in biology. For successful clinical translations, we outline several proposals across the four identified domains of human neuroimaging, namely, (a) reliability of findings; (b) effective clinical translation at the individual subject level; (c) capturing mechanistic insights; and (d) enhancing ecological validity of lab findings. Advances across these domains will be necessary for further progress in psychiatric neuroimaging.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>RSS PAP: Functional dissociation of theta oscillations in the frontal and visual cortices and their long-range network during sustained attention</title>
	<link>http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0248-19.2019v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>ABSTRACT&lt;p&gt;Theta-band (4–12 Hz) activities in the frontal cortex have been thought to be a key mechanism of sustained attention and goal-related behaviors, forming a phase-coherent network with task-related sensory cortices for integrated neuronal ensembles. However, recent visual task studies found that selective attention attenuates stimulus-related theta power in the visual cortex, suggesting a functional dissociation of cortical theta oscillations. To investigate this contradictory behavior of cortical theta, a visual Go/No-Go task was performed with electroencephalogram recording in C57BL/6J mice. During the No-Go period, transient theta oscillations were observed in both the frontal and visual cortices, but theta oscillations of the two areas were prominent in different trial epochs. By separating trial epochs based on subjects’ short-term performance, we found that frontal theta was prominent in good-performance epochs, while visual theta was prominent in bad-performance epochs, exhibiting a functional dissociation of cortical theta rhythms. Furthermore, the two theta rhythms also showed a heterogeneous pattern of phase-amplitude coupling with fast oscillations, reflecting their distinct architecture in underlying neuronal circuitry. Interestingly, in good-performance epochs, where visual theta was relatively weak, stronger fronto-visual long-range synchrony and shorter posterior-to-anterior temporal delay were found. These findings highlight a previously overlooked aspect of long-range synchrony between distinct oscillatory entities in the cerebral cortex and provide empirical evidence of a functional dissociation of cortical theta rhythms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Previous literature emphasized the pro-cognitive role of coherent oscillatory networks between distal brain regions, such as the fronto-visual theta synchrony. However, such a conceptual framework has been challenged as recent findings revealed distinct behavioral correlates of theta oscillations found in different cortical regions, especially in the frontal and visual cortices. Here, we show that frontal and visual theta represent distinct cortical processes and that the functional connectivity between them increases during sustained attention, especially when one of the two theta rhythms is relatively suppressed. The data presented here highlight a novel aspect of neural long-range synchrony between distinct cortical oscillators with distinct functional significance in task performance.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>RSS PAP: Impaired reliability and precision of spiking in adults but not juveniles in a mouse model of Fragile X Syndrome</title>
	<link>http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0217-19.2019v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) is the most common source of intellectual disability and autism. Extensive studies have been performed on the network and behavioral correlates of the syndrome but our knowledge about intrinsic conductance changes is still limited. In this study we show a differential effect of FMRP Knock Out (KO) in different sub-sections of hippocampus using whole cell patch clamp in mouse hippocampal slices. We observed no significant change in spike numbers in the CA1 region of hippocampus but a significant increase in CA3, in juvenile mice. However, in adult mice we see a reduction in spike number in the CA1 with no significant difference in CA3. In addition, we see increased variability in spike number in CA1 cells following a variety of steady and modulated current step protocols. This effect emerges in adult (8 weeks) but not juvenile (4 weeks) mice. This increased spiking variability was correlated with reduced spike number and with elevated AHP. The increased AHP arose from elevated SK currents (small conductance calcium activated potassium channels) but other currents involved in mAHP, such as I&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt; and M, were not significantly different. We obtained a partial rescue of the cellular variability phenotype when we blocked SK current using the specific blocker apamin. Our observations provide a single cell correlate of the network observations of response variability and loss of synchronization, and suggest that elevation of SK currents in FXS may provide a partial mechanistic explanation for this difference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Fragile-X syndrome leads to a range of intellectual disability effects and autism. We have found differential effect of FMRP KO in different sub sections of hippocampus where it caused an increased spiking in CA3 in juveniles and reduced spiking in CA1, in adults. We have also found that even individual neurons with this mutation exhibit increased variability in their activity patterns. Importantly, this effect emerges after six weeks of age in mice. We showed that a specific ion channel protein, SK channel, was partially responsible, and blockage of these channels led to a partial restoration of cellular activity. This is interesting as it provides a possible molecular link between activity variability in single cells, and reported irregularity in network activity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25610?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) affects 1 in 59 children, yet except for rare genetic causes, the etiology in most ASD remains unknown. In the ASD brain, inflammatory cytokine and transcript profiling shows increased expression of genes encoding mediators of the innate immune response. We evaluated postmortem brain tissue for adaptive immune cells and immune cell–mediated cytotoxic damage that could drive this innate immune response in the ASD brain.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Standard neuropathology diagnostic methods including histology and immunohistochemistry were extended with automated image segmentation to quantify identified pathologic features in the postmortem brains.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We report multifocal perivascular lymphocytic cuffs contain increased numbers of lymphocytes in ~65% of ASD compared to control brains in males and females, across all ages, in most brain regions, and in white and gray matter, and leptomeninges. CD3&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T lymphocytes predominate over CD20&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; B lymphocytes and CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; over CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T lymphocytes in ASD brains. Importantly, the perivascular cuff lymphocyte numbers correlate to the quantity of astrocyte‐derived round membranous blebs. Membranous blebs form as a cytotoxic reaction to lymphocyte attack. Consistent with multifocal immune cell–mediated injury at perivascular cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)–brain barriers, a subset of white matter vessels have increased perivascular space (with jagged contours) and collagen in ASD compared to control brains. CSF–brain barrier pathology is also evident at cerebral cortex pial and ventricular ependymal surfaces in ASD.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings suggest dysregulated cellular immunity damages astrocytes at foci along the CSF–brain barrier in ASD. ANN NEUROL 2019&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Competing endogenous RNA crosstalk at system level</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/3lY_PVh3HUI/article</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Mattia Miotto, Enzo Marinari, Andrea De Martino&lt;/p&gt;

microRNAs (miRNAs) regulate gene expression at post-transcriptional level by repressing target RNA molecules. Competition to bind miRNAs tends in turn to correlate their targets, establishing effective RNA-RNA interactions that can influence expression levels, buffer fluctuations and promote signal propagation. Such a potential has been characterized mathematically for small motifs both at steady state and away from stationarity. Experimental evidence, on the other hand, suggests that competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) crosstalk is rather weak. Extended miRNA-RNA networks could however favour the integration of many crosstalk interactions, leading to significant large-scale effects in spite of the weakness of individual links. To clarify the extent to which crosstalk is sustained by the miRNA interactome, we have studied its emergent systemic features &lt;i&gt;in silico&lt;/i&gt; in large-scale miRNA-RNA network reconstructions. We show that, although generically weak, system-level crosstalk patterns (i) are enhanced by transcriptional heterogeneities, (ii) can achieve high-intensity even for RNAs that are not co-regulated, (iii) are robust to variability in transcription rates, and (iv) are significantly non-local, i.e. correlate weakly with miRNA-RNA interaction parameters. Furthermore, RNA levels are generically more stable when crosstalk is strongest. As some of these features appear to be encoded in the network’s topology, crosstalk may functionally be favoured by natural selection. These results suggest that, besides their repressive role, miRNAs mediate a weak but resilient and context-independent network of cross-regulatory interactions that interconnect the transcriptome, stabilize expression levels and support system-level responses.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/3lY_PVh3HUI&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: The TRPA1 Ion Channel Contributes to Sensory-Guided Avoidance of Menthol in Mice</title>
	<link>http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/6/6/ENEURO.0304-19.2019?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The flavoring agent menthol elicits complex orosensory and behavioral effects including perceived cooling at low concentrations and irritation and ingestive avoidance at higher intensities. Oral menthol engages the cold-activated transient receptor potential (TRP) ion channel TRP melastatin 8 (TRPM8) on trigeminal fibers, although its aversive feature was discussed to involve activation of TRP ankyrin 1 (TRPA1) associated with nociceptive processing. Here, we studied the roles of TRPM8 and TRPA1 in orosensory responding to menthol by subjecting mice gene deficient for either channel to brief-access exposure tests, which measure immediate licking responses to fluid stimuli to capture sensory/tongue control of behavior. Stimuli included aqueous concentration series of (–)-menthol [0 (water), 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 1.0, 1.5, and 2.3 mM] and the aversive bitter taste stimulus quinine-HCl (0, 0.01, 0.03, 0.1, 0.3, 1, and 3 mM). Concentration-response data were generated from daily brief-access tests conducted in lickometers, which recorded the number of licks water-restricted mice emitted to a randomly selected stimulus concentration over a block of several 10-s stimulus presentations. Wild-type mice showed aversive orosensory responses to menthol above 0.7 mM. Oral aversion to menthol was reduced in mice deficient for TRPA1 but not TRPM8. Oral aversion to quinine was similar between TRPA1 mutant and control mice but stronger than avoidance of menthol. This implied menthol avoidance under the present conditions represented a moderate form of oral aversion. These data reveal TRPA1 contributes to the oral sensory valence of menthol and have implications for how input from TRPA1 and TRPM8 shapes somatosensory-guided behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Differential Adaptation in Azimuth and Elevation to Acute Monaural Spatial Hearing after Training with Visual Feedback</title>
	<link>http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/6/6/ENEURO.0219-19.2019?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Sound localization in the horizontal plane (azimuth) relies mainly on binaural difference cues in sound level and arrival time. Blocking one ear will perturb these cues, and may strongly affect azimuth performance of the listener. However, single-sided deaf listeners, as well as acutely single-sided plugged normal-hearing subjects, often use a combination of (ambiguous) monaural head-shadow cues, impoverished binaural level-difference cues, and (veridical, but limited) pinna- and head-related spectral cues to estimate source azimuth. To what extent listeners can adjust the relative contributions of these different cues is unknown, as the mechanisms underlying adaptive processes to acute monauralization are still unclear. By providing visual feedback during a brief training session with a high-pass (HP) filtered sound at a fixed sound level, we investigated the ability of listeners to adapt to their erroneous sound-localization percepts. We show that acutely plugged listeners rapidly adjusted the relative contributions of perceived sound level, and the spectral and distorted binaural cues, to improve their localization performance in azimuth also for different sound levels and locations than those experienced during training. Interestingly, our results also show that this acute cue-reweighting led to poorer localization performance in elevation, which was in line with the acoustic–spatial information provided during training. We conclude that the human auditory system rapidly readjusts the weighting of all relevant localization cues, to adequately respond to the demands of the current acoustic environment, even if the adjustments may hamper veridical localization performance in the real world.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Mecp2 Deletion from Cholinergic Neurons Selectively Impairs Recognition Memory and Disrupts Cholinergic Modulation of the Perirhinal Cortex</title>
	<link>http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/6/6/ENEURO.0134-19.2019?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Rett Syndrome is a neurological disorder caused by mutations in the gene encoding methyl CpG binding protein 2 (MeCP2) and characterized by severe intellectual disability. The cholinergic system is a critical modulator of cognitive ability and is affected in patients with Rett Syndrome. To better understand the importance of MeCP2 function in cholinergic neurons, we studied the effect of selective &lt;i&gt;Mecp2&lt;/i&gt; deletion from cholinergic neurons in mice. Mice with &lt;i&gt;Mecp2&lt;/i&gt; deletion from cholinergic neurons were selectively impaired in assays of recognition memory, a cognitive task largely mediated by the perirhinal cortex (PRH). Deletion of &lt;i&gt;Mecp2&lt;/i&gt; from cholinergic neurons resulted in profound alterations in baseline firing of L5/6 neurons and eliminated the responses of these neurons to optogenetic stimulation of cholinergic input to PRH. Both the behavioral and the electrophysiological deficits of cholinergic &lt;i&gt;Mecp2&lt;/i&gt; deletion were rescued by inhibiting ACh breakdown with donepezil treatment.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: AMPA receptor plasticity sustains severe, fatal status epilepticus</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25635?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generalized convulsive status epilepticus is associated with high mortality. We tested whether AMPA receptor plasticity plays a role in sustaining seizures, seizure generalization, and mortality observed during focal onset status epilepticus. We also determined whether modified AMPA receptors generated during status epilepticus could be targeted with a drug.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Electrically induced status epilepticus was characterized by EEG and behavior in GluA1‐knockout mice and in transgenic mice with selective knockdown of the GluA1 subunit in hippocampal principal neurons. Excitatory and inhibitory synaptic transmission in CA1 neurons was studied using patch clamp electrophysiology. The dose response of IEM 1460, a calcium‐permeable AMPA receptor antagonist, was determined.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Global removal of the GluA1 subunit did not affect seizure susceptibility; however, it reduced susceptibility to status epilepticus. GluA1 subunit knockout also reduced mortality, severity, and duration of status epilepticus. Absence of the GluA1 subunit prevented enhancement of glutamatergic synaptic transmission associated with status epilepticus; however, GABAergic synaptic inhibition was compromised. Selective removal of the GluA1 subunit from hippocampal principal neurons also reduced mortality, severity, and duration of status epilepticus. IEM 1460 rapidly terminated status epilepticus in a dose‐dependent manner.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AMPA receptor plasticity mediated by the GluA1 subunit plays a critical role in sustaining and amplifying seizure activity and contributes to mortality. Calcium‐permeable AMPA receptors modified during status epilepticus can be inhibited to terminate status epilepticus.&lt;/p&gt;

We have previously shown morphometric alterations in large and small caliber myelinated fibers of nerves in the adult spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR). However, the functional correlation of these findings has not been explored. We performed an electrophysiological investigation of hind limb nerves in SHR of both genders in different ages. Normotensive Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats were used as controls. Electrophysiological recordings and determination of motor (MCV) and sensory (SCV) nerve conduction velocity were performed in the same animals at four different ages: 5, 8, 20 and 40 weeks after birth. Comparisons were made between ages, genders and animal strain. We showed a continuous body weight increase in adult life in all animals studied. MCV got stable at 20-week old hypertensive animals and continued to increase in normotensive ones. The SCV was constant between the ages of 20 and 40 weeks old in female SHR and decreased in male SHR while it continued to increase in WKY animals. The electrophysiological investigation of the nerves in WKY and SHR from both genders and different ages, associated with morphological and morphometric data from the literature suggest that hypertension affects the nerve function and might corroborate the development of a peripheral neuropathy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Multiple Functions of KBP in Neural Development Underlie Brain Anomalies in Goldberg-Shprintzen Syndrome</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2019.00265</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Kinesin-binding protein (KBP; KIF1BP; KIAA1279) functions as a regulator for a subset of kinesins, many of which play important roles in neural development. Previous studies have shown that KBP is expressed in nearly all tissue with cytoplasmic localization. Autosomal recessive mutations in KIAA1279 cause a rare neurological disorder, Goldberg-Shprintzen syndrome (GOSHS), characterized by microcephaly, polymicrogyria, intellectual disability, axonal neuropathy, thin corpus callosum and peripheral neuropathy. Most KIAA1279 mutations found in GOSHS patients are homozygous nonsense mutations that result in KBP loss-of-function. However, it is not fully understood how KBP dysfunction causes these defects. Here, we used in utero electroporation (IUE) to express KBP short hairpin RNA (shRNA) with green fluorescent protein (GFP) in neural progenitor cells of embryonic day (E) 14 mice, and collected brain slices at different developmental stages. By immunostaining of neuronal lineage markers, we found that KBP knockdown does not affect the neural differentiation process. However, at 4 days post IUE, many cells were located in the intermediate zone (IZ). Moreover, at postnatal day (P) 6, about one third of the cells, which have become mature neurons, remained ectopically in the white matter (WM), while cells that have reached Layer II/III of the cortex showed impaired dendritic outgrowth and axonal projection. We also found that KBP knockdown induces apoptosis during the postnatal period. Our findings indicate that loss of KBP function leads to defects in neuronal migration, morphogenesis, maturation, and survival, which may be responsible for brain phenotypes observed in GOSHS.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2019.00262</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The discovery that prion protein can misfold into a pathological conformation that encodes structural information capable of both propagation and inducing severe neuropathology has revolutionized our understanding of neurodegenerative disease. Many neurodegenerative diseases with a protein misfolding component are now classified as “prion-like” owing to the propagation of both symptoms and protein aggregation pathology in affected individuals. The neuromuscular disorder amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is characterized by protein inclusions formed by either TAR DNA-binding protein of 43 kDa (TDP-43), Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD1), or fused in sarcoma (FUS), in both upper and lower motor neurons. Evidence from in vitro, cell culture, and in vivo studies has provided strong evidence to support the involvement of a prion-like mechanism in ALS. In this article, we review the evidence suggesting that prion-like propagation of protein aggregation is a primary pathomechanism in ALS, focusing on the key proteins and genes involved in disease (TDP-43, SOD1, FUS, and C9orf72). In each case, we discuss the evidence ranging from biophysical studies to in vivo examinations of prion-like spreading. We suggest that the idiopathic nature of ALS may stem from its prion-like nature and that elucidation of the specific propagating protein assemblies is paramount to developing effective therapies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Multiple system atrophy (MSA) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease clinically characterized by parkinsonism and cerebellar ataxia, and pathologically by oligodendrocyte α-synuclein inclusions. Genetic variants of COQ2 are associated with an increased risk for MSA in certain populations. Also, deficits in the level of coenzyme Q&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; and its biosynthetic enzymes are associated with MSA. Here, we measured ATP levels and expression of biosynthetic enzymes for coenzyme Q&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;, including COQ2, in multiple regions of MSA and control brains. We found a reduction in ATP levels in disease-affected regions of MSA brain that associated with reduced expression of COQ2 and COQ7, supporting the concept that abnormalities in the biosynthesis of coenzyme Q&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; play an important role in the pathogenesis of MSA.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Cognitive control is essential for flexible, top-down, goal-directed behavior. Individuals with Internet gaming disorder (IGD) are characterized by impaired prefrontal cortex function and cognitive control. This results in an increase in stimulus-driven habitual behavior, particularly related to pathological gaming. In the present study, we investigated the electroencephalographic (EEG) activity in individuals with IGD. Twenty-four individuals with IGD and 35 healthy control (HC) subjects were recruited. We analyzed their EEG activity while the subjects played their favorite game (30–40 min duration). We compared the band power between the two groups. During gaming, the left frontal theta, alpha, and beta band activities were lower in subjects with IGD than in HCs. Moreover, the left frontal theta power negatively correlated with IGD severity. These results indicate that left frontal theta power could be used as a neurophysiological biomarker for the detection of diminished cognitive control patterns in individuals with IGD.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.01148</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The utility of premovement electroencephalography (EEG) for decoding movement intention during a reaching task has been demonstrated. However, the kind of information the brain represents regarding the intended target during movement preparation remains unknown. In the present study, we investigated which movement parameters (i.e., direction, distance, and positions for reaching) can be decoded in premovement EEG decoding. Eight participants performed 30 types of reaching movements that consisted of 1 of 24 movement directions, 7 movement distances, 5 horizontal target positions, and 5 vertical target positions. Event-related spectral perturbations were extracted using independent components, some of which were selected via an analysis of variance for further binary classification analysis using a support vector machine. When each parameter was used for class labeling, all possible binary classifications were performed. Classification accuracies for direction and distance were significantly higher than chance level, although no significant differences were observed for position. For the classification in which each movement was considered as a different class, the parameters comprising two vectors representing each movement were analyzed. In this case, classification accuracies were high when differences in distance were high, the sum of distances was high, angular differences were large, and differences in the target positions were high. The findings further revealed that direction and distance may provide the largest contributions to movement. In addition, regardless of the parameter, useful features for classification are easily found over the parietal and occipital areas.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Neurodegeneration section | New and Recent Articles: Impairment of Membrane Repolarization Accompanies Axon Transport Deficits in Glaucoma</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.01139</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Glaucoma is a leading cause of blindness worldwide, resulting from degeneration of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), which form the optic nerve. In glaucoma, axon transport deficits appear to precede structural degeneration of RGC axons. The period of time between the onset of axon transport deficits and the structural degeneration of RGC axons may represent a therapeutic window for the prevention of irreversible vision loss. However, it is unclear how deficits in axon transport relate to the electrophysiological capacity of RGCs to produce and maintain firing frequencies that encode visual stimuli. Here, we examined the electrophysiological signature of individual RGCs in glaucomatous retina with respect to axon transport facility. Utilizing the Microbead Occlusion Model of murine ocular hypertension, we performed electrophysiological recordings of RGCs with and without deficits in anterograde axon transport. We found that RGCs with deficits in axon transport have a reduced ability to maintain spiking frequency that arises from elongation of the repolarization phase of the action potential. This repolarization phenotype arises from reduced cation flux and K+ dyshomeostasis that accompanies pressure-induced decreases in Na/K-ATPase expression and activity. In vitro studies with purified RGCs indicate that elevated pressure induces early internalization of Na/K-ATPase that, when reversed, stabilizes cation flux and prevents K+ dyshomeostasis. Furthermore, pharmacological inhibition of the Na/K-ATPase is sufficient to replicate pressure-induced cation influx and repolarization phase phenotypes in healthy RGCs. These studies suggest that deficits in axon transport also likely reflect impaired electrophysiological function of RGCs. Our findings further identify a failure to maintain electrochemical gradients and cation dyshomeostasis as an early phenotype of glaucomatous pathology in RGCs that may have significant bearing on efforts to restore RGC health in diseased retina.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.01124</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;α-Synuclein (α-Syn) forms pathological amyloid aggregates deposited in Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites in the brain of Parkinson’s disease (PD) patients. Heat shock proteins (Hsps) are the major components of the cellular chaperone network, which are responsible for preventing proteins from amyloid aggregation. Different Hsps were reported to interact with α-syn. However, the underlying mechanism of the interplay between α-syn and different Hsps remains unclear. Here, by combing NMR spectroscopy, electron microscope and other biochemical approaches, we systemically investigated the interaction between α-syn and three Hsps from different families including Hsp27, HDJ1, and Hsp104. We found that all three Hsps can weakly bind to α-syn and inhibit it from amyloid aggregation. Intriguingly, different Hsps recognize distinct regions of α-syn monomer, and act synergistically in chaperoning α-syn from fibril formation in sub-stoichiometry. Our results revealed the diverse binding mechanisms employed by different Hsps to tackle α-syn, and suggested that different Hsps form a network for cooperatively chaperoning α-syn from pathological aggregation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Coupling Robot-Aided Assessment and Surface Electromyography (sEMG) to Evaluate the Effect of Muscle Fatigue on Wrist Position Sense in the Flexion-Extension Plane</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2019.00396</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Proprioception is a crucial sensory modality involved in the control and regulation of coordinated movements and in motor learning. However, the extent to which proprioceptive acuity is influenced by local muscle fatigue is obscured by methodological differences in proprioceptive and fatiguing protocols. In this study, we used high resolution kinematic measurements provided by a robotic device, as well as both frequency and time domain analysis of signals captured via surface electromyography (sEMG) to examine the effects of local muscle fatigue on wrist proprioceptive acuity in 16 physically and neurologically healthy young adults. To this end, participants performed a flexion/extension ipsilateral joint position matching test (JPM), after which a high-resistive robotic task was used to induce muscle fatigue of the flexor carpi radialis (FCR) muscle. The JPM test was then repeated in order to analyze potential changes in proprioceptive acuity. Results indicated that the fatigue protocol had a significant effect on movements performed in flexion direction, with participants exhibiting a tendency to undershoot the target before the fatigue protocol (−1.218°), but overshooting after the fatigue protocol (0.587°). In contrast, in the extension direction error bias values were similar before and after the fatigue protocol as expected (pre = −1.852°, post = −1.237°) and reflected a tendency to undershoot the target. Moreover, statistical analysis indicated that movement variability was not influenced by the fatigue protocol or movement direction. In sum, results of the present study demonstrate that an individual’s estimation of wrist joint displacement (i.e., error bias), but not precision (i.e., variability), is affected by muscular fatigue in a sample of neurologically and physically healthy adults.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2019.00382</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Numerous cognitive studies have demonstrated experience-induced plasticity in the primary sensory cortex, indicating that repeated decisions could modulate sensory processing. In this context, we investigated whether an auditory version of the monetary incentive delay (MID) task could change the neural processing of the incentive cues that code expected monetary outcomes. To study sensory plasticity, we presented the incentive cues as deviants during oddball sessions recorded before and after training in the two MID task sessions. We found that after 2 days of training in the MID task, incentive cues evoked a larger P3a (compared with the baseline condition), indicating there was an enhancement of the involuntary attention to the stimuli that predict rewards. At the individual level, the training-induced change of mismatch-related negativity was correlated with the amplitude of the feedback-related negativity (FRN) recorded during the first MID task session. Our results show that the MID task evokes plasticity changes in the auditory system associated with better passive discrimination of incentive cues and with enhanced involuntary attention switching towards these cues. Thus, the sensory processing of incentive cues is dynamically modulated by previous outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In the mouse whisker system, the contribution of L6 corticothalamic cells (L6 CT) to cortical and thalamic processing of the whisker deflection direction was investigated. A genetically defined population of L6 CT cells project to infragranular GABAergic interneurons that hyperpolarize neurons in somatosensory barrel cortex (BC). Optogenetic activation of these neurons switched BC to an adapted mode in which excitatory cells lost their angular tuning. In contrast, however, this was not the case with a general activation of inhibitory interneurons via optogenetic activation of Gad2-expressing cells. The decrease in angular tuning, when L6 CT cells were activated, was due to changes in cortical inhibition, and not inherited from changes in the thalamic output. Furthermore, L6 CT driven cortical inhibition, but not the general activation of GABAergic interneurons, abolished adaptation to whisker responses. In the present study, evidence is presented that a subpopulation of L6 CT activates a specific circuit of GABAergic interneurons that will predispose neocortex toward processing of tactile information requiring multiple whisker touches, such as in a texture discrimination task.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Neural correlates of working memory (WM) training remain a matter of debate, especially in older adults. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) together with an n-back task to measure brain plasticity in healthy middle-aged adults following an 8-week adaptive online verbal WM training. Participants performed 32 sessions of this training on their personal computers. In addition, we assessed direct effects of the training by applying a verbal WM task before and after the training. Participants (mean age 55.85 ± 4.24 years) were pseudo-randomly assigned to the experimental group (n = 30) or an active control group (n = 27). Training resulted in an activity decrease in regions known to be involved in verbal WM (i.e., fronto-parieto-cerebellar circuitry and subcortical regions), indicating that the brain became potentially more efficient after the training. These activation decreases were associated with a significant performance improvement in the n-back task inside the scanner reflecting considerable practice effects. In addition, there were training-associated direct effects in the additional, external verbal WM task (i.e., HAWIE-R digit span forward task), and indicating that the training generally improved performance in this cognitive domain. These results led us to conclude that even at advanced age cognitive training can improve WM capacity and increase neural efficiency in specific regions or networks.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Bee Venom Soluble Phospholipase A2 Exerts Neuroprotective Effects in a Lipopolysaccharide-Induced Mouse Model of Alzheimer’s Disease via Inhibition of Nuclear Factor-Kappa B</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2019.00287</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Neuroinflammation is important in the pathogenesis and development of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). In the AD brain, microglial activation and upregulation of pro-inflammatory mediators both induce amyloid beta (Aβ) accumulation. Regulatory T cells (Tregs) and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) signaling have been implicated in AD development through their effects on neuroinflammation and microglial activation. The bee venom soluble phospholipase A2 (bv-sPLA2) enzyme is known to exert anti-inflammatory and anti-immune effects. Here, we investigated the inhibitory effects of bv-sPLA2 on memory deficiency in a lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced mouse model of AD. We examined whether bv-sPLA2 (0.02, 0.2, and 2 mg/kg by i.p. injection three times for 1 week) could inhibit neuroinflammation and memory impairment in LPS-treated mice (250 μg/kg by i.p. injection daily for 1 week). We also assessed the effects of bv-sPLA2 administration (0.01, 0.1, and 1 μg/ml) on LPS (1 μg/ml)-treated microglial BV-2 cells. In the LPS-injected mouse brain, sPLA2 treatment rescued memory dysfunction and decreased Aβ levels, through the downregulation of amyloidogenic proteins, and decreased the expression of inflammatory proteins and pro-inflammatory cytokines. Moreover, the LPS-mediated increase in inflammatory protein expression was attenuated bv-sPLA2 treatment in BV-2 cells. Treatment with bv-sPLA2 also downregulated signaling by NF-κB, which is considered to be an important factor in the regulation of neuroinflammatory and amyloidogenic responses, both in vivo and in vitro. Additionally, co-treatment with NF-κB (5 μM) and bv-sPLA2 (0.1 μg/ml) exerted more marked anti-inflammatory effects, compared to bv-sPLA2 treatment alone. These results indicate that bv-sPLA2 inhibits LPS-induced neuroinflammation and amyloidogenesis via inhibition of NF-κB.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

In many areas of the brain, both spontaneous and stimulus-evoked activity can manifest as synchronous activation of neuronal assemblies. The characterization of assembly structure and dynamics provides important insights into how brain computations are distributed across neural networks. The proliferation of experimental techniques for recording the activity of neuronal assemblies calls for a comprehensive statistical method to describe, analyze and characterize these high dimensional datasets. The performance of existing methods for defining assemblies is sensitive to noise and stochasticity in neuronal firing patterns and assembly heterogeneity. To address these problems, we introduce a generative hierarchical model of synchronous activity to describe the organization of neurons into assemblies. Unlike existing methods, our analysis provides a simultaneous estimation of assembly composition, dynamics and within-assembly statistical features, such as the levels of activity, noise and assembly synchrony. We have used our method to characterize population activity throughout the tectum of larval zebrafish, allowing us to make statistical inference on the spatiotemporal organization of tectal assemblies, their composition and the logic of their interactions. We have also applied our method to functional imaging and neuropixels recordings from the mouse, allowing us to relate the activity of identified assemblies to specific behaviours such as running or changes in pupil diameter.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/0_IJrY49Zz8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: Antiepileptic Drugs and Suicide: Role of Prior Suicidal Behavior and Parental Psychiatric Disorder</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25623?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To examine whether prior suicidal behavior and familial predisposition to psychiatric disorders modify the association between antiepileptic drug use and completed suicide.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using the Danish National Prescription Register, we identified all incident users of antiepileptic drugs aged 15 years or older in Denmark between July 1997 and December 2015. We carried out a nested case–control study and defined exposure to antiepileptic drugs at the index date (ie, time of suicide). Conditional logistic regressions were used to estimate mortality rate ratios (MRRs) of suicide in current versus previous users of antiepileptic drugs. We also analyzed suicide risk associated with the 9 most commonly used antiepileptic drugs.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We identified 1,759 individuals completing suicide. Current versus previous use of any antiepileptic drug was associated with an increased risk of suicide (MRR = 1.26, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.13–1.40). This excess risk was observed in individuals with a history of suicidal behavior (MRR = 1.28, 95% CI = 1.07–1.54) and in those without (MRR = 1.26, 95% CI = 1.11–1.43), and in individuals with a familial predisposition to psychiatric disorders (MRR = 1.48, 95% CI = 1.18–1.87) and in those without (MRR = 1.21, 95% CI = 1.07–1.35).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use of antiepileptic drugs was associated with an increased risk of suicide. The findings do not support that the risk of suicide following treatment with antiepileptic drugs identified in randomized trials is explained by prior suicidality or familial predisposition to psychiatric disorders. The additional risk of suicide associated with use of antiepileptic drugs was generally low and should be balanced against benefits of treatment. ANN NEUROL 2019&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

In the hippocampus, Ca&lt;sup&gt;++&lt;/sup&gt; transient produced by glutamatergic ionotropic neurotransmission facilitates Ca&lt;sup&gt;++&lt;/sup&gt;-Calmodulin-dependent kinase 2 (CaMKII) Thr286 phosphorylation and promote long-term potentiation (LTP) expression. At CA1 post-synaptic densities, Ca&lt;sup&gt;++&lt;/sup&gt; transients equally activate small conductance (SK2) channel which regulates excitability by suppressing Ca&lt;sup&gt;++&lt;/sup&gt; movement. Here, we demonstrate that upstream attenuation of GluN1 function in the hippocampus led to a decrease in Thr286 CaMKIIα phosphorylation, and increased SK2 expression. Consistent with the loss of GluN1 function, potentiation of SK channel in wild type hippocampus reduced CaMKIIα expression and abrogate synaptic localization of T286 pCaMKIIα. Our results demonstrate that positive modulation of SK channel at hippocampal synapses likely refine GluN1-linked plasticity by tuning dendritic localization of CaMKIIα.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Integrative Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Generalization of Object Localization From Whiskers to Other Body Parts in Freely Moving Rats</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnint.2019.00064</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Rats can be trained to associate relative spatial locations of objects with the spatial location of rewards. Here we ask whether rats can localize static silent objects with other body parts in the dark, and if so with what resolution. We addressed these questions in trained rats, whose interactions with the objects were tracked at high-resolution before and after whisker trimming. We found that rats can use other body parts, such as trunk and ears, to localize objects. Localization resolution with non-whisking body parts (henceforth, ‘body’) was poorer than that obtained with whiskers, even when left with a single whisker at each side. Part of the superiority of whiskers was obtained via the use of multiple contacts. Transfer from whisker to body localization occurred within one session, provided that body contacts with the objects occurred before whisker trimming, or in the next session otherwise. This transfer occurred whether temporal cues were used for discrimination or when discrimination was based on spatial cues alone. Rats’ decision in each trial was based on the sensory cues acquired in that trial and on decisions and reward locations in previous trials. When sensory cues were acquired by body contacts, rat decisions relied more on the reward location in previous trials. Overall, the results suggest that rats can generalize the idea of relative object location across different body parts, while preferring to rely on whiskers-based localization, which occurs earlier and conveys higher resolution.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.01174</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs), such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Parkinson’s disease (PD), Huntington’s disease (HD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and frontotemporal dementia (FTD), are devastating age-associated brain disorders. Significant efforts have been made to uncover the molecular and cellular pathogenic mechanisms that underlie NDDs. However, our understanding of the neural circuit mechanisms that mediate NDDs and associated symptomatic features have been hindered by technological limitations. Our inability to identify and track individual neurons longitudinally in subcortical brain regions that are preferentially targeted in NDDs has left gaping holes in our knowledge of NDDs. Recent development and advancement of the miniature fluorescence microscope (miniscope) has opened up new avenues for examining spatially and temporally coordinated activity from hundreds of cells in deep brain structures in freely moving rodents. In the present mini-review, we examine the capabilities of current and future miniscope tools and discuss the innovative applications of miniscope imaging techniques that can push the boundaries of our understanding of neural circuit mechanisms of NDDs into new territories.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fninf.2019.00068</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Neurons perform computations by integrating inputs from thousands of synapses—mostly in the dendritic tree—to drive action potential firing in the axon. One fruitful approach to studying this process is to record from neurons using patch-clamp electrodes, fill the recorded neurons with a substance that allows subsequent staining, reconstruct the three-dimensional architectures of the dendrites, and use the resulting functional and structural data to develop computer models of dendritic integration. Accurately producing quantitative reconstructions of dendrites is typically a tedious process taking many hours of manual inspection and measurement. Here we present ShuTu, a new software package that facilitates accurate and efficient reconstruction of dendrites imaged using bright-field microscopy. The program operates in two steps: (1) automated identification of dendritic processes, and (2) manual correction of errors in the automated reconstruction. This approach allows neurons with complex dendritic morphologies to be reconstructed rapidly and efficiently, thus facilitating the use of computer models to study dendritic structure-function relationships and the computations performed by single neurons.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: The Easy Part of the Hard Problem: A Resonance Theory of Consciousness</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2019.00378</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Synchronization, harmonization, vibrations, or simply resonance in its most general sense seems to have an integral relationship with consciousness itself. One of the possible “neural correlates of consciousness” in mammalian brains is a specific combination of gamma, beta and theta electrical synchrony. More broadly, we see similar kinds of resonance patterns in living and non-living structures of many types. What clues can resonance provide about the nature of consciousness more generally? This paper provides an overview of resonating structures in the fields of neuroscience, biology and physics and offers a possible solution to what we see as the “easy part” of the “Hard Problem” of consciousness, which is generally known as the “combination problem.” The combination problem asks: how do micro-conscious entities combine into a higher-level macro-consciousness? The proposed solution in the context of mammalian consciousness suggests that a shared resonance is what allows different parts of the brain to achieve a phase transition in the speed and bandwidth of information flows between the constituent parts. This phase transition allows for richer varieties of consciousness to arise, with the character and content of that consciousness in each moment determined by the particular set of constituent neurons. We also offer more general insights into the ontology of consciousness and suggest that consciousness manifests as a continuum of increasing richness in all physical processes, distinguishing our view from emergentist materialism. We refer to this approach, a meta-synthesis, as a (general) resonance theory of consciousness. We offer some suggestions for testing the theory.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Extracting Reproducible Time-Resolved Resting State Networks Using Dynamic Mode Decomposition</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2019.00075</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Resting state networks (RSNs) extracted from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scans are believed to reflect the intrinsic organization and network structure of brain regions. Most traditional methods for computing RSNs typically assume these functional networks are static throughout the duration of a scan lasting 5–15 min. However, they are known to vary on timescales ranging from seconds to years; in addition, the dynamic properties of RSNs are affected in a wide variety of neurological disorders. Recently, there has been a proliferation of methods for characterizing RSN dynamics, yet it remains a challenge to extract reproducible time-resolved networks. In this paper, we develop a novel method based on dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) to extract networks from short windows of noisy, high-dimensional fMRI data, allowing RSNs from single scans to be resolved robustly at a temporal resolution of seconds. After validating the method on a synthetic dataset, we analyze data from 120 individuals from the Human Connectome Project and show that unsupervised clustering of DMD modes discovers RSNs at both the group (gDMD) and the single subject (sDMD) levels. The gDMD modes closely resemble canonical RSNs. Compared to established methods, sDMD modes capture individualized RSN structure that both better resembles the population RSN and better captures subject-level variation. We further leverage this time-resolved sDMD analysis to infer occupancy and transitions among RSNs with high reproducibility. This automated DMD-based method is a powerful tool to characterize spatial and temporal structures of RSNs in individual subjects.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: Low‐Frequency Brain Oscillations Track Motor Recovery in Human Stroke</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25615?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The majority of patients with stroke survive the acute episode and live with enduring disability. Effective therapies to support recovery of motor function after stroke are yet to be developed. Key to this development is the identification of neurophysiologic signals that mark recovery and are suitable and susceptible to interventional therapies. Movement preparatory low‐frequency oscillations (LFOs) play a key role in cortical control of movement. Recent animal data point to a mechanistic role of motor cortical LFOs in stroke motor deficits and demonstrate neuromodulation intervention with therapeutic benefit. Their relevance in human stroke pathophysiology is unknown.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We studied the relationship between movement‐preparatory LFOs during the performance of a visuomotor grip task and motor function in a longitudinal (&amp;lt;5 days, 1 and 3 months) cohort study of 33 patients with motor stroke and in 19 healthy volunteers.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acute stroke–lesioned brains fail to generate the LFO signal. Whereas in healthy humans, a transient occurrence of LFOs preceded movement onset at predominantly contralateral frontoparietal motor regions, recordings in patients revealed that movement‐preparatory LFOs were substantially diminished to a level of 38% after acute stroke. LFOs progressively increased at 1 and 3 months. This re‐emergence closely tracked the recovery of motor function across several movement qualities including grip strength, fine motor skills, and synergies and was frequency band specific.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our results provide the first human evidence for a link between movement‐preparatory LFOs and functional recovery after stroke, promoting their relevance for movement control. These results suggest that it may be interesting to explore targeted, LFOs‐restorative brain stimulation therapy in human stroke patients. ANN NEUROL 2019&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25618?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Holmes tremor is a debilitating movement disorder with limited treatment options. Lesions causing Holmes tremor can occur in multiple different brain locations, leaving the neuroanatomical substrate unclear. Here, we test whether lesion locations that cause Holmes tremor map to a connected brain circuit and whether this circuit might serve as a useful therapeutic target.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Case reports of Holmes tremor caused by focal brain lesions were identified through a systematic literature search. Connectivity between each lesion location and the rest of the brain was computed using resting state functional connectivity magnetic resonance imaging data from 1,000 healthy volunteers. Commonalities across lesion locations were identified. This Holmes tremor circuit was then compared to neurosurgical treatment targets and clinical efficacy.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We identified 36 lesions causing Holmes tremor, which were scattered across multiple different brain regions. However, all lesion locations were connected to a common brain circuit with nodes in the red nucleus, thalamus, globus pallidus, and cerebellum. In cases with effective neurosurgical treatment, the treatment target was connected with the lesion location, indicating that a second hit to the same circuit might be beneficial. Commonly used deep brain stimulation targets such as the ventral intermediate nucleus and subthalamic nucleus fell outside our Holmes tremor circuit, whereas the globus pallidus target was close, consistent with published clinical response rates for these targets.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lesions causing Holmes tremor are part of a single connected brain circuit that may serve as an improved therapeutic target. ANN NEUROL 2019&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Here we review advances in theory and experiments that highlight how noise correlations are implicated in perceptual processes. We focus on the structure of correlations and variations in it to reveal the computations performed by the cortex. We argue that to discover the functional role of correlations in cortical computations, and make predictions about them, we need to harness hierarchical encoding models. We propose that in hierarchical models the source of noise correlations is dual: inference of both task-related and higher-level perceptual variables contribute to their emergence, which is reflected in the task- and stimulus-dependence of the correlation structure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded>

With recent advances in recording techniques, the inner working of these populations has come into full view. Analyzing the resulting large-scale data sets is challenging because of the often complex and ‘mixed’ dependency of neural activities on experimental parameters, such as stimuli, decisions, or motor responses. Here we review recent insights gained from analyzing these data with dimensionality reduction methods that ‘demix’ these dependencies. We demonstrate that the mappings from (carefully chosen) experimental parameters to population activities appear to be typical and stable across tasks, brain areas, and animals, and are often identifiable by linear methods. By considering when and why dimensionality reduction and demixing work well, we argue for a view of population coding in which populations represent (demixed) latent signals, corresponding to stimuli, decisions, motor responses, and so on. These latent signals are encoded into neural population activity via non-linear mappings and decoded via linear readouts. We explain how such a scheme can facilitate the propagation of information across cortical areas, and we review neural network architectures that can reproduce the encoding and decoding of latent signals in population activities. These architectures promise a link from the biophysics of single neurons to the activities of neural populations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded>

When incorporated into reinforcement-based machine learning algorithms, visual novelty can act as an intrinsic reward signal that vastly increases the efficiency of exploration and expedites learning, particularly in situations where external rewards are difficult to obtain. Here we review parallels between recent developments in novelty-driven machine learning algorithms and our understanding of how visual novelty is computed and signaled in the primate brain. We propose that in the visual system, novelty representations are not configured with the principal goal of detecting novel objects, but rather with the broader goal of flexibly generalizing novelty information across different states in the service of driving novelty-based learning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded>

The two domains have been typically treated in complete separation both in terms of the underlying computational mechanisms and the brain areas and processes implementing those computations. However, a number of recent findings in both domains call in question this strict separation. We interpret classical and more recent results in the general framework of probabilistic computation, provide a unifying view of how various aspects of the two domains are interlinked, and suggest how the probabilistic approach can also alleviate the problem of dealing with widely different types of neural correlates of learning. Finally, we outline several directions along which our proposed approach fosters new types of experiments that can promote investigations of natural learning in humans and other species.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded>

Classical approaches that investigate our ability to extract the principles of organisation that govern complex environments focus on reward-based learning. Yet, the human brain is shown to be expert at learning generative structure based on mere exposure and without explicit reward. Individuals are shown to adapt to–unbeknownst to them–changes in the environment’s temporal statistics and predict future events. Further, we present evidence for a common brain architecture for unsupervised structure learning and reward-based learning, suggesting that the brain is built on the premise that ‘learning is its own reward’ to support adaptive behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded>

Analysis of complex dynamical systems is also at the heart of control engineering, where it is central to the design of robust control strategies. Although a rich engineering literature has grown over decades to facilitate the analysis of such systems, little of it has percolated into neuroscience so far. Here, we give a brief introduction to a number of core control-theoretic concepts that provide useful perspectives on neural circuit dynamics. We introduce important mathematical tools related to these concepts, and establish connections to neural circuit analysis, focusing on a number of themes that have arisen from the modern ‘state-space’ view on neural population dynamics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded>

Recent work has highlighted this state-dependent functional flexibility of cortical circuits and provided initial insights into underlying circuit-level mechanisms. Transitions from quiescent to aroused or task-engaged behavioral states are associated with common motifs of network activity, including changes in correlations and enhanced sensory encoding. Evidence points to a key role for selective activation of specific GABAergic interneuron populations in mediating mode-switching in cortical networks. Finally, inhibitory interneurons may function as a critical target for convergent state-dependent neuromodulatory sculpting of cortical circuits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded>

Recent experiments reveal that neuronal representations of learned sensorimotor tasks continually change over days and weeks, even after animals have achieved expert behavioral performance. How is learned information stored to allow consistent behavior despite ongoing changes in neuronal activity? What functions could ongoing reconfiguration serve? We highlight recent experimental evidence for such representational drift in sensorimotor systems, and discuss how this fits into a framework of distributed population codes. We identify recent theoretical work that suggests computational roles for drift and argue that the recurrent and distributed nature of sensorimotor representations permits drift while limiting disruptive effects. We propose that representational drift may create error signals between interconnected brain regions that can be used to keep neural codes consistent in the presence of continual change. These concepts suggest experimental and theoretical approaches to studying both learning and maintenance of distributed and adaptive population codes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded>

In models, the critical state offers a number of computational advantages. Thus this hypothesis, and in particular the experimental work by Beggs and Plenz (2003), has triggered an avalanche of research, with thousands of studies referring to it. Nonetheless, experimental results are still contradictory. How is it possible, that a hypothesis has attracted active research for decades, but nonetheless remains controversial? We discuss the experimental and conceptual controversy, and then present a parsimonious solution that (i) unifies the contradictory experimental results, (ii) avoids disadvantages of a critical state, and (iii) enables rapid, adaptive tuning of network properties to task requirements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded>

Here, we review emerging conceptual and technological advances that begin to address this challenge, garnering insights from both biological and artificial neural networks. We argue that neural data should be recorded during rich behavioral tasks, to model cognitive processes and estimate latent behavioral variables. Careful quantification of animal movements can also provide a more complete picture of how movements shape neural dynamics and reflect changes in brain state, such as arousal or stress. Artificial neural networks (ANNs) could serve as artificial model organisms to connect neural dynamics and rich behavioral data. ANNs have already begun to reveal how a wide range of different behaviors can be implemented, generating hypotheses about how observed neural activity might drive behavior and explaining diversity in behavioral strategies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded>

Traditional theories of object recognition have focused on how crucial form features, for example, the orientation of edges, may be extracted in early visual cortex and utilized to recognize objects. An alternative view argues that much of early and mid-level visual processing focuses on encoding surface characteristics, for example, texture. Neurophysiological evidence from primate area V4 supports a third alternative — the joint, but independent, encoding of form and texture — that would be advantageous for segmenting objects from the background in natural scenes and for object recognition that is independent of surface texture. Future studies that leverage deep convolutional network models, especially focusing on network failures to match biology and behavior, can advance our insights into how such a joint representation of form and surface properties might emerge in visual cortex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded>

While the implied existence of a one-to-one mapping between external referents and neural firing has been useful, the prevalence of adaptation challenges this. Adaptation provides neural responses with dynamics on timescales that range from milliseconds up to many seconds. These timescales are highly relevant for sensory experience in the natural world, in which local statistical properties of inputs change continuously, and are additionally altered by active sensing. Adaptation has a number of consequences for coding: it creates short-term history dependence; it engenders complex feature selectivity that is time-varying; and it can serve to enhance information representation in dynamic environments. Considering how to best incorporate adaptation into neural models exposes a fundamental dichotomy in approaches to the description of neural systems: ones that take an explicitly ‘coding’ perspective versus ones that describe the system’s dynamics. Here we discuss the pros and cons of different approaches to the modeling of adaptive dynamics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded>

At the macro scale, neuroimaging modalities measure global activity fluctuations organized into spatiotemporal patterns across the entire brain. Here we review recent advances linking the local and global scales of cortical dynamics and their relationship to behavior.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Anxiety and depression are major public health concerns worldwide. Although genome-wide association studies have identified several genes robustly associated with susceptibility for these disorders, the molecular and cellular mechanisms associated with anxiety and depression is largely unknown. Reduction of microRNA-137 (miR-137) level has been implicated in the etiology of major depressive disorder. However, little is known about the in vivo impact of the loss of miR-137 on the biology of anxiety and depression. Here, we generated a forebrain-specific miR-137 knockout mouse line, and showed that miR-137 is critical for dendritic and synaptic growth in the forebrain. Mice with miR-137 loss-of-function exhibit anxiety-like behavior, and impaired spatial learning and memory. We then observe an elevated expression of EZH2 in the forebrain of miR-137 knockout mice, and provide direct evidence that knockdown of EZH2 can rescue anxious phenotypes associated with the loss of miR-137. Together our results suggest that loss of miR-137 contributes to the etiology of anxiety, and EZH2 might be a potential therapeutic target for anxiety and depressive phenotypes associated with the dysfunction of miR-137.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2019.00259</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Retinoic acid (RA) is the active metabolite of vitamin A but is also used as a medication, primarily for acne in which the treatment regime lasts several months. A number of studies have indicated that treatment with RA over this time period impacts the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and may contribute to a number of the side-effects of the drug. No studies though have investigated the short-term, early effects RA may have on the HPA axis via the transcriptional pathways activated by the RA receptor. This study investigated the action of RA over 3 days on regulatory components of the HPA axis. Several key genes involved in glucocorticoid feedback pathways in the hippocampus, hypothalamus and pituitary were unchanged after 3-days exposure to RA. Key elements though in the adrenal gland involved in corticosterone and aldosterone synthesis were altered in particular with the Cyp11b2 gene downregulated in vivo and ex vivo. The rapid, 5 h, change in Cyp11b2 expression suggested this activation may be direct. These results highlight the adrenal gland as a target of short-term action of RA and potentially a trigger component in the mechanisms by which the long-term adverse effects of RA treatment occur.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnint.2019.00057</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Epilepsy is associated with numerous neurodevelopmental disorders. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) of the motor cortex coupled with electromyography (EMG) enables biomarkers that provide measures of cortical excitation and inhibition that are particularly relevant to epilepsy and related disorders. The motor threshold (MT), cortical silent period (CSP), short interval intracortical inhibition (SICI), intracortical facilitation (ICF), and long interval intracortical inhibition (LICI) are among TMS-derived metrics that are modulated by antiepileptic drugs. TMS may have a practical role in optimization of antiepileptic medication regimens, as studies demonstrate dose-dependent relationships between TMS metrics and acute medication administration. A close association between seizure freedom and normalization of cortical excitability with long-term antiepileptic drug use highlights a plausible utility of TMS in measures of anti-epileptic drug efficacy. Finally, TMS-derived biomarkers distinguish patients with various epilepsies from healthy controls and thus may enable development of disorder-specific biomarkers and therapies both within and outside of the epilepsy realm.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Neural Technology section | New and Recent Articles: Accelerated Intermittent Theta-Burst Stimulation as a Treatment for Cocaine Use Disorder: A Proof-of-Concept Study</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.01147</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;There are no effective treatments for cocaine use disorder (CUD), a chronic, relapsing brain disease characterized by dysregulated circuits related to cue reactivity, reward processing, response inhibition, and executive control. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) has the potential to modulate circuits and networks implicated in neuropsychiatric disorders, including addiction. Although acute applications of TMS have reduced craving in urine-negative cocaine users, the tolerability and safety of administering accelerated TMS to cocaine-positive individuals is unknown. As such, we performed a proof-of-concept study employing an intermittent theta-burst stimulation (iTBS) protocol in an actively cocaine-using sample. Although our main goal was to assess the tolerability and safety of administering three iTBS sessions daily, we also hypothesized that iTBS would reduce cocaine use in this non-treatment seeking cohort. We recruited 19 individuals with CUD to receive three open-label iTBS sessions per day, with approximately a 60-min interval between sessions, for 10 days over a 2-week period (30 total iTBS sessions). iTBS was delivered to left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) with neuronavigation guidance. Compliance and safety were assessed throughout the trial. Cocaine use behavior was assessed before, during, and after the intervention and at 1- and 4-week follow-up visits. Of the 335 iTBS sessions applied, 73% were performed on participants with cocaine-positive urine tests. Nine of the 14 participants who initiated treatment received at least 26 of 30 iTBS sessions and returned for the 4-week follow-up visit. These individuals reduced their weekly cocaine consumption by 78% in amount of dollars spent and 70% in days of use relative to pre-iTBS cocaine use patterns. Similarly, individuals reduced their weekly consumption of nicotine, alcohol, and THC, suggesting iTBS modulated a common circuit across drugs of abuse. iTBS was well-tolerated, despite the expected occasional headaches. A single participant developed a transient neurological event of uncertain etiology on iTBS day 9 and cocaine-induced psychosis 2 weeks after discontinuation. It thus appears that accelerated iTBS to left dlPFC administered in active, chronic cocaine users is both feasible and tolerable in actively using cocaine participants with preliminary indications of efficacy in reducing both the amount and frequency of cocaine (and other off target drug) use. The neural underpinnings of these behavioral changes could help in the future development of effective treatment of CUD.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Neurodegeneration section | New and Recent Articles: Dietary Supplementation With the Ketogenic Diet Metabolite Beta-Hydroxybutyrate Ameliorates Post-TBI Aggression in Young-Adult Male Drosophila</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.01140</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Traumatic brain injury (TBI), caused by repeated concussive head trauma can induce chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), a neurodegenerative disease featuring behavioral symptoms ranging from cognitive deficits to elevated aggression. In a Drosophila model, we used a high-impact trauma device (Katzenberger et al., 2013, 2015) to induce TBI-like symptoms and to study post-TBI behavioral outcomes. Following TBI, aggression in banged male flies was significantly elevated as compared with that in unbanged flies. These increases in aggressive behavior were not the result of basal motility changes, as measured by a negative geotaxis assay. In addition, the increase in post-TBI aggression appeared to be specific to concussive trauma: neither cold exposure nor electric shock—two alternate types of trauma—significantly elevated aggressive behavior in male-male pairs. Various forms of dietary therapy, especially the high-fat, low-carbohydrate ketogenic diet (KD), have recently been explored for a wide variety of neuropathies. We thus hypothesized that putatively neuroprotective dietary interventions might be able to suppress post-traumatic elevations in aggressive behavior in animals subjected to head-trauma-inducing strikes, or “bangs”. We supplemented a normal high-carbohydrate Drosophila diet with the KD metabolite beta-hydroxybutyrate (β-HB)—a ketone body (KB). Banged flies raised on a KB-supplemented diet exhibited a marked reduction in aggression, whereas aggression in unbanged flies was equivalent whether dieted with KB supplements or not. Pharmacological blockade of the ATP-sensitive potassium (K&lt;sub&gt;ATP&lt;/sub&gt;) channel abrogated KB effects reducing post-TBI aggression while pharmacological activation mimicked them, suggesting a mechanism by which KBs act in this model. KBs did not significantly extend lifespan in banged flies, but markedly extended lifespan in unbanged flies. We have thus developed a functional model for the study of post-TBI elevations of aggression. Further, we conclude that dietary interventions may be a fruitful avenue for further exploration of treatments for TBI- and CTE-related cognitive-behavioral symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neural Circuits | New and Recent Articles: Two Neural Circuits to Point Towards Home Position After Passive Body Displacements</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncir.2019.00070</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A challenge in motor control research is to understand the mechanisms underlying the transformation of sensory information into arm motor commands. Here, we investigated these transformation mechanisms for movements whose targets were defined by information issued from body rotations in the dark (i.e., idiothetic information). Immediately after being rotated, participants reproduced the amplitude of their perceived rotation using their arm (Experiment 1). The cortical activation during movement planning was analyzed using electroencephalography and source analyses. Task-related activities were found in regions of interest (ROIs) located in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), dorsal premotor cortex, dorsal region of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and the sensorimotor cortex. Importantly, critical regions for the cognitive encoding of space did not show significant task-related activities. These results suggest that arm movements were planned using a sensorimotor-type of spatial representation. However, when a 8 s delay was introduced between body rotation and the arm movement (Experiment 2), we found that areas involved in the cognitive encoding of space [e.g., ventral premotor cortex (vPM), rostral ACC, inferior and superior posterior parietal cortex (PPC)] showed task-related activities. Overall, our results suggest that the use of a cognitive-type of representation for planning arm movement after body motion is necessary when relevant spatial information must be stored before triggering the movement.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neural Circuits | New and Recent Articles: A Biologically-Inspired Model to Predict Perceived Visual Speed as a Function of the Stimulated Portion of the Visual Field</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncir.2019.00068</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Spatial orientation relies on a representation of the position and orientation of the body relative to the surrounding environment. When navigating in the environment, this representation must be constantly updated taking into account the direction, speed, and amplitude of body motion. Visual information plays an important role in this updating process, notably via optical flow. Here, we systematically investigated how the size and the simulated portion of the field of view (FoV) affect perceived visual speed of human observers. We propose a computational model to account for the patterns of human data. This model is composed of hierarchical cells' layers that model the neural processing stages of the dorsal visual pathway. Specifically, we consider that the activity of the MT area is processed by populations of modeled MST cells that are sensitive to the differential components of the optical flow, thus producing selectivity for specific patterns of optical flow. Our results indicate that the proposed computational model is able to describe the experimental evidence and it could be used to predict expected biases of speed perception for conditions in which only some portions of the visual field are visible.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Associations Between Cognitive Functions and Physical Frailty in Patients With Parkinson’s Disease</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2019.00283</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Background: Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease manifested by both motor and non-motor dysfunctions and co-existence of cognitive impairment and physical frailty is common. Given that research in this area is limited, a better understanding of associated factors with physical frailty could provide a focused screening method and facilitate early intervention in PD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Seventy-six patients with idiopathic PD were recruited and Fried’s criteria of physical frailty were used to group all participants. Comprehensive cognitive tests and clinical characteristics were measured, and univariate and multivariate analysis was performed to explore the relationship between clinical factors or neuropsychological functions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Twenty-nine patients with PD (38%) exhibited physical frailty. Compared to PD patients without frailty, PD patients with frailty were older in age and demonstrated worse disease severity and poorer cognitive functions, including attention, executive function, memory, speech and language, and visuospatial function (p &amp;lt; 0.05). Further, stepwise logistic regression analysis revealed that disease severity by the Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) total score (OR: 1.065; 95% CI: 1.033–1.099) and executive function (OR: 0.724; 95% CI: 0.581–0.877) were independent risk factors for predicting physical frailty (p = 0.003 and 0.002). The best cut-off points are 46 in UPDRS (sensitivity: 62.1%; specificity: 91.5%).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: Executive function impairment is an independent risk factor for the development of physical frailty with disease progression. Awareness of such comorbidity might provide a screening tool to facilitate investigation in their underlying etiology and early intervention for frailty prevention.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Global vs. Network-Specific Regulations as the Source of Intrinsic Coactivations in Resting-State Networks</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2019.00065</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Spontaneous neural activities are endowed with specific patterning characterized by synchronizations within functionally relevant distant regions that are termed as resting-state networks (RSNs). Although the mechanisms that organize the large-scale neural systems are still largely unknown, recent studies have proposed a hypothesis that network-specific coactivations indeed emerge as the result of globally propagating neural activities with specific paths of transmission. However, the extent to which such a centralized global regulation, rather than network-specific control, contributes to the RSN synchronization remains unknown. In the present study, we investigated the contribution from each mechanism by directly identifying the global as well as local component of resting-state functional MRI (fMRI) data provided by human connectome project, using temporal independent component analysis (ICA). Based on the spatial distribution pattern, each ICA component was classified as global or local. Time lag mapping of each IC revealed several paths of global or semi-global propagations that are partially overlapping yet spatially distinct to each other. Consistent with previous studies, the time lag of global oscillation, although being less spatially homogenous than what was assumed to be, contributed to the RSN synchronization. However, an equivalent contribution was also shown on the part of the more locally confined activities that are independent to each other. While allowing the view that network-specific coactivation occurs as part of the sequences of global neural activities, these results further confirm an equally important role of the network-specific regulation for its coactivation, regardless of whether vascular artifacts contaminate the global component in fMRI measures.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: State-Dependent Entrainment of Prefrontal Cortex Local Field Potential Activity Following Patterned Stimulation of the Cerebellar Vermis</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2019.00060</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The cerebellum is involved in sensorimotor, cognitive, and emotional functions through cerebello-cerebral connectivity. Cerebellar neurostimulation thus likely affects cortical circuits, as has been shown in studies using cerebellar stimulation to treat neurological disorders through modulation of frontal EEG oscillations. Here we studied the effects of different frequencies of cerebellar stimulation on oscillations and coherence in the cerebellum and prefrontal cortex in the urethane-anesthetized rat. Local field potentials were recorded in the right lateral cerebellum (Crus I/II) and bilaterally in the prefrontal cortex (frontal association area, FrA) in adult male Sprague-Dawley rats. Stimulation was delivered to the cerebellar vermis (lobule VII) using single pulses (0.2 Hz for 60 s), or repeated pulses at 1 Hz (30 s), 5 Hz (10 s), 25 Hz (2 s), and 50 Hz (1 s). Effects of stimulation were influenced by the initial state of EEG activity which varies over time during urethane-anesthesia; 1 Hz stimulation was more effective when delivered during the slow-wave state (Stage 1), while stimulation with single-pulse, 25, and 50 Hz showed stronger effects during the activated state (Stage 2). Single-pulses resulted in increases in oscillatory power in the delta and theta bands for the cerebellum, and in frequencies up to 80 Hz in cortical sites. 1 Hz stimulation induced a decrease in 0–30 Hz activity and increased activity in the 30–200 Hz range, in the right FrA. 5 Hz stimulation reduced power in high frequencies in Stage 1 and induced mixed effects during Stage 2.25 Hz stimulation increased cortical power at low frequencies during Stage 2, and increased power in higher frequency bands during Stage 1. Stimulation at 50 Hz increased delta-band power in all recording sites, with the strongest and most rapid effects in the cerebellum. 25 and 50 Hz stimulation also induced state-dependent effects on cerebello-cortical and cortico-cortical coherence at high frequencies. Cerebellar stimulation can therefore entrain field potential activity in the FrA and drive synchronization of cerebello-cortical and cortico-cortical networks in a frequency-dependent manner. These effects highlight the role of the cerebellar vermis in modulating large-scale synchronization of neural networks in non-motor frontal cortex.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Integrative Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Differential Effect of Visual and Proprioceptive Stimulation on Corticospinal Output for Reciprocal Muscles</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnint.2019.00063</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;This study investigated the corticospinal excitability of reciprocal muscles during tasks involving sensory difference between proprioceptive and visual inputs. Participants were instructed to relax their muscles and to observe a screen during vibratory stimulation. A video screen was placed on the board covering the right hand and forearm. Participants were randomly tested in four conditions: resting, control, static, and dynamic. The resting condition involved showing a black screen, the control condition, a mosaic patterned static videoclip; the static condition, a static videoclip of wrist flexion 0°; and the dynamic condition, a videoclip that corresponded to each participant’s closely-matched illusory wrist flexion angle and speed by vibration. Vibratory stimulation (frequency 80 Hz and duration 4 s) was applied to the distal tendon of the dominant right extensor carpi radialis (ECR) using a tendon vibrator in the control, static, and dynamic conditions. Four seconds after the vibratory stimulation (end of vibration), the primary motor cortex at the midpoint between the centers of gravity of the flexor carpi radialis (FCR) and ECR muscles was stimulated by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). The ECR motor evoked potential (MEP) amplitudes significantly increased in the control condition compared to the resting condition, whereas the FCR MEP amplitudes did not change between the resting and control conditions. In addition, the ECR MEP amplitudes significantly increased in the static condition compared to the dynamic condition. However, the FCR MEP amplitudes significantly increased in the dynamic condition compared to the static condition. These results imply that the difference between visuo-proprioceptive information had an effect on corticospinal excitability for the muscle. In conclusion, we found that proprioceptive and visual information differentially altered the corticospinal excitability of reciprocal muscles.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Neurogenesis section | New and Recent Articles: BAF45D Downregulation in Spinal Cord Ependymal Cells Following Spinal Cord Injury in Adult Rats and Its Potential Role in the Development of Neuronal Lesions</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.01151</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The endogenous spinal cord ependymal cells (SCECs), which form the central canal (CC), are critically involved in proliferation, differentiation and migration after spinal cord injury (SCI) and represents a repair cell source in treating SCI. Previously, we reported that BAF45D is expressed in the SCECs and the spinal cord neurons in adult mice and knockdown of BAF45D fail to induce expression of PAX6, a neurogenic fate determinant, during early neural differentiation of human embryonic stem cells. However, the effects of SCI on expression of BAF45D have not been reported. The aim of this study is to explore the expression and potential role of BAF45D in rat SCI model. In this study, adult rats were randomly divided into intact, sham, and SCI groups. We first explored expression of BAF45D in the SCECs in intact adult rats. We then explored SCI-induced loss of motor neurons and lesion of neurites in the anterior horns induced by the SCI. We also investigated whether the SCI-induced lesions in SCECs are accompanied by the motor neuron lesions. Finally, we examined the effect of BAF45D knockdown on cell growth in neuro2a cells. Our data showed that BAF45D is expressed in SCECs, neurons, and oligodendrocytes but not astrocytes in the spinal cords of intact adult rats. After SCI, the structure of CC was disrupted and the BAF45D-positive SCEC-derivatives were decreased. During the early stages of SCI, when shape of CC was affected but there was no disruption in circular structure of the SCECs, it was evident that there was a significant reduction in the number of neurites and motor neurons in the anterior horns compared with those of intact rats. In comparison, a complete loss of SCECs accompanied by further loss of motor neurons but not neurites was observed at the later stage. BAF45D knockdown was also found to inhibit cell growth in neuro2a cells. These results highlight the decreased expression of BAF45D in SCI-injured SCECs and the potential role of BAF45D downregulation in development of neuronal lesion after SCI in adult rats.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Neurodegeneration section | New and Recent Articles: The Delta-Subunit Selective GABAA Receptor Modulator, DS2, Improves Stroke Recovery via an Anti-inflammatory Mechanism</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.01133</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Inflammatory processes are known to contribute to tissue damage in the central nervous system (CNS) across a broad range of neurological conditions, including stroke. Gamma amino butyric acid (GABA), the main inhibitory neurotransmitter in the CNS, has been implicated in modulating peripheral immune responses by acting on GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptors on antigen-presenting cells and lymphocytes. Here, we investigated the effects and mechanism of action of the delta-selective compound, DS2, to improve stroke recovery and modulate inflammation. We report a decrease in nuclear factor (NF)-κB activation in innate immune cells over a concentration range in vitro. Following a photochemically induced motor cortex stroke, treatment with DS2 at 0.1 mg/kg from 1 h post-stroke significantly decreased circulating tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-17, and IL-6 levels, reduced infarct size and improved motor function in mice. Free brain concentrations of DS2 were found to be lower than needed for robust modulation of central GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptors and were not affected by the presence and absence of elacridar, an inhibitor of both P-glycoprotein and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP). Finally, as DS2 appears to dampen peripheral immune activation and only shows limited brain exposure, we assessed the role of DS2 to promote functional recovery after stroke when administered from 3-days after the stroke. Treatment with DS2 from 3-days post-stroke improved motor function on the grid-walking, but not on the cylinder task. These data highlight the need to further develop subunit-selective compounds to better understand change in GABA receptor signaling pathways both centrally and peripherally. Importantly, we show that GABA compounds such as DS2 that only shows limited brain exposure can still afford significant protection and promote functional recovery most likely via modulation of peripheral immune cells and could be given as an adjunct treatment.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Brain Imaging Methods section | New and Recent Articles: Network Representations of Facial and Bodily Expressions: Evidence From Multivariate Connectivity Pattern Classification</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.01111</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Emotions can be perceived from both facial and bodily expressions. Our previous study has found the successful decoding of facial expressions based on the functional connectivity (FC) patterns. However, the role of the FC patterns in the recognition of bodily expressions remained unclear, and no neuroimaging studies have adequately addressed the question of whether emotions perceiving from facial and bodily expressions are processed rely upon common or different neural networks. To address this, the present study collected functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data from a block design experiment with facial and bodily expression videos as stimuli (three emotions: anger, fear, and joy), and conducted multivariate pattern classification analysis based on the estimated FC patterns. We found that in addition to the facial expressions, bodily expressions could also be successfully decoded based on the large-scale FC patterns. The emotion classification accuracies for the facial expressions were higher than that for the bodily expressions. Further contributive FC analysis showed that emotion-discriminative networks were widely distributed in both hemispheres, containing regions that ranged from primary visual areas to higher-level cognitive areas. Moreover, for a particular emotion, discriminative FCs for facial and bodily expressions were distinct. Together, our findings highlight the key role of the FC patterns in the emotion processing, indicating how large-scale FC patterns reconfigure in processing of facial and bodily expressions, and suggest the distributed neural representation for the emotion recognition. Furthermore, our results also suggest that the human brain employs separate network representations for facial and bodily expressions of the same emotions. This study provides new evidence for the network representations for emotion perception and may further our understanding of the potential mechanisms underlying body language emotion recognition.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neural Circuits | New and Recent Articles: Age-Related Differences in Functional and Structural Connectivity in the Spatial Navigation Brain Network</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncir.2019.00069</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Spatial navigation involves multiple cognitive processes including multisensory integration, visuospatial coding, memory, and decision-making. These functions are mediated by the interplay of cerebral structures that can be broadly separated into a posterior network (subserving visual and spatial processing) and an anterior network (dedicated to memory and navigation planning). Within these networks, areas such as the hippocampus (HC) are known to be affected by aging and to be associated with cognitive decline and navigation impairments. However, age-related changes in brain connectivity within the spatial navigation network remain to be investigated. For this purpose, we performed a neuroimaging study combining functional and structural connectivity analyses between cerebral regions involved in spatial navigation. Nineteen young (μ = 27 years, σ = 4.3; 10 F) and 22 older (μ = 73 years, σ = 4.1; 10 F) participants were examined in this study. Our analyses focused on the parahippocampal place area (PPA), the retrosplenial cortex (RSC), the occipital place area (OPA), and the projections into the visual cortex of central and peripheral visual fields, delineated from independent functional localizers. In addition, we segmented the HC and the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) from anatomical images. Our results show an age-related decrease in functional connectivity between low-visual areas and the HC, associated with an increase in functional connectivity between OPA and PPA in older participants compared to young subjects. Concerning the structural connectivity, we found age-related differences in white matter integrity within the navigation brain network, with the exception of the OPA. The OPA is known to be involved in egocentric navigation, as opposed to allocentric strategies which are more related to the hippocampal region. The increase in functional connectivity between the OPA and PPA may thus reflect a compensatory mechanism for the age-related alterations around the HC, favoring the use of the preserved structural network mediating egocentric navigation. Overall, these findings on age-related differences of functional and structural connectivity may help to elucidate the cerebral bases of spatial navigation deficits in healthy and pathological aging.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: A Potential Association Between Retinal Changes, Subjective Memory Impairment, and Anxiety in Older Adults at Risk for Alzheimer’s Disease: A 27-Month Pilot Study</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2019.00288</link>
	<content:encoded>Introduction&lt;p&gt;The utility of subjective memory impairment (SMI) as a risk marker for preclinical Alzheimer’s disease (AD) remains unclear; however, recent studies have identified a correlation between retinal biomarkers and onset of preclinical disease. This study examines the relationship between retinal biomarkers that have been associated with cerebral amyloid, an early hallmark of AD, and SMI scores in patients at risk for developing AD.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;Forty-nine cognitively normal subjects were followed over 27 months and evaluated using a combination of neuropsychological, psychological, and retinal imaging instruments. Subjective memory testing was conducted using the memory assessment clinic questionnaire (MACQ) and Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scales (DASS). Multivariate linear analysis was conducted using STATA software.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Positive correlations were found between retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) volume and scores obtained from the MAC-Q at 27 months (MAC-Q_27), the DASS questionnaire for anxiety at 27 months (DASS-A_27), and the change in DASS-A over 27 months (dDASSA). There was also a significant positive correlation between these variables and the change in RNFL thickness over 27 months (dRNFL). MACQ_27, DASSA_27, and dDASS-A accounted for 35.7% of RFNL variance at 27 months and 21.5% of dRFNL variance.&lt;/p&gt;Discussion&lt;p&gt;These findings suggest that worse subjective memory complaints and anxiety scores may be associated with one of the most commonly used structural anatomical retinal markers of early disease burden in AD. If so, these results lend support to SMI as a valid risk marker for later cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: POPDC3 Gene Variants Associate with a New Form of Limb Girdle Muscular Dystrophy</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25620?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Popeye domain containing 3 (&lt;i&gt;POPDC3)&lt;/i&gt; gene encodes a membrane protein involved in cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) signaling. Besides gastric cancer, no disease association has been described. We describe a new muscular dystrophy associated with this gene.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We screened 1,500 patients with unclassified limb girdle weakness or hyperCKemia for pathogenic &lt;i&gt;POPDC3&lt;/i&gt; variants. Five patients carrying &lt;i&gt;POPDC3&lt;/i&gt; variants were examined by muscle magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), muscle biopsy, and cardiac examination. We performed functional analyses in a zebrafish &lt;i&gt;popdc3&lt;/i&gt; knockdown model and heterologous expression of the mutant proteins in &lt;i&gt;Xenopus laevis&lt;/i&gt; oocytes to measure TREK‐1 current.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We identified homozygous &lt;i&gt;POPDC3&lt;/i&gt; missense variants (p.Leu155His, p.Leu217Phe, and p.Arg261Gln) in 5 patients from 3 ethnically distinct families. Variants affected highly conserved residues in the Popeye (p.Leu155 and p.Leu217) and carboxy‐terminal (p.Arg261) domains. The variants were almost absent from control populations. Probands’ muscle biopsies were dystrophic, and serum creatine kinase levels were 1,050 to 9,200U/l. Muscle weakness was proximal with adulthood onset in most patients and affected lower earlier than upper limbs. Muscle MRI revealed fat replacement of paraspinal and proximal leg muscles; cardiac investigations were unremarkable. Knockdown of &lt;i&gt;popdc3&lt;/i&gt; in zebrafish, using 2 different splice‐site blocking morpholinos, resulted in larvae with tail curling and dystrophic muscle features.

	<title>Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: A Naturalistic Approach to the Hard Problem of Consciousness</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2019.00058</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Following a brief review of current efforts to identify the neuronal correlates of conscious processing (NCCP) an attempt is made to bridge the gap between the material neuronal processes and the immaterial dimensions of subjective experience. It is argued that this “hard problem” of consciousness research cannot be solved by only considering the neuronal underpinnings of cognition. The proposal is that the hard problem can be treated within a naturalistic framework if one considers not only the biological but also the socio-cultural dimensions of evolution. The argument is based on the following premises: perceptions are the result of a constructivist process that depends on priors. This applies both for perceptions of the outer world and the perception of oneself. Social interactions between agents endowed with the cognitive abilities of humans generated immaterial realities, addressed as social or cultural realities. This novel class of realities assumed the role of priors for the perception of oneself and the embedding world. A natural consequence of these extended perceptions is a dualist classification of observables into material and immaterial phenomena nurturing the concept of ontological substance dualism. It is argued that perceptions shaped by socio-cultural priors lead to the construction of a self-model that has both a material and an immaterial dimension. As priors are implicit and not amenable to conscious recollection the perceived immaterial dimension is experienced as veridical and not derivable from material processes—which is the hallmark of the hard problem. These considerations let the hard problem appear as the result of cognitive constructs that are amenable to naturalistic explanations in an evolutionary framework.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: The Role of Microglia and Astrocytes in Huntington’s Disease</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2019.00258</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Huntington’s disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disease. HD patients present with movement disorders, behavioral and psychiatric symptoms and cognitive decline. This review summarizes the contribution of microglia and astrocytes to HD pathophysiology. Neuroinflammation in the HD brain is characterized by a reactive morphology in these glial cells. Microglia and astrocytes are critical in regulating neuronal activity and maintaining an optimal milieu for neuronal function. Previous studies provide evidence that activated microglia and reactive astrocytes contribute to HD pathology through transcriptional activation of pro-inflammatory genes to perpetuate a chronic inflammatory state. Reactive astrocytes also display functional changes in glutamate and ion homeostasis and energy metabolism. Astrocytic and microglial changes may further contribute to the neuronal death observed with the progression of HD. Importantly, the degree to which these neuroinflammatory changes are detrimental to neurons and contribute to the progression of HD pathology is not well understood. Furthermore, recent observations provide compelling evidence that activated microglia and astrocytes exert a variety of beneficial functions that are essential for limiting tissue damage and preserving neuronal function in the HD brain. Therefore, a better understanding of the neuroinflammatory environment in the brain in HD may lead to the development of targeted and innovative therapeutic opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Histone H3K9 Trimethylation Downregulates the Expression of Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor in the Dorsal Hippocampus and Impairs Memory Formation During Anaesthesia and Surgery</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2019.00246</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is essential for cognitive and memory functions. Abnormal BDNF expression in the central nervous system may impair these functions. Anaesthesia and surgery can induce perioperative neurocognitive disorders (PND). Clinical studies show that BDNF expression is decreased in patients presenting with cognitive impairment after anaesthesia and surgery. However, the molecular mechanism is still unclear. Epigenetic regulation plays an important role in cognition. The hypermethylation of H3K9 is crucial for transcriptional silencing and the onset of cognitive disorders. Here, we hypothesised that H3K9 trimethylation repressed BDNF expression and impaired memory formation or recall during anaesthesia and surgery. Laparotomy under isoflurane inhalation anaesthesia, behavioural tests, Western blotting, quantitative real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP), and immunohistochemistry were used in this study. BDNF expression was decreased in the hippocampus after anaesthesia and surgery. Cognitive impairment affected memory formation but not recall. The trimethylation of H3K9 downregulated BDNF expression. The overexpression of BDNF or use of exogenous BDNF improved the impairment of memory formation caused by anaesthesia and surgery. Therefore, inhibiting H3K9 trimethylation and increasing the expression of BDNF may help prevent PND in the clinical setting.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.01132</link>
	<content:encoded>Background&lt;p&gt;Noisy galvanic vestibular stimulation (nGVS) has been shown to improve motor performance in people with and without disabilities. Previous investigations on the use of nGVS to improve upper-limb motor performance have focused on unimanual fine motor movements, nevertheless, bimanual gross movements are also essential for conducting activities of daily living and can be affected as a result of cerebral dysfunction. Consequently, in this study we investigated the effects of nGVS on bimanual gross motor performance.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;Twelve healthy participants completed a visuomotor task in which they performed bimanual upper-limb movements using two robots. During the task, participants tracked a target that oscillated following a sinusoidal amplitude-modulated trajectory. In half of the trials, participants received subthreshold nGVS, in the other half, they received sham stimulation. Primary outcome measure: percent improvement in root mean square error (RMSE) between the target’s and cursors’ trajectories. Secondary outcome measures: percent improvement in lag between the cursors and target; and percent improvement in RMSE between the cursors’ trajectories. A post-test questionnaire was administered to evaluate the experience of participants.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Tracking error was not affected by nGVS: left −2.6(5.5)%, p = 0.128; right −0.9(6.2)%, p = 0.639; nor was bimanual coordination −1.5(9.6)%, p = 0.590. When comparing if one hand was affected more than the other, we did not find a statistically significant difference (−1.7(3.3)%, p = 0.098). Similar results were found for the lag. Questionnaire results indicated that the robotic devices did not limit participants’ movements, did not make participants feel unsafe, nor were they difficult to control. Furthermore, participants did not feel unsafe with the nGVS device, nor did they report any discomfort due to nGVS.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;Results suggest that nGVS applied to people without disabilities do not affect bimanual gross motor performance. However, as this was the first study to investigate such effects, stimulation parameters were based on previous unimanual fine motor studies. Future studies should investigate optimal stimulation parameters for improving upper-limb gross motor performance. Overall, participants felt safe using the robotic devices and receiving the noisy electrical stimulation. As such, a similar setup could potentially be employed for subsequent studies investigating the relation between upper-limb performance and nGVS.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.01127</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Diabetes leads to an elevated risk of stroke and worse functional outcome compared to the general population. We investigate whether L-4F, an economical ApoA-I mimetic peptide, reduces neurovascular and white-matter damage in db/db type-2 diabetic (T2DM) stroke mice. L-4F (16 mg/kg, subcutaneously administered initially 2 h after stroke and subsequently daily for 4 days) reduced hemorrhagic transformation, decreased infarct-volume and mortality, and treated mice exhibited increased cerebral arteriole diameter and smooth muscle cell number, decreased blood-brain barrier leakage and white-matter damage in the ischemic brain as well as improved neurological functional outcome after stroke compared with vehicle-control T2DM mice (p &amp;lt; 0.05, n = 11/group). Moreover, administration of L-4F mitigated macrophage infiltration, and reduced the level of proinflammatory mediators tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα), high-mobility group box-1 (HMGB-1)/advanced glycation end-product receptor (RAGE) and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) in the ischemic brain in T2DM mice (p &amp;lt; 0.05, n = 6/group). In vitro, L-4F treatment did not increase capillary-like tube formation in mouse-brain endothelial cells, but increased primary artery explant cell migration derived from C57BL/6-aorta 1 day after middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAo), and enhanced neurite-outgrowth after 2 h of oxygen-glucose deprivation and axonal-outgrowth in primary cortical neurons derived from the C57BL/6-embryos subjected to high-glucose condition. This study suggests that early treatment with L-4F provides a potential strategy to reduce neuroinflammation and vascular and white-matter damage in the T2DM stroke population.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Brain Imaging Methods section | New and Recent Articles: The Relationship Between Local Field Potentials and the Blood-Oxygenation-Level Dependent MRI Signal Can Be Non-linear</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.01126</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is currently one of the most important neuroimaging methods in neuroscience. The image contrast in fMRI relies on the blood-oxygenation-level dependent (BOLD) signal, which indirectly reflects neural activity through neurovascular coupling. Because the mechanism that links the BOLD signal to neural activities involves multiple complicated processes, where neural activity, regional metabolism, hemodynamics, and the BOLD signal are all inter-connected, understanding the quantitative relationship between the BOLD signal and the underlying neural activities is crucial for interpreting fMRI data. Simultaneous local field potential (LFP) and fMRI recordings provide a method to study neurovascular coupling. There were a few studies that have shown non-linearities in stimulus related responses, but whether there is any non-linearity in LFP—BOLD relationship at rest has not been specifically quantified. In this study, we analyzed the simultaneous LFP and resting state-fMRI data acquired from rodents, and found that the relationship between LFP and BOLD is non-linear under isoflurane (ISO) anesthesia, but linear under dexmedetomidine (DMED) anesthesia. Subsequent analysis suggests that such non-linearity may come from the non-Gaussian distribution of LFP power and switching from LFP power to LFP amplitude can alleviate the problem to a degree. We also confirmed that, despite the non-linearity in the mean LFP—BOLD curve, the Pearson correlation between the two signals is relatively unaffected.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Brain Imaging Methods section | New and Recent Articles: The Impact of the Geometric Correction Scheme on MEG Functional Topology at Rest</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.01114</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Spontaneous activity is correlated across brain regions in large scale networks (RSN) closely resembling those recruited during several behavioral tasks and characterized by functional specialization and dynamic integration. Specifically, MEG studies revealed a set of central regions (dynamic core) possibly facilitating communication among differently specialized brain systems. However, source projected MEG signals, due to the fundamentally ill-posed inverse problem, are affected by spatial leakage, leading to the estimation of spurious, blurred connections that may affect the topological properties of brain networks and their integration. To reduce leakage effects, several correction schemes have been proposed including the Geometric Correction Scheme (GCS) whose theory, simulations and empirical results on topography of a few RSNs were already presented. However, its impact on the estimation of fundamental graph measures used to describe the architecture of interactions among brain regions has not been investigated yet. Here, we estimated dense, MEG band-limited power connectomes in theta, alpha, beta, and gamma bands from 13 healthy subjects (all young adults). We compared the connectivity and topology of MEG uncorrected and GCS-corrected connectomes. The use of GCS considerably reorganized the topology of connectivity, reducing the local, within-hemisphere interactions mainly in the beta and gamma bands and increasing across-hemisphere interactions mainly in the alpha and beta bands. Moreover, the number of hubs decreased in the alpha and beta bands, but the centrality of some fundamental regions such as the Posterior Cingulate Cortex (PCC), Supplementary Motor Area (SMA) and Middle Prefrontal Cortex (MPFC) remained strong in all bands, associated to an increase of the Global Efficiency and a decrease of Modularity. As a comparison, we applied orthogonalization on connectomes and ran the same topological analyses. The correlation values were considerably reduced, and orthogonalization mainly decreased local within-hemisphere interactions in all bands, similarly to GCS. Notably, the centrality of the PCC, SMA and MPFC was preserved in all bands, as for GCS, together with other hubs in the posterior parietal regions. Overall, leakage correction removes spurious local connections, but confirms the role of dynamic hub regions, specifically the anterior and posterior cingulate, in integrating information in the brain at rest.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.01069</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Cognitive control of emotions depends on intermodular long-distance communications. However, negative connections between connector hubs are removed by traditional hard-thresholding approach in graph-theoretical research. Using soft-thresholding approach to reserve negative links, we explore time-varying features of connector hubs in intermodular communications during cognitive control of affective pictures. We develop a novel approach to sparse functional networks and construct negatively linking connector networks for positive, negative, and neutral pictures. We find that consisting of flexible hubs, the frontoparietal system dynamically top–down inhibits neural activities through negative connections from the salience subnetwork and visual processing area. Moreover, the shared connectors form functional backbones that dynamically reconfigure according to differently-valenced pictures in order to coordinate both stability and flexibility of cognitive connector networks. These results reveal the necessity of conserving negative links between intermodular communications in chronnectome research and deepen the understanding of how connector networks dynamically evolute during cognitive control of affective processing.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Genome-Wide Association Studies for Cerebrospinal Fluid Soluble TREM2 in Alzheimer’s Disease</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2019.00297</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia. Rare variants in triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) have been identified as risk factors for AD. Soluble TREM2 (sTREM2) in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is a potential and novel biomarker of neuroinflammation implicated in the onset and progression of AD. To explore the roles of CSF sTREM2 on the pathogenesis of AD, we performed genome-wide association studies (GWAS) by using the data from Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). We found CSF sTREM2 levels were elevated with the disease stages, but there was no significant difference between that of AD patients and normal participants. CSF sTREM2 was positively correlated with CSF total tau and phosphorylated-tau levels (ρ &amp;gt; 0.35, p &amp;lt; 1e-06; ρ &amp;gt; 0.32, p &amp;lt; 1e-05, respectively) for all disease states. We identified the most significant CSF sTREM2 related locus was rs7232 (FDR = 3.01e-08), a missense variant in MS4A6A gene of chromosome 11. Moreover, we also detected rs7232 was highly associated with MS4A6A gene expression (FDR = 1.37e-18). In addition, our pathway analysis for our significant GWAS results showed that biological processes for regulation of viruses and immune response were highly overrepresented or enriched. Our study suggests that CSF sTREM2 plays an informative role in AD progression. Moreover, CSF sTREM2 and AD is highly related to viral infections and immune response.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Effect of Systemic Inflammation on Rat Attentional Function and Neuroinflammation: Possible Protective Role for Food Restriction</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2019.00296</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Background: Aging is characterized by subtle cognitive decline, which correlates with increased peripheral inflammation. Acute activation of the peripheral immune system, via lipopolysaccharide (LPS) injection, elicits deficits in hippocampal-dependent spatial memory. Little is known concerning the effect of chronic inflammation on prefrontal cortex (PFC)-dependent vigilance. We examined the impact of repeated LPS injections in young and middle-age rats on the 5-choice serial reaction time task (5-CSRTT), expecting repeated LPS treatment to induce attentional deficits with greater disruption in middle-age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Male Fischer-344 rats, 4- and 12-months-old, were food restricted and trained on the 5-CSRTT. Once rats reached criterion, they were injected with LPS (1 mg/kg, i.p.) weekly for 4 weeks and testing started 48 h after each injection. To examine the possibility that mild food restriction inherent to the behavioral task influenced inflammation markers, a second group of food-restricted or ad-lib-fed rats was assessed for cytokine changes 48 h after one injection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Performing LPS-treated rats exhibited a sickness response, manifesting as reduced initiated and completed trials during the first week but recovered by the second week of testing. After the first week, LPS-treated rats continued to exhibit longer response latencies, despite no change in food retrieval latency, suggestive of LPS-induced cognitive slowing. Similarly, LPS-induced impairment of attention was observed as increased omissions with heightened cognitive demand and increased age. Repeated LPS-treatment increased the level of PFC IL-1α, and PFC IL-6 was marginally higher in middle-age rats. No effect of age or treatment was observed for plasma cytokines in performing rats. Histological examination of microglia indicated increased colocalization of Iba1+ and CD68+ cells from middle-age relative to young rats. Examination of food restriction demonstrated an attenuation of age- and LPS-related increases in plasma cytokine levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: Systemic inflammation, induced through LPS treatment, impaired attentional function, which was independent of sickness and exacerbated by increased cognitive demand and increased age. Additional studies revealed that food restriction, associated with the task, attenuated markers of neuroinflammation and plasma cytokines. The results emphasize the need for improved methods for modeling low-level chronic systemic inflammation to effectively examine its impact on attention during aging.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Background&lt;p&gt;The purpose of the present study was to evaluate deep learning-based image-guided surgical planning for deep brain stimulation (DBS). We developed deep learning semantic segmentation-based DBS targeting and prospectively applied the method clinically.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;T2&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt; fast gradient-echo images from 102 patients were used for training and validation. Manually drawn ground truth information was prepared for the subthalamic and red nuclei with an axial cut ∼4 mm below the anterior–posterior commissure line. A fully convolutional neural network (FCN-VGG-16) was used to ensure margin identification by semantic segmentation. Image contrast augmentation was performed nine times. Up to 102 original images and 918 augmented images were used for training and validation. The accuracy of semantic segmentation was measured in terms of mean accuracy and mean intersection over the union. Targets were calculated based on their relative distance from these segmented anatomical structures considering the Bejjani target.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Mean accuracies and mean intersection over the union values were high: 0.904 and 0.813, respectively, for the 62 training images, and 0.911 and 0.821, respectively, for the 558 augmented training images when 360 augmented validation images were used. The Dice coefficient converted from the intersection over the union was 0.902 when 720 training and 198 validation images were used. Semantic segmentation was adaptive to high anatomical variations in size, shape, and asymmetry. For clinical application, two patients were assessed: one with essential tremor and another with bradykinesia and gait disturbance due to Parkinson’s disease. Both improved without complications after surgery, and microelectrode recordings showed subthalamic nuclei signals in the latter patient.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;The accuracy of deep learning-based semantic segmentation may surpass that of previous methods. DBS targeting and its clinical application were made possible using accurate deep learning-based semantic segmentation, which is adaptive to anatomical variations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Neural Technology section | New and Recent Articles: Fornix Stimulation Induces Metabolic Activity and Dopaminergic Response in the Nucleus Accumbens</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.01109</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The Papez circuit, including the fornix white matter bundle, is a well-known neural network that is involved in multiple limbic functions such as memory and emotional expression. We previously reported a large-animal study of deep brain stimulation (DBS) in the fornix that found stimulation-induced hemodynamic responses in both the medial limbic and corticolimbic circuits on functional resonance imaging (fMRI) and evoked dopamine responses in the nucleus accumbens (NAc), as measured by fast-scan cyclic voltammetry (FSCV). The effects of DBS on the fornix are challenging to analyze, given its structural complexity and connection to multiple neuronal networks. In this study, we extend our earlier work to a rodent model wherein we characterize regional brain activity changes resulting from fornix stimulation using fludeoxyglucose (&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F-FDG) micro positron emission tomography (PET) and monitor neurochemical changes using FSCV with pharmacological confirmation. Both global functional changes and local changes were measured in a rodent model of fornix DBS. Functional brain activity was measured by micro-PET, and the neurochemical changes in local areas were monitored by FSCV. Micro-PET images revealed increased glucose metabolism within the medial limbic and corticolimbic circuits. Neurotransmitter efflux induced by fornix DBS was monitored at NAc by FSCV and identified by specific neurotransmitter reuptake inhibitors. We found a significant increase in the metabolic activity in several key regions of the medial limbic circuits and dopamine efflux in the NAc following fornix stimulation. These results suggest that electrical stimulation of the fornix modulates the activity of brain memory circuits, including the hippocampus and NAc within the dopaminergic pathway.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Brain Imaging Methods section | New and Recent Articles: Functional MRI Readouts From BOLD and Diffusion Measurements Differentially Respond to Optogenetic Activation and Tissue Heating</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.01104</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Functional blood-oxygenation-level-dependent (BOLD) MRI provides a brain-wide readout that depends on the hemodynamic response to neuronal activity. Diffusion fMRI has been proposed as an alternative to BOLD fMRI and has been postulated to directly rely on neuronal activity. These complementary functional readouts are versatile tools to be combined with optogenetic stimulation to investigate networks of the brain. The cell-specificity and temporal precision of optogenetic manipulations promise to enable further investigation of the origin of fMRI signals. The signal characteristics of the diffusion fMRI readout vice versa may better resolve network effects of optogenetic stimulation. However, the light application needed for optogenetic stimulation is accompanied by heat deposition within the tissue. As both diffusion and BOLD are sensitive to temperature changes, light application can lead to apparent activations confounding the interpretation of fMRI data. The degree of tissue heating, the appearance of apparent activation in different fMRI sequences and the origin of these phenomena are not well understood. Here, we disentangled apparent activations in BOLD and diffusion measurements in rats from physiological activation upon sensory or optogenetic stimulation. Both, BOLD and diffusion fMRI revealed similar signal shapes upon sensory stimulation that differed clearly from those upon heating. Apparent activations induced by high-intensity light application were dominated by T&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt;-effects and resulted in mainly negative signal changes. We estimated that even low-intensity light application used for optogenetic stimulation reduces the BOLD response close to the fiber by up to 0.4%. The diffusion fMRI signal contained T&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, T&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt; and diffusion components. The apparent diffusion coefficient, which reflects the isolated diffusion component, showed negative changes upon both optogenetic and electric forepaw stimulation. In contrast, positive changes were detected upon high-intensity light application and thus ruled out heating as a major contributor to the diffusion fMRI signal.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroanatomy | New and Recent Articles: Environmental Enrichment From Birth Impacts Parvalbumin Expressing Cells and Wisteria Floribunda Agglutinin Labelled Peri-Neuronal Nets Within the Developing Murine Striatum</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnana.2019.00090</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Environmental enrichment can dramatically affect both the development and function of neural circuits. This is accomplished, at least in part, by the regulation of inhibitory cellular networks and related extracellular matrix glycoprotein structures known as perineuronal nets. The degree to which enhanced housing can influence brain areas involved in the planning and execution of actions is not well known. We examined the effect of enriching mice from birth on parvalbumin expression and perineuronal net formation in developing and adult striatum. This input nucleus of the basal ganglia consists of topographically discernible regions that serve different functions, providing a means of simultaneously examining the influence of environmental factors on discrete, but related networks. Greater densities of striatal parvalbumin positive cells and wisteria floribunda agglutinin labelled perineuronal nets were present in enriched pups during the second postnatal week, primarily within the lateral portion of the nucleus. Housing conditions continued to have an impact into adulthood, with enriched mice exhibiting higher parvalbumin positive cell densities in both medial and lateral striatum. Curiously, no differences due to housing conditions were detected in striatal perineuronal net densities of mature animals. The degree of overlap between striatal parvalbumin expression and perineuronal net formation was also increased, suggesting that heightened neural activity associated with enrichment may have contributed to greater engagement of networks affiliated with cells that express the calcium binding protein. Brain derived neurotrophic factor, an important regulator of inhibitory network maturation, is also subtly, but significantly affected within the striatum of enriched cohorts. Together, these findings suggest that environmental enrichment can exert cell specific effects within different divisions of an area vital for the regulation of action.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Emerging Cognitive Intervention Technologies to Meet the Needs of an Aging Population: A Systematic Review</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2019.00291</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Background: Cognitive training helps to promote healthy aging and ease activities of daily living for older adults. Recently, experiments have been conducted using robots to perform this cognitive training.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: A review was conducted to examine the effects of computer-based cognitive interventions for older adults who were either healthy or experiencing mild cognitive impairment (MCI). A second study also examined the evolution of socially assistive robots (SAR) and their effectiveness at administering cognitive training for older adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Eighty-one studies published between 2009 and 2019 were identified for review, 56 of which focused on computerized cognitive training (CCT) while 25 examined the use of robotics. Twenty-four of the 56 CCT studies met the inclusion criteria. These were further classified into two groups: studies which used self-designed programs, and studies using commercially available ones. Of the 25 studies examining the use of robotics in cognitive intervention 7 met the inclusion criteria. Review shows that CCT improves cognitive function but that robots are more effective tools for improving cognition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: It can be concluded that CCT is beneficial for older adults and though there are drawbacks to this approach they are overcome by the introduction of robots into the training process. Culture, language, and socio-economic considerations vis-a-vis robot design and training methodology should be included in future research.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Evidence of Hyperacusis in Adult Rats Following Non-traumatic Sound Exposure</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2019.00055</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Manipulations that enhance neuroplasticity may inadvertently create opportunities for maladaptation. We have previously used passive exposures to non-traumatic white noise to open windows of plasticity in the adult rat auditory cortex and induce frequency-specific functional reorganizations of the tonotopic map. However, similar reorganizations in the central auditory pathway are thought to contribute to the generation of hearing disorders such as tinnitus and hyperacusis. Here, we investigate whether noise-induced reorganizations are accompanied by electrophysiological or behavioral evidence of tinnitus or hyperacusis in adult Long-Evans rats. We used a 2-week passive exposure to moderate-intensity (70 dB SPL) broadband white noise to reopen a critical period for spectral tuning such that a second 1-week exposure to 7 kHz tone pips produced an expansion of the 7 kHz frequency region in the primary auditory cortex (A1). We demonstrate for the first time that this expansion also takes place in the ventral auditory field (VAF). Sound exposure also led to spontaneous and sound-evoked hyperactivity in the anterior auditory field (AAF). Rats were assessed for behavioral evidence of tinnitus or hyperacusis using gap and tone prepulse inhibition of the acoustic startle response. We found that sound exposure did not affect gap-prepulse inhibition. However, sound exposure led to an improvement in prepulse inhibition when the prepulse was a 7 kHz tone, showing that exposed rats had enhanced sensorimotor gating for the exposure frequency. Together, our electrophysiological and behavioral results provide evidence of hyperacusis but not tinnitus in sound-exposed animals. Our findings demonstrate that periods of prolonged noise exposure may open windows of plasticity that can also be understood as windows of vulnerability, potentially increasing the likelihood for maladaptive plasticity to take place.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.01141</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The purification of pluripotent stem cell-derived cortico-fugal projection neurons (PSC-CFuPNs) is useful for disease modeling and cell therapies related to the dysfunction of cortical motor neurons, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) or stroke. However, no CFuPN-specific surface markers for the purification are known. Recently, microRNAs (miRNAs) have been reported as alternatives to surface markers. Here, we investigated this possibility by applying the miRNA switch, an mRNA technology, to enrich PSC-CFuPNs. An array study of miRNAs in mouse fetal brain tissue revealed that CFuPNs highly express miRNA-124-3p at E14.5 and E16.5. In response, we designed a miRNA switched that responds to miRNA-124-3p and applied it to mouse embryonic stem cell (ESC)-derived cortical neurons. Flow cytometry and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) analyses showed the miRNA-124-3p switch enriched CFuPN-like cells from this population. Immunocytechemical analysis confirmed vGlut1/Emx1/Bcl11b triple positive CFuPN-like cells were increased from 6.5 to 42%. Thus, our miRNA-124-3p switch can uniquely enrich live CFuPN-like cells from mouse ESC-derived cortical neurons.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Brain Imaging Methods section | New and Recent Articles: Origins of the Resting-State Functional MRI Signal: Potential Limitations of the “Neurocentric” Model</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.01136</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) is emerging as a research tool for systems and clinical neuroscience. The mechanism underlying resting-state functional MRI (rsfMRI) signal, however, remains incompletely understood. A widely held assumption is that the spontaneous fluctuations in blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signal reflect ongoing neuronal processes (herein called “neurocentric” model). In support of this model, evidence from human and animal studies collectively reveals that the spatial synchrony of spontaneously occurring electrophysiological signal recapitulates BOLD rsFC networks. Two recent experiments from independent labs designed to specifically examine neuronal origins of rsFC, however, suggest that spontaneously occurring neuronal events, as assessed by multiunit activity or local field potential (LFP), although statistically significant, explain only a small portion (∼10%) of variance in resting-state BOLD fluctuations. These two studies, although each with its own limitations, suggest that the spontaneous fluctuations in rsfMRI, may have complex cellular origins, and the “neurocentric” model may not apply to all brain regions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Neural Technology section | New and Recent Articles: Habituation of the Interlimb Reflex (ILR) Over the Biceps Brachii Muscle After Electrical Stimuli Over the Sural Nerve</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.01130</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Up to now relatively little is known about interlimb reflexes (ILR). Especially it is not well known whether ILR may habituate or not to subsequent stimuli. The main aim of the present investigation was to explore the short term habituation behavior of ILR. The electromyogram was recorded over the tonically active biceps brachii (BB) muscle in 11 healthy subjects contralateral and ipsilateral to supramaximum electrical stimuli (9–12 mA) that were delivered at 1.0 and 0.4 Hz over the left sural nerve. In addition, a selective averaging method was used to investigate the influence of preceding stimuli on the ILR. Thus, 30 blocks of 3 subsequent stimuli were used. All 1st ILR of each block were averaged together. Averages were also obtained for 2nd and 3rd ILR. While ILR amplitudes gained significantly both ipsilateral and contralateral to the stimulus (p &amp;lt; 0.05) after train stimuli as compared with single stimuli, ILR amplitudes showed a significant decrease at 1.0 Hz versus 0.4 Hz stimuli. ILR amplitudes decreased significantly after the 2nd and 3rd stimulus relative to the 1st (p &amp;lt; 0.05). ILR can be recorded bilaterally remote from the stimulus site. Furthermore, ILR show clear short term habituation behavior.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Objectives&lt;p&gt;To investigate the diagnostic value of MRI-based texture analysis in discriminating common posterior fossa tumors, including medulloblastoma, brain metastatic tumor, and hemangioblastoma.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;A total number of 185 patients were enrolled in the current study: 63 of them were diagnosed with medulloblastoma, 56 were diagnosed with brain metastatic tumor, and 66 were diagnosed with hemangioblastoma. Texture features were extracted from contrast-enhanced T1-weighted (T1C) images and fluid-attenuation inversion recovery (FLAIR) images within two matrixes. Mann–Whitney U test was conducted to identify whether texture features were significantly different among subtypes of tumors. Logistic regression analysis was performed to assess if they could be taken as independent predictors and to establish the integrated models. Receiver operating characteristic analysis was conducted to evaluate their performances in discrimination.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;There were texture features from both T1C images and FLAIR images found to be significantly different among the three types of tumors. The integrated model represented that the promising diagnostic performance of texture analysis depended on a series of features rather than a single feature. Moreover, the predictive model that combined texture features and clinical feature implied feasible performance in prediction with an accuracy of 0.80.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;MRI-based texture analysis could potentially be served as a radiological method in discrimination of common tumors located in posterior fossa.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Brain Imaging Methods section | New and Recent Articles: Clustering the Brain With “CluB”: A New Toolbox for Quantitative Meta-Analysis of Neuroimaging Data</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.01037</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In this paper we describe and validate a new coordinate-based method for meta-analysis of neuroimaging data based on an optimized hierarchical clustering algorithm: CluB (Clustering the Brain). The CluB toolbox permits both to extract a set of spatially coherent clusters of activations from a database of stereotactic coordinates, and to explore each single cluster of activation for its composition according to the cognitive dimensions of interest. This last step, called “cluster composition analysis,” permits to explore neurocognitive effects by adopting a factorial-design logic and by testing the working hypotheses using either asymptotic tests, or exact tests either in a classic inference, or in a Bayesian-like context. To perform our validation study, we selected the fMRI data from 24 normal controls involved in a reading task. We run a standard random-effects second level group analysis to obtain a “Gold Standard” of reference. In a second step, the subject-specific reading effects (i.e., the linear t-contrast “reading &amp;gt; baseline”) were extracted to obtain a coordinates-based database that was used to run a meta-analysis using both CluB and the popular Activation Likelihood Estimation method implemented in the software GingerALE. The results of the two meta-analyses were compared against the “Gold Standard” to compute performance measures, i.e., sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy. The GingerALE method obtained a high level of accuracy (0.967) associated with a high sensitivity (0.728) and specificity (0.971). The CluB method obtained a similar level of accuracy (0.956) and specificity (0.969), notwithstanding a lower level of sensitivity (0.14) due to the lack of prior Gaussian transformation of the data. Finally, the two methods obtained a good-level of concordance (AC&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.93). These results suggested that methods based on hierarchical clustering (and post-hoc statistics) and methods requiring prior Gaussian transformation of the data can be used as complementary tools, with the GingerALE method being optimal for neurofunctional mapping of pooled data according to simpler designs, and the CluB method being preferable to test more specific, and localized, neurocognitive hypotheses according to factorial designs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The somatic nervous system of the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans is a model for understanding the physical characteristics of the neurons and their interconnections. Its neurons show high variation in morphological attributes. This study investigates the relationship of neuronal morphology to the number of synapses per neuron. Morphology is also examined for any detectable association with neuron cell type or ganglion membership.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

A new study by Krabbe and Paradiso et al. shows that vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP)-expressing interneurons of the basolateral amygdala control associative learning and memory formation by gating aversive stimuli scaled by their unexpectedness.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/neuro/rss/current/~4/5Ylnsygs40A&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.01030</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Adult-onset autosomal dominant leukodystrophy (ADLD) is a lately described rare form of leukodystrophy with only one family report from China. As the only disease associated with increased lamina B1 encoded by LMNB1, ADLDs have different clinical presentations, ranging from autonomic to pyramidal tract and cerebellar ataxia. Here, we report a case of ADLD that presented with positional tremor as the initial symptom. T2-weighted brain MRI showed brain atrophy and diffuse high signal intensity of the cerebral white matter and the brain stem. The precise diagnosis was made by identification of the mutated gene. To the best of our knowledge, this is perhaps the first case report of ADLD presenting as tremor in China.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>
