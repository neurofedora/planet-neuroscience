	<title>Frontiers in Integrative Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Atypical Social Attention and Emotional Face Processing in Autism Spectrum Disorder: Insights From Face Scanning and Pupillometry</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnint.2019.00076</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Social attention deficits are a hallmark characteristic within autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and have been hypothesized to have cascading effects on emotion recognition. Eye-tracking methodology has emerged as a potentially reliable, feasible, and sensitive biomarker for examining core phenotypic features of ASD; however, these findings are mixed with regards to measuring treatment change in clinical trials. The present study aimed to assess the utility of an eye-tracking paradigm to discriminate between clinical groups in social attention and emotion recognition through face scanning and pupillometry. The present study also assessed the reliability of this paradigm within the ASD sample to further our understanding of the utility of eye-tracking for future clinical trials. Participants included 42 individuals with ASD, 29 developmental disability (DD) controls, and 62 typically developing (TD) controls between 3 and 25 years of age. An emotional faces eye-tracking paradigm was administered to all participants, with the ASD group completing the paradigm a second time approximately 2 months later. Participants’ average proportion of looking and number of fixations to specific areas of interest (AOI) were examined along with changes in pupil reactivity while viewing different emotional faces. Results suggest atypical face-scanning through a reduced proportion of looking and the number of fixations toward the eyes in the ASD group regardless of the emotion that was presented. Further, pupillometry measures were able to detect increases in pupil dilation to happy faces in the ASD group. Lastly, test-retest reliability coefficients varied between the poor and excellent range based on the mechanism assessed, with the proportion of looking demonstrating the highest reliability coefficients. These findings build on the promise of eye-tracking as a feasible and reliable biomarker for identifying social attention and emotion recognition deficits in ASD. Detecting differences in emotion recognition explicitly through facial scanning was not as clear. Specific mechanisms within the eye-tracking paradigm may be viable options for assessing treatment-specific outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Human Creativity and Consciousness: Unintended Consequences of the Brain's Extraordinary Energy Efficiency?. (arXiv:2002.03738v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2002.03738</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;It is proposed that both human creativity and human consciousness are
(unintended) consequences of the human brain's extraordinary energy efficiency.
The topics of creativity and consciousness are treated separately, though have
a common sub-structure. It is argued that creativity arises from a synergy
between two cognitive modes of the human brain (which broadly coincide with
Kahneman's Systems 1 and 2). In the first, available energy is spread across a
relatively large network of neurons. As such, the amount of energy per active
neuron is so small that the operation of such neurons is susceptible to thermal
(ultimately quantum decoherent) noise. In the second, available energy is
focussed on a small enough subset of neurons to guarantee a deterministic
operation. An illustration of how this synergy can lead to creativity with
implications for computing in silicon are discussed. Starting with a discussion
of the concept of free will, the notion of consciousness is defined in terms of
an awareness of what are perceived to be nearby counterfactual worlds in state
space. It is argued that such awareness arises from an interplay between our
memories on the one hand, and quantum physical mechanisms (where, unlike in
classical physics, nearby counterfactual worlds play an indispensable dynamical
role) in the ion channels of neural networks. As with the brain's
susceptibility to noise, it is argued that in situations where quantum physics
plays a role in the brain, it does so for reasons of energy efficiency. As an
illustration of this definition of consciousness, a novel proposal is outlined
as to why quantum entanglement appears so counter-intuitive.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: A Spike in Performance: Training Hybrid-Spiking Neural Networks with Quantized Activation Functions. (arXiv:2002.03553v1 [cs.LG])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2002.03553</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The machine learning community has become increasingly interested in the
energy efficiency of neural networks. The Spiking Neural Network (SNN) is a
promising approach to energy-efficient computing, since its activation levels
are quantized into temporally sparse, one-bit values (i.e., &quot;spike&quot; events),
which additionally converts the sum over weight-activity products into a simple
addition of weights (one weight for each spike). However, the goal of
maintaining state-of-the-art (SotA) accuracy when converting a non-spiking
network into an SNN has remained an elusive challenge, primarily due to spikes
having only a single bit of precision. Adopting tools from signal processing,
we cast neural activation functions as quantizers with temporally-diffused
error, and then train networks while smoothly interpolating between the
non-spiking and spiking regimes. We apply this technique to the Legendre Memory
Unit (LMU) to obtain the first known example of a hybrid SNN outperforming SotA
recurrent architectures---including the LSTM, GRU, and NRU---in accuracy, while
reducing activities to at most 3.74 bits on average with 1.26 significant bits
multiplying each weight. We discuss how these methods can significantly improve
the energy efficiency of neural networks.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Oriented Matroids and Combinatorial Neural Codes. (arXiv:2002.03542v1 [math.CO])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2002.03542</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A combinatorial neural code $\mathscr C\subseteq 2^{[n]}$ is convex if it
arises as the intersection pattern of convex open subsets of $\mathbb R^d$. We
relate the emerging theory of convex neural codes to the established theory of
oriented matroids, both categorically and with respect to geometry and
computational complexity. On the categorical side, we show that the map taking
an acyclic oriented matroid to the code of positive parts of its topes is a
faithful functor. We adapt the oriented matroid ideal introduced by Novik,
Postnikov, and Sturmfels into a functor from the category of oriented matroids
to the category of rings; then, we show that the resulting ring maps naturally
to the neural ring of the matroid's neural code.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For geometry and computational complexity, we show that a code has a
realization with convex polytopes if and only if it lies below the code of a
representable oriented matroid in the partial order of codes introduced by
Jeffs. We show that previously published examples of non-convex codes do not
lie below any oriented matroids, and we construct examples of non-convex codes
lying below non-representable oriented matroids. By way of this construction,
we can apply Mn\&quot;{e}v-Sturmfels universality to show that deciding whether a
combinatorial code is convex is NP-hard.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2002.03540</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;We design a physical wave-pulse neural network (WPNN) for both wave and pulse
propagation, which gives more degrees of freedom for neural coding than spike
neural networks (SNN). We define the rules and the information entropy of this
kind of neural network, where the signal speed, arrival time, and the length of
connections between neurons all become crucial parameters for signal coding. We
call it quasi-quantum coding (QQC) since the combination of wave and pulse
signals here behaves like a classical mimic of quantum wave-particle duality,
and can be studied by borrowing some concepts form quantum mechanics. We
present that the quasi-quantum coding can give efficient methods for both sound
and image recognitions. We also discuss the possibility of the wave-pulse
neural network and the quasi-quantum coding methods running on it in biological
brains where both neural oscillations and action potentials are important to
cognition.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2002.03420</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Empirical estimates of the dimensionality of neural population activity are
often much lower than the population size. Similar phenomena are also observed
in trained and designed neural network models. These experimental and
computational results suggest that mapping low-dimensional dynamics to
high-dimensional neural space is a common feature of cortical computation.
Despite the ubiquity of this observation, the constraints arising from such
mapping are poorly understood. Here we consider a specific example of mapping
low-dimensional dynamics to high-dimensional neural activity -- the neural
engineering framework. We analytically solve the framework for the classic ring
model -- a neural network encoding a static or dynamic angular variable. Our
results provide a complete characterization of the success and failure modes
for this model. Based on similarities between this and other frameworks, we
speculate that these results could apply to more general scenarios.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2002.03211</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Within computational neuroscience, informal interactions with modelers often
reveal wildly divergent goals. In this opinion piece, we explicitly address the
diversity of goals that motivate and ultimately influence modeling efforts. We
argue that a wide range of goals can be meaningfully taken to be of highest
importance. A simple informal survey conducted on the Internet confirmed the
diversity of goals in the community. However, different priorities or
preferences of individual researchers can lead to divergent model evaluation
criteria. We propose that many disagreements in evaluating the merit of
computational research stem from differences in goals and not from the
mechanics of constructing, describing, and validating models. We suggest that
authors state explicitly their goals when proposing models so that others can
judge the quality of the research with respect to its stated goals.

	<title>Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: The Effects of Anesthetics on the Cortex—Lessons From Event-Related Potentials</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2020.00002</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Consciousness while under general anesthesia is a dreadful condition. Various electroencephalogram (EEG)-based technologies have been developed, on the basis of empirical evidence, in order to identify this condition. However, certain electrophysiological phenomena, which seem strongly related with depth of anesthesia in some drugs, appear less consistent with those of other anesthetic drugs. There is a gap between the complexity of the phenomenon of consciousness and its behavioral manifestations, on the one hand, and the empirical nature of the reported electrophysiological markers, which are associated with it, on the other hand. In fact, such a gap might prevent us from progressing toward unified electrophysiological markers of consciousness while under anesthesia, which are applicable to all anesthetic drugs. We believe that there is a need to bridge this conceptual gap. Therefore, in this work, we will try to present a theoretical framework for such bridging. First, we suggest focusing on neuropsychological processes, which seem to have a clear role in the behavioral manifestations of consciousness while under anesthesia but seem, nevertheless, better defined than consciousness itself—such as perception and attention. Then, we suggest analyzing the effects of anesthesia upon these neuropsychological processes, as they are manifested in the EEG signal. Specifically, we will focus on the effects of anesthesia on event-related potentials (ERPs), which seem more easily associable with neuropsychological modeling.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsyn.2020.00005</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Synaptic transmission between neurons is the basic mechanism for information processing in cortical microcircuits. To date, paired recording from synaptically coupled neurons is the most widely used method which allows a detailed functional characterization of unitary synaptic transmission at the cellular and synaptic level in combination with a structural characterization of both pre- and postsynaptic neurons at the light and electron microscopic level. In this review, we will summarize the many applications of paired recordings to investigate synaptic function and structure. Paired recordings have been used to study the detailed electrophysiological and anatomical properties of synaptically coupled cell pairs within a synaptic microcircuit; this is critical in order to understand the connectivity rules and dynamic properties of synaptic transmission. Paired recordings can also be adopted for quantal analysis of an identified synaptic connection and to study the regulation of synaptic transmission by neuromodulators such as acetylcholine, the monoamines, neuropeptides, and adenosine etc. Taken together, paired recordings from synaptically coupled neurons will remain a very useful approach for a detailed characterization of synaptic transmission not only in the rodent brain but also that of other species including humans.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2020.00012</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Multiple TREX mRNA export complex subunits (e.g., THOC1, THOC2, THOC5, THOC6, THOC7) have now been implicated in neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs), neurodegeneration and cancer. We previously implicated missense and splicing-defective THOC2 variants in NDDs and a broad range of other clinical features. Here we report 10 individuals from nine families with rare missense THOC2 variants including the first case of a recurrent variant (p.Arg77Cys), and an additional individual with an intragenic THOC2 microdeletion (Del-Ex37-38). Ex vivo missense variant testing and patient-derived cell line data from current and published studies show 9 of the 14 missense THOC2 variants result in reduced protein stability. The splicing-defective and deletion variants result in a loss of small regions of the C-terminal THOC2 RNA binding domain (RBD). Interestingly, reduced stability of THOC2 variant proteins has a flow-on effect on the stability of the multi-protein TREX complex; specifically on the other NDD-associated THOC subunits. Our current, expanded cohort refines the core phenotype of THOC2 NDDs to language disorder and/or ID, with a variable severity, and disorders of growth. A subset of affected individuals’ has severe-profound ID, persistent hypotonia and respiratory abnormalities. Further investigations to elucidate the pathophysiological basis for this severe phenotype are warranted.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2020.00001</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Laminin-α2-related congenital muscular dystrophy (LAMA2-CMD) is a devastating neuromuscular disease caused by mutations in the LAMA2 gene. These mutations result in the complete absence or truncated expression of the laminin-α2 chain. The α2-chain is a major component of the laminin-211 and laminin-221 isoforms, the predominant laminin isoforms in healthy adult skeletal muscle. Mutations in this chain result in progressive skeletal muscle degeneration as early as neonatally. Laminin-211/221 is a ligand for muscle cell receptors integrin-α7β1 and α-dystroglycan. LAMA2 mutations are correlated with integrin-α7β1 disruption in skeletal muscle. In this review, we will summarize laminin-211/221 interactions with integrin-α7β1 in LAMA2-CMD muscle. Additionally, we will summarize recent developments using upregulation of laminin-111 in the sarcolemma of laminin-α2-deficient muscle. We will discuss potential mechanisms of action by which laminin-111 is able to prevent myopathy. These published studies demonstrate that laminin-111 is a disease modifier of LAMA2-CMD through different methods of delivery. Together, these studies show the potential for laminin-111 therapy as a novel paradigm for the treatment of LAMA2-CMD.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Background&lt;p&gt;Maladaptive reactivity to sensory inputs is commonly observed in neurodevelopmental disorders (e.g., autism, ADHD). Little is known, however, about the underlying neural mechanisms. For some children, atypical sensory reactivity is the primary complaint, despite absence of another identifiable neurodevelopmental diagnosis. Studying Sensory Processing Disorder (SPD) may well provide a window into the neuropathology of these symptoms. It has been proposed that a deficit in sensory integration underlies the SPD phenotype, but objective quantification of sensory integration is lacking. Here we used neural and behavioral measures of multisensory integration (MSI), which would be affected by impaired sensory integration and for which there are well accepted objective measures, to test whether failure to integrate across the senses is associated with atypical sensory reactivity in SPD. An autism group served to determine if observed differences were unique to SPD.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;We tested whether children aged 6–16 years with SPD (N = 14) integrate multisensory inputs differently from age-matched typically developing controls (TD: N = 54), or from children with an autism spectrum disorder (ASD: N = 44). Participants performed a simple reaction-time task to the occurrence of auditory, visual, and audiovisual stimuli presented in random order, while high-density recordings of electrical brain activity were made.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Children with SPD showed large reductions in the extent to which they benefited from multisensory inputs compared to TDs. The ASD group showed similarly reduced response speeding to multisensory relative to unisensory inputs. Neural evidence for MSI was seen across all three groups, with the multisensory response differing from the sum of the unisensory responses. Post hoc tests suggested the possibility of enhanced MSI in SPD in timeframes consistent with cortical sensory registration (∼60 ms), followed by reduced MSI during a timeframe consistent with object formation (∼130 ms). The ASD group also showed reduced MSI in the later timeframe.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;Children with SPD showed reduction in their ability to benefit from redundant audio-visual inputs, similar to children with ASD. Neurophysiological recordings, on the other hand, showed that major indices of MSI were largely intact, although post hoc testing pointed to periods of potential differential processing. While these exploratory electrophysiological observations point to potential sensory-perceptual differences in multisensory processing in SPD, it remains equally plausible at this stage that later attentional processing differences may yet prove responsible for the multisensory behavioral deficits uncovered here.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Brain Imaging Methods section | New and Recent Articles: Examination of Structural Variations of the Circle of Willis by 3D Time-of-Flight Magnetic Resonance Angiography</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00071</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Objectives: To explore structural variations of the circle of Willis using three-dimensional time-of-flight magnetic resonance angiography (3D-TOF-MRA), and to compare this modality with digital subtraction angiography (DSA).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: A total of 819 consecutive patients suspected of having cerebral vascular diseases underwent 3D-TOF-MRA, followed by DSA within 2 weeks. We report accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) of 3D-TOF-MRA compared with DSA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: The sensitivity and specificity of combined analyses were 90–100 and 98–100%, respectively. The sensitivity and NPV of 3D-TOF-MRA images for A-, C-, D-, and H-types of circle of Willis anomalies were 100%. The specificity, accuracy and sensitivity were all 100% for detecting absence of the anterior communicating artery (ACOA). Sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV were all 100% for detecting F-type. The sensitivity and PPV of volume rendered (VR) images for the B-, E-, and G-types were relatively low (85.0, 86.2, and 73.8%, respectively). Maximum intensity projection (MIP) was somewhat better (88.3, 89.2, and 81.8%, respectively). Combined analyses were better still (95.8, 96.1, and 99.0%, respectively). Specificity and NPVs were high (99.3–100%).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: 3D-TOF-MRA compares well to DSA for evaluation of the structure of the circle of Willis. As 3D-TOF-MRA is a non-invasive modality, it may be preferred as a means to evaluate structural variations of the circle of Willis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Neurodegeneration section | New and Recent Articles: A Connected Network of Interacting Proteins Is Involved in Human-Tau Toxicity in Drosophila</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00068</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Tauopathies are neurodegenerative diseases characterized by the presence of aggregates of abnormally phosphorylated Tau. Deciphering the pathophysiological mechanisms that lead from the alteration of Tau biology to neuronal death depends on the identification of Tau cellular partners. Combining genetic and transcriptomic analyses in Drosophila, we identified 77 new modulators of human Tau-induced toxicity, bringing to 301 the number of Tau genetic interactors identified so far in flies. Network analysis showed that 229 of these genetic modulators constitute a connected network. The addition of 77 new genes strengthened the network structure, increased the intergenic connectivity and brought up key hubs with high connectivities, namely Src64B/FYN, Src42A/FRK, kuz/ADAM10, heph/PTBP1, scrib/SCRIB, and Cam/CALM3. Interestingly, we established for the first time a genetic link between Tau-induced toxicity and ADAM10, a recognized Alzheimer Disease protective factor. In addition, our data support the importance of the presynaptic compartment in mediating Tau toxicity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroinformatics | New and Recent Articles: An Automated Open-Source Workflow for Standards-Compliant Integration of Small Animal Magnetic Resonance Imaging Data</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fninf.2020.00005</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Large-scale research integration is contingent on seamless access to data in standardized formats. Standards enable researchers to understand external experiment structures, pool results, and apply homogeneous preprocessing and analysis workflows. Particularly, they facilitate these features without the need for numerous potentially confounding compatibility add-ons. In small animal magnetic resonance imaging, an overwhelming proportion of data is acquired via the ParaVision software of the Bruker Corporation. The original data structure is predominantly transparent, but fundamentally incompatible with modern pipelines. Additionally, it sources metadata from free-field operator input, which diverges strongly between laboratories and researchers. In this article we present an open-source workflow which automatically converts and reposits data from the ParaVision structure into the widely supported and openly documented Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS). Complementing this workflow we also present operator guidelines for appropriate ParaVision data input, and a programmatic walk-through detailing how preexisting scans with uninterpretable metadata records can easily be made compliant after the acquisition.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Effects of Anodal tDCS on Arithmetic Performance and Electrophysiological Activity</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00017</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Arithmetic abilities are among the most important school-taught skills and form the basis for higher mathematical competencies. At the same time, their acquisition and application can be challenging. Hence, there is broad interest in methods to improve arithmetic abilities. One promising method is transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS). In the present study, we compared two anodal tDCS protocols in their efficacy to improve arithmetic performance and working memory. In addition, we investigated stimulation-related electrophysiological changes. Three groups of participants solved arithmetic problems (additions and subtractions) and an n-back task before, during, and after receiving either frontal or parietal anodal tDCS (25 min; 1 mA) or sham stimulation. EEG was simultaneously recorded to assess stimulation effects on event-related (de-) synchronisation (ERS/ERD) in theta and alpha bands. Persons receiving frontal stimulation showed an acceleration of calculation speed in large subtractions from before to during and after stimulation. However, a comparable, but delayed (apparent only after stimulation) increase was also found in the sham stimulation group, while it was absent in the group receiving parietal stimulation. In additions and small subtractions as well as the working memory task, analyses showed no effects of stimulation. Results of ERS/ERD during large subtractions indicate changes in ERS/ERD patterns over time. In the left hemisphere there was a change from theta band ERD to ERS in all three groups, whereas a similar change in the right hemisphere was restricted to the sham group. Taken together, tDCS did not lead to a general improvement of arithmetic performance. However, results indicate that frontal stimulation accelerated training gains, while parietal stimulation halted them. The absence of general performance improvements, but acceleration of training effects might be a further indicator of the advantages of using tDCS as training or learning support over tDCS as a sole performance enhancer.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Three-Year Gait and Axial Outcomes of Bilateral STN and GPi Parkinson’s Disease Deep Brain Stimulation</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00001</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Objective: To examine the short- and long-term clinical outcomes of the bilateral subthalamic nucleus (STN) and globus pallidus internus (GPi) deep brain stimulation (DBS) on gait and axial symptoms in Parkinson’s disease (PD) patients. Available data have been inconsistent and mostly short-term regarding the effect of both brain targets on gait and axial symptoms. We aimed to identify potential target specific differences at 3-year follow-up from a large single-center experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: We retrospectively reviewed short-term (6-month follow-up) and long-term (36-month follow-up) changes in the Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) Part II and III total scores of 72 PD patients (53 with bilateral STN-DBS and 19 with bilateral GPi-DBS). An interdisciplinary team made target-specific decisions for each DBS patient. We analyzed changes in gait and axial subscores derived from UPDRS II and III.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: In both the STN- and GPi-DBS cohorts, we observed no significant differences in gait and axial UPDRS derived subscores in the off-med/on stimulation state at long-term follow-up when compared to baseline. On-med axial scores remained similar in the short-term but worsened in both groups (STN, 2.23 ± 3.43, p &amp;lt; 0.001; GPi, 2.53 ± 2.37, p &amp;lt; 0.01) in the long-term possibly due to disease progression. At long-term follow-up, the UPDRS III off-med/on stimulation scores worsened but were persistently improved from baseline in both groups (−9.07 ± 13.9, p &amp;lt; 0.001).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: The study showed that long-term both STN- and GPi-DBS had a similar effect on gait and axial symptoms in UPDRS derived subscores at 36-month follow-up despite potential baseline differences in criteria for selection of each target. More sophisticated measures of gait and balance beyond the categorical UPDRS score will be needed for future studies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Factors Influencing Manipulation of a Familiar Object in Patients With Limb Apraxia After Stroke</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2019.00465</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Previous studies have shown that hand actions to visual objects are affected both by perceptual factors and by action goals. Our aim was to study how these processes affected hand actions in chronic stroke patients, based on whether they had limb apraxia. Twenty-two left hemisphere, chronic stroke patients were measured on neuropsychological tasks of limb apraxia, which was identified in a subgroup of 10 patients. All patients underwent testing on a separate task of making simple reach and grasp actions to a cup. Their performance was compared to a group of 18 healthy age-matched volunteers. Participants were instructed to grasp the top or bottom of a cup to either lift or turn it over so as to end with a hand position that was either comfortable or uncomfortable. This task tested the influence of the compatibility of hand–cup orientation, as well as goals driven by the end-state comfort of the hand, on action selection for object manipulation. Participants’ performance was measured in terms of error rates, and speed of initiation and reaching (movement time) to the object. The patients’ performance was significantly delayed, and error rates increased when reaching to grasp a cup under conditions of poor compatibility and end-state comfort. The subgroup of patients with apraxia showed a decreased influence of compatibility of hand interaction with the cup, with increased error rates and delayed response times, compared to patients with no apraxia and healthy volunteers. This is despite the fact they did not display significant deficits on neuropsychological tasks of real object use. The study shows that patients with apraxia have difficulties in selecting elements of object-directed actions, pertaining to both habitual and goal-directed factors.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: IRSp53 Deletion in Glutamatergic and GABAergic Neurons and in Male and Female Mice Leads to Distinct Electrophysiological and Behavioral Phenotypes</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00023</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;IRSp53 (also known as BAIAP2) is an abundant excitatory postsynaptic scaffolding protein implicated in autism spectrum disorders (ASD), schizophrenia, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). IRSp53 is expressed in different cell types across different brain regions, although it remains unclear how IRSp53 deletion in different cell types affects brain functions and behaviors in mice. Here, we deleted IRSp53 in excitatory and inhibitory neurons in mice and compared resulting phenotypes in males and females. IRSp53 deletion in excitatory neurons driven by Emx1 leads to strong social deficits and hyperactivity without affecting anxiety-like behavior, whereas IRSp53 deletion in inhibitory neurons driven by Viaat has minimal impacts on these behaviors in male mice. In female mice, excitatory neuronal IRSp53 deletion induces hyperactivity but moderate social deficits. Excitatory neuronal IRSp53 deletion in male mice induces an increased ratio of evoked excitatory and inhibitory synaptic transmission (E/I ratio) in layer V pyramidal neurons in the prelimbic region of the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), whereas the same mutation does not alter the E/I ratio in female neurons. These results suggest that IRSp53 deletion in excitatory and inhibitory neurons and in male and female mice has distinct impacts on behaviors and synaptic transmission.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Metabolic Regulation of Glial Phenotypes: Implications in Neuron–Glia Interactions and Neurological Disorders</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00020</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Glial cells are multifunctional, non-neuronal components of the central nervous system with diverse phenotypes that have gained much attention for their close involvement in neuroinflammation and neurodegenerative diseases. Glial phenotypes are primarily characterized by their structural and functional changes in response to various stimuli, which can be either neuroprotective or neurotoxic. The reliance of neurons on glial cells is essential to fulfill the energy demands of the brain for its proper functioning. Moreover, the glial cells perform distinct functions to regulate their own metabolic activities, as well as work in close conjunction with neurons through various secreted signaling or guidance molecules, thereby constituting a complex network of neuron-glial interactions in health and disease. The emerging evidence suggests that, in disease conditions, the metabolic alterations in the glial cells can induce structural and functional changes together with neuronal dysfunction indicating the importance of neuron–glia interactions in the pathophysiology of neurological disorders. This review covers the recent developments that implicate the regulation of glial phenotypic changes and its consequences on neuron–glia interactions in neurological disorders. Finally, we discuss the possibilities and challenges of targeting glial metabolism as a strategy to treat neurological disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Subarachnoid Hemorrhage Induces Dynamic Immune Cell Reactions in the Choroid Plexus</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00018</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) is a specific form of hemorrhagic stroke that frequently causes intracranial hypertension. The choroid plexus (CP) of the brain ventricles is responsible for producing cerebrospinal fluid and forms the blood – cerebrospinal fluid barrier. The aim of the current study was to determine whether SAH induces an immune cell reaction in the CP and whether the resulting increase in intracranial pressure (ICP) itself can lead to cellular changes in the CP. SAH was induced by injecting non-heparinized autologous blood to the cisterna magna. Artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) instead of blood was used to assess influence of increased ICP alone. SAH and ACSF animals were left to survive for 1, 3, and 7 days. SAH induced significantly increased numbers of M1 (ED1+, CCR7+) and M2 (ED2+, CD206+) macrophages as well as MHC-II+ antigen presenting cells (APC) compared to naïve and ACSF animals. Increased numbers of ED1+ macrophages and APC were found in the CP only 3 and 7 days after ACSF injection, while ED2+ macrophage number did not increase. CD3+ T cells were not found in any of the animals. Following SAH, proliferation activity in the CP gradually increased over time while ACSF application induced higher cellular proliferation only 1 and 3 days after injection. Our results show that SAH induces an immune reaction in the CP resulting in an increase in the number of several macrophage types in the epiplexus position. Moreover, we also found that increased ICP due to ACSF application induced both an immune reaction and increased proliferation of epiplexus cells in the CP. These findings indicate that increased ICP, and not just blood, contributes to cellular changes in the CP following SAH.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Cellular Senescence in Neurodegenerative Diseases</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00016</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Cellular senescence is a homeostatic biological process characterized by a permanent state of cell cycle arrest that can contribute to the decline of the regenerative potential and function of tissues. The increased presence of senescent cells in different neurodegenerative diseases suggests the contribution of senescence in the pathophysiology of these disorders. Although several factors can induce senescence, DNA damage, oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, and altered proteostasis have been shown to play a role in its onset. Oxidative stress contributes to accelerated aging and cognitive dysfunction stages affecting neurogenesis, neuronal differentiation, connectivity, and survival. During later life stages, it is implicated in the progression of cognitive decline, synapse loss, and neuronal degeneration. Also, neuroinflammation exacerbates oxidative stress, synaptic dysfunction, and neuronal death through the harmful effects of pro-inflammatory cytokines on cell proliferation and maturation. Both oxidative stress and neuroinflammation can induce DNA damage and alterations in DNA repair that, in turn, can exacerbate them. Another important feature associated with senescence is altered proteostasis. Because of the disruption in the function and balance of the proteome, senescence can modify the proper synthesis, folding, quality control, and degradation rate of proteins producing, in some diseases, misfolded proteins or aggregation of abnormal proteins. There is an extensive body of literature that associates cellular senescence with several neurodegenerative disorders including Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Down syndrome (DS), and Parkinson’s disease (PD). This review summarizes the evidence of the shared neuropathological events in these neurodegenerative diseases and the implication of cellular senescence in their onset or aggravation. Understanding the role that cellular senescence plays in them could help to develop new therapeutic strategies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00014</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Human brain organoids (mini-brains) consist of self-organized three-dimensional (3D) neural tissue which can be derived from reprogrammed adult cells and maintained for months in culture. These 3D structures manifest substantial potential for the modeling of neurodegenerative diseases and pave the way for personalized medicine. However, as these 3D brain models can express the whole human genetic complexity, it is critical to have access to isogenic mini-brains that only differ in specific and controlled genetic variables. Genetic engineering based on retroviral vectors is incompatible with the long-term modeling needed here and implies a risk of random integration while methods using CRISPR-Cas9 are still too complex to adapt to stem cells. We demonstrate in this study that our strategy which relies on an episomal plasmid vector derived from the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) offers a simple and robust approach, avoiding the remaining caveats of mini-brain models. For this proof-of-concept, we used a normal tau protein with a fluorescent tag and a mutant genetic form (P301S) leading to Fronto-Temporal Dementia. Isogenic cell lines were obtained which were stable for more than 30 passages expressing either form. We show that the presence of the plasmid in the cells does not interfere with the mini-brain differentiation protocol and obtain the development of a pathologically relevant phenotype in cerebral organoids, with pathological hyperphosphorylation of the tau protein. Such a simple and versatile genetic strategy opens up the full potential of human organoids to contribute to disease modeling, personalized medicine and testing of therapeutics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Objective&lt;p&gt;Our study was designed to investigate whether the indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase (IDO)-mediated kynurenine/tryptophan (KYN/TRP) pathway participates in the development of emotional deficits from ethanol addiction/withdrawal mice.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;The expression of proinflammatory factors, including tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α), interleukin-1β (IL-1β), and interleukin-6 (IL-6), was tested by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The IDO levels in the hippocampus, cerebral cortex, and amygdala were measured by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and western blot, and the neurotransmitters were tested by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Emotional deficits of mice were evaluated by behavioral tests.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Expression levels of inflammatory factors (TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6) were increased in mice after 4 weeks of alcohol exposure. As for indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) expression, only the subtype IDO1 was found to increase at both mRNA level and protein level in all the tested brain regions of ethanol addiction/withdrawal mice. In behavioral tests, mice exposed to alcohol showed gradually declined memory function accompanied by anxiety-like and depressive-like behaviors. Meanwhile, increased expression of KYN, decreased expression of 5-HT, and abnormal expression of 3-HK and KA were found in the hippocampus, cerebral cortex, and amygdala of ethanol addiction/withdrawal mice. Interestingly, the IDO1 inhibitor, 1-methyl-L-tryptophan (1-MT), reversed all above alterations induced by ethanol in mice.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;Our results suggested that the TRP/KYN pathway, medicated by IDO1, in the hippocampus, cerebral cortex, and amygdala, plays an important role in the development of emotional deficits caused by ethanol addiction and withdrawal.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: GABAA Receptor β2E155 Residue Located at the Agonist-Binding Site Is Involved in the Receptor Gating</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00002</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptors (GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;Rs) play a crucial role in mediating inhibition in the adult brain. In spite of progress in describing (mainly) the static structures of this receptor, the molecular mechanisms underlying its activation remain unclear. It is known that in the α&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;β&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;γ&lt;sub&gt;2L&lt;/sub&gt; receptors, the mutation of the β&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;E155 residue, at the orthosteric binding site, strongly impairs the receptor activation, but the molecular and kinetic mechanisms of this effect remain elusive. Herein, we investigated the impact of the β&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;E155C mutation on binding and gating of the α&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;β&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;γ&lt;sub&gt;2L&lt;/sub&gt; receptor. To this end, we combined the macroscopic and single-channel analysis, the use of different agonists [GABA and muscimol (MSC)] and flurazepam (FLU) as a modulator. As expected, the β&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;E155C mutation caused a vast right shift of the dose–response (for GABA and MSC) and, additionally, dramatic changes in the time course of current responses, indicative of alterations in gating. Mutated receptors showed reduced maximum open probability and enhanced receptor spontaneous activity. Model simulations for macroscopic currents revealed that the primary effect of the mutation was the downregulation of the preactivation (flipping) rate. Experiments with MSC and FLU further confirmed a reduction in the preactivation rate. Our single-channel analysis revealed the mutation impact mainly on the second component in the shut times distributions. Based on model simulations, this finding further confirms that this mutation affects mostly the preactivation transition, supporting thus the macroscopic data. Altogether, we provide new evidence that the β&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;E155 residue is involved in both binding and gating (primarily preactivation).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Modulation of Hippocampal Gamma Oscillations by Dopamine in Heterozygous Reeler Mice in vitro</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2019.00586</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The reelin haploinsufficient heterozygous reeler mice (HRM), an animal model of schizophrenia, have altered mesolimbic dopaminergic pathways and share similar neurochemical and behavioral properties with patients with schizophrenia. Dysfunctional neural circuitry with impaired gamma (γ) oscillation (30–80 Hz) has been implicated in abnormal cognition in patients with schizophrenia. However, the function of neural circuitry in terms of γ oscillation and its modulation by dopamine (DA) has not been reported in HRM. In this study, first, we recorded γ oscillations in CA3 from wild-type mice (WTM) and HRM hippocampal slices, and we studied the effects of DA on γ oscillations. We found that there was no difference in γ power between WTM and HRM and that DA increased γ power of WTM but not HRM, suggesting that DA modulations of network oscillations in HRM are impaired. Second, we found that N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) antagonist MK-801 itself increased γ power and occluded DA-mediated enhancement of γ power in WTM but partially restored DA modulation of γ oscillations in HRM. Third, inhibition of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), a downstream molecule of NMDAR, increased γ power and blocked the effects of DA on γ oscillation in WTM and had no significant effect on γ power but largely restored DA modulation of γ oscillations in HRM. Our results reveal that impaired DA function in HRM is associated with dysregulated NMDAR–PI3K signaling, a mechanism that may be relevant in the pathology of schizophrenia.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroanatomy | New and Recent Articles: Zebrafish Astroglial Morphology in the Olfactory Bulb Is Altered With Repetitive Peripheral Damage</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnana.2020.00004</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Zebrafish do not possess the typical astrocytes that are found in mammalian systems. In some brain areas, this teleost has radial glia that appears to perform astrocyte-like functions, but these cells have not been described in the zebrafish olfactory bulb. Mammalian astrocytes facilitate neuroplasticity and undergo astrogliosis after insult. The role of these cells in the zebrafish olfactory system after the damage has been poorly explored. This is important to examine because zebrafish have a high degree of neuroplasticity and the olfactory bulb is a brain area renowned for plasticity. The goal of this study was to explore the potential role of zebrafish astrocytes in the olfactory bulb damage response, with a goal to exploit the high level of regeneration in this system. We found that anti-glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) labels numerous processes in the zebrafish olfactory bulb that are concentrated in the nerve and glomerular layers (GL) and do not show radial glial-like morphology. We propose to term this astroglia, since their location and response to damage suggests that they are similar in function to the mammalian astrocyte. To induce repetitive peripheral damage to the olfactory organ, a wax plug was inserted into the nasal cavity of adult zebrafish every 12 h for up to 7 days; this crushes the olfactory organ and leads to degradation of olfactory sensory neuron axons that project to the olfactory bulb. After 1 day, we found a significant increase in astroglial labeling in the affected bulb when compared to the internal control bulb and astroglial branches appeared to increase in number and size. By the third day of plug insertions there was no significant difference in astroglial labeling between the affected bulb and the internal control bulb. These data lead us to believe that astrogliosis does occur in the presence of peripheral damage, but this process attenuates within 1 week and no glial scar is evident upon recovery from the damage. Further exploration of astrocytes in zebrafish, in particular this apparent attenuation of astrogliosis, has the potential to elucidate key differences in glial function between teleosts and mammals.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroanatomy | New and Recent Articles: Stereotaxic Diffusion Tensor Imaging White Matter Atlas for the in vivo Domestic Feline Brain</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnana.2020.00001</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The cat brain is a useful model for neuroscientific research and with the increasing use of advanced neuroimaging techniques there is a need for an open-source stereotaxic white matter brain atlas to accompany the cortical gray matter atlas, currently available. A stereotaxic white matter atlas would facilitate anatomic registration and segmentation of the white matter to aid in lesion localization or standardized regional analysis of specific regions of the white matter. In this article, we document the creation of a stereotaxic feline white matter atlas from diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data obtained from a population of eight mesaticephalic felines. Deterministic tractography reconstructions were performed to create tract priors for the major white matter projections of Corpus callosum (CC), fornix, cingulum, uncinate, Corona Radiata (CR), Corticospinal tract (CST), inferior longitudinal fasciculus (ILF), Superior Longitudinal Fasciculus (SLF), and the cerebellar tracts. T1-weighted, fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), radial diffusivity (RD) and axial diffusivity (AD) population maps were generated. The volume, mean tract length and mean FA, MD, AD and RD values for each tract prior were documented. A structural connectome was then created using previously published cortical priors and the connectivity metrics for all cortical regions documented. The provided white matter atlas, diffusivity maps, tract priors and connectome will be a valuable resource for anatomical, pathological and translational neuroimaging research in the feline model. Multi-atlas population maps and segmentation priors are available at Cornell’s digital repository: https://ecommons.cornell.edu/handle/1813/58775.2.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: The Density of Perineuronal Nets Increases With Age in the Inferior Colliculus in the Fischer Brown Norway Rat</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00027</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Age-related hearing loss, one of the most frequently diagnosed disabilities in industrialized countries, may result from declining levels of GABA in the aging inferior colliculus (IC). However, the mechanisms of aging and subsequent disruptions of temporal processing in elderly hearing abilities are still being investigated. Perineuronal nets (PNs) are a specialized form of the extracellular matrix and have been linked to GABAergic neurotransmission and to the regulation of structural and synaptic plasticity. We sought to determine whether the density of PNs in the IC changes with age. We combined Wisteria floribunda agglutinin (WFA) staining with immunohistochemistry to glutamic acid decarboxylase in three age groups of Fischer Brown Norway (FBN) rats. The density of PNs on GABAergic and non-GABAergic cells in the three major subdivisions of the IC was quantified. Results first demonstrate that the density of PNs in the FBN IC increase with age. The greatest increases of PN density from young to old age occurred in the central IC (67% increase) and dorsal IC (117% increase). Second, in the young IC, PNs surround non-GABAergic and GABAergic cells with the majority of PNs surrounding the former. The increase of PNs with age in the IC occurred on both non-GABAergic and GABAergic populations. The average density of PN-surrounded non-GABAergic cells increased from 84.9 PNs/mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; in the young to 134.2 PNs/mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; in the old. While the density of PN-surrounded GABAergic cells increased from 26 PNs/mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; in the young to 40.6 PNs/mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; in the old. The causality is unclear, but increases in PN density in old age may play a role in altered auditory processing in the elderly, or may lead to further changes in IC plasticity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Comparison of Gray Matter Atrophy in Behavioral Variant Frontal Temporal Dementia and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis: A Coordinate-Based Meta-Analysis</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00014</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Background: There is growing evidence supporting behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) as extreme points of a disease spectrum. The aim of this study was to delineate the common and different patterns of gray matter atrophy associated with bvFTD and with ALS by pooling together the results of previous voxel-based morphometry (VBM) studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: We retrieved VBM studies that investigated gray matter atrophy in bvFTD patients vs. controls and in ALS patients vs. controls. Stereotactic data were extracted from those studies and subsequently tested for convergence and differences using activation likelihood estimation (ALE). A behavioral analysis using the BrainMap database was performed to assess the functional roles of the regions affected by bvFTD and/or ALS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Our study demonstrated a convergence of gray matter atrophy in the frontolimbic structures that involve the bilateral anterior insula and anterior cingulate cortex. Comparing the pattern of GM atrophy in bvFTD and ALS patients revealed greater atrophy in the frontomedial cortex, bilateral caudate, left anterior insula, and right thalamus in those with bvFTD and a higher degree of atrophy in the right motor cortex of those with ALS. Behavioral analysis revealed that the pattern of the affected regions contributed to the dysfunction of emotional and cognitive processing in bvFTD patients and the dysfunction of motor execution in ALS patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: Our results revealed a shared neural basis between bvFTD and ALS subjects, as well as a specific and distinct neural signature that underpinned the clinical manifestations of those two diseases. Those findings outlined the role of the frontomedial-caudate circuit in the development of bvFTD-like deficits in ALS patients.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: The Interaction of EphA4 With PDGFRβ Regulates Proliferation and Neuronal Differentiation of Neural Progenitor Cells in vitro and Promotes Neurogenesis in vivo</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00007</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Neural progenitor cells (NPCs) have great potentials in cell replacement therapy for neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD), by promoting neurogenesis associated with hippocampal memory improvement. Ephrin receptors and angiogenic growth factor receptors have a marked impact on the proliferation and differentiation of NPCs. Although ephrin receptor A4 (EphA4) was shown to directly interact with platelet-derived growth factor receptor β (PDGFRβ), the functional effects of this interaction on neurogenesis in cultured NPCs and adult hippocampus have not yet been studied. Immunoprecipitation demonstrated that EphA4 directly interacted with PDGFRβ in NPCs under ligand stimulation. Ephrin-A1 and PDGF-platelet-derived growth factor BB (BB) significantly increased proliferation and neuronal differentiation of NPCs, which was further augmented by combined treatment of Ephrin-A1 and PDGF-BB. We also found that ligand-dependent proliferation and neuronal differentiation were inhibited by the dominant-negative EphA4 mutant or a PDGFR inhibitor. Most importantly, injection of ephrin-A1 and/or PDGF-BB promoted hippocampal NPC proliferation in the APP/PS1 mouse model of AD, indicating that direct interaction of EphA4 with PDGFRβ plays a functional role on neurogenesis in vivo. Finally, studies in NPCs showed that the EphA4/PDGFRβ/FGFR1/FRS2α complex formed by ligand stimulation is involved in neurogenesis via ERK signaling. The present findings provided a novel insight into the functional role of direct interaction of EphA4 and PDGFRβ in neurogenesis, implicating its potential use for treating neurodegenerative diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/52546</link>
	<content:encoded>In higher plants, germline differentiation occurs during a relatively short period within developing flowers. Understanding of the mechanisms that govern germline differentiation lags behind other plant developmental processes. This is largely because the germline is restricted to relatively few cells buried deep within floral tissues, which makes them difficult to study. To overcome this limitation, we have developed a methodology for live imaging of the germ cell lineage within floral organs of Arabidopsis using light sheet fluorescence microscopy. We have established reporter lines, cultivation conditions, and imaging protocols for high-resolution microscopy of developing flowers continuously for up to several days. We used multiview imagining to reconstruct a three-dimensional model of a flower at subcellular resolution. We demonstrate the power of this approach by capturing male and female meiosis, asymmetric pollen division, movement of meiotic chromosomes, and unusual restitution mitosis in tapetum cells. This method will enable new avenues of research into plant sexual reproduction.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Single cell isolation from helminth-infected murine intestines has been notoriously difficult, due to the strong anti-parasite type 2 immune responses that drive mucus production, tissue remodeling and immune cell infiltration. Through the systematic optimization of a standard intestinal digestion protocol, we were able to successfully isolate millions of immune cells from the heavily infected duodenum. To validate that these cells gave an accurate representation of intestinal immune responses, we analyzed them using a high-dimensional spectral flow cytometry panel and confirmed our findings by confocal microscopy. Our cell isolation protocol and high-dimensional analysis allowed us to identify many known hallmarks of anti-parasite immune responses throughout the entire course of helminth infection and has the potential to accelerate single-cell discoveries of local helminth immune responses that have previously been unfeasible.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Biological age measurements (BAs) assess aging-related physiological change and predict health risks among individuals of the same chronological age (CA). Multiple BAs have been proposed and are well studied individually but not jointly. We included 845 individuals and 3973 repeated measurements from a Swedish population-based cohort and examined longitudinal trajectories, correlations, and mortality associations of nine BAs across 20 years follow-up. We found the longitudinal growth of functional BAs accelerated around age 70; average levels of BA curves differed by sex across the age span (50–90 years). All BAs were correlated to varying degrees; correlations were mostly explained by CA. Individually, all BAs except for telomere length were associated with mortality risk independently of CA. The largest effects were seen for methylation age estimators (GrimAge) and the frailty index (FI). In joint models, two methylation age estimators (Horvath and GrimAge) and FI remained predictive, suggesting they are complementary in predicting mortality.</content:encoded>

Within-brothers and within-twin pair analyses were conducted to explore the role of shared familial factors including partly shared genetics. In total, 10,599 men were diagnosed with dementia. The association between one z-score difference in body height and dementia (HR: 0.90, 95% CI: 0.89;0.90) was inverse and weakened slightly after adjustment for intelligence test scores and educational level. The associations persisted in within-brother analysis and revealed a stronger, but less precise, point estimate than the cohort analysis of brothers.

Most viruses have evolved strategies for preventing interferon (IFN) secretion and evading innate immunity. Recent work has shown that viral shutdown of IFN secretion can be viewed as a social trait, since the ability of a given virus to evade IFN-mediated immunity depends on the phenotype of neighbor viruses. Following this idea, we investigate the role of spatial structure in the evolution of innate immunity evasion. For this, we model IFN signaling and viral spread using a spatially explicit approximation that combines a diffusion-reaction model and cellular automaton. Our results indicate that the benefits of preventing IFN secretion for a virus are strongly determined by spatial structure through paracrine IFN signaling. Therefore, innate immunity evasion can evolve as a cooperative or even altruistic trait based on indirect fitness effects that IFN shutdown exerts on other members of the viral population. We identify key factors determining whether evasion from IFN-mediated immunity should evolve, such as population bottlenecks occurring during viral transmission, the relative speed of cellular infection and IFN secretion, and the diffusion properties of the medium.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/AN9UMwyBeOE&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Epithelial-mesenchymal heterogeneity implies that cells within the same tumor can exhibit different phenotypes—epithelial, mesenchymal, or one or more hybrid epithelial-mesenchymal phenotypes. This behavior has been reported across cancer types, both &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;, and implicated in multiple processes associated with metastatic aggressiveness including immune evasion, collective dissemination of tumor cells, and emergence of cancer cell subpopulations with stem cell-like properties. However, the ability of a population of cancer cells to generate, maintain, and propagate this heterogeneity has remained a mystifying feature. Here, we used a computational modeling approach to show that epithelial-mesenchymal heterogeneity can emerge from the noise in the partitioning of biomolecules (such as RNAs and proteins) among daughter cells during the division of a cancer cell. Our model captures the experimentally observed temporal changes in the fractions of different phenotypes in a population of murine prostate cancer cells, and describes the hysteresis in the population-level dynamics of epithelial-mesenchymal plasticity. The model is further able to predict how factors known to promote a hybrid epithelial-mesenchymal phenotype can alter the phenotypic composition of a population. Finally, we used the model to probe the implications of phenotypic heterogeneity and plasticity for different therapeutic regimens and found that co-targeting of epithelial and mesenchymal cells is likely to be the most effective strategy for restricting tumor growth. By connecting the dynamics of an intracellular circuit to the phenotypic composition of a population, our study serves as a first step towards understanding the generation and maintenance of non-genetic heterogeneity in a population of cancer cells, and towards the therapeutic targeting of phenotypic heterogeneity and plasticity in cancer cell populations.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/pd-If0fBoZM&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Daniel Majoral, Ajmal Zemmar, Raul Vicente&lt;/p&gt;

Recent experimental findings indicate that Purkinje cells in the cerebellum represent time intervals by mechanisms other than conventional synaptic weights. These findings add to the theoretical and experimental observations suggesting the presence of intra-cellular mechanisms for adaptation and processing. To account for these experimental results we propose a new biophysical model for time interval learning in a Purkinje cell. The numerical model focuses on a classical delay conditioning task (e.g. eyeblink conditioning) and relies on a few computational steps. In particular, the model posits the activation by the parallel fiber input of a local intra-cellular calcium store which can be modulated by intra-cellular pathways. The reciprocal interaction of the calcium signal with several proteins forming negative and positive feedback loops ensures that the timing of inhibition in the Purkinje cell anticipates the interval between parallel and climbing fiber inputs during training. We systematically test the model ability to learn time intervals at the 150-1000 ms time scale, while observing that learning can also extend to the multiple seconds scale. In agreement with experimental observations we also show that the number of pairings required to learn increases with inter-stimulus interval. Finally, we discuss how this model would allow the cerebellum to detect and generate specific spatio-temporal patterns, a classical theory for cerebellar function.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/2RbSj3cH3UE&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Genetic perturbation screens using RNA interference (RNAi) have been conducted successfully to identify host factors that are essential for the life cycle of bacteria or viruses. So far, most published studies identified host factors primarily for single pathogens. Furthermore, often only a small subset of genes, e.g., genes encoding kinases, have been targeted. Identification of host factors on a pan-pathogen level, i.e., genes that are crucial for the replication of a diverse group of pathogens has received relatively little attention, despite the fact that such common host factors would be highly relevant, for instance, for devising broad-spectrum anti-pathogenic drugs. Here, we present a novel two-stage procedure for the identification of host factors involved in the replication of different viruses using a combination of random effects models and Markov random walks on a functional interaction network. We first infer candidate genes by jointly analyzing multiple perturbations screens while at the same time adjusting for high variance inherent in these screens. Subsequently the inferred estimates are spread across a network of functional interactions thereby allowing for the analysis of missing genes in the biological studies, smoothing the effect sizes of previously found host factors, and considering a priori pathway information defined over edges of the network. We applied the procedure to RNAi screening data of four different positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses, Hepatitis C virus, Chikungunya virus, Dengue virus and Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, and detected novel host factors, including UBC, PLCG1, and DYRK1B, which are predicted to significantly impact the replication cycles of these viruses. We validated the detected host factors experimentally using pharmacological inhibition and an additional siRNA screen and found that some of the predicted host factors indeed influence the replication of these pathogens.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/c7yWpG2SmZk&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Chromatin-enriched RNAs mark active and repressive &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt;-regulation: An analysis of nuclear RNA-seq</title>

Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) localize in the cell nucleus and influence gene expression through a variety of molecular mechanisms. Chromatin-enriched RNAs (cheRNAs) are a unique class of lncRNAs that are tightly bound to chromatin and putatively function to locally &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt;-activate gene transcription. CheRNAs can be identified by biochemical fractionation of nuclear RNA followed by RNA sequencing, but until now, a rigorous analytic pipeline for nuclear RNA-seq has been lacking. In this study, we survey four computational strategies for nuclear RNA-seq data analysis and develop a new pipeline, Tuxedo-ch, which outperforms other approaches. Tuxedo-ch assembles a more complete transcriptome and identifies cheRNA with higher accuracy than other approaches. We used Tuxedo-ch to analyze benchmark datasets of K562 cells and further characterize the genomic features of intergenic cheRNA (icheRNA) and their similarity to enhancer RNAs (eRNAs). We quantify the transcriptional correlation of icheRNA and adjacent genes and show that icheRNA is more positively associated with neighboring gene expression than eRNA or cap analysis of gene expression (CAGE) signals. We also explore two novel genomic associations of cheRNA, which indicate that cheRNAs may function to promote or repress gene expression in a context-dependent manner. IcheRNA loci with significant levels of H3K9me3 modifications are associated with active enhancers, consistent with the hypothesis that enhancers are derived from ancient mobile elements. In contrast, antisense cheRNA (as-cheRNA) may play a role in local gene repression, possibly through local RNA:DNA:DNA triple-helix formation.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/tdefoXQ0d04&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>RSS PAP: Corticotropin releasing factor receptor-1 neurons in the lateral amygdala display selective sensitivity to acute and chronic ethanol exposure</title>
	<link>http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0420-19.2020v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>ABSTRACT&lt;p&gt;The lateral amygdala (LA) serves as the point of entry for sensory information within the amygdala complex, a structure that plays a critical role in emotional processes and has been implicated in alcohol use disorders. Within the amygdala, the corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) system has been shown to mediate some of the effects of both stress and ethanol, but the effects of ethanol on specific CRF1 receptor circuits in the amygdala have not been fully established. We used male CRF1:GFP reporter mice to characterize CRF1-expressing (CRF1+) and non-expressing (CRF1-) LA neurons and investigate the effects of acute and chronic ethanol exposure on these populations. The CRF1+ population was found to be comprised predominantly of glutamatergic projection neurons with a minority subpopulation of interneurons. CRF1+ neurons exhibited a tonic conductance that was insensitive to acute ethanol. CRF1- neurons did not display a basal tonic conductance, but application of acute ethanol induced a  GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptor subunit-dependent tonic conductance and enhanced phasic GABA release onto these cells. Chronic ethanol increased CRF1+ neuronal excitability but did not significantly alter phasic or tonic GABA signaling in either CRF1+ or CRF1- cells. Chronic ethanol and withdrawal also did not alter basal extracellular GABA or glutamate transmitter levels in the LA/BLA and did not alter sensitivity of GABA or glutamate to acute ethanol-induced increases in transmitter release. Together, these results provide the first characterization of the CRF1+ population of LA neurons and suggest mechanisms for differential acute ethanol sensitivity within this region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The corticotropin releasing factor (CRF) system is a critical component of the stress network and has been implicated in psychiatric disorders including addiction, anxiety, and depression. The present study examines CRF receptor-1 (CRF1) lateral amygdala (LA) neurons and reports differential inhibitory control and acute ethanol effects of CRF1 LA neurons as compared to the unlabeled (CRF1-) population. An improved understanding of CRF1 amygdala circuitry and the selective sensitivity of that circuitry to ethanol represents an important step in identifying brain region-specific neuroadaptations that occur with ethanol exposure. The present findings also have broad implications, including potential relevance to the role of CRF1 circuitry in other contexts that may provide insight into other disorders involving amygdala dysfunction, including anxiety and depression.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0390-19.2020v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;The zona incerta is a subthalamic nucleus proposed to link sensory stimuli with motor responses to guide behavior, but its functional role is not well established. Using mice of either sex, we studied the effect of manipulating zona incerta gabaergic cells on the expression of a signaled locomotor action, known as &lt;i&gt;signaled active avoidance&lt;/i&gt;. We found that modulation of gabaergic zona incerta cells, but not of cells in the adjacent thalamic reticular nucleus, fully controls the expression of signaled active avoidance responses. Inhibition of zona incerta gabaergic cells drives active avoidance responses, while excitation of these cells blocks signaled active avoidance mainly by inhibiting cells in the midbrain pedunculopontine tegmentum (PPT). The zona incerta regulates signaled locomotion in the midbrain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; The zona incerta is an enigmatic nucleus in the forebrain whose functional role is not well established. We found that gabaergic cells in the zona incerta, that project to the midbrain, control the ability of mice to avoid a threat signaled by a sensory stimulus. Inhibiting these cells drives avoidance responses, while exciting them blocks avoidance responses by inhibiting targets in the midbrain.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) signals through its cognate receptor tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB) to promote the function of several classes of inhibitory interneurons. We previously reported that loss of BDNF–TrkB signaling in cortistatin (Cort)-expressing interneurons leads to behavioral hyperactivity and spontaneous seizures in mice. We performed bulk RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) from the cortex of mice with disruption of BDNF–TrkB signaling in cortistatin interneurons, and identified differential expression of genes important for excitatory neuron function. Using translating ribosome affinity purification and RNA-seq, we define a molecular profile for Cort-expressing inhibitory neurons and subsequently compare the translatome of normal and TrkB-depleted Cort neurons, revealing alterations in calcium signaling and axon development. Several of the genes enriched in Cort neurons and differentially expressed in TrkB-depleted neurons are also implicated in autism and epilepsy. Our findings highlight TrkB-dependent molecular pathways as critical for the maturation of inhibitory interneurons and support the hypothesis that loss of BDNF signaling in Cort interneurons leads to altered excitatory/inhibitory balance.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2002.02936</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Adenosine receptors are G-protein-coupled receptors involved in a wide range
of physiological and pathological phenomena in most mammalian systems. All four
receptors are widely expressed in the central nervous system, where they
modulate neurotransmitter release and neuronal plasticity. A large number of
gene association studies have shown that common genetic variants of the
adenosine receptors (encoded by the ADORA1, ADORA2A, ADORA2B and ADORA3 genes)
have a neuroprotective or neurodegenerative role in neurologic/psychiatric
diseases. New genetic studies of rare variants and few novel associations with
depression or epilepsy subtypes have recently been reported. Here, we review
the literature on the genetics of adenosine receptors in neurologic and/or
psychiatric diseases in humans, and discuss perspectives for further genetic
research. We also provide an update on the genetic structures of the four human
adenosine receptor genes and their regulation - a topic that has not been
extensively addressed. Our review emphasizes the importance of (i) better
characterizing the genetics of adenosine receptor genes and (ii) understanding
how these genes are regulated.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2002.02807</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Human beings and other vertebrates show remarkable performance and efficiency
in locomotion, but the functioning of their biological control systems for
locomotion is still only partially understood. The basic patterns and timing
for locomotion are provided by a central pattern generator (CPG) in the spinal
cord. The cerebellum is known to play an important role in adaptive locomotion.
Recent studies have given insights into the error signals responsible for
driving the cerebellar adaptation in locomotion. However, the question of how
the cerebellar output influences the gait remains unanswered. We hypothesize
that the cerebellar correction is applied to the pattern formation part of the
CPG. Here, a bio-inspired control system for adaptive locomotion of the
musculoskeletal system of the mouse is presented, where a cerebellar-like
module adapts the step time by using the double support interlimb asymmetry as
a temporal teaching signal. The control system is tested on a simulated mouse
in a split-belt treadmill setup similar to those used in experiments with real
mice. The results show adaptive locomotion behavior in the interlimb parameters
similar to that seen in humans and mice. The control system adaptively
decreases the double support asymmetry that occurs due to environmental
perturbations in the split-belt protocol.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Implementing Inductive bias for different navigation tasks through diverse RNN attractors. (arXiv:2002.02496v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2002.02496</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Navigation is crucial for animal behavior and is assumed to require an
internal representation of the external environment, termed a cognitive map.
The precise form of this representation is often considered to be a metric
representation of space. An internal representation, however, is judged by its
contribution to performance on a given task, and may thus vary between
different types of navigation tasks. Here we train a recurrent neural network
that controls an agent performing several navigation tasks in a simple
environment. To focus on internal representations, we split learning into a
task-agnostic pre-training stage that modifies internal connectivity and a
task-specific Q learning stage that controls the network's output. We show that
pre-training shapes the attractor landscape of the networks, leading to either
a continuous attractor, discrete attractors or a disordered state. These
structures induce bias onto the Q-Learning phase, leading to a performance
pattern across the tasks corresponding to metric and topological regularities.
By combining two types of networks in a modular structure, we could get better
performance for both regularities. Our results show that, in recurrent
networks, inductive bias takes the form of attractor landscapes -- which can be
shaped by pre-training and analyzed using dynamical systems methods.
Furthermore, we demonstrate that non-metric representations are useful for
navigation tasks, and their combination with metric representation leads to
flexibile multiple-task learning.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Criticality or Supersymmetry Breaking ?. (arXiv:1609.00001v3 [q-bio.NC] UPDATED)</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.00001</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In many stochastic dynamical systems, ordinary chaotic behavior is preceded
by a full-dimensional phase that exhibits 1/f-type power-spectra and/or
scale-free statistics of (anti)instantons such as neuroavalanches, earthquakes,
etc. In contrast with the phenomenological concept of self-organized
criticality, the recently developed approximation-free supersymmetric theory of
stochastic differential equations, or stochastics, (STS) identifies this phase
as the noise-induced chaos (N-phase), i.e., the phase where the topological
supersymmetry pertaining to all stochastic dynamical systems is broken
spontaneously by the condensation of the noise-induced (anti-)instantons. Here,
we support this picture in the context of neurodynamics. We study a 1D chain of
neuron-like elements and find that the dynamics in the N-phase is indeed
featured by positive stochastic Lyapunov exponents and dominated by
(anti)instantonic processes of (creation)annihilation of kinks and antikinks,
which can be viewed as predecessors of boundaries of neuroavalanches. We also
construct the phase diagram of emulated stochastic neurodynamics on Spikey
neuromorphic hardware and demonstrate that the width of the N-phase vanishes in
the deterministic limit in accordance with STS. As a first result of the
application of STS to neurodynamics comes the conclusion that a conscious brain
can reside only in the N-phase.

To examine whether primary motor cortex (M1) is involved in maintenance of sequential movements, we trained two monkeys (&lt;i&gt;Cebus apella&lt;/i&gt;) to perform two sequential reaching tasks. In one task, sequential movements were instructed by visual cues, whereas in the other task, movements were generated from memory after extended practice. After the monkey became proficient with performing the tasks, we injected an inhibitor of protein synthesis, anisomycin, into M1 to disrupt information storage in this area. Injection of anisomycin in M1 had a marked effect on the performance of sequential movements that were guided by memory. In contrast, the anisomycin injection did not have a significant effect on the performance of movements guided by vision. These results suggest that M1 of non-human primates is involved in the maintenance of skilled sequential movements.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: latest articles: c-Maf restrains T-bet-driven programming of CCR6-negative group 3 innate lymphoid cells</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/52549</link>
	<content:encoded>RORgt&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; group 3 innate lymphoid cells (ILC3s) maintain intestinal homeostasis through secretion of type 3 cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-17 and IL-22. However, CCR6&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; ILC3s additionally co-express T-bet allowing for the acquisition of type 1 effector functions. While T-bet controls the type 1 programming of ILC3s, the molecular mechanisms governing T-bet are undefined. Here, we identify c-Maf as a crucial negative regulator of murine T-bet&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; CCR6&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; ILC3s. Phenotypic and transcriptomic profiling of c-Maf-deficient CCR6&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; ILC3s revealed a hyper type 1 differentiation status, characterized by overexpression of ILC1/NK cell-related genes and downregulation of type 3 signature genes. On the molecular level, c-Maf directly restrained T-bet expression. Conversely, c-Maf expression was dependent on T-bet and regulated by IL-1b, IL-18 and Notch signals. Thus, we define c-Maf as a crucial cell-intrinsic brake in the type 1 effector acquisition which forms a negative feedback loop with T-bet to preserve the identity of CCR6&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; ILC3s.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/52258</link>
	<content:encoded>Distinctions between cell types underpin organisational principles for nervous system function. Functional variation also exists between neurons of the same type. This is exemplified by correspondence between grid cell spatial scales and synaptic integrative properties of stellate cells (SCs) in the medial entorhinal cortex. However, we know little about how functional variability is structured either within or between individuals. Using ex-vivo patch-clamp recordings from up to 55 SCs per mouse, we find that integrative properties vary between mice and, in contrast to modularity of grid cell spatial scales, have a continuous dorsoventral organisation. Our results constrain mechanisms for modular grid firing and provide evidence for inter-animal phenotypic variability among neurons of the same type. We suggest that neuron type properties are tuned to circuit level set points that vary within and between animals.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/52125</link>
	<content:encoded>Bacteriophage T7 infects &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; and evades the host restriction/modification system. The Ocr protein of T7 was shown to exist as a dimer mimicking DNA and to bind to host restriction enzymes, thus preventing the degradation of the viral genome by the host. Here we report that Ocr can also inhibit host transcription by directly binding to bacterial RNA polymerase (RNAP) and competing with the recruitment of RNAP by sigma factors. Using cryo electron microscopy, we determined the structures of Ocr bound to RNAP. The structures show that an Ocr dimer binds to RNAP in the cleft, where key regions of sigma bind and where DNA resides during transcription synthesis, thus providing a structural basis for the transcription inhibition. Our results reveal the versatility of Ocr in interfering with host systems and suggest possible strategies that could be exploited in adopting DNA mimicry as a basis for forming novel antibiotics.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/50022</link>
	<content:encoded>Transport of fluids, molecules, nutrients or nanoparticles through coral tissues are poorly documented. Here, we followed the flow of various tracers from the external seawater to within the cells of all tissues in living animals. After entering the general coelenteric cavity, we show that nanoparticles disperse throughout the tissues via the paracellular pathway. Then, the ubiquitous entry gate to within the cells' cytoplasm is macropinocytosis. Most cells form large vesicles of 350-600 nm in diameter at their apical side, continuously internalizing their surrounding medium. Macropinocytosis was confirmed using specific inhibitors of PI3K and actin polymerization. Nanoparticle internalization dynamics is size dependent and differs between tissues. Furthermore, we reveal that macropinocytosis is likely a major endocytic pathway in other anthozoan species. The fact that nearly all cells of an animal are continuously soaking in the environment challenges many aspects of the classical physiology viewpoints acquired from the study of bilaterians.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.02.10.942011v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract: ABCD is a longitudinal, observational study of U.S. children, ages 9-10 at baseline, recruited at random from the household populations in defined catchment areas for each of 21 study sites. The 21 geographic locations that comprise the ABCD research sites are nationally distributed and generally represent the range of demographic and socio-economic diversity of the U.S. birth cohorts that comprise the ABCD study population. The clustering of participants and the potential for selection bias in study site selection and enrollment are features of the ABCD observational study design that are informative for statistical estimation and inference. Both multi-level modeling and robust survey design-based methods can be used to account for clustering of sampled ABCD children in the 21 study sites. Covariate controls in analytical models and propensity weighting methods that calibrate ABCD weighted distributions to nationally-representative controls from the American Community Survey (ACS) can be employed in analysis to account for known informative sample design features or to attenuate potential demographic and socio-economic selection bias in the national sampling and recruitment of eligible children. This guide will present results of an empirical investigation of the ABCD baseline data that compares the statistical efficiency of multi-level modeling and distribution-free design-based approaches--both weighted and unweighted--to analyses of the ABCD baseline data. Specific recommendations will be provided for researchers on robust, efficient approaches to both descriptive and multivariate analyses of the ABCD baseline data.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.02.10.941625v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>The importance of glial cells in the modulation of neuronal processes is now generally accepted. In particular, enormous progress in our understanding of astrocytes and microglia physiology in the central nervous system (CNS) has been made in recent years, due to the development of genetic and molecular toolkits. However, the roles of satellite glial cells (SGCs) and macrophages - the peripheral counterparts of astrocytes and microglia - remain poorly studied despite their involvement in debilitating conditions, such as pain. Here, we characterized in dorsal root ganglia (DRGs), different genetically-modified mouse lines previously used for studying astrocytes and microglia, with the goal to implement them for investigating DRG SGC and macrophage functions. Although SGCs and astrocytes share some molecular properties, most tested transgenic lines were found to not be suitable for studying selectively a large number of SGCs within DRGs. Nevertheless, we identified and validated two mouse lines: (i) a CreERT2 recombinase-based mouse line allowing transgene expression almost exclusively in SGCs and in the vast majority of SGCs, and (ii) a GFP-expressing line allowing the selective visualization of macrophages. In conclusion, among the tools available for exploring astrocyte functions, a few can be used for studying selectively a great proportion of SGCs. Thus, efforts remain to be made to characterize other available mouse lines as well as to develop, rigorously characterize and validate new molecular tools to investigate the roles of DRG SGCs, but also macrophages, in health and disease.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>The insular cortex (IC) plays key roles in emotional and regulatory brain functions and is affected across psychiatric diseases. However, the brain-wide connections of the mouse IC have not been comprehensively mapped. Here we traced the whole-brain inputs and outputs of the mouse IC across its rostro-caudal extent. We employed cell-type specific monosynaptic rabies virus tracings to characterize afferent connections onto either excitatory or inhibitory IC neurons, and adeno-associated viral tracings to label excitatory efferent axons. While the connectivity between the IC and other cortical regions was highly reciprocal, the IC connectivity with subcortical structures was often unidirectional, revealing prominent top-down and bottom-up pathways. The posterior and medial IC exhibited resembling connectivity patterns, while the anterior IC connectivity was distinct, suggesting two major functional compartments. Our results provide insights into the anatomical architecture of the mouse IC and thus a structural basis to guide investigations into its complex functions.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.02.10.941377v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Knowledge of mechanisms involved in vulnerability/resilience to stress disorders is crucial for prevention and treatment schemes. We previously documented that insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) is associated to vulnerability to stress both in mice and humans. Since hypothalamic orexin neurons express IGF-I receptors and are involved in responses to stress, we analyzed their role in the modulatory actions of IGF-I on stress. Anxiolytic actions of IGF-I after exposure to a predator were absent in mice lacking IGF-I receptors in orexin neurons (Firoc mice). Based on these observations we speculated that Firoc mice may be prone to develop fear-related disturbances, including post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)-like symptoms when confronted to fear learning, a process that is postulated to be altered in PTSD. Firoc mice submitted to fear conditioning showed increased freezing responses, suggesting aberrant fear learning. Exaggerated freezing was accompanied by increased levels of orexin, together with enhanced c-fos staining of these neurons, an indicator of increased cell activity, and of noradrenergic neurons of the locus coeruleus nucleus, a region downstream of orexinergic activation. After fear conditioning, Firoc mice developed PTSD-like behavioral traits such as prolonged context-dependent fear and post-stress anhedonia. Since abnormal fear learning was ameliorated by chemogenetic (DREADD) inhibition of orexin neurons, reduced IGF-I input to orexin neurons in Firoc mice seems to enhance their excitability to fear-related inputs. Collectively, these results suggest that IGF-I input to orexin neurons is an important determinant of vulnerability to stress disorders, which provides additional targets for therapy of these high social impact conditions.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.02.10.939561v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Structural and functional characteristics of the cortex systematically vary along global axes as a function of cytoarchitecture, gene expression, and connectivity. The topology of the cerebral cortex has been proposed to be a prerequisite for the emergence of human cognition and explain both the impact and progression of pathology. However, the neurogenetic origin of these organizational axes in humans remains incompletely understood. To address this gap in the literature our current study assessed macro scale cortical organization through an unsupervised machine learning analysis of cortical thickness covariance patterns and used converging methods to evaluate its genetic basis. In a large-scale sample of twins (n=899) we found structural covariance of thickness to be organized along both an anterior-to-posterior and inferior-to-superior axes. We found that both axes showed a high degree of correspondence in pairs of identical twins, suggesting a strong heritable component in humans. Furthermore, comparing these dimensions in macaques and humans highlighted similar organizational principles in both species demonstrating that these axes of cortical organization are phylogenetically conserved within primate species. Finally, we found that in both humans and macaques the inferior-superior dimension of cortical organization was aligned with the predictions of the dual-origin theory, highlighting the possibility that the macroscale organization of primate brain structure is subject to multiple distinct neurodevelopmental trajectories. Together, our study establishes the genetic basis of natural axes in the cerebral cortex along which structure is organized and so provides important insights into the organization of human cognition that will inform both our understanding of how structure guides function and for the progression of pathology in diseases.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.02.10.927012v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are the first line treatment for major depressive disorder (MDD), yet their mechanisms of action are not fully understood and their therapeutic benefit varies among individuals. We used a targeted metabolomics approach utilizing a panel of 180 metabolites to gain insights into mechanisms of action and response to citalopram/escitalopram. Plasma samples from 136 participants with MDD enrolled into the Mayo Pharmacogenomics Research Network Antidepressant Medication Pharmacogenomic Study (PGRN-AMPS) were profiled at baseline and after 8 weeks of treatment. After treatment, we saw increased levels of short chain acylcarnitines and decreased levels of medium and long chain acylcarnitines, suggesting an SSRI effect on {beta}-oxidation and mitochondrial function. Amines including arginine, proline, and methionine sulfoxide were upregulated while serotonin and sarcosine were downregulated, suggesting an SSRI effect on urea cycle, one-carbon metabolism and serotonin uptake. Eighteen lipids within the phosphatidylcholine (PC aa and ae) classes were upregulated. Changes in several lipid and amine levels correlated with changes in 17 item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression scores (HRSD17). Differences in metabolic profiles at baseline and post-treatment were noted between participants who remitted (HRSD17[≤]7) and those who gained no meaningful benefits (&amp;lt;30% reduction in HRSD17). Remitters exhibited a) higher baseline levels of C3, C5, alpha-aminoadipic acid, sarcosine and serotonin; and b) higher week-8 levels of PC aa C34:1, PC aa C34:2, PC aa C36:2 and PC aa C36:4. These findings suggest that mitochondrial energetics including acylcarnitine metabolism, transport and its link to {beta}-oxidation and lipid membrane remodeling may play roles in SSRI treatment response.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Axons of midbrain dopaminergic neurons innervate the striatum where they contribute to movement and reinforcement learning. Past work has shown that striatal GABA tonically inhibits dopamine release, but whether GABA-A receptors directly modulate transmission or act indirectly through circuit elements is unresolved. Here, we use whole-cell and perforated-patch recordings to test for GABA-A receptors on the main dopaminergic neuron axons and branching processes within striatum. Application of GABA depolarized axons, but also decreased the amplitude of axonal spikes, limited propagation and reduced striatal dopamine release. The mechanism of inhibition involved sodium channel inactivation and shunting. Lastly, we show that the positive allosteric modulator diazepam enhanced GABA-A currents on dopaminergic neuron axons and directly inhibited release, but also likely acts by reducing excitatory drive from cholinergic interneurons. Thus, we reveal the mechanisms of GABA-A receptor modulation of dopamine release and provide new insight into the actions of benzodiazepines within the striatum.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Delta oscillations (0.5-4 Hz) are a robust but often overlooked feature of basal ganglia pathophysiology in Parkinson's disease and their relationship to parkinsonian akinesia has not been investigated. Here, we establish a novel approach to detect spike oscillations embedded in noise to provide the first study of delta oscillations in awake, dopamine depleted mice. We find that approximately half of neurons in the substantia nigra reticulata exhibit delta oscillations in dopamine depletion and that these oscillations are a strong indicator of dopamine loss and akinesia, outperforming measures such as changes in firing rate, irregularity, bursting and synchrony. We further establish that these oscillations are caused by the loss of D2 receptor activation and do not require motor cortex, contrary to previous findings in anesthetized animals. These results give insight into how dopamine loss leads to dysfunction and suggest a reappraisal of delta oscillations as a biomarker in Parkinson's disease.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.02.09.940858v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Background: Exposure to childhood adversity has been consistently associated with poor developmental outcomes, but it is unclear whether these associations vary across different forms of adversity. We examined cross-sectional and longitudinal associations between two types of adversity, threat and deprivation, with cognition, emotional processing, and psychopathology in a middle-income country. Methods: The sample consisted of 2,511 children and adolescents (6-17 years old) from the Brazilian High-Risk Cohort for Psychiatric Disorders. Parent reports on childhood adversity were used to construct threat and deprivation latent constructs. Psychopathology was measured by the CBCL which generated a measure of general psychopathology (the p factor). Executive function (EF) and attention orienting toward angry faces were assessed using cognitive tasks. All measures were acquired at two time-points 3-years apart. Cross-lagged panel models were estimated to evaluate longitudinal associations. Results: Psychopathology was associated with threat and deprivation cross-sectionally, and higher levels of threat and deprivation predicted increases in general psychopathology at follow-up. For EF, worse performance was more strongly associated with deprivation than threat at baseline, and only with deprivation at follow-up. Deprivation was associated with attention orienting away from angry faces cross-sectionally, but neither form of adversity was associated with changes over time in attention bias. Conclusion: Both types of adversity are associated with current and future psychopathology and with current, but not future, EF. Threat was more strongly linked to higher psychopathology, whereas deprivation was more strongly linked to lower EF. Lack of longitudinal associations between deprivation and EF mean reverse causality cannot be excluded.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.02.09.940841v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Both the right inferior frontal gyrus (rIFG) and the pre-supplementary motor area (pre-SMA) are crucial for successful response inhibition. However, the particular functional roles of those two regions have been controversially debated for more than a decade now. It is unclear whether the rIFG directly initiates stopping or serves an attentional function, whereas the stopping is triggered by the pre-SMA. The current multimodal MEG/fMRI study sought to clarify the role and temporal activation order of both regions in response inhibition using a selective stopping task. This task dissociates inhibitory from attentional processes. Our results reliably reveal a temporal precedence of rIFG over pre-SMA. Moreover, connectivity during response inhibition is directed from rIFG to pre-SMA and predicts stopping performance. Response inhibition is implemented via beta-band oscillations. Our findings support the hypothesis that response inhibition is initiated by the rIFG as a form of attention-independent top-down control.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.02.09.940817v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Synchronization is a collective mechanism by which oscillatory networks achieve their functions. Factors driving synchronization include the network's topological and dynamical properties. However, how these factors drive the emergence of synchronization in the presence of potentially disruptive external inputs like stochastic perturbations is not well understood, particularly for real-world systems such as the human brain. Here, we aim to systematically address this problem using a large-scale model of the human brain network (i.e., the human connectome). The results show that the model can produce complex synchronization patterns transitioning between incoherent and coherent states. When nodes in the network are coupled at some critical strength, a counterintuitive phenomenon emerges where the addition of noise increases the synchronization of global and local dynamics, with structural hub nodes benefiting the most. This stochastic synchronization effect is found to be driven by the intrinsic hierarchy of neural timescales of the brain and the heterogeneous complex topology of the connectome. Moreover, the effect coincides with clustering of node phases and strengthening of the functional connectivity of some of the connectome's subnetworks. Overall, the work provides broad theoretical insights into the emergence and mechanisms of stochastic synchronization, highlighting its putative contribution in achieving network integration underpinning brain function.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.02.09.940726v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Little is known about the hippocampus dentations - or &quot;bumps&quot; on the inferior surface of the hippocampus - and whether they hold functional significance. Empirical work on these features is beginning to emerge, but no study has yet been conducted in which their spatial positions are demarcated, and their putative role in individual differences in memory is based on a single small study. We gathered ultra-high resolution isotropic MTL scans from a young-adult sample and performed such measurements. On the long axis, we found smaller and denser dentations moving towards the hippocampus' posterior extent. Although other reports have distinguished the functional characteristics of anterior and posterior hippocampal dentations, we found hardly any were actually localized in the hippocampal head, with half of participants featuring no anterior dentations at all. We also observed more numerous dentations in the left hemisphere than right, and found this asymmetry tracked right-hand dominance. All dentations lay specifically within the CA1 subfield, which was thicker at dentations - protruding below standard lower boundary of the hippocampus - as well as larger in participants with more dentations, suggesting dentations reflect CA1 growth rather than mere folding. Finally, we observed an association between dentations and visual source memory, but not recognition memory. The current report is the first to characterize the spatial properties of this intriguing neuroanatomical feature, which requires the direct spatial labeling of dentations. Further to better characterizing this intriguing neuroanatomical feature, we provide some confirmatory evidence for a link to episodic memory, although we found evidence for this link to be less overwhelming than initially reported.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.02.09.940643v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Approaches to predictably control neural oscillations are needed to understand their causal role in brain function in healthy and diseased states and to advance the development of neuromodulation therapies. In this article, we present a neural control approach and optimization framework to actively suppress or amplify neural oscillations observed in local field potentials in real-time by using electrical stimulation. The rationale behind this control approach is that neural oscillatory activity evoked by electrical pulses can suppress or amplify spontaneous oscillations via destructive or constructive interference when stimulation pulses are continuously delivered at precise phases of these oscillations in a closed-loop scheme. We demonstrate that this technique, referred to as phase-locked brain stimulation, is capable of actively suppressing or amplifying 8-17 Hz oscillations in the subthalamic nucleus of two parkinsonian nonhuman primates, which exhibited a robust increase in oscillatory power in this frequency band following administration of the neurotoxin MPTP (1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine).</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Lower intake of animal-based products links to improved weight status, independent of depressive symptoms and personality in the general population</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.02.09.940460v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Background: Restricting animal-based products from diet may exert beneficial effects on weight status, however whether this is also true for emotional health is unclear. Moreover, differential personality traits may underlie restrictive eating habits and therefore potentially confound diet-health associations. To systematically assess whether restrictive dietary intake of animal-based products relates to lower weight and higher depressive symptoms, and how this is linked to personality traits in the general population. Methods: Cross-sectional data was taken from the baseline LIFE-Adult study collected from 2011-2014 in Leipzig, Germany (n = 8943). Main outcomes of interest were 12-month dietary frequency of animal-derived products measured using a Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ), body mass index (BMI) (kg/m2), and the Center of Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CES-D). Personality traits were assessed in a subsample of n = 7906 using the Five Factor Inventory (NEO-FFI). Findings: Higher restriction of animal-based product intake was associated with a lower BMI, but not depression score. Personality, i.e. lower extraversion, was related to frequency of animal product intake. Further, not diet but personality was significantly associated with depression, i.e. higher neuroticism, lower extraversion, lower agreeableness, lower conscientiousness and higher BMI. The beneficial association with lower weight seemed to be driven by the frequency of meat product intake and not secondary animal products. Likewise, the overall number of excluded food items from the individual diet was associated with a lower BMI and additionally with lower depression scores, also when additionally correcting for differences in personality traits. Interpretation: Higher restriction of animal-based products in the diet was significantly associated with a lower BMI, but not with depressive symptoms scores in a large well-characterized population-based sample of adults. In addition, we found that certain personality traits related to restricting animal-based products - and that those traits, but not dietary habits, explained a considerable amount of variance in depressive symptoms. Upcoming longitudinal studies need to confirm these findings and to test the hypothesis if restricting animal-based products, esp. primary animal products ((processed) meat, wurst), conveys benefits on weights status, hinting to a beneficial relationship of animal-based restricted diets in regard to prevention and treatment of overweight and obesity.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Aesthetic preference for art emerges from a weighted integration over hierarchically structured visual features in the brain</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.02.09.940353v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>It is an open question whether preferences for visual art can be lawfully predicted from the basic constituent elements of a visual image. Moreover, little is known about how such preferences are actually constructed in the brain. Here we developed and tested a computational framework to gain an understanding of how the human brain constructs aesthetic value. We show that it is possible to explain human preferences for a piece of art based on an analysis of features present in the image. This was achieved by analyzing the visual properties of drawings and photographs by multiple means, ranging from image statistics extracted by computer vision tools, subjective human ratings about attributes, to a deep convolutional neural network. Crucially, it is possible to predict subjective value ratings not only within but also across individuals, speaking to the possibility that much of the variance in human visual preference is shared across individuals. Neuroimaging data revealed that preference computations occur in the brain by means of a graded hierarchical representation of lower and higher level features in the visual system. These features are in turn integrated to compute an overall subjective preference in the parietal and prefrontal cortex. Our findings suggest that rather than being idiosyncratic, human preferences for art can be explained at least in part as a product of a systematic neural integration over underlying visual features of an image. This work not only advances our understanding of the brain-wide computations underlying value construction but also brings new mechanistic insights to the study of visual aesthetics and art appreciation.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.02.08.940189v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>In the last two decades rodents have been on the rise as a dominant model for visual neuroscience. This is particularly true for earlier levels of information processing, but high-profile papers have suggested that also higher levels of processing such as invariant object recognition occur in rodents. Here we provide a quantitative and comprehensive assessment of this claim by comparing a wide range of rodent behavioral and neural data with convolutional deep neural networks. These networks have been shown to capture the richness of information processing in primates through a succession of convolutional and fully connected layers. We find that rodent object vision can be captured using low to mid-level convolutional layers only, without any convincing evidence for the need of higher layers known to simulate complex object recognition in primates. Our approach also reveals surprising insights on assumptions made before, for example, that the best performing animals would be the ones using the most complex representations - which we show to likely be incorrect. Our findings suggest a road ahead for further studies aiming at quantifying and establishing the richness of representations underlying information processing in animal models at large.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Neuroplasticity is essential to learning and memory in the brain; it has therefore also been implicated in numerous neurological and psychiatric disorders, making measuring the state of neuroplasticity of foremost importance to clinical neuroscience. Long-term potentiation (LTP) is a key mechanism of neuroplasticity and has been studied extensively, and invasively in non-human animals. Translation to human application largely relies on the validation of non-invasive measures of LTP. The current study provides validation for the use of a thalamocortical computational model of visual cortex for investigating and replicating interlaminar connectivity changes using non-invasive EEG recording of humans, and a commonly used visual sensory LTP paradigm. The model demonstrated remarkable accuracy recapitulating post-tetanus changes including increased excitatory connectivity from thalamus to layer IV and from layer IV to II/III. The findings also further validate visual sensory induced LTP and evoked potential modulation for measuring of the state of LTP in cortex.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.02.08.939744v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Information transfer, measured by transfer entropy, is a key component of distributed computation. It is therefore important to understand the pattern of information transfer in order to unravel the distributed computational algorithms of a system. Since in many natural systems distributed computation is thought to rely on rhythmic processes a frequency resolved measure of information transfer is highly desirable. Here, we present a novel algorithm, and its efficient implementation, to identify separately frequencies sending and receiving information in a network. Our approach relies on the invertible maximum overlap discrete wavelet transform (MODWT) for the creation of surrogate data in the computation of transfer entropy and entirely avoids filtering of the original signals. The approach thereby avoids well-known problems due to phase shifts or the ineffectiveness of filtering in the information theoretic setting. We also show that measuring frequency-resolved information transfer is a partial information decomposition problem that cannot be fully resolved to date and discuss the implications of this issue. Last, we evaluate the performance of our algorithm on simulated data and apply it to human magnetoencephalography (MEG) recordings and to local field potential recordings in the ferret. In human MEG we demonstrate top-down information flow in temporal cortex from very high frequencies (above 100Hz) to both similarly high frequencies and to frequencies around 20Hz, i.e. a complex spectral configuration of cortical information transmission that has not been described before. In the ferret we show that the prefrontal cortex sends information at low frequencies (4-8 Hz) to early visual cortex (V1), while V1 receives the information at high frequencies (&amp;gt;125 Hz).</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Protein synthesis must be finely tuned in the nervous system, as it represents an essential feature of neurodevelopmental gene expression, and dominant pathology in neurological disease. However, the architecture of ribosomal complexes in the developing mammalian brain has not been analyzed at high resolution. This study investigates the architecture of ribosomes ex vivo from the embryonic and perinatal mouse neocortex, revealing Ebp1 as a 60S peptide tunnel exit binding factor at near-atomic resolution by multiparticle cryo-electron microscopy. The impact of Ebp1 on the neuronal proteome was analyzed by pSILAC and BONCAT coupled mass spectrometry, implicating Ebp1 in neurite outgrowth proteostasis, with in vivo embryonic Ebp1 knockdown resulting in dysregulation of neurite outgrowth. Our findings reveal Ebp1 as a central component of neocortical protein synthesis, and the 60S peptide tunnel exit as a focal point of gene expression control in the molecular specification of neuronal morphology.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Models that aim to explain electrophysiological responses to linguistic processing (e.g., the N400 and P600 components) typically assume that the representation of linguistic input is error-free. Recent evidence suggests that language processing mechanisms are well-adapted to input corrupted by noise (e.g., speech errors, mishearing) and readily correct for it via rational inference over possible intended sentences and probable noise corruptions. We hypothesize that a P600 ensues whenever the probability that the message was corrupted by noise exceeds the probability that it was produced intentionally and perceived accurately. We show that semantic violations that are attributable to noise--for example, in &quot;The storyteller could turn any incident into an amusing antidote&quot;, the implausible word &quot;antidote&quot; is orthographically and phonologically close to the intended &quot;anecdote&quot;--elicit a P600 (rather than N400). Further, the magnitude of this P600 is shown to relate to the probability that the comprehender will retrieve a plausible alternative.</content:encoded>

&lt;p&gt;


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Graphic illustration of the effect of injury and early TLR4 antagonist treatment on early network excitability and the long‐term network state. The schematic neurons include TLR4 and AMPAR subunit expression profiles in the acute phase of sham or brain injury. The corresponding early effects on network excitability are depicted by schematic population response traces (inset on upper left). Note the increase in excitability of the uninjured neuron after TLR4 antagonism without changes in AMPAR expression. Note also the increase in TLR4, calcium permeable AMPARs and population excitability after injury and its reduction by TLR4 antagonist treatment. Ampakine enhancement of excitability during TLR4 antagonism is illustrated. The early phase responses and manipulations (including injury, treatments, and molecular responses) are superimposed on a two‐tone color‐coded network state topology where green indicates low‐normal network excitability, ensuring network stability and low risk for epilepsy (Inset on upper right). Note the correspondence between early excitability state (population response profile) and long‐term seizure susceptibility and the effects of pharmacological manipulations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Traumatic brain injury is a major risk factor for acquired epilepsies and understanding the mechanisms underlying the early pathophysiology could yield viable therapeutic targets. Growing evidence indicates a role for inflammatory signaling in modifying neuronal excitability and promoting epileptogenesis. Here we examined the effect of innate immune receptor, toll‐like receptor 4 (TLR4) on excitability of the hippocampal dentate gyrus and epileptogenesis after brain injury.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slice and in vivo electrophysiology and western blots were conducted in rats subject to fluid percussion brain injury or sham injury.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The studies identify that TLR4 signaling in neurons, augments dentate granule cell calcium‐permeable AMPA receptor (CP‐AMPAR) currents after brain injury. Blocking TLR4 signaling &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; shortly after brain injury reduced dentate network excitability and seizure susceptibility. When blocking of TLR4 signaling after injury was delayed, however, this treatment failed to reduce post‐injury seizure susceptibility. Further, TLR4 signal blocking was less efficacious in limiting seizure susceptibility when AMPAR currents, downstream targets of TLR4 signaling, were transiently enhanced. Paradoxically, blocking TLR4 signaling augmented both network excitability and seizure susceptibility in uninjured controls. Despite the differential effect on seizure susceptibility, TLR4 antagonism suppressed cellular inflammatory responses after injury without impacting sham controls.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These findings demonstrate that independently of glia, the immune receptor TLR4 directly regulates post‐traumatic neuronal excitability. Moreover, the TLR4‐dependent early increase in dentate excitability is causally associated with epileptogenesis. Identification and selective targeting of the mechanisms underlying the aberrant TLR4‐mediated increase in CP‐AMPAR signaling after injury may prevent epileptogenesis after brain trauma.&lt;/p&gt;

	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25697?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although migraine is defined by the headache and headache associated symptoms, the true beginning of a migraine attack lies in the premonitory phase and to understand the generation of attacks one needs to investigate the phase before headache starts. The premonitory phase of migraine is characterized by a well described complex of symptoms. Its duration, however, is not clearly defined and there are to date no biomarkers to help defining when this phase starts.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here we used functional magnetic resonance imaging to elucidate the duration of the premonitory phase in spontaneous human migraine attacks. As migraine attacks are hardly predictable and thereby the premonitory phase difficult to catch, we scanned nine patients daily over a minimum period of 30 days using a well‐established paradigm for functional MRI of trigeminal nociception.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seven patients were included in the analysis thus providing cumulative data of 27 spontaneous human migraine attacks including scans before, during and after migraine pain as well as interictal scans. As a response to painful trigeminal stimulation activation of the hypothalamus was present within the last 48 hours before headache onset but not earlier.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using hypothalamic activation as a potential marker for the premonitory phase of migraine in this unique data set, our data thus corroborate a duration of 48 hours for the premonitory phase of migraine and we suggest to apply this timely criterion in future studies when focussing on this particular phase of the migraine cycle.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: Coffee consumption and risk of stroke: a Mendelian randomization study</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25693?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Observational epidemiological studies have reported a relationship between coffee intake and risk of stroke. However, evidence for this association is inconsistent and it remains uncertain whether the association is causal or due to confounding or reverse causality. To clarify this relationship, we adopted a Mendelian randomization (MR) approach to evaluate the effects of coffee consumption on the risk of stroke and its subtypes.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Method&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A meta‐analysis of genome‐wide association studies (GWASs) including 91,462 coffee consumers was used to identify instruments for coffee consumption. Summary‐level data for stroke, intracerebral hemorrhage, ischemic stroke (IS) and IS subtypes were obtained from GWAS meta‐analyses conducted by the MEGASTROKE consortium. MR analyses were performed using the inverse‐variance‐weighted (IVW), weighted‐median, MR Pleiotropy RESidual Sum and Outlier (PRESSO) test and MR‐Egger regression. Sensitivity analyses were further performed using alternative instruments to test the robustness of our findings.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Genetically predicted coffee consumption (high vs. infrequent/no) was not associated with risk of stroke. Similarly, among coffee consumers, MR analysis did not indicate causal associations between coffee consumption (cups/day) and risk of stroke. However, in the subgroup analysis, we found weak suggestive evidence for a potential protective effect of coffee consumption on risk of small vessel ischemic stroke (SV‐IS), though the association did not reach statistical significance after correction for multiple comparisons.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study suggests that coffee consumption is not causally associated with risk of stroke or its subtypes. Further studies are warranted to elucidate the possible association between coffee intake and risk of SV‐IS, as well as its potential underlying mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: Visual dysfunction of the superior colliculus in de novo Parkinsonian patients</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25696?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Objectives&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;i&gt;dual hit&lt;/i&gt; hypothesis about the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease suggests that the brainstem is a convergent area for the propagation of pathological α‐synuclein from the periphery to the brain. While brainstem structures are likely to be affected early in the course of the disease, detailed information regarding specific brainstem regions is lacking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The aim of our study was to investigate the function of the superior colliculus, a sensori‐motor brainstem structure, in &lt;i&gt;de novo&lt;/i&gt; Parkinson's patients compared to controls using brain functional magnetic imaging and visual stimulation paradigms.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;De novo&lt;/i&gt; Parkinson's patients and controls were recruited. PD subjects were imaged before and after starting PD medications. A recently developed functional magnetic resonance imaging protocol was used to stimulate and visualize the superior colliculus and two other visual structures: the lateral geniculate nucleus and the primary visual cortex.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the 22 parkinsonian patients, there was no modulation of the superior colliculus responses to the luminance contrasts compared to controls. This implies a hypersensitivity to low luminance contrast and abnormal rapid BOLD signal saturation to high luminance contrasts. The lateral geniculate nucleus was only modulated by 3%‐9% luminance contrasts, compared to controls. No major differences were found in the primary visual cortex between both groups.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our findings suggest that pathological superior colliculus visual responses in &lt;i&gt;de novo&lt;/i&gt; Parkinson's disease patients are present early on the course of the disease. Thus, changes in imaging the superior colliculus could play an important role as a preclinical biomarker of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: SmartPhase: Accurate and fast phasing of heterozygous variant pairs for genetic diagnosis of rare diseases</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/dzGC1WVgeuM/article</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Paul Hager, Hans-Werner Mewes, Meino Rohlfs, Christoph Klein, Tim Jeske&lt;/p&gt;

There is an increasing need to use genome and transcriptome sequencing to genetically diagnose patients suffering from suspected monogenic rare diseases. The proper detection of compound heterozygous variant combinations as disease-causing candidates is a challenge in diagnostic workflows as haplotype information is lost by currently used next-generation sequencing technologies. Consequently, computational tools are required to phase, or resolve the haplotype of, the high number of heterozygous variants in the exome or genome of each patient. Here we present SmartPhase, a phasing tool designed to efficiently reduce the set of potential compound heterozygous variant pairs in genetic diagnoses pipelines. The phasing algorithm of SmartPhase creates haplotypes using both parental genotype information and reads generated by DNA or RNA sequencing and is thus well suited to resolve the phase of rare variants. To inform the user about the reliability of a phasing prediction, it computes a confidence score which is essential to select error-free predictions. It incorporates existing haplotype information and applies logical rules to determine variants that can be excluded as causing a recessive, monogenic disease. SmartPhase can phase either all possible variant pairs in predefined genetic loci or preselected variant pairs of interest, thus keeping the focus on clinically relevant results. We compared SmartPhase to WhatsHap, one of the leading comparable phasing tools, using simulated data and a real clinical cohort of 921 patients. On both data sets, SmartPhase generated error-free predictions using our derived confidence score threshold. It outperformed WhatsHap with regard to the percentage of resolved pairs when parental genotype information is available. On the cohort data, SmartPhase enabled on average the exclusion of approximately 22% of the input variant pairs in each singleton patient and 44% in each trio patient. SmartPhase is implemented as an open-source Java tool and freely available at http://ibis.helmholtz-muenchen.de/smartphase/.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/dzGC1WVgeuM&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Computational protein design of an ensemble of conformations for one protein–&lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;i&gt;e&lt;/i&gt;., multi-state design–determines the side chain identity by optimizing the energetic contributions of that side chain in each of the backbone conformations. Sampling the resulting large sequence-structure search space limits the number of conformations and the size of proteins in multi-state design algorithms. Here, we demonstrated that the REstrained CONvergence (RECON) algorithm can simultaneously evaluate the sequence of large proteins that undergo substantial conformational changes. Simultaneous optimization of side chain conformations across all conformations increased sequence conservation when compared to single-state designs in all cases. More importantly, the sequence space sampled by RECON MSD resembled the evolutionary sequence space of flexible proteins, particularly when confined to predicting the mutational preferences of limited common ancestral descent, such as in the case of influenza type A hemagglutinin. Additionally, we found that sequence positions which require substantial changes in their local environment across an ensemble of conformations are more likely to be conserved. These increased conservation rates are better captured by RECON MSD over multiple conformations and thus multiple local residue environments during design. To quantify this rewiring of contacts at a certain position in sequence and structure, we introduced a new metric designated ‘contact proximity deviation’ that enumerates contact map changes. This measure allows mapping of global conformational changes into local side chain proximity adjustments, a property not captured by traditional global similarity metrics such as RMSD or local similarity metrics such as changes in φ and ψ angles.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/KQCfRaWtDY0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Influenza A viruses cause seasonal epidemics and occasional pandemics in the human population. While the worldwide circulation of seasonal influenza is at least partly understood, the exact migration patterns between countries, states or cities are not well studied. Here, we use the Sankoff algorithm for parsimonious phylogeographic reconstruction together with effective distances based on a worldwide air transportation network. By first simulating geographic spread and then phylogenetic trees and genetic sequences, we confirmed that reconstructions with effective distances inferred phylogeographic spread more accurately than reconstructions with geographic distances and Bayesian reconstructions with BEAST that do not use any distance information, and led to comparable results to the Bayesian reconstruction using distance information via a generalized linear model. Our method extends Bayesian methods that estimate rates from the data by using fine-grained locations like airports and inferring intermediate locations not observed among sampled isolates. When applied to sequence data of the pandemic H1N1 influenza A virus in 2009, our approach correctly inferred the origin and proposed airports mainly involved in the spread of the virus. In case of a novel outbreak, this approach allows to rapidly analyze sequence data and infer origin and spread routes to improve disease surveillance and control.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/mcNkWiC65tY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

While spatiotemporal proximity is necessary for synapse formation, it remains unclear to what extent the underlying positional strategies are sufficient to ensure synapse formation between the right partners. Many neurons readily form synapses with wrong partners if they find themselves at the wrong place or time. Minimally, restricting spatiotemporal proximity can prevent incorrect synapses. Maximally, restricting encounters in time and space could be sufficient to ensure correct partnerships between neurons that can form synapses promiscuously. In this review we explore recent findings on positional strategies during developmental growth that contribute to precise outcomes in brain wiring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Parametric Representation of Tactile Numerosity in Working Memory</title>
	<link>http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/7/1/ENEURO.0090-19.2019?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Estimated numerosity perception is processed in an approximate number system (ANS) that resembles the perception of a continuous magnitude. The ANS consists of a right lateralized frontoparietal network comprising the lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC) and the intraparietal sulcus. Although the ANS has been extensively investigated, only a few studies have focused on the mental representation of retained numerosity estimates. Specifically, the underlying mechanisms of estimated numerosity working memory (WM) is unclear. Besides numerosities, as another form of abstract quantity, vibrotactile WM studies provide initial evidence that the right LPFC takes a central role in maintaining magnitudes. In the present fMRI multivariate pattern analysis study, we designed a delayed match-to-numerosity paradigm to test what brain regions retain approximate numerosity memoranda. In line with parametric WM results, our study found numerosity-specific WM representations in the right LPFC as well as in the supplementary motor area and the left premotor cortex extending into the superior frontal gyrus, thus bridging the gap in abstract quantity WM literature.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>RSS PAP: Sex-specific differences in motor unit remodeling in a mouse model of ALS</title>
	<link>http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0388-19.2020v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Progressive loss of neuromuscular junctions (NMJ) is an early event in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), preceding the global degeneration of motor axons and being accompanied by new axonal sprouting within the same axonal arbor. Some aspects of ALS onset and progression seem to be affected by sex in animal models of the disease. However, whether there are sex-specific differences in the pattern or time course of NMJ loss and repair within single motor axons remains unknown. We performed further analysis of a previously published &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; dataset, obtained from male and female SOD1&lt;sup&gt;G37R&lt;/sup&gt; mice. We found that NMJ losses are as frequent in male and female motor axons but, intriguingly, axonal sprouting is more frequent in female than male mice, resulting in a net increase of axonal arborization. Interestingly, these numerous new axonal branches in female mice are associated with a slightly faster decline in grip strength, increased NMJ denervation, and reduced α-motor neuron survival. Collectively, these results suggest that excessive axonal sprouting and motor-unit expansion in female SOD1&lt;sup&gt;G37R&lt;/sup&gt; mice are maladaptive during ALS progression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Sex-specific differences in ALS progression have been identified in patients and in some animal models of the disease. However, the physio-pathological changes underlying these disparities remain poorly defined. In this study, we identified that the pattern of motor axon retraction and regrowth in skeletal muscles is a novel factor to consider in our understanding of sex-linked differences in ALS. Analysis of single motor axons in a model of ALS identified that female motor axons were more likely to form compensatory branches, which was associated with a worse phenotype. These surprising findings highlight the necessity to more systematically evaluate the prevalence of sex-specific differences across animal models of ALS and in patients.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0319-19.2020v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Diacylglycerol kinase  (DGK) regulates protein kinase C (PKC) activity by converting diacylglycerol (DG) to phosphatidic acid (PA). DGK directly interacts with PKC and is phosphorylated by PKC, resulting in the upregulation of lipid kinase activity. PKC dysfunction impairs motor coordination, indicating that the regulation of PKC activity is important for motor coordination. DGK and PKC are abundantly expressed in cerebellar Purkinje cells. However, the physiological role of DGK has not been elucidated. Therefore, we developed DGK knockout (KO) mice and tested their cerebellar motor coordination. In DGK KO mice, cerebellar motor coordination and long-term depression (LTD) were impaired, and the dendrites of Purkinje cells from DGK KO mice were significantly retracted. Interestingly, treatment with the cPKC inhibitor Gö6976 rescued the dendritic retraction of primary cultured Purkinje cells from DGK KO mice. In contrast, treatment with the PKC activator 12-&lt;i&gt;o&lt;/i&gt;-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (TPA) reduced morphological alterations in the dendrites of Purkinje cells from WT mice. In addition, we confirmed the upregulation of PKC activity in the cerebellum of DGK KO mice and rescued impaired LTD in DGK KO mice with a PKC specific inhibitor. Furthermore, impairment of motor coordination observed in DGK KO mice was rescued in tm1c mice with DGK reexpression induced by the FLP-FRT recombination system. These results indicate that DGK is involved in cerebellar LTD and the dendritic development of Purkinje cells through the regulation of PKC activity, and thus contributes to cerebellar motor coordination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; The only output neurons of the cerebellum, Purkinje cells, regulate long-term depression (LTD). LTD and the dendritic development of Purkinje cells are important for motor function. Many studies have revealed functional correlations between signaling molecules involved in the mechanisms of motor coordination; however, we still do not have enough knowledge to understand the overall concept. Here, we show that the functional correlation between diacylglycerol kinase  (DGK) and protein kinase C  (PKC) contributes to motor coordination. DGK regulates the activity of PKC, which is an important factor in LTD and the dendritic development of Purkinje cells, allowing PKC to function precisely as a mediator of motor coordination.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

We performed [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]‐Fluorodopa PET studies of 57 homozygous and heterozygous &lt;i&gt;GBA1&lt;/i&gt; mutation carriers (15 with parkinsonism) and 98 controls looking for early indications of dopamine loss using voxel‐wise analyses to identify group differences in striatal [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]‐Fluorodopa uptake (K&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;). Forty‐eight subjects were followed longitudinally.

However, at baseline and over time, striatal [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]‐Fluorodopa uptake in mutation carriers without parkinsonism did not significantly differ from controls.&lt;/p&gt;

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;We introduce a mean-field model for analysing the dynamics of human
consciousness. In particular, inspired by the Giulio Tononi's Integrated
Information Theory and by the Max Tegmark's representation of consciousness, we
study order-disorder phase transitions on Curie-Weiss models generated by
processing EEG signals. The latter have been recorded on healthy individuals
undergoing deep sedation. Then, we implement a machine learning tool for
classifying mental states using, as input, the critical temperatures computed
in the Curie-Weiss models. Results show that, by the proposed method, it is
possible to discriminate between states of awareness and states of deep
sedation. Besides, we identify a state space for representing the path between
mental states, whose dimensions correspond to critical temperatures computed
over different frequency bands of the EEG signal. Beyond possible theoretical
implications in the study of human consciousness, resulting from our model, we
deem relevant to emphasise that the proposed method could be exploited for
clinical applications.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1801.06079</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Connectomes are spatially embedded networks whose architecture has been
shaped by physical constraints and communication needs throughout evolution.
Using a decentralized navigation protocol, we investigate the relationship
between the structure of the connectomes of different species and their spatial
layout. As a navigation strategy, we use greedy routing where nearest
neighbors, in terms of geometric distance, are visited. We measure the fraction
of successful greedy paths and their length as compared to shortest paths in
the topology of connectomes. In Euclidean space, we find a striking difference
between the navigability properties of mammalian and non-mammalian species,
which implies the inability of Euclidean distances to fully explain the
structural organization of their connectomes. In contrast, we find that
hyperbolic space, the effective geometry of complex networks, provides almost
perfectly navigable maps of connectomes for all species, meaning that
hyperbolic distances are exceptionally congruent with the structure of
connectomes. Hyperbolic maps therefore offer a quantitative meaningful
representation of connectomes that suggests a new cartography of the brain
based on the combination of its connectivity with its effective geometry rather
than on its anatomy only. Hyperbolic maps also provide a universal framework to
study decentralized communication processes in connectomes of different species
and at different scales on an equal footing.

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsyn.2020.00004</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Calcium-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CaMKII) is a molecule involved in several cell processes including plasticity related to learning and memory. Activation of NMDA-type glutamate receptors results in translocation of CaMKII to synapses. However, there are at least two distinct mechanisms by which glutamate-dependent CaMKII translocation occurs: one well-studied process resulting from whole-cell glutamate stimulation and one resulting from brief, local glutamate application. Unlike the relatively fast CaMKII translocation seen following whole-cell glutamate delivery (seconds), local application results in CaMKII translocation that occurs gradually within 6–10 min. This locally-induced translocation of CaMKII requires L-type Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; channel co-activation but does not rely on GluN2B receptor subunit expression, unlike translocation following whole-cell application of glutamate. The current study examined if nucleotide binding is necessary for locally-induced CaMKII translocation, similar to CaMKII translocation resulting from whole-cell glutamate application. Three different mechanisms of inhibition were employed: staurosporine (ATP inhibitor), CaMKII(281–302) peptide inhibitor and expression of the K42M mutation. Locally-induced CaMKII translocation was moderately suppressed in the presence of either the broad-spectrum kinase inhibitor staurosporine (100 nm) or the CaMKII(281–302) peptide inhibitor. However, expression of the catalytically dead K42M mutation that prevents ATP-binding to CaMKII, significantly inhibited locally-induced translocation. Thus, CaMKII translocation following brief, local glutamate application requires nucleotide binding, providing support for future research into the molecular mechanisms of this distinct form of CaMKII translocation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Synaptic Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Plasticity in the Brainstem: Prenatal and Postnatal Experience Can Alter Laterodorsal Tegmental (LDT) Structure and Function</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsyn.2020.00003</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The brainstem has traditionally been considered an area of the brain with autonomous control of mostly homeostatic functions such as heart rate, respiration, and the sleep and wakefulness state, which would preclude the necessity to exhibit the high degree of synaptic or cellular mechanisms of plasticity typical of regions of the brain responsible for flexible, executive control, such as the medial prefrontal cortex or the hippocampus. The perception that the brainstem does not share the same degree of flexibility to alter synaptic strength and/or wiring within local circuits makes intuitive sense, as it is not easy to understand how “soft wiring” would be an advantage when considering the importance of faithful and consistent performance of the homeostatic, autonomic functions that are controlled by the brainstem. However, many of the molecular and cellular requirements which underlie strengthening of synapses seen in brain regions involved in higher-level processing are present in brainstem nuclei, and recent research suggest that the view of the brainstem as “hard wired,” with rigid and static connectivity and with unchanging synaptic strength, is outdated. In fact, information from studies within the last decades, including work conducted in our group, leads us to propose that the brainstem can dynamically alter synaptic proteins, and change synaptic connections in response to prenatal or postnatal stimuli, and this would likely alter functionality and output. This article reviews recent research that has provided information resulting in our revision of the view of the brainstem as static and non-changing by using as example recent information gleaned from a brainstem pontine nucleus, the laterodorsal tegmentum (LDT). The LDT has demonstrated mechanisms underlying synaptic plasticity, and plasticity has been exhibited in the postnatal LDT following exposure to drugs of abuse. Further, exposure of the brain during gestation to drugs of abuse results in alterations in development of signaling pathways in the LDT. As the LDT provides a high degree of innervation of mesoaccumbal and mesocortical circuits involved in salience, as well as thalamocortical circuits involved in control of arousal and orientation, changes in synaptic strength would be expected to alter output, which would significantly impact behavioral state, motivated behavior and directed attention. Further, alterations in developmental trajectory within the LDT following prenatal exposure to drugs of abuse would be expected to impact on later life expression of motivation and arousal.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The P/Q-type Ca&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;2.1 channel regulates neurotransmitter release at neuromuscular junctions (NMJ) and many central synapses. CACNA1A encodes the pore-containing α&lt;sub&gt;1A&lt;/sub&gt; subunit of Ca&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;2.1 channels. In humans, de novo CACNA1A mutations result in a wide spectrum of neurological, neuromuscular, and movement disorders, such as familial hemiplegic migraine type 1 (FHM1), episodic ataxia type 2 (EA2), as well as a more recently discovered class of more severe disorders, which are characterized by ataxia, hypotonia, cerebellar atrophy, and cognitive/developmental delay. Heterologous expression of Ca&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;2.1 channels has allowed for an understanding of the consequences of CACNA1A missense mutations on channel function. In contrast, a mechanistic understanding of how specific CACNA1A mutations lead in vivo to the resultant phenotypes is lacking. In this review, we present the zebrafish as a model to both study in vivo mechanisms of CACNA1A mutations that result in synaptic and behavioral defects and to screen for effective drug therapies to combat these and other Ca&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;2.1 channelopathies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnint.2019.00071</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The objective of the Autism Biomarkers Consortium for Clinical Trials (ABC-CT) is to evaluate a set of lab-based behavioral video tracking (VT), electroencephalography (EEG), and eye tracking (ET) measures for use in clinical trials with children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Within the larger organizational structure of the ABC-CT, the Data Acquisition and Analytic Core (DAAC) oversees the standardization of VT, EEG, and ET data acquisition, data processing, and data analysis. This includes designing and documenting data acquisition and analytic protocols and manuals; facilitating site training in acquisition; data acquisition quality control (QC); derivation and validation of dependent variables (DVs); and analytic deliverables including preparation of data for submission to the National Database for Autism Research (NDAR). To oversee consistent application of scientific standards and methodological rigor for data acquisition, processing, and analytics, we developed standard operating procedures that reflect the logistical needs of multi-site research, and the need for well-articulated, transparent processes that can be implemented in future clinical trials. This report details the methodology of the ABC-CT related to acquisition and QC in our Feasibility and Main Study phases. Based on our acquisition metrics from a preplanned interim analysis, we report high levels of acquisition success utilizing VT, EEG, and ET experiments in a relatively large sample of children with ASD and typical development (TD), with data acquired across multiple sites and use of a manualized training and acquisition protocol.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Brain Imaging Methods section | New and Recent Articles: Multiscale Imaging Approach for Studying the Central Nervous System: Methodology and Perspective</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00072</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Non-invasive imaging methods have become essential tools for understanding the central nervous system (CNS) in health and disease. In particular, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques provide information about the anatomy, microstructure, and function of the brain and spinal cord in vivo non-invasively. However, MRI is limited by its spatial resolution and signal specificity. In order to mitigate these shortcomings, it is crucial to validate MRI with an array of ancillary ex vivo imaging techniques. These techniques include histological methods, such as light and electron microscopy (EM), which can provide specific information on the tissue structure in healthy and diseased brain and spinal cord, at cellular and subcellular level. However, these conventional histological techniques are intrinsically two-dimensional (2D) and, as a result of sectioning, lack volumetric information of the tissue. This limitation can be overcome with genuine three-dimensional (3D) imaging approaches of the tissue. 3D highly resolved information of the CNS achievable by means of other imaging techniques can complement and improve the interpretation of MRI measurements. In this article, we provide an overview of different 3D imaging techniques that can be used to validate MRI. As an example, we introduce an approach of how to combine diffusion MRI and synchrotron X-ray phase contrast tomography (SXRPCT) data. Our approach paves the way for a new multiscale assessment of the CNS allowing to validate and to improve our understanding of in vivo imaging (such as MRI).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Brain Imaging Methods section | New and Recent Articles: Systematic Evaluation of Image Tiling Adverse Effects on Deep Learning Semantic Segmentation</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00065</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Convolutional neural network (CNN) models obtain state of the art performance on image classification, localization, and segmentation tasks. Limitations in computer hardware, most notably memory size in deep learning accelerator cards, prevent relatively large images, such as those from medical and satellite imaging, from being processed as a whole in their original resolution. A fully convolutional topology, such as U-Net, is typically trained on down-sampled images and inferred on images of their original size and resolution, by simply dividing the larger image into smaller (typically overlapping) tiles, making predictions on these tiles, and stitching them back together as the prediction for the whole image. In this study, we show that this tiling technique combined with translationally-invariant nature of CNNs causes small, but relevant differences during inference that can be detrimental in the performance of the model. Here we quantify these variations in both medical (i.e., BraTS) and non-medical (i.e., satellite) images and show that training a 2D U-Net model on the whole image substantially improves the overall model performance. Finally, we compare 2D and 3D semantic segmentation models to show that providing CNN models with a wider context of the image in all three dimensions leads to more accurate and consistent predictions. Our results suggest that tiling the input to CNN models—while perhaps necessary to overcome the memory limitations in computer hardware—may lead to undesirable and unpredictable errors in the model's output that can only be adequately mitigated by increasing the input of the model to the largest possible tile size.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00063</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Available evidence suggests that diabetes mellitus (DM) is a non-genetic risk factor for Parkinson’s disease (PD). PD and DM have shared similarities in pathogenetic mechanisms, including age, environmental factors, inflammatory reaction, and protein aggregation, etc. α-Synuclein is the primary protein component in the protein inclusions in PD, while islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP) aggregates to form amyloid structures in β cells in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Pancreatic and cerebral functions, pancreas and brain α-synuclein deposition as well as striatal alterations, were assessed in spontaneously developed T2DM monkeys and age-matched normal monkeys. We demonstrated increased accumulation, aggregation, and phosphorylation of α-synuclein, and IAPP in the pancreatic islets of spontaneously developed T2DM monkeys, compared to the age-matched normal subjects. Double immunofluorescence analyses showed complete overlap between α-synuclein and IAPP in the pancreatic islets. In addition, in T2DM monkeys’ brain, we observed concomitantly increased accumulation and phosphorylation of α-synuclein in the cortex, pre-commissural putamen and dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra, which interestingly showed high correlation with levels of fasting plasma glucose (FPG), triglyceride (TG), and high density lipoprotein (HDL). Our data indicates the close association between IAPP and α-synuclein and the potential link between T2DM and PD, which implies that T2DM may facilitate PD disease onset and progress by interfering with the pathological protein aggregation both in the pancreatic islets and the brain.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Brain Imaging Methods section | New and Recent Articles: Monitoring Depth of Anesthesia Based on Hybrid Features and Recurrent Neural Network</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00026</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals contain valuable information about the different physiological states of the brain, with a variety of linear and nonlinear features that can be used to investigate brain activity. Monitoring the depth of anesthesia (DoA) with EEG is an ongoing challenge in anesthesia research. In this paper, we propose a novel method based on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and a sparse denoising autoencoder (SDAE) to combine the hybrid features of EEG to monitor the DoA. The EEG signals were preprocessed using filtering, etc., and then more than ten features including sample entropy, permutation entropy, spectra, and alpha-ratio were extracted from the EEG signal. We then integrated the optional features such as permutation entropy and alpha-ratio to extract the essential structure and learn the most efficient temporal model for monitoring the DoA. Compared with using a single feature, the proposed model could accurately estimate the depth of anesthesia with higher prediction probability (P&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;). Experimental results evaluated on the datasets demonstrated that our proposed method provided better performance than the methods using permutation entropy, alpha-ratio, LSTM, and other traditional indices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Neurodegeneration section | New and Recent Articles: Motion Biomarkers Showing Maximum Contrast Between Healthy Subjects and Parkinson's Disease Patients Treated With Deep Brain Stimulation of the Subthalamic Nucleus. A Pilot Study</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.01450</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Background: Classic motion abnormalities in Parkinson's disease (PD), such as tremor, bradykinesia, or rigidity, are well-covered by standard clinical assessments such as the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS). However, PD includes motor abnormalities beyond the symptoms and signs as measured by UPDRS, such as the lack of anticipatory adjustments or compromised movement smoothness, which are difficult to assess clinically. Moreover, PD may entail motor abnormalities not yet known. All these abnormalities are quantifiable via motion capture and may serve as biomarkers to diagnose and monitor PD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Objective: In this pilot study, we attempted to identify motion features revealing maximum contrast between healthy subjects and PD patients with deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the nucleus subthalamicus (STN) switched off and on as the first step to develop biomarkers for detecting and monitoring PD patients' motor symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: We performed 3D gait analysis in 7 out of 26 PD patients with DBS switched off and on, and in 25 healthy control subjects. We computed feature values for each stride, related to 22 body segments, four time derivatives, left–right mean vs. difference, and mean vs. variance across stride time. We then ranked the feature values according to their distinguishing power between PD patients and healthy subjects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: The foot and lower leg segments proved better in classifying motor anomalies than any other segment. Higher degrees of time derivatives were superior to lower degrees (jerk &amp;gt; acceleration &amp;gt; velocity &amp;gt; displacement). The averaged movements across left and right demonstrated greater distinguishing power than left–right asymmetries. The variability of motion was superior to motion's absolute values.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: This small pilot study identified the variability of a smoothness measure, i.e., jerk of the foot, as the optimal signal to separate healthy subjects' from PD patients' gait. This biomarker is invisible to clinicians' naked eye and is therefore not included in current motor assessments such as the UPDRS. We therefore recommend that more extensive investigations be conducted to identify the most powerful biomarkers to characterize motor abnormalities in PD. Future studies may challenge the composition of traditional assessments such as the UPDRS.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Neurodegeneration section | New and Recent Articles: A Robust Model System for Retinal Hypoxia: Live Imaging of Calcium Dynamics and Gene Expression Studies in Primary Human Mixed Retinal Culture</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.01445</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The detailed mechanisms underlying oxidative stress that leads to neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration in retinal vascular conditions, including diabetic retinopathy, retinopathy of prematurity etc., remain largely unexplored mainly due to a lack of suitable disease models that can simulate the inherent neuron–glia interactions in human retina. Specifically, establishment of a mixed retinal culture (MRC) containing both neuron and glial cell types remains a challenge due to different conditions required for their optimal growth and differentiation. Here, we establish a novel primary MRC model system containing neurons, astrocytes, Müller glia, and microglia from human donor retina that can be used to study the neuromodulatory effects of glial cells under the stress. The cell characterization based on immunostaining with individual cell type–specific markers and their presence in close vicinity to each other further underscores their utility for studying their cross talk. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first instance of an in vitro model obtained from human donor retina containing four major cell types. Next, we induce hypoxic stress to MRC to investigate if hypoxia activated neuroglia modulates altered gene expression for inflammatory, apoptotic, and angiogenic markers and Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; transients by live cell imaging. Further, we performed k-means clustering of the Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; responses to identify the modification of clustering pattern in stressed condition. Finally, we provide the evidence that the altered Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; transient correlates to differential expression of genes shown to be involved in neuroinflammation, angiogenesis, and neurodegeneration under the hypoxic conditions as seen earlier in human cell lines and animal models of diabetic retinopathy. The major features of the hypoxic conditions in the proposed human MRC model included: increase in microglia activity, chemokine and cytokine expression, and percentage of cells having higher amplitude and frequency of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; transients. Thus, the proposed experimental system can potentially serve as an ideal in vitro model for studying the neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative changes in the retina and identifying newer drug targets.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroinformatics | New and Recent Articles: Optimizing Computer–Brain Interface Parameters for Non-invasive Brain-to-Brain Interface</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fninf.2020.00001</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A non-invasive, brain-to-brain interface (BBI) requires precision neuromodulation and high temporal resolution as well as portability to increase accessibility. A BBI is a combination of the brain–computer interface (BCI) and the computer–brain interface (CBI). The optimization of BCI parameters has been extensively researched, but CBI has not. Parameters taken from the BCI and CBI literature were used to simulate a two-class medical monitoring BBI system under a wide range of conditions. BBI function was assessed using the information transfer rate (ITR), measured in bits per trial and bits per minute. The BBI ITR was a function of classifier accuracy, window update rate, system latency, stimulation failure rate (SFR), and timeout threshold. The BCI parameters, including window length, update rate, and classifier accuracy, were kept constant to investigate the effects of varying the CBI parameters, including system latency, SFR, and timeout threshold. Based on passively monitoring BCI parameters, a base ITR of 1 bit/trial was used. The optimal latency was found to be 100 ms or less, with a threshold no more than twice its value. With the optimal latency and timeout parameters, the system was able to maintain near-maximum efficiency, even with a 25% SFR. When the CBI and BCI parameters are compared, the CBI’s system latency and timeout threshold should be reflected in the BCI’s update rate. This would maximize the number of trials, even at a high SFR. These findings suggested that a higher number of trials per minute optimizes the ITR of a non-invasive BBI. The delays innate to each BCI protocol and CBI stimulation method must also be accounted for. The high latencies in each are the primary constraints of non-invasive BBI for the foreseeable future.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fninf.2019.00079</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;At present, the diagnosis of brain disease is mainly based on the self-reported symptoms and clinical signs of the patient, which can easily lead to psychiatrists' bias. The purpose of this study is to develop a brain network clustering model to accurately identify brain diseases based on resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in the absence of clinical information. We use cosine similarity and sub-network kernels to measure attribute similarity and structure similarity, respectively. By integrating the structure similarity and attribute similarity into one matrix, spectral clustering is used to achieve brain network clustering. Finally, we evaluate this method on three diseases: Alzheimer's disease, Bipolar disorder patients, and Schizophrenia. The performance of methods is evaluated by measuring clustering consistency. Clustering consistency is similar to clustering accuracy, which is used to evaluate the consistency between the clustering labels and clinical diagnostic labels of the subjects. The experimental results show that our proposed method can significantly improve clustering performance, with a consistency of 60.6% for Alzheimer's disease, with a consistency of 100% for Schizophrenia, with a consistency of 100% for Bipolar disorder patients.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: The Effect of Visual Articulatory Information on the Neural Correlates of Non-native Speech Sound Discrimination</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00025</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Behavioral studies have shown that the ability to discriminate between non-native speech sounds improves after seeing how the sounds are articulated. This study examined the influence of visual articulatory information on the neural correlates of non-native speech sound discrimination. English speakers’ discrimination of the Hindi dental and retroflex sounds was measured using the mismatch negativity (MMN) event-related potential, before and after they completed one of three 8-min training conditions. In an audio-visual speech training condition (n = 14), each sound was presented with its corresponding visual articulation. In one control condition (n = 14), both sounds were presented with the same visual articulation, resulting in one congruent and one incongruent audio-visual pairing. In another control condition (n = 14), both sounds were presented with the same image of a still face. The control conditions aimed to rule out the possibility that the MMN is influenced by non-specific audio-visual pairings, or by general exposure to the dental and retroflex sounds over the course of the study. The results showed that audio-visual speech training reduced the latency of the MMN but did not affect MMN amplitude. No change in MMN amplitude or latency was observed for the two control conditions. The pattern of results suggests that a relatively short audio-visual speech training session (i.e., 8 min) may increase the speed with which the brain processes non-native speech sound contrasts. The absence of a training effect on MMN amplitude suggests a single session of audio-visual speech training does not lead to the formation of more discrete memory traces for non-native speech sounds. Longer and/or multiple sessions might be needed to influence the MMN amplitude.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00024</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The parent-child relationship and family context influence the development of emotion regulation (ER) brain circuitry and related skills in children and adolescents. Although both parents’ and children’s ER neurocircuitry simultaneously affect how they interact with one another, neuroimaging studies of parent-child relationships typically include only one member of the dyad in brain imaging procedures. The current study examined brain activation related to parenting and ER in parent-adolescent dyads during concurrent fMRI scanning with a novel task – the Testing Emotional Attunement and Mutuality (TEAM) task. The TEAM task includes feedback trials indicating the other dyad member made an error, resulting in a monetary loss for both participants. Results indicate that positive parenting practices as reported by the adolescent were positively correlated with parents’ hemodynamic activation of the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, a region related to empathy, during these error trials. Additionally, during feedback conditions both parents and adolescents exhibited fMRI activation in ER-related regions, including the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, anterior insula, fusiform gyrus, thalamus, caudate, precuneus, and superior parietal lobule. Adolescents had higher left amygdala activation than parents during the feedback condition. These findings demonstrate the utility of dyadic fMRI scanning for investigating relational processes, particularly in the parent-child relationship.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2020.00007</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have shown favorable performance recently. Nonetheless, the time-consuming computation on neuron level and complex optimization limit their real-time application. Curiosity has shown great performance in brain learning, which helps biological brains grasp new knowledge efficiently and actively. Inspired by this leaning mechanism, we propose a curiosity-based SNN (CBSNN) model, which contains four main learning processes. Firstly, the network is trained with biologically plausible plasticity principles to get the novelty estimations of all samples in only one epoch; secondly, the CBSNN begins to repeatedly learn the samples whose novelty estimations exceed the novelty threshold and dynamically update the novelty estimations of samples according to the learning results in five epochs; thirdly, in order to avoid the overfitting of the novel samples and forgetting of the learned samples, CBSNN retrains all samples in one epoch; finally, step two and step three are periodically taken until network convergence. Compared with the state-of-the-art Voltage-driven Plasticity-centric SNN (VPSNN) under standard architecture, our model achieves a higher accuracy of 98.55% with only 54.95% of its computation cost on the MNIST hand-written digit recognition dataset. Similar conclusion can also be found out in other datasets, i.e., Iris, NETtalk, Fashion-MNIST, and CIFAR-10, respectively. More experiments and analysis further prove that such curiosity-based learning theory is helpful in improving the efficiency of SNNs. As far as we know, this is the first practical combination of the curiosity mechanism and SNN, and these improvements will make the realistic application of SNNs possible on more specific tasks within the von Neumann framework.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2020.00006</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The accurate automatic segmentation of gliomas and its intra-tumoral structures is important not only for treatment planning but also for follow-up evaluations. Several methods based on 2D and 3D Deep Neural Networks (DNN) have been developed to segment brain tumors and to classify different categories of tumors from different MRI modalities. However, these networks are often black-box models and do not provide any evidence regarding the process they take to perform this task. Increasing transparency and interpretability of such deep learning techniques is necessary for the complete integration of such methods into medical practice. In this paper, we explore various techniques to explain the functional organization of brain tumor segmentation models and to extract visualizations of internal concepts to understand how these networks achieve highly accurate tumor segmentations. We use the BraTS 2018 dataset to train three different networks with standard architectures and outline similarities and differences in the process that these networks take to segment brain tumors. We show that brain tumor segmentation networks learn certain human-understandable disentangled concepts on a filter level. We also show that they take a top-down or hierarchical approach to localizing the different parts of the tumor. We then extract visualizations of some internal feature maps and also provide a measure of uncertainty with regards to the outputs of the models to give additional qualitative evidence about the predictions of these networks. We believe that the emergence of such human-understandable organization and concepts might aid in the acceptance and integration of such methods in medical diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncir.2020.00004</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The piriform cortex (PC) is a key brain area involved in both processing and coding of olfactory information. It is implicated in various brain disorders, such as epilepsy, Alzheimer’s disease, and autism. The PC consists of the anterior (APC) and posterior (PPC) parts, which are different anatomically and functionally. However, the direct input networks to specific neuronal populations within the APC and PPC remain poorly understood. Here, we mapped the whole-brain direct inputs to the two major neuronal populations, the excitatory glutamatergic principal neurons and inhibitory γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-ergic interneurons within the APC and PPC using the rabies virus (RV)-mediated retrograde trans-synaptic tracing system. We found that for both types of neurons, APC and PPC share some similarities in input networks, with dominant inputs originating from the olfactory region (OLF), followed by the cortical subplate (CTXsp), isocortex, cerebral nuclei (CNU), hippocampal formation (HPF) and interbrain (IB), whereas the midbrain (MB) and hindbrain (HB) were rarely labeled. However, APC and PPC also show distinct features in their input distribution patterns. For both types of neurons, the input proportion from the OLF to the APC was higher than that to the PPC; while the PPC received higher proportions of inputs from the HPF and CNU than the APC did. Overall, our results revealed the direct input networks of both excitatory and inhibitory neuronal populations of different PC subareas, providing a structural basis to analyze the diverse PC functions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Microglia are the endogenous immune cells of the brain and act as sensor of infection and pathologic injury to the brain, leading to a rapid plastic process of activation that culminates in the endocytosis and phagocytosis of damaged tissue. Microglia cells are the most plastic cells in the brain. Microglia isolation from their environment as well as culturing them in the presence of serum alter their function and lead to a rapid loss of their signature gene expression. Previous studies have identified pivotal factors allowing microglia culture in the absence of serum. Here, we have further characterized the function, expression of markers, metabolic status and response to pro and anti-inflammatory stimulus of microglia isolated by magnetic-activated cell sorting and cultured in a chemically defined medium. We have compared this new method with previous traditional protocols of culturing microglia that use high concentrations of serum.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: TTX-Resistant Sodium Channels Functionally Separate Silent From Polymodal C-nociceptors</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00013</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Pronounced activity-dependent slowing of conduction has been used to characterize mechano-insensitive, “silent” nociceptors and might be due to high expression of Na&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;1.8 and could, therefore, be characterized by their tetrodotoxin-resistance (TTX-r). Nociceptor-class specific differences in action potential characteristics were studied by: (i) in vitro calcium imaging in single porcine nerve growth factor (NGF)-responsive neurites; (ii) in vivo extracellular recordings in functionally identified porcine silent nociceptors; and (iii) in vitro patch-clamp recordings from murine silent nociceptors, genetically defined by nicotinic acetylcholine receptor subunit alpha-3 (CHRNA3) expression. Porcine TTX-r neurites (n = 26) in vitro had more than twice as high calcium transients per action potential as compared to TTX-s neurites (n = 18). In pig skin, silent nociceptors (n = 14) characterized by pronounced activity-dependent slowing of conduction were found to be TTX-r, whereas polymodal nociceptors were TTX-s (n = 12) and had only moderate slowing. Mechano-insensitive cold nociceptors were also TTX-r but showed less activity-dependent slowing than polymodal nociceptors. Action potentials in murine silent nociceptors differed from putative polymodal nociceptors by longer duration and higher peak amplitudes. Longer duration AP in silent murine nociceptors linked to increased sodium load would be compatible with a pronounced activity-dependent slowing in pig silent nociceptors and longer AP durations could be in line with increased calcium transients per action potential observed in vitro in TTX-resistant NGF responsive porcine neurites. Even though there is no direct link between slowing and TTX-resistant channels, the results indicate that axons of silent nociceptors not only differ in their receptive but also in their axonal properties.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Microbial BMAA and the Pathway for Parkinson’s Disease Neurodegeneration</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00026</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The neurotoxin β-N-methylamino-L-alanine (BMAA) is a natural non-proteinogenic diamino acid produced by several species of both prokaryotic (cyanobacteria) and eukaryotic (diatoms and dinoflagellates) microorganisms. BMAA has been shown to biomagnify through the food chain in some ecosystems, accumulating for example in seafood such as shellfish and fish, common dietary sources of BMAA whose ingestion may have possible neuronal consequences. In addition to its excitotoxic potential, BMAA has been implicated in protein misfolding and aggregation, inhibition of specific enzymes and neuroinflammation, all hallmark features of neurodegenerative diseases. However, the exact molecular mechanisms of neurotoxicity remain to be elucidated in detail. Although BMAA is commonly detected in its free form, complex BMAA-containing molecules have also been identified such as the paenilamicins, produced by an insect gut bacterial pathogen. On the other hand, production of BMAA or BMAA-containing molecules by members of the human gut microbiota, for example by non-photosynthetic cyanobacteria, the Melainabacteria, remains only hypothetical. In any case, should BMAA reach the gut it may interact with cells of the mucosal immune system and neurons of the enteric nervous system (ENS) and possibly target the mitochondria. Here, we review the available evidence and hint on possible mechanisms by which chronic exposure to dietary sources of this microbial neurotoxin may drive protein misfolding and mitochondrial dysfunction with concomitant activation of innate immune responses, chronic low-grade gut inflammation, and ultimately the neurodegenerative features observed across the gut-brain axis in Parkinson’s disease (PD).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;With a lipid-rich environment and elevated oxygen consumption, the central nervous system (CNS) is subject to intricate regulation by lipid-derived electrophiles (LDEs). Investigations into oxidative damage and chronic LDE generation in neural disorders have spurred the development of tools that can detect and catalog the gamut of LDE-adducted proteins. Despite these advances, deconstructing the precise consequences of individual protein-specific LDE modifications remained largely impossible until recently. In this perspective, we first overview emerging toolsets that can decode electrophile-signaling events in a protein/context-specific manner, and how the accumulating mechanistic insights brought about by these tools have begun to offer new means to modulate pathways relevant to multiple sclerosis (MS). By surveying the latest data surrounding the blockbuster MS drug dimethyl fumarate that functions through LDE-signaling-like mechanisms, we further provide a vision for how chemical biology tools probing electrophile signaling may be leveraged toward novel interventions in CNS disease.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/51325</link>
	<content:encoded>Genome wide association studies for non-syndromic orofacial cleft (OFC) have identified single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at loci where the presumed risk-relevant gene is expressed in oral periderm. The functional subsets of such SNPs are difficult to predict because the sequence underpinnings of periderm enhancers are unknown. We applied ATAC-seq to models of human palate periderm, including zebrafish periderm, mouse embryonic palate epithelia, and a human oral epithelium cell line, and to complementary mesenchymal cell types. We identified sets of enhancers specific to the epithelial cells and trained gapped-kmer support-vector-machine classifiers on these sets. We used the classifiers to predict the effect of 14 OFC-associated SNPs at 12q13 near &lt;i&gt;KRT18&lt;/i&gt;. All the classifiers picked the same SNP as having the strongest effect, but the significance was highest with the classifier trained on zebrafish periderm. Reporter and deletion analyses support this SNP as lying within a periderm enhancer regulating &lt;i&gt;KRT18&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;KRT8&lt;/i&gt; expression.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: latest articles: β11-12 linker isomerization governs Acid-sensing ion channel desensitization and recovery</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/51111</link>
	<content:encoded>Acid-sensing ion channels (ASICs) are neuronal sodium-selective channels activated by reductions in extracellular pH. Structures of the three presumptive functional states, high-pH resting, low-pH desensitized, and toxin-stabilized open, have all been solved for chicken ASIC1. These structures, along with prior functional data, suggest that the isomerization or flipping of the β11-12 linker in the extracellular, ligand-binding domain is an integral component of the desensitization process. To test this, we combined fast perfusion electrophysiology, molecular dynamics simulations and state-dependent non-canonical amino acid cross-linking. We find that both desensitization and recovery can be accelerated by orders of magnitude by mutating resides in this linker or the surrounding region. Furthermore, desensitization can be suppressed by trapping the linker in the resting state, indicating that isomerization of the β11-12 linker is not merely a consequence of, but a necessity for the desensitization process in ASICs.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: latest articles: Clusters of cooperative ion channels enable a membrane-potential-based mechanism for short-term memory</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/49974</link>
	<content:encoded>Across biological systems, cooperativity between proteins enables fast actions, supra-linear responses, and long-lasting molecular switches. In the nervous system, however, the function of cooperative interactions between voltage-dependent ionic channels remains largely unknown. Based on mathematical modeling, we here demonstrate that clusters of strongly cooperative ion channels can plausibly form bistable conductances. Consequently, clusters are permanently switched on by neuronal spiking, switched off by strong hyperpolarization, and remain in their state for seconds after stimulation. The resulting short-term memory of the membrane potential allows to generate persistent firing when clusters of cooperative channels are present together with non-cooperative spike-generating conductances. Dynamic clamp experiments in rodent cortical neurons confirm that channel cooperativity can robustly induce graded persistent activity – a single-cell based, multistable mnemonic firing mode experimentally observed in several brain regions. We therefore propose that ion channel cooperativity constitutes an efficient cell-intrinsic implementation for short-term memories at the voltage level.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: latest articles: The contribution of temporal coding to odor coding and odor perception in humans</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/49734</link>
	<content:encoded>Whether neurons encode information through their spike rates, their activity times or both is an ongoing debate in systems neuroscience. Here, we tested whether humans can discriminate between a pair of temporal odor mixtures (TOMs) composed of the same two components delivered in rapid succession in either one temporal order or its reverse. These TOMs presumably activate the same olfactory neurons but at different times and thus differ mainly in the time of neuron activation. We found that most participants could hardly discriminate between TOMs, although they easily discriminated between a TOM and one of its components. By contrast, participants succeeded in discriminating between the TOMs when they were notified of their successive nature in advance. We thus suggest that the time of glomerulus activation can be exploited to extract odor-related information, although it does not change the odor perception substantially, as should be expected from an odor code per se.</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: What makes or breaks a campaign to stop an invading plant pathogen?</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/sboreAmKuck/article</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Alice E. Milne, Tim Gottwald, Stephen R. Parnell, Vasthi Alonso Chavez, Frank van den Bosch&lt;/p&gt;

Diseases in humans, animals and plants remain an important challenge in our society. Effective control of invasive pathogens often requires coordinated concerted action of a large group of stakeholders. Both epidemiological and human behavioural factors influence the outcome of a disease control campaign. In mathematical models that are frequently used to guide such campaigns, human behaviour is often ill-represented, if at all. Existing models of human, animal and plant disease that do incorporate participation or compliance are often driven by pay-offs or direct observations of the disease state. It is however very well known that opinion is an important driving factor of human decision making. Here we consider the case study of Citrus Huanglongbing disease (HLB), which is an acute bacterial disease that threatens the sustainability of citrus production across the world. We show how by coupling an epidemiological model of this invasive disease with an opinion dynamics model we are able to answer the question: What makes or breaks the effectiveness of a disease control campaign? Frequent contact between stakeholders and advisors is shown to increase the probability of successful control. More surprisingly, we show that informing stakeholders about the effectiveness of control methods is of much greater importance than prematurely increasing their perceptions of the risk of infection. We discuss the overarching consequences of this finding and the effect on human as well as plant disease epidemics.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/sboreAmKuck&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: The hourglass organization of the &lt;i&gt;Caenorhabditis elegans&lt;/i&gt; connectome</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/AYcqhyLM5-4/article</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Kaeser M. Sabrin, Yongbin Wei, Martijn van den Heuvel, Constantine Dovrolis&lt;/p&gt;

We approach the &lt;i&gt;C. elegans&lt;/i&gt; connectome as an information processing network that receives input from about 90 sensory neurons, processes that information through a highly recurrent network of about 80 interneurons, and it produces a coordinated output from about 120 motor neurons that control the nematode’s muscles. We focus on the feedforward flow of information from sensory neurons to motor neurons, and apply a recently developed network analysis framework referred to as the “hourglass effect”. The analysis reveals that this feedforward flow traverses a small core (“hourglass waist”) that consists of 10-15 interneurons. These are mostly the same interneurons that were previously shown (using a different analytical approach) to constitute the “rich-club” of the &lt;i&gt;C. elegans&lt;/i&gt; connectome. This result is robust to the methodology that separates the feedforward from the feedback flow of information. The set of core interneurons remains mostly the same when we consider only chemical synapses or the combination of chemical synapses and gap junctions. The hourglass organization of the connectome suggests that &lt;i&gt;C. elegans&lt;/i&gt; has some similarities with encoder-decoder artificial neural networks in which the input is first compressed and integrated in a low-dimensional latent space that encodes the given data in a more efficient manner, followed by a decoding network through which intermediate-level sub-functions are combined in different ways to compute the correlated outputs of the network. The core neurons at the hourglass waist represent the &lt;i&gt;information bottleneck&lt;/i&gt; of the system, balancing the representation accuracy and compactness (complexity) of the given sensory information.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/AYcqhyLM5-4&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>RSS PAP: Parvalbumin interneuron dysfunction in a thalamo-prefrontal cortical circuit in Disc1 locus impairment mice</title>
	<link>http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0496-19.2020v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>ABSTRACT&lt;p&gt;Altered cortical excitation-inhibition (E-I) balance resulting from abnormal parvalbumin interneuron (PV IN) function is a proposed pathophysiological mechanism of schizophrenia (SZ) and other major psychiatric disorders. Preclinical studies have indicated that &lt;i&gt;disrupted-in-schizophrenia-1&lt;/i&gt; (DISC1) is a useful molecular lead to address the biology of prefrontal cortex dependent cognition and PV IN function. To date, prefrontal cortical inhibitory circuit function has not been investigated in depth in &lt;i&gt;Disc1&lt;/i&gt; locus impairment (LI) mouse models. Therefore, we used a &lt;i&gt;Disc1&lt;/i&gt; LI mouse model to investigate E-I balance in medial prefrontal cortical (mPFC) circuits. We found that inhibition onto layer 3 excitatory pyramidal neurons in the mPFC was significantly reduced in &lt;i&gt;Disc1&lt;/i&gt; LI mice. This reduced inhibition was accompanied by decreased GABA release from local PV, but not somatostatin (SOM) interneurons, and by impaired feedforward inhibition in the mediodorsal thalamus (MD) to mPFC circuit. Our mechanistic findings of abnormal PV IN function in a &lt;i&gt;Disc1&lt;/i&gt; LI model provide insight into biology that may be relevant to neuropsychiatric disorders including schizophrenia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; A popular theory suggests that dysregulation of fast-spiking parvalbumin interneurons (PV INs) and elevated excitation-inhibition (E-I) balance contribute to the pathophysiology of various psychiatric disorders. Previous studies suggest that genetic perturbations of the &lt;i&gt;disrupted-in-schizophrenia-1&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;Disc1&lt;/i&gt;) gene affect prefrontal cortex-dependent cognition and PV IN function, but synaptic and circuit physiology data are lacking. Here, we provide evidence that the presynaptic function of PV INs in the medial prefrontal cortex is altered in &lt;i&gt;Disc1&lt;/i&gt; LI mice and that E-I balance is elevated within a thalamofrontal circuit known to be important for cognition. These findings may contribute to our understanding of the biology that gives rise to cognitive symptoms in a range of neuropsychiatric disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Distinct Populations of Neurons Activated by Heroin and Cocaine in the Striatum as Assessed by catFISH</title>
	<link>http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/7/1/ENEURO.0394-19.2019?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Despite the still prevailing notion of a shared substrate of action for all addictive drugs, there is evidence suggesting that opioid and psychostimulant drugs differ substantially in terms of their neurobiological and behavioral effects. These differences may reflect separate neural circuits engaged by the two drugs. Here we used the catFISH (cellular compartment analysis of temporal activity by fluorescence &lt;i&gt;in situ&lt;/i&gt; hybridization) technique to investigate the degree of overlap between neurons engaged by heroin versus cocaine in adult male Sprague Dawley rats. The catFISH technique is a within-subject procedure that takes advantage of the different transcriptional time course of the immediate-early genes &lt;i&gt;homer 1a&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;arc&lt;/i&gt; to determine to what extent two stimuli separated by an interval of 25 min engage the same neuronal population. We found that throughout the striatal complex the neuronal populations activated by noncontingent intravenous injections of cocaine (800 μg/kg) and heroin (100 and 200 μg/kg), administered at an interval of 25 min from each other, overlapped to a much lesser extent than in the case of two injections of cocaine (800 μg/kg), also 25 min apart. The greatest reduction in overlap between populations activated by cocaine and heroin was in the dorsomedial and dorsolateral striatum (~30% and ~22%, respectively, of the overlap observed for the sequence cocaine–cocaine). Our results point toward a significant separation between neuronal populations activated by heroin and cocaine in the striatal complex. We propose that our findings are a proof of concept that these two drugs are encoded differently in a brain area believed to be a common neurobiological substrate to drug abuse.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;With the advancement in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning
(ML) techniques, researchers are striving towards employing these techniques
for advancing clinical practice. One of the key objectives in healthcare is the
early detection and prediction of disease to timely provide preventive
interventions. This is especially the case for epilepsy, which is characterized
by recurrent and unpredictable seizures. Patients can be relieved from the
adverse consequences of epileptic seizures if it could somehow be predicted in
advance. Despite decades of research, seizure prediction remains an unsolved
problem. This is likely to remain at least partly because of the inadequate
amount of data to resolve the problem. There have been exciting new
developments in ML-based algorithms that have the potential to deliver a
paradigm shift in the early and accurate prediction of epileptic seizures. Here
we provide a comprehensive review of state-of-the-art ML techniques in early
prediction of seizures using EEG signals. We will identify the gaps,
challenges, and pitfalls in the current research and recommend future
directions.

	<title>Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: A Prototypical Template for Rapid Face Detection Is Embedded in the Monkey Superior Colliculus</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2020.00005</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Human babies respond preferentially to faces or face-like images. It has been proposed that an innate and rapid face detection system is present at birth before the cortical visual pathway is developed in many species, including primates. However, in primates, the visual area responsible for this process is yet to be unraveled. We hypothesized that the superior colliculus (SC) that receives direct and indirect retinal visual inputs may serve as an innate rapid face-detection system in primates. To test this hypothesis, we examined the responsiveness of monkey SC neurons to first-order information of faces required for face detection (basic spatial layout of facial features including eyes, nose, and mouth), by analyzing neuronal responses to line drawing images of: (1) face-like patterns with contours and properly placed facial features; (2) non-face patterns including face contours only; and (3) nonface random patterns with contours and randomly placed face features. Here, we show that SC neurons respond stronger and faster to upright and inverted face-like patterns compared to the responses to nonface patterns, regardless of contrast polarity and contour shapes. Furthermore, SC neurons with central receptive fields (RFs) were more selective to face-like patterns. In addition, the population activity of SC neurons with central RFs can discriminate face-like patterns from nonface patterns as early as 50 ms after the stimulus onset. Our results provide strong neurophysiological evidence for the involvement of the primate SC in face detection and suggest the existence of a broadly tuned template for face detection in the subcortical visual pathway.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2020.00001</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Neuromodulation is a therapeutic technique that is well-established in the treatment of idiopathic Lower urinary tract (LUT) dysfunction such as overactive bladder (OAB). We have recently developed a novel neuromodulation approach, Transcutaneous Electrical Spinal Cord Neuromodulation (TESCoN) and demonstrated its acute effects on LUT dysfunction after spinal cord injury (SCI) during urodynamic studies. We found that TESCoN can promote urinary storage and induce urinary voiding when delivered during urodynamic studies. The objective of this study was to determine whether TESCoN can retrain the spinal neural networks to induce chronic improvement in the LUT, such that positive changes can persist even in the absence of stimulation. In addition, we wished to examine the effect of TESCoN on LUT dysfunction due to multiple pathologies. To achieve this objective, 14 patients [SCI = 5, stroke = 5, multiple sclerosis (MS) = 3, and idiopathic OAB (iOAB) = 1] completed 24 sessions of TESCoN over the course of 8 weeks. Patients completed urodynamic studies before and after undergoing TESCoN therapy. Additionally, each subject completed a voiding diary and the Neurogenic Bladder Symptom Score questionnaire before and after receiving TESCoN therapy. We found that TESCoN led to decreased detrusor overactivity, improved continence, and enhanced LUT sensation across the different pathologies underlying LUT dysfunction. This study serves as a pilot in preparation for a rigorous randomized placebo-controlled trial designed to demonstrate the effect of TESCoN on LUT function in neurogenic and non-neurogenic conditions.&lt;/p&gt;New And Noteworthy&lt;p&gt;Non-Surgical modality to reduce incidence of urinary incontinence and improve neurogenic bladder symptom scores (NBSS) in individuals with neurogenic bladder due to spinal cord injury or stroke.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Lysophosphatidic Acid Induces Apoptosis of PC12 Cells Through LPA1 Receptor/LPA2 Receptor/MAPK Signaling Pathway</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2020.00016</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Lysophosphatidic acid is a small extracellular signaling molecule, which is elevated in pathological conditions such as ischemic stroke and traumatic brain injury (TBI). LPA regulates the survival of neurons in various diseases. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying LPA-induced neuronal death remain unclear. Here we report that LPA activates LPA1 and LPA2 receptors, and the downstream MAPK pathway to induce the apoptosis of PC12 cells through mitochondrial dysfunction. LPA elicits the activation of ERK1/2, p38, and JNK pathways, decreases the expression of Bcl2, promotes the translocation of Bax, and enhances the activation of caspase-3, resulting in mitochondrial dysfunction and cell apoptosis. This process can be blocked by LPA1 receptor antagonist and LPA2 receptor antagonist and MAPK pathway inhibitors. Our results indicate that LPA1 receptor, LPA2 receptor and MAPK pathway play a critical role in LPA-induced neuronal injury. LPA receptors and MAPK pathways may be novel therapeutic targets for ischemic stroke and TBI, where excessive LPA signaling exist.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Fiber photometry has enabled neuroscientists to easily measure targeted brain activity patterns in awake, freely behaving animal. A focus of this technique is to identify functionally-relevant changes in activity around particular environmental and/or behavioral events, i.e., event-related activity transients (ERT). A simple and popular approach to identifying ERT is to summarize peri-event signal [e.g., area under the curve (AUC), peak activity, etc.,] and perform standard analyses on this summary statistic. We highlight the various issues with this approach and overview straightforward alternatives: waveform confidence intervals (CIs) and permutation tests. We introduce the rationale behind these approaches, describe the results of Monte Carlo simulations evaluating their effectiveness at controlling Type I and Type II error rates, and offer some recommendations for selecting appropriate analysis strategies for fiber photometry experiments.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Neurodegeneration section | New and Recent Articles: Hierarchical Clustering Analyses of Plasma Proteins in Subjects With Cardiovascular Risk Factors Identify Informative Subsets Based on Differential Levels of Angiogenic and Inflammatory Biomarkers</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00084</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Agglomerative hierarchical clustering analysis (HCA) is a commonly used unsupervised machine learning approach for identifying informative natural clusters of observations. HCA is performed by calculating a pairwise dissimilarity matrix and then clustering similar observations until all observations are grouped within a cluster. Verifying the empirical clusters produced by HCA is complex and not well studied in biomedical applications. Here, we demonstrate the comparability of a novel HCA technique with one that was used in previous biomedical applications while applying both techniques to plasma angiogenic (FGF, FLT, PIGF, Tie-2, VEGF, VEGF-D) and inflammatory (MMP1, MMP3, MMP9, IL8, TNFα) protein data to identify informative subsets of individuals. Study subjects were diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment due to cerebrovascular disease (MCI-CVD). Through comparison of the two HCA techniques, we were able to identify subsets of individuals, based on differences in VEGF (p &amp;lt; 0.001), MMP1 (p &amp;lt; 0.001), and IL8 (p &amp;lt; 0.001) levels. These profiles provide novel insights into angiogenic and inflammatory pathologies that may contribute to VCID.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00082</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Huntington’s disease (HD) is a hereditary neurodegenerative disorder that typically manifests in midlife with motor, cognitive, and/or psychiatric symptoms. The disease is caused by a CAG triplet expansion in exon 1 of the huntingtin gene and leads to a severe neurodegeneration in the striatum and cortex. Classical electrophysiological studies in genetic HD mouse models provided important insights into the disbalance of excitatory, inhibitory and neuromodulatory inputs, as well as progressive disconnection between the cortex and striatum. However, the involvement of local cortical and striatal microcircuits still remains largely unexplored. Here we review the progress in understanding HD-related impairments in the cortical and basal ganglia circuits, and outline new opportunities that have opened with the development of modern circuit analysis methods. In particular, in vivo imaging studies in mouse HD models have demonstrated early structural and functional disturbances within the cortical network, and optogenetic manipulations of striatal cell types have started uncovering the causal roles of certain neuronal populations in disease pathogenesis. In addition, the important contribution of astrocytes to HD-related circuit defects has recently been recognized. In parallel, unbiased systems biology studies are providing insights into the possible molecular underpinnings of these functional defects at the level of synaptic signaling and neurotransmitter metabolism. With these approaches, we can now reach a deeper understanding of circuit-based HD mechanisms, which will be crucial for the development of effective and targeted therapeutic strategies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Brain Imaging Methods section | New and Recent Articles: Multi-Level Clustering of Dynamic Directional Brain Network Patterns and Their Behavioral Relevance</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.01448</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Dynamic functional connectivity (DFC) obtained from resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data has been shown to provide novel insights into brain function which may be obscured by static functional connectivity (SFC). Further, DFC, and by implication how different brain regions may engage or disengage with each other over time, has been shown to be behaviorally relevant and more predictive than SFC of behavioral performance and/or diagnostic status. DFC is not a directional entity and may capture neural synchronization. However, directional interactions between different brain regions is another putative mechanism by which neural populations communicate. Accordingly, static effective connectivity (SEC) has been explored as a means of characterizing such directional interactions. But investigation of its dynamic counterpart, i.e., dynamic effective connectivity (DEC), is still in its infancy. Of particular note are methodological insufficiencies in identifying DEC configurations that are reproducible across time and subjects as well as a lack of understanding of the behavioral relevance of DEC obtained from resting state fMRI. In order to address these issues, we employed a dynamic multivariate autoregressive (MVAR) model to estimate DEC. The method was first validated using simulations and then applied to resting state fMRI data obtained in-house (N = 21), wherein we performed dynamic clustering of DEC matrices across multiple levels [using adaptive evolutionary clustering (AEC)] – spatial location, time, and subjects. We observed a small number of directional brain network configurations alternating between each other over time in a quasi-stable manner akin to brain microstates. The dominant and consistent DEC network patterns involved several regions including inferior and mid temporal cortex, motor and parietal cortex, occipital cortex, as well as part of frontal cortex. The functional relevance of these DEC states were determined using meta-analyses and pertained mainly to memory and emotion, but also involved execution and language. Finally, a larger cohort of resting-state fMRI and behavioral data from the Human Connectome Project (HCP) (N = 232, Q1–Q3 release) was used to demonstrate that metrics derived from DEC can explain larger variance in 70 behaviors across different domains (alertness, cognition, emotion, and personality traits) compared to SEC in healthy individuals.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroinformatics | New and Recent Articles: Developmental Designs and Adult Functions of Cortical Maps in Multiple Modalities: Perception, Attention, Navigation, Numbers, Streaming, Speech, and Cognition</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fninf.2020.00004</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;This article unifies neural modeling results that illustrate several basic design principles and mechanisms that are used by advanced brains to develop cortical maps with multiple psychological functions. One principle concerns how brains use a strip map that simultaneously enables one feature to be represented throughout its extent, as well as an ordered array of another feature at different positions of the strip. Strip maps include circuits to represent ocular dominance and orientation columns, place-value numbers, auditory streams, speaker-normalized speech, and cognitive working memories that can code repeated items. A second principle concerns how feature detectors for multiple functions develop in topographic maps, including maps for optic flow navigation, reinforcement learning, motion perception, and category learning at multiple organizational levels. A third principle concerns how brains exploit a spatial gradient of cells that respond at an ordered sequence of different rates. Such a rate gradient is found along the dorsoventral axis of the entorhinal cortex, whose lateral branch controls the development of time cells, and whose medial branch controls the development of grid cells. Populations of time cells can be used to learn how to adaptively time behaviors for which a time interval of hundreds of milliseconds, or several seconds, must be bridged, as occurs during trace conditioning. Populations of grid cells can be used to learn hippocampal place cells that represent the large spaces in which animals navigate. A fourth principle concerns how and why all neocortical circuits are organized into layers, and how functionally distinct columns develop in these circuits to enable map development. A final principle concerns the role of Adaptive Resonance Theory top-down matching and attentional circuits in the dynamic stabilization of early development and adult learning. Cortical maps are modeled in visual, auditory, temporal, parietal, prefrontal, entorhinal, and hippocampal cortices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fninf.2020.00002</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Accurate stimulus onset timing is critical to almost all behavioral research. Auditory, visual, or manual response time stimulus onsets are typically sent through wires to various machines that record data such as: eye gaze positions, electroencephalography, stereo electroencephalography, and electrocorticography. These stimulus onsets are collated and analyzed according to experimental condition. If there is variability in the temporal accuracy of the delivery of these onsets to external systems, the quality of the resulting data and scientific analyses will degrade. Here, we describe an approximately 200 dollar Arduino based system and associated open-source codebase that achieved a maximum of 4 microseconds of delay from the inputs to the outputs while electrically opto-isolating the connected external systems. Using an oscilloscope, the device is configurable for the different environmental conditions particular to each laboratory (e.g., light sensor type, screen type, speaker type, stimulus type, temperature, etc). This low-cost open-source project delivered electrically isolated digital stimulus onset Transistor-Transistor Logic triggers with an input/output delay of 4 μs, and was successfully tested with seven different external systems that record eye and neurological data.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Real-Time Eye-to-Eye Contact Is Associated With Cross-Brain Neural Coupling in Angular Gyrus</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00019</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Direct eye contact between two individuals is a salient social behavior known to initiate and promote interpersonal interaction. However, the neural processes that underlie these live interactive behaviors and eye-to-eye contact are not well understood. The Dynamic Neural Coupling Hypothesis presents a general theoretical framework proposing that shared interactive behaviors are represented by cross-brain signal coherence. Using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) adapted for hyper scanning, we tested this hypothesis specifically for neural mechanisms associated with eye-to-eye gaze between human participants compared to similar direct eye-gaze at a dynamic video of a face and predicted that the coherence of neural signals between the two participants during reciprocal eye-to-eye contact would be greater than coherence observed during direct eye-gaze at a dynamic video for those signals originating in social and face processing systems. Consistent with this prediction cross-brain coherence was increased for signals within the angular gyrus (AG) during eye-to-eye contact relative to direct eye-gaze at a dynamic face video (p &amp;lt; 0.01). Further, activity in the right temporal-parietal junction (TPJ) was increased in the real eye-to-eye condition (p &amp;lt; 0.05, FDR corrected). Together, these findings advance a functional and mechanistic understanding of the AG and cross-brain neural coupling associated with real-time eye-to-eye contact.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroanatomy | New and Recent Articles: Conserved Genoarchitecture of the Basal Hypothalamus in Zebrafish Embryos</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnana.2020.00003</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Analyses of genoarchitecture recently stimulated substantial revisions of anatomical models for the developing hypothalamus in mammalian and other vertebrate systems. The prosomeric model proposes the hypothalamus to be derived from the secondary prosencephalon, and to consist of alar and basal regions. The basal hypothalamus can further be subdivided into tuberal and mamillary regions, each with distinct subregions. Albeit being a widely used model system for neurodevelopmental studies, no detailed genoarchitectural maps exist for the zebrafish (Danio rerio) hypothalamus. Here, we compare expression domains of zebrafish genes, including arxa, shha, otpa, isl1, lhx5, nkx2.1, nkx2.2a, pax6, and dlx5a, the orthologs of which delimit specific subregions within the murine basal hypothalamus. We develop the highly conserved brain-specific homeobox (bsx) gene as a novel marker for genoarchitectural analysis of hypothalamic regions. Our comparison of gene expression patterns reveals that the genoarchitecture of the basal hypothalamus in zebrafish embryos 48 hours post fertilization is highly similar to mouse embryos at E13.5. We found the tuberal hypothalamus in zebrafish embryos to be relatively large and to comprise previously ill-defined regions around the posterior hypothalamic recess. The mamillary hypothalamus is smaller and concentrates to rather medial areas in proximity to the anterior end of the neural tube floor plate. Within the basal hypothalamus we identified longitudinal and transverse tuberal and mamillary subregions topologically equivalent to those previously described in other vertebrates. However, the hypothalamic diencephalic boundary region and the posterior tuberculum still provide a challenge. We applied the updated prosomeric model to the developing zebrafish hypothalamus to facilitate cross-species comparisons. Accordingly, we applied the mammalian nomenclature of hypothalamic organization to zebrafish and propose it to replace some controversial previous nomenclature.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Age-Dependent Effect of Transcranial Alternating Current Stimulation on Motor Skill Consolidation</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00025</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) is the application of subthreshold, sinusoidal current to modulate ongoing brain rhythms related to sensory, motor and cognitive processes. Electrophysiological studies suggested that the effect of tACS applied at an alpha frequency (8–12 Hz) was state-dependent. The effects of tACS, that is, an increase in parieto-occipital electroencephalography (EEG) alpha power and magnetoencephalography (MEG) phase coherence, was only observed when the eyes were open (low alpha power) and not when the eyes were closed (high alpha power). This state-dependency of the effects of alpha tACS might extend to the aging brain characterized by general slowing and decrease in spectral power of the alpha rhythm. We additionally hypothesized that tACS will influence the motor cortex, which is involved in motor skill learning and consolidation. A group of young and old healthy adults performed a serial reaction time task (SRTT) with their right hand before and after the tACS stimulation. Each participant underwent three sessions of stimulation: sham, stimulation applied at the individual participant’s alpha peak frequency or individual alpha peak frequency (iAPF; α-tACS) and stimulation with iAPF plus 2 Hz (α2-tACS) to the left motor cortex for 10 min (1.5 mA). We measured the effect of stimulation on general motor skill (GMS) and sequence-specific skill (SS) consolidation. We found that α-tACS and α2-tACS improved GMS and SS consolidation in the old group. In contrast, α-tACS minimally improved GMS consolidation but impaired SS consolidation in the young group. On the other hand, α2-tACS was detrimental to the consolidation of both skills in the young group. Our results suggest that individuals with aberrant alpha rhythm such as the elderly could benefit more from tACS stimulation, whereas for young healthy individuals with intact alpha rhythm the stimulation could be detrimental.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00023</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Electroacupuncture (EA) has become popular for its adjustable strength and frequency and easy quantification in the clinic and has demonstrated therapeutic potential for Alzheimer’s disease (AD). However, the mechanism remains unknown. Abnormally activated c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) has been closely related to the pathological process of AD. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of EA on cognitive impairment and the role of the JNK signaling pathway in AD model amyloid precursor protein (APP)/presenilin 1 (PS1) mice. The memory and learning ability of each group was assessed using the Morris Water Maze (MWM). Immunofluorescence, immunohistochemistry and Western blot were performed to measure the expression of APP, JNK, phosphorylated (P-)JNK, mitogen-activated protein kinase 4 (MKK4), MKK7, c-Jun and caspase-3 in hippocampal tissue samples in APP/PS1 mice after EA intervention. Obvious cognitive deficits were observed in the AD model APP/PS1 mice in the MWM test and were associated with JNK signaling pathway activation and APP upregulation. Four weeks of EA significantly ameliorated the cognitive impairments and inhibited JNK signaling pathway activation and APP upregulation. Taken together, the findings demonstrated that EA can reverse cognitive deficits and substantially lower the burden of APP in AD model APP/PS1 mice, at least partially through inhibiting the JNK signaling pathway and regulating apoptosis signals. Therefore, EA may offer an effective alternative therapeutic approach for AD.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: latest articles: Spatiotemporal dynamics of multi-vesicular release is determined by heterogeneity of release sites in central synapses</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/55210</link>
	<content:encoded>Synaptic active zone (AZ) can release multiple vesicles in response to an action potential. This multi-vesicular release (MVR) occurs at most synapses, but its spatiotemporal properties are unknown. Nanoscale-resolution detection of individual release events in hippocampal synapses revealed unprecedented heterogeneity among vesicle release sites within a single AZ, with a gradient of release probability decreasing from AZ center to periphery. Parallel to this organization, MVR events preferentially overlap with uni-vesicular release (UVR) events at sites closer to AZ center. Pairs of fusion events comprising MVR are also not perfectly synchronized, and the earlier event tends to occur closer to AZ center. The spatial features of release sites and MVR events are similarly tightened by buffering intracellular calcium. These observations revealed a marked heterogeneity of release site properties within individual AZs, which determines the spatiotemporal features of MVR events and is controlled, in part, by non-uniform calcium elevation across the AZ.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: latest articles: Selective egg cell polyspermy bypasses the triploid block</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/52976</link>
	<content:encoded>Polyploidization, the increase in genome copies, is considered a major driving force for speciation. We have recently provided the first direct in planta evidence for polyspermy induced polyploidization. Capitalizing on a novel &lt;i&gt;sco1&lt;/i&gt;-based polyspermy assay, we here show that polyspermy can selectively polyploidize the egg cell, while rendering the genome size of the ploidy-sensitive central cell unaffected. This unprecedented result indicates that polyspermy can bypass the triploid block, which is an established postzygotic polyploidization barrier. In fact, we here show that most polyspermy-derived seeds are insensitive to the triploid block suppressor &lt;i&gt;admetos&lt;/i&gt;. The robustness of polyspermy-derived plants is evidenced by the first transcript profiling of triparental plants and our observation that these idiosyncratic organisms segregate tetraploid offspring within a single generation. Polyspermy-derived triparental plants are thus comparable to triploids recovered from interploidy crosses. Our results expand current polyploidization concepts and have important implications for plant breeding.</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Opponent processes in visual memories: A model of attraction and repulsion in navigating insects’ mushroom bodies</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/Wf2BicC5Niw/article</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Florent Le Möel, Antoine Wystrach&lt;/p&gt;

Solitary foraging insects display stunning navigational behaviours in visually complex natural environments. Current literature assumes that these insects are mostly driven by attractive visual memories, which are learnt when the insect’s gaze is precisely oriented toward the goal direction, typically along its familiar route or towards its nest. That way, an insect could return home by simply moving in the direction that appears most familiar. Here we show using virtual reconstructions of natural environments that this principle suffers from fundamental drawbacks, notably, a given view of the world does not provide information about whether the agent should turn or not to reach its goal. We propose a simple model where the agent continuously compares its current view with both goal and anti-goal visual memories, which are treated as attractive and repulsive respectively. We show that this strategy effectively results in an opponent process, albeit not at the perceptual level–such as those proposed for colour vision or polarisation detection–but at the level of environmental space. This opponent process results in a signal that strongly correlates with the angular error of the current body orientation so that a single view of the world now suffices to indicate whether the agent should turn or not. By incorporating this principle into a simple agent navigating in reconstructed natural environments, we show that it overcomes the usual shortcomings and produces a step-increase in navigation effectiveness and robustness. Our findings provide a functional explanation to recent behavioural observations in ants and why and how so-called aversive and appetitive memories must be combined. We propose a likely neural implementation based on insects’ mushroom bodies’ circuitry that produces behavioural and neural predictions contrasting with previous models.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Wf2BicC5Niw&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Despite advances in the modeling and understanding of colorectal cancer development, the dynamics of the progression from benign adenomatous polyp to colorectal carcinoma are still not fully resolved. To take advantage of adenoma size and prevalence data in the National Endoscopic Database of the Clinical Outcomes Research Initiative (CORI) as well as colorectal cancer incidence and size data from the Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) database, we construct a two-type branching process model with compartments representing adenoma and carcinoma cells. To perform parameter inference we present a new large-size approximation to the size distribution of the cancer compartment and validate our approach on simulated data. By fitting the model to the CORI and SEER data, we learn biologically relevant parameters, including the transition rate from adenoma to cancer. The inferred parameters allow us to predict the individualized risk of the presence of cancer cells for each screened patient. We provide a web application which allows the user to calculate these individual probabilities at https://ccrc-eth.shinyapps.io/CCRC/. For example, we find a 1 in 100 chance of cancer given the presence of an adenoma between 10 and 20mm size in an average risk patient at age 50. We show that our two-type branching process model recapitulates the early growth dynamics of colon adenomas and cancers and can recover epidemiological trends such as adenoma prevalence and cancer incidence while remaining mathematically and computationally tractable.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/ZKXVX0O7SD8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

We describe Orbit Image Analysis, an open-source whole slide image analysis tool. The tool consists of a generic tile-processing engine which allows the execution of various image analysis algorithms provided by either Orbit itself or from other open-source platforms using a tile-based map-reduce execution framework. Orbit Image Analysis is capable of sophisticated whole slide imaging analyses due to several key features. First, Orbit has machine-learning capabilities. This deep learning segmentation can be integrated with complex object detection for analysis of intricate tissues. In addition, Orbit can run locally as standalone or connect to the open-source image server OMERO. Another important characteristic is its scale-out functionality, using the Apache Spark framework for distributed computing. In this paper, we describe the use of Orbit in three different real-world applications: quantification of idiopathic lung fibrosis, nerve fibre density quantification, and glomeruli detection in the kidney.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/X-tN569iWBE&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: A Very Fast Time Scale of Human Motor Adaptation: Within Movement Adjustments of Internal Representations during Reaching</title>
	<link>http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/7/1/ENEURO.0149-19.2019?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Humans and other animals adapt motor commands to predictable disturbances within tens of trials in laboratory conditions. A central question is how does the nervous system adapt to disturbances in natural conditions when exactly the same movements cannot be practiced several times. Because motor commands and sensory feedback together carry continuous information about limb dynamics, we hypothesized that the nervous system could adapt to unexpected disturbances online. We tested this hypothesis in two reaching experiments during which velocity-dependent force fields (FFs) were randomly applied. We found that within-movement feedback corrections gradually improved, despite the fact that the perturbations were unexpected. Moreover, when participants were instructed to stop at a via-point, the application of a FF prior to the via-point induced mirror-image after-effects after the via-point, consistent with within-trial adaptation to the unexpected dynamics. These findings suggest a fast time-scale of motor learning, which complements feedback control and supports adaptation of an ongoing movement.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>RSS PAP: Carrier of Wingless (Cow) Regulation of Drosophila Neuromuscular Junction Development</title>
	<link>http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0285-19.2020v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;The first Wnt signaling ligand discovered, &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; Wingless (Wg; Wnt1 in mammals), plays critical roles in neuromuscular junction (NMJ) development, regulating synaptic architecture and function. Heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs), consisting of a core protein with heparan sulfate (HS) glycosaminoglycan (GAG) chains, bind to Wg ligands to control both extracellular distribution and intercellular signaling function. &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; HSPGs previously shown to regulate Wg &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;-synaptic signaling at the NMJ include the glypican Dally-like Protein (Dlp) and perlecan Terribly Reduced Optic Lobes (Trol). Here, we investigate synaptogenic functions of the most recently described &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; HSPG, secreted Carrier of Wingless (Cow), which directly binds Wg in the extracellular space. At the glutamatergic NMJ, we find that Cow secreted from the presynaptic motor neuron acts to limit synaptic architecture and neurotransmission strength. In c&lt;i&gt;ow&lt;/i&gt; null mutants, we find increased synaptic bouton number and elevated excitatory current amplitudes, phenocopying presynaptic Wg overexpression. We show &lt;i&gt;cow&lt;/i&gt; null mutants exhibit an increased number of glutamatergic synapses and increased synaptic vesicle (SV) fusion frequency based both on GCaMP imaging and electrophysiology recording. We find that membrane-tethered Wg prevents &lt;i&gt;cow&lt;/i&gt; null defects in NMJ development, indicating that Cow mediates secreted Wg signaling. It was shown previously that the secreted Wg deacylase Notum restricts Wg signaling at the NMJ, and we show here that Cow and Notum work through the same pathway to limit synaptic development. We conclude Cow acts cooperatively with Notum to coordinate neuromuscular synapse structural and functional differentiation via negative regulation of Wg &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;-synaptic signaling within the extracellular synaptomatrix.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Wnt intercellular signaling is disrupted in numerous devastating neurological disorders, including Alzheimer’s disease. Therefore, an understanding of Wnt signaling regulation is important for the design and implementation of targeted treatments. As a disease model, the &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; glutamatergic NMJ system is large, accessible and genetically malleable, and thus well suited for discovering the molecular and cellular mechanisms of Wnt signaling regulation. Extracellular HSPGs are important players as regulators of Wnt intercellular signaling. Here, we show secreted HSPG Carrier of Wingless (Cow), which directly binds to the founding Wnt-1 ligand, regulates NMJ structure and function. The mammalian homolog of Cow, Testican-2, is highly expressed in the brain. Studying this HSPG in &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; should inform mechanisms of Wnt regulation in human brain.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: ICAM5 as a Novel Target for Treating Cognitive Impairment in Fragile X Syndrome</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/40/6/1355?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most common inherited form of intellectual disability, resulted from the silencing of the &lt;i&gt;Fmr1&lt;/i&gt; gene and the subsequent loss of fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP). Spine dysgenesis and cognitive impairment have been extensively characterized in FXS; however, the underlying mechanism remains poorly understood. As an important regulator of spine maturation, intercellular adhesion molecule 5 (ICAM5) mRNA may be one of the targets of FMRP and involved in cognitive impairment in FXS. Here we show that in &lt;i&gt;Fmr1&lt;/i&gt; KO male mice, ICAM5 was excessively expressed during the late developmental stage, and its expression was negatively correlated with the expression of FMRP and positively related with the morphological abnormalities of dendritic spines. While &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; reduction of ICAM5 normalized dendritic spine abnormalities in &lt;i&gt;Fmr1&lt;/i&gt; KO neurons, and &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; knockdown of ICAM5 in the dentate gyrus rescued the impaired spatial and fear memory and anxiety-like behaviors in &lt;i&gt;Fmr1&lt;/i&gt; KO mice, through both granule cell and mossy cell with a relative rate of 1.32 ± 0.15. Furthermore, biochemical analyses showed direct binding of FMRP with ICAM5 mRNA, to the coding sequence of ICAM5 mRNA. Together, our study suggests that ICAM5 is one of the targets of FMRP and is implicated in the molecular pathogenesis of FXS. ICAM5 could be a therapeutic target for treating cognitive impairment in FXS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is characterized by dendritic spine dysgenesis and cognitive dysfunctions, while one of the FMRP latent targets, ICAM5, is well established for contributing both spine maturation and learning performance. In this study, we examined the potential link between ICAM5 mRNA and FMRP in FXS, and further investigated the molecular details and pathological consequences of ICAM5 overexpression. Our results indicate a critical role of ICAM5 in spine maturation and cognitive impairment in FXS and suggest that ICAM5 is a potential molecular target for the development of medication against FXS.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Calcineurin Promotes Neuroplastic Changes in the Amygdala Associated with Weakened Cocaine-Cue Memories</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/40/6/1344?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Interfering with memory reconsolidation or inducing memory extinction are two approaches for weakening maladaptive memories in disorders such as addiction and post-traumatic stress disorder. Both extinction and reconsolidation are regulated by intracellular protein kinases and phosphatases, and interfering with these signaling molecules can alter memory strength. The calcium-dependent protein phosphatase, calcineurin (CaN), has been implicated in both the consolidation and extinction of fear memories. However, the role of CaN in regulating drug-cue associative memories has not been investigated. Prior studies have demonstrated that plasticity at thalamo-lateral amygdala (T-LA) synapses is critically involved in the regulation of cocaine-cue memories. Therefore, in the present study, we tested the effects of LA administration of an activator of CaN, chlorogenic acid (CGA), on behavioral and electrophysiological indices of cocaine cue memory reconsolidation and extinction. Male, Sprague-Dawley rats were trained to self-administer cocaine paired with an audiovisual cue. The cue memory was then either briefly reactivated, extinguished, or not manipulated, followed immediately by LA infusion of CGA. Rats were tested 24 h later for cue-induced reinstatement, or LA slices were prepared for electrophysiological recordings. We found that intra-LA infusions of CGA following cue extinction or reconsolidation reduced cue-induced reinstatement, which was blocked by co-infusion of the CaN inhibitor, FK-506. Similarly, CGA infusions following cue re-exposure significantly attenuated EPSC amplitude at T-LA synapses, suggesting that CaN affects cocaine-cue memory reconsolidation and extinction by altering T-LA synaptic strength. Therefore, CaN signaling in the LA may represent a novel target for disrupting cocaine-associated memories to reduce relapse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Repetitive drug use induces synaptic plasticity that underlies the formation of long-lasting associative memories for environmental cues paired with the drug. We previously identified thalamo-amygdala synapses (T-LA) that project via the interal capsule, as an important locus for the regulation of cocaine-cue memories. These synapses are strengthened by repeated cocaine-cue pairings, but this is reversed by extinction training or by optogenetic induction of &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; long-term depression (LTD). Here, we demonstrate that activating calcineurin, a calcium-dependent phosphatase, following the reactivation or extinction of a cocaine-cue memory, induces LTD-like changes at T-LA synapses, and a corresponding decrease in cue-induced reinstatement, suggesting that calcineurin may be a potential therapeutic target for relapse prevention.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: The Nucleus Accumbens Core Is Necessary for Responding to Incentive But Not Instructive Stimuli</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/40/6/1332?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;An abundant literature has highlighted the importance of the nucleus accumbens core (NAcC) in behavioral tasks dependent on external stimuli. Yet, some studies have also reported the absence of involvement of the NAcC in stimuli processing. We aimed at comparing, in male rats, the underlying neuronal determinants of incentive and instructive stimuli in the same task. We developed a variant of a GO/NOGO task that reveals important differences in these two types of stimuli. The incentive stimulus invites the rat to engage in the task sequence. Once the rat has decided to initiate a trial, it remains engaged in the task until the end of the trial. This task revealed the differential contribution of the NAcC to responding to different types of stimuli: responding to the incentive stimulus depended on NAcC AMPA/NMDA and dopamine D1 receptors, but the retrieval of the response associated with the instructive stimuli (lever pressing on GO, withholding on NOGO) did not. Our electrophysiological study showed that more NAcC neurons responded more strongly to the incentive than the instructive stimuli. Furthermore, when animals did not respond to the incentive stimulus, the induced excitation was suppressed for most projection neurons, whereas interneurons were strongly activated at a latency preceding that found in projection neurons. This work provides insight on the underlying neuronal processes explaining the preferential implication of the NAcC in deciding whether and when to engage in reward-seeking rather than to decide which action to perform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The nucleus accumbens core (NAcC) is essential to process information carried by reward-predicting stimuli. Yet, stimuli have distinct properties: incentive stimuli orient the attention toward reward-seeking, whereas instructive stimuli inform about the action to perform. Our study shows that, in male rats, NAcC perturbation with glutamate or dopamine antagonists impeded responses to the incentive but not to the instructive stimulus. NAcC neuronal recordings revealed a stronger representation of incentive than instructive stimuli. Furthermore, we found that interneurons are recruited when rats fail to respond to incentive stimuli. This work provides insight on the underlying neuronal processes explaining the preferential implication of the NAcC in deciding whether and when to engage in reward-seeking rather than to decide which action to perform.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Cocaine Dysregulates Dynorphin Modulation of Inhibitory Neurotransmission in the Ventral Pallidum in a Cell-Type-Specific Manner</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/40/6/1321?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Cocaine-driven changes in the modulation of neurotransmission by neuromodulators are poorly understood. The ventral pallidum (VP) is a key structure in the reward system, in which GABA neurotransmission is regulated by opioid neuropeptides, including dynorphin. However, it is not known whether dynorphin acts differently on different cell types in the VP and whether its effects are altered by withdrawal from cocaine. Here, we trained wild-type, D1-Cre, A2A-Cre, or vGluT2-Cre:Ai9 male and female mice in a cocaine conditioned place preference protocol followed by 2 weeks of abstinence, and then recorded GABAergic synaptic input evoked either electrically or optogenetically onto identified VP neurons before and after applying dynorphin. We found that after cocaine CPP and abstinence dynorphin attenuated inhibitory input to VP&lt;sub&gt;GABA&lt;/sub&gt; neurons through a postsynaptic mechanism. This effect was absent in saline mice. Furthermore, this effect was seen specifically on the inputs from nucleus accumbens medium spiny neurons expressing either the D1 or the D2 dopamine receptor. Unlike its effect on VP&lt;sub&gt;GABA&lt;/sub&gt; neurons, dynorphin surprisingly potentiated the inhibitory input on VP&lt;sub&gt;vGluT2&lt;/sub&gt; neurons, but this effect was abolished after cocaine CPP and abstinence. Thus, dynorphin has contrasting influences on GABA input to VP&lt;sub&gt;GABA&lt;/sub&gt; and VP&lt;sub&gt;vGluT2&lt;/sub&gt; neurons and these influences are affected differentially by cocaine CPP and abstinence. Collectively, our data suggest a role for dynorphin in withdrawal through its actions in the VP. As VP&lt;sub&gt;GABA&lt;/sub&gt; and VP&lt;sub&gt;vGluT2&lt;/sub&gt; neurons have contrasting effects on drug-seeking behavior, our data may indicate a complex role for dynorphin in withdrawal from cocaine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The ventral pallidum consists mainly of GABAergic reward-promoting neurons, but it also encloses a subgroup of aversion-promoting glutamatergic neurons. Dynorphin, an opioid neuropeptide abundant in the ventral pallidum, shows differential modulation of GABA input to GABAergic and glutamatergic pallidal neurons and may therefore affect both the rewarding and aversive aspects of withdrawal. Indeed, abstinence after repeated exposure to cocaine alters dynorphin actions in a cell-type-specific manner; after abstinence dynorphin suppresses the inhibitory drive on the &quot;rewarding&quot; GABAergic neurons but ceases to modulate the inhibitory drive on the &quot;aversive&quot; glutamatergic neurons. This reflects a complex role for dynorphin in cocaine reward and abstinence.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Task-Free Functional Language Networks: Reproducibility and Clinical Application</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/40/6/1311?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Intrinsic connectivity networks (ICNs) identified through task-free fMRI (tf-fMRI) offer the opportunity to investigate human brain circuits involved in language processes without requiring participants to perform challenging cognitive tasks. In this study, we assessed the ability of tf-fMRI to isolate reproducible networks critical for specific language functions and often damaged in primary progressive aphasia (PPA). First, we performed whole-brain seed-based correlation analyses on tf-fMRI data to identify ICNs anchored in regions known for articulatory, phonological, and semantic processes in healthy male and female controls (HCs). We then evaluated the reproducibility of these ICNs in an independent cohort of HCs, and recapitulated their functional relevance with a &lt;i&gt;post hoc&lt;/i&gt; meta-analysis on task-based fMRI. Last, we investigated whether atrophy in these ICNs could inform the differential diagnosis of nonfluent/agrammatic, semantic, and logopenic PPA variants. The identified ICNs included a dorsal articulatory-phonological network involving inferior frontal and supramarginal regions; a ventral semantic network involving anterior middle temporal and angular gyri; a speech perception network involving superior temporal and sensorimotor regions; and a network between posterior inferior temporal and intraparietal regions likely linking visual, phonological, and attentional processes for written language. These ICNs were highly reproducible across independent groups and revealed areas consistent with those emerging from task-based meta-analysis. By comparing ICNs' spatial distribution in HCs with patients' atrophy patterns, we identified ICNs associated with each PPA variant. Our findings demonstrate the potential use of tf-fMRI to investigate the functional status of language networks in patients for whom activation studies can be methodologically challenging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; We showed that a single, short, task-free fMRI acquisition is able to identify four reproducible and relatively segregated intrinsic left-dominant networks associated with articulatory, phonological, semantic, and multimodal orthography-to-phonology processes, in HCs. We also showed that these intrinsic networks relate to syndrome-specific atrophy patterns in primary progressive aphasia. Collectively, our results support the application of task-free fMRI in future research to study functionality of language circuits in patients for whom tasked-based activation studies might be methodologically challenging.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Electrical Coupling of Heterotypic Ganglion Cells in the Mammalian Retina</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/40/6/1302?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Electrical coupling has been reported to occur only between homotypic retinal ganglion cells, in line with the concept of parallel processing in the early visual system. Here, however, we show reciprocal correlated firing between heterotypic ganglion cells in multielectrode array recordings during light stimulation in retinas of adult guinea pigs of either sex. Heterotypic coupling was further confirmed via tracer spread after intracellular injections of single cells with neurobiotin. Both electrically coupled cell types were sustained ON center ganglion cells but showed distinct light response properties and receptive field sizes. We identified one of the involved cell types as sustained ON α-ganglion cells. The presence of electrical coupling between heterotypic ganglion cells introduces a network motif in which the signals of distinct ganglion cell types are partially mixed at the output stage of the retina.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The visual information is split into parallel pathways, before it is sent to the brain via the output neurons of the retina, the ganglion cells. Ganglion cells can form electrical synapses between dendrites of neighboring cells in support of lateral information exchange. To date, ganglion-to-ganglion cell coupling is thought to occur only between cells of the same type. Here, however, we show that electrical coupling between different types of ganglion cells exists in the mammalian retina. We provide functional and anatomical evidence that two different types of ganglion cells share information via electrical coupling. This new network motif extends the impact of the heavily studied coding benefits of homotypic coupling to heterotypic coupling across parallel neuronal pathways.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Neuronal Activity in the Primate Amygdala during Economic Choice</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/40/6/1286?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Multiple lines of evidence link economic choices to the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), but other brain regions may contribute to the computation and comparison of economic values. A particularly strong candidate is the basolateral amygdala (BLA). Amygdala lesions impair performance in reinforcer devaluation tasks, suggesting that the BLA contributes to value computation. Furthermore, previous studies of the BLA have found neuronal activity consistent with a value representation. Here, we recorded from the BLA of two male rhesus macaques choosing between different juices. Offered quantities varied from trial to trial, and relative values were inferred from choices. Approximately one-third of BLA cells were task-related. Our analyses revealed the presence of three groups of neurons encoding variables &lt;i&gt;offer value&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;chosen value&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;chosen juice&lt;/i&gt;. In this respect, the BLA appeared similar to the OFC. The two areas differed for the proportion of neurons in each group, as the fraction of &lt;i&gt;chosen value&lt;/i&gt; cells was significantly higher in the BLA. Importantly, the activity of these neurons reflected the subjective nature of value. Firing rates in the BLA were sustained throughout the trial and maximal after juice delivery. In contrast, firing rates in the OFC were phasic and maximal shortly after offer presentation. Our results suggest that the BLA supports economic choice and reward expectation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Economic choices rely on the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), but other brain regions may contribute to this behavior. A strong candidate is the basolateral amygdala (BLA). Previous results are consistent with a neuronal representation of value, but the role of the BLA in economic decisions remains unclear. Here, we recorded from monkeys choosing between juices. Neurons in the BLA encoded three decision variables: &lt;i&gt;offer value&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;chosen value&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;chosen juice&lt;/i&gt;. These variables were also identified in the OFC. The two areas differed in the proportion of cells encoding each variable and in the activation timing. In the OFC, firing rates peaked shortly after offer presentation; in the BLA, firing rates were sustained and peaked after juice delivery. These results suggest that the BLA supports choices and reward expectation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Projection-Specific Potentiation of Ventral Pallidal Glutamatergic Outputs after Abstinence from Cocaine</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/40/6/1276?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The ventral pallidum (VP) is a central node in the reward system that is strongly implicated in reward and addiction. Although the majority of VP neurons are GABAergic and encode reward, recent studies revealed a novel glutamatergic neuronal population in the VP [VP neurons expressing the vesicular glutamate transporter 2 (VP&lt;sub&gt;VGluT2&lt;/sub&gt;)], whose activation generates aversion. Withdrawal from drugs has been shown to induce drastic synaptic changes in neuronal populations associated with reward, such as the ventral tegmental area (VTA) or nucleus accumbens neurons, but less is known about cocaine-induced synaptic changes in neurons classically linked with aversion. Here, we demonstrate that VP&lt;sub&gt;VGluT2&lt;/sub&gt; neurons contact different targets with different intensities, and that cocaine conditioned place preference (CPP) training followed by abstinence selectively potentiates their synapses on targets that encode aversion. Using whole-cell patch-clamp recordings combined with optogenetics in male and female transgenic mice, we show that VP&lt;sub&gt;VGluT2&lt;/sub&gt; neurons preferentially contact aversion-related neurons, such as lateral habenula neurons and VTA GABAergic neurons, with minor input to reward-related neurons, such as VTA dopamine and VP GABA neurons. Moreover, after cocaine CPP and abstinence, the VP&lt;sub&gt;VGluT2&lt;/sub&gt; input to the aversion-related structures is potentiated, whereas the input to the reward-related structures is depressed. Thus, cocaine CPP followed by abstinence may allow VP&lt;sub&gt;VGluT2&lt;/sub&gt; neurons to recruit aversion-related targets more readily and therefore be part of the mechanism underlying the aversive symptoms seen after withdrawal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The biggest problem in drug addiction is the high propensity to relapse. One central driver for relapse events is the negative aversive symptoms experienced by addicts during withdrawal. In this work, we propose a possible mechanism for the intensification of aversive feelings after withdrawal that involves the glutamatergic neurons of the ventral pallidum. We show not only that these neurons are most strongly connected to aversive targets, such as the lateral habenula, but also that, after abstinence, their synapses on aversive targets are strengthened, whereas the synapses on other rewarding targets are weakened. These data illustrate how after abstinence from cocaine, aversive pathways change in a manner that may contribute to relapse.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: A Multidimensional Neural Maturation Index Reveals Reproducible Developmental Patterns in Children and Adolescents</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/40/6/1265?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Adolescence is a time of extensive neural restructuring, leaving one susceptible to atypical development. Although neural maturation in humans can be measured using functional and structural MRI, the subtle patterns associated with the initial stages of abnormal change may be difficult to identify, particularly at an individual level. Brain age prediction models may have utility in assessing brain development in an individualized manner, as deviations between chronological age and predicted brain age could reflect one's divergence from typical development. Here, we built a support vector regression model to summarize high-dimensional neuroimaging as an index of brain age in both sexes. Using structural and functional MRI data from two large pediatric datasets and a third clinical dataset, we produced and validated a two-dimensional neural maturation index (NMI) that characterizes typical brain maturation patterns and identifies those who deviate from this trajectory. Examination of brain signatures associated with NMI scores revealed that elevated scores were related to significantly lower gray matter volume and significantly higher white matter volume, particularly in high-order regions such as the prefrontal cortex. Additionally, those with higher NMI scores exhibited enhanced connectivity in several functional brain networks, including the default mode network. Analysis of data from a sample of male and female patients with schizophrenia revealed an association between advanced NMI scores and schizophrenia diagnosis in participants aged 16–22, confirming the NMI's utility as a marker of atypicality. Altogether, our findings support the NMI as an individualized, interpretable measure by which neural development in adolescence may be assessed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The substantial neural restructuring that occurs during adolescence increases one's vulnerability to aberration. A brain index that is capable of capturing one's conformance with typical development will allow for individualized assessment and enhance our understanding of typical and atypical development. In this analysis, we produce a neural maturation index (NMI) using support vector regression and a large pediatric sample. This index generalizes across multiple cohorts and shows potential in the identification of clinical groups. We also implement a novel method for examining the developmental trajectory through data-driven analysis. The signatures identified by the NMI reflect key stages of the extensive neural development that occurs during adolescence and support its utility as a metric of typical brain development.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Grafting Embryonic Raphe Neurons Reestablishes Serotonergic Regulation of Sympathetic Activity to Improve Cardiovascular Function after Spinal Cord Injury</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/40/6/1248?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Cardiovascular dysfunction often occurs after high-level spinal cord injury. Disrupting supraspinal vasomotor pathways affects basal hemodynamics and contributes to the development of autonomic dysreflexia (AD). Transplantation of early-stage neurons to the injured cord may reconstruct the descending projections to enhance cardiovascular performance. To determine the specific role of reestablishing serotonergic regulation of hemodynamics, we implanted serotonergic (5-HT&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) neuron-enriched embryonic raphe nucleus-derived neural stem cells/progenitors (RN-NSCs) into a complete spinal cord transection lesion site in adult female rats. Grafting embryonic spinal cord-derived NSCs or injury alone served as 2 controls. Ten weeks after injury/grafting, histological analysis revealed well-survived grafts and partial integration with host tissues in the lesion site. Numerous graft-derived serotonergic axons topographically projected to the caudal autonomic regions. Neuronal tracing showed that host supraspinal vasomotor pathways regenerated into the graft, and 5-HT&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; neurons within graft and host brainstem neurons were transsynaptically labeled by injecting pseudorabies virus (PRV-614) into the kidney, indicating reconnected serotonergic circuits regulating autonomic activity. Using an implanted telemeter to record cardiovascular parameters, grafting RN-NSCs restored resting mean arterial pressure to normal levels and remarkably alleviated naturally occurring and colorectal distension-induced AD. Subsequent pharmacological blockade of 5-HT&lt;sub&gt;2A&lt;/sub&gt; receptors with ketanserin in RN-NSC-grafted rats reduced resting mean arterial pressure and increased heart rate in all but 2 controls. Furthermore, spinal cord retransection below RN-NSC grafts partially eliminated the recovery in AD. Collectively, these data indicate that RN-NSCs grafted into a spinal cord injury site relay supraspinal control of serotonergic regulation for sympathetic activity to improve cardiovascular function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Disruption of supraspinal vasomotor pathways results in cardiovascular dysfunction following high-level spinal cord injury. To reestablish the descending regulation of autonomic function, we transplanted serotonergic neuron enriched embryonic raphe nucleus-derived neural stem cells/progenitors into the lesion site of completely transected rat spinal cord. Consequently, grafted raphe nucleus-derived neural stem cells/progenitors acted as a neuronal relay to reconnect supraspinal center and spinal sympathetic neurons below the injury. The reconstituted serotonergic regulation of sympathetic activity led to the improvement of hemodynamic parameters and mitigated autonomic dysreflexia. Based on morphological and physiological results, this study validates the effectiveness of transplanting early-stage serotonergic neurons into the spinal cord for cardiovascular functional recovery after spinal cord injury.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Midkine-a Is Required for Cell Cycle Progression of Müller Glia during Neuronal Regeneration in the Vertebrate Retina</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/40/6/1232?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In the retina of zebrafish, Müller glia have the ability to reprogram into stem cells capable of regenerating all classes of retinal neurons and restoring visual function. Understanding the cellular and molecular mechanisms controlling the stem cell properties of Müller glia in zebrafish may provide cues to unlock the regenerative potential in the mammalian nervous system. Midkine is a cytokine/growth factor with multiple roles in neural development, tissue repair, and disease. In &lt;i&gt;midkine-a&lt;/i&gt; loss-of-function mutants of both sexes, Müller glia initiate the appropriate reprogramming response to photoreceptor death by increasing expression of stem cell-associated genes, and entering the G&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; phase of the cell cycle. However, transition from G&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; to S phase is blocked in the absence of Midkine-a, resulting in significantly reduced proliferation and selective failure to regenerate cone photoreceptors. Failing to progress through the cell cycle, Müller glia undergo reactive gliosis, a pathological hallmark in the injured CNS of mammals. Finally, we determined that the Midkine-a receptor, anaplastic lymphoma kinase, is upstream of the HLH regulatory protein, Id2a, and of the retinoblastoma gene, &lt;i&gt;p130&lt;/i&gt;, which regulates progression through the cell cycle. These results demonstrate that Midkine-a functions as a core component of the mechanisms that regulate proliferation of stem cells in the injured CNS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The death of retinal neurons and photoreceptors is a leading cause of vision loss. Regenerating retinal neurons is a therapeutic goal. Zebrafish can regenerate retinal neurons from intrinsic stem cells, Müller glia, and are a powerful model to understand how stem cells might be used therapeutically. Midkine-a, an injury-induced growth factor/cytokine that is expressed by Müller glia following neuronal death, is required for Müller glia to progress through the cell cycle. The absence of Midkine-a suspends proliferation and neuronal regeneration. With cell cycle progression stalled, Müller glia undergo reactive gliosis, a pathological hallmark of the mammalian retina. This work provides a unique insight into mechanisms that control the cell cycle during neuronal regeneration.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor Has a Transsynaptic Trophic Effect on Neural Activity in an Adult Forebrain Circuit</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/40/6/1226?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;While hormone-driven plasticity in the adult brain is well studied, the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms are less well understood. One example of this is seasonal plasticity in the avian brain, where song nuclei exhibit hormonally driven changes in response to changing photoperiod and circulating sex steroid hormones. Hormone receptor activation in song nucleus HVC (proper name) elicits a robust change in activity in target nucleus RA (robust nucleus of the arcopallium), but the molecular signal responsible for this is unknown. This study addressed whether brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) mediates a transsynaptic effect from HVC to RA in male Gambel's white-crowned sparrows (&lt;i&gt;Zonotrichia leucophrys gambelii&lt;/i&gt;). &lt;i&gt;In situ&lt;/i&gt; hybridization confirmed an increase in BDNF expression in HVC neurons of birds switched to a long-day (LD) photoperiod plus systemically elevated testosterone (T) levels, compared with short-day (SD) conditions. BDNF expression was virtually absent in RA neurons of SD birds, increasing to barely detectable levels in a small subset of cells in LD+T birds. Infusion of BDNF protein adjacent to the RA of SD birds caused an increase in the spontaneous neuron firing rate. Conversely, the infusion of ANA12, a specific antagonist of the tyrosine-related kinase B (TrkB) for BDNF, prevented the increase in RA neuron firing rate in LD+T birds. These results indicate that BDNF is sufficient, and TrkB receptor activation is necessary, for the transsynaptic trophic effect exerted by HVC on RA. The dramatic change in the activity of RA neurons during the breeding season provides a clear example of transsynaptic BDNF effects in the adult brain in a functionally relevant circuit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Sex steroid hormones drive changes in brain circuits in all vertebrates, both within specific neurons and on their synaptic targets. Such changes can lead to profound changes in behavior, but little is known about the precise molecular mechanisms that underlie this process. We addressed this question in a seasonally breeding songbird and found that the trophic effects of one forebrain song nucleus on its target are mediated transsynaptically by the neurotrophin BDNF. This suggests that, in addition to their role in development, neurotrophins have critical roles in adult brain plasticity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Gamma Visual Stimulation Induces a Neuroimmune Signaling Profile Distinct from Acute Neuroinflammation</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/40/6/1211?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Many neurodegenerative and neurological diseases are rooted in dysfunction of the neuroimmune system; therefore, manipulating this system has strong therapeutic potential. Prior work has shown that exposing mice to flickering lights at 40 Hz drives gamma frequency (~40 Hz) neural activity and recruits microglia, the primary immune cells of the brain, revealing a novel method to manipulate the neuroimmune system. However, the biochemical signaling mechanisms between 40 Hz neural activity and immune recruitment remain unknown. Here, we exposed wild-type male mice to 5–60 min of 40 Hz or control flicker and assessed cytokine and phosphoprotein networks known to play a role in immune function. We found that 40 Hz flicker leads to increases in the expression of cytokines which promote microglial phagocytic states, such as IL-6 and IL-4, and increased expression of microglial chemokines, such as macrophage-colony-stimulating factor and monokine induced by interferon-. Interestingly, cytokine effects differed as a function of stimulation frequency, revealing a range of neuroimmune effects of stimulation. To identify possible mechanisms underlying cytokine expression, we quantified the effect of the flicker on intracellular signaling pathways known to regulate cytokine levels. We found that a 40 Hz flicker upregulates phospho-signaling within the nuclear factor -light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-B) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways. While cytokine expression increased after 1 h of 40 Hz flicker stimulation, protein phosphorylation in the NF-B pathway was upregulated within minutes. Importantly, the cytokine expression profile induced by 40 Hz flicker was different from cytokine changes in response to acute neuroinflammation induced by lipopolysaccharides. These results are the first, to our knowledge, to show how visual stimulation rapidly induces critical neuroimmune signaling in healthy animals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Prior work has shown that exposing mice to lights flickering at 40 Hz induces neural spiking activity at 40 Hz (within the gamma frequency) and recruits microglia, the primary immune cells of the brain. However, the immediate effect of 40 Hz flicker on neuroimmune biochemical signaling was unknown. We found that 40 Hz flicker leads to significant increases in the expression of cytokines, key immune signals known to recruit microglia. Furthermore, we found that 40 Hz flicker rapidly changes the phosphorylation of proteins in the NF-B and MAPK pathways, both known to regulate cytokine expression. Our findings are the first to delineate a specific rapid immune signaling response following 40 Hz visual stimulation, highlighting both the unique nature and therapeutic potential of this treatment.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Mimicking Age-Associated Gadd45{gamma} Dysregulation Results in Memory Impairments in Young Adult Mice</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/40/6/1197?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Age-related memory loss is observed across multiple mammalian species and preferentially affects hippocampus-dependent memory. Memory impairments are characterized by accelerated decay of spatial memories. Nevertheless, the molecular mechanisms underlying these deficits are still largely unknown. Here, we investigated the expression and function of the growth arrest DNA damage (Gadd45) family during aging and cognition, respectively. We report that aging impairs the expression of Gadd45 in the hippocampus of cognitively impaired male mice. Mimicking this decrease in young adult male mice led to age-like memory deficits in hippocampus-dependent memory tasks. Gadd45 reduction impaired the activity of key components of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway (p38 and JNK) in mouse hippocampal cultures. Furthermore, we found that activation of downstream targets, such as ATF-2, c-Jun, and CREB (cAMP response element-binding protein), was disrupted. Finally, we showed that Gadd45 is required for induction of key early- and late-response genes that have been associated with aging. Together, these findings indicate that Gadd45 expression regulates cognitive abilities and synapse-to-nucleus communication and suggest Gadd45 dysfunction as a potential mechanism contributing to age-related cognitive impairments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; A high percentage of subjects experience age-related memory loss that burdens daily performance. Although many advances have been made, the precise changes in the brain governing these deficits are unclear. Identifying molecular processes that are required for cognition and are altered during old age is crucial to develop preventive or therapeutic strategies. Here, we show that baseline and learning-induced expression of the growth arrest DNA damage (Gadd45)  is selectively impaired in the hippocampus of aged mice with cognitive deficits. Next, we show that modeling this impairment in young adult mice with normal cognitive performance disrupts long- and short-term memories in an age-like manner. Finally, we demonstrate that Gadd45 regulates synapse-to-nucleus communication processes that are needed for plasticity-associated gene expression.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Recent advances in brain organoid technology have created new opportunities to investigate the formation and function of the human brain, under physiological and pathological conditions. Brain organoids can be generated to model the cellular and structural development of the human brain, and allow the investigation of the intricate interactions between resident neural and glial cell types. Combined with new advances in gene editing, imaging, and genomic analysis, brain organoid technology can be applied to address questions pertinent to human brain development, disease, and evolution. However, the current iterations of brain organoids also have limitations in faithfully recapitulating the &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; processes. In this perspective, we evaluate the recent progress in brain organoid technology, and discuss the experimental considerations for its utilization.&lt;/p&gt;

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) have revolutionized research on human diseases, particularly neurodegenerative and psychiatric disorders, making it possible to study mechanisms of disease risk and initiation in otherwise inaccessible patient-specific cells. Today, the integration of CRISPR engineering approaches with hiPSC-based models permits precise isogenic comparisons of human neurons and glia. This review is intended as a guideline for neuroscientists and clinicians interested in translating their research to hiPSC-based studies. It offers state-of-the-art approaches to tackling the challenges that are unique to human &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; disease models, particularly interdonor and intradonor variability, and limitations in neuronal maturity and circuit complexity. Finally, we provide a detailed overview of the immense possibilities the field has to offer, highlighting efficient neural differentiation and induction strategies for the major brain cell types and providing perspective into integrating CRISPR-based methods into study design. The combination of hiPSC-based disease modeling, CRISPR technology, and high-throughput approaches promises to advance our scientific knowledge and accelerate progress in drug discovery.&lt;/p&gt;

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2002.01467</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In psychiatry, we often speak of constructing &quot;models.&quot; Here we try to make
sense of what such a claim might mean, starting with the most fundamental
question: &quot;What is (and isn't) a model?&quot;. We then discuss, in a concrete
measurable sense, what it means for a model to be useful. In so doing, we first
identify the added value that a computational model can provide, in the context
of accuracy and power. We then present the limitations of standard statistical
methods and provide suggestions for how we can expand the explanatory power of
our analyses by reconceptualizing statistical models as dynamical systems.
Finally, we address the problem of model building, suggesting ways in which
computational psychiatry can escape the potential for cognitive biases imposed
by classical hypothesis-driven research, exploiting deep systems-level
information contained within neuroimaging data to advance our understanding of
psychiatric neuroscience.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2002.01126</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Declarative memory has been studied for its relationship with remembering
daily life experiences. Previous studies reported changes in power spectra
during encoding phase related to behavioral performance, however decoding phase
still needs to be explored. This study investigates neural oscillations changes
related to memory process. Participants were asked to perform a memory task for
encoding and decoding phase while EEG signals were recorded. Results showed
that for encoding phase, there was a significant decrease of power in low beta,
high beta bands over fronto-central area and a decrease in low beta, high beta
and gamma bands over left temporal area related to successful subsequent memory
effects. For decoding phase, only significant decreases of alpha power were
observed over fronto-central area. This finding showed relevance of beta and
alpha band for encoding and decoding phase of a memory task respectively.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In this study, 3D brain-computer interface (BCI) training platforms were used
to stimulate the subjects for visual motion imagery and visual perception. We
measured the activation brain region and alpha-band power activity when the
subjects perceived and imagined the stimuli. Based on this, 4-class were
classified in visual stimuli session and visual motion imagery session
respectively. The results showed that the occipital region is involved in
visual perception and visual motion imagery, and alpha-band power is increased
in visual motion imagery session and decreased in visual motion stimuli
session. Compared with the performance of visual motion imagery and motor
imagery, visual motion imagery has higher performance than motor imagery. The
binary class was classified using one versus rest approach as well as analysis
of brain activation to prove that visual-related brain wave signals are
meaningful, and the results were significant.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2002.01117</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Visual imagery is an intuitive brain-computer interface paradigm, referring
to the emergence of the visual scene. Despite its convenience, analysis of its
intrinsic characteristics is limited. In this study, we demonstrate the effect
of time interval and channel selection that affects the decoding performance of
the multi-class visual imagery. We divided the epoch into time intervals of 0-1
s and 1-2 s and performed six-class classification in three different brain
regions: whole brain, visual cortex, and prefrontal cortex. In the time
interval, 0-1 s group showed 24.2 % of average classification accuracy, which
was significantly higher than the 1-2 s group in the prefrontal cortex. In the
three different regions, the classification accuracy of the prefrontal cortex
showed significantly higher performance than the visual cortex in 0-1 s
interval group, implying the cognitive arousal during the visual imagery. This
finding would provide crucial information in improving the decoding
performance.

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Characterizing Adult Cochlear Supporting Cell Transcriptional Diversity Using Single-Cell RNA-Seq: Validation in the Adult Mouse and Translational Implications for the Adult Human Cochlea</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2020.00013</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Hearing loss is a problem that impacts a significant proportion of the adult population. Cochlear hair cell (HC) loss due to loud noise, chemotherapy and aging is the major underlying cause. A significant proportion of these individuals are dissatisfied with available treatment options which include hearing aids and cochlear implants. An alternative approach to restore hearing would be to regenerate HCs. Such therapy would require a recapitulation of the complex architecture of the organ of Corti, necessitating regeneration of both mature HCs and supporting cells (SCs). Transcriptional profiles of the mature cell types in the cochlea are necessary to can provide a metric for eventual regeneration therapies. To assist in this effort, we sought to provide the first single-cell characterization of the adult cochlear SC transcriptome. We performed single-cell RNA-Seq on FACS-purified adult cochlear SCs from the Lfng&lt;sup&gt;EGFP&lt;/sup&gt; adult mouse, in which SCs express GFP. We demonstrate that adult cochlear SCs are transcriptionally distinct from their perinatal counterparts. We establish cell-type-specific adult cochlear SC transcriptome profiles, and we validate these expression profiles through a combination of both fluorescent immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization co-localization and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) of adult cochlear SCs. Furthermore, we demonstrate the relevance of these profiles to the adult human cochlea through immunofluorescent human temporal bone histopathology. Finally, we demonstrate cell cycle regulator expression in adult SCs and perform pathway analyses to identify potential mechanisms for facilitating mitotic regeneration (cell proliferation, differentiation, and eventually regeneration) in the adult mammalian cochlea. Our findings demonstrate the importance of characterizing mature as opposed to perinatal SCs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Association of Hypomorphic P2X7 Receptor Genotype With Age</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2020.00008</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;One of the main risk factors for brain diseases is aging. Recent studies have shown that aging is a progressive degenerative process associated with chronic low-level inflammation. The ATP-gated P2X7 receptor (P2X7R) plays an important role in inflammation and has been associated with different brain (e.g., Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s) or other age-related (osteoporosis, arthritis, cancer) diseases. Several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the P2RX7 gene have been identified, including the loss-of-function 1513A&amp;gt;C and 1405A&amp;gt;G SNPs, and the gain-of-function 489C&amp;gt;T and 1068G&amp;gt;A SNPs. We carried out a literature analysis to verify an association between P2RX7 SNPs’ frequency and age. In 34 worldwide eligible studies (11.858 subjects) no correlation between 1513CC genotype frequency and age emerged. On the contrary, analysis of European Caucasian cohorts (7.241 subjects) showed a significant increase in 1513CC frequency with age (P = 0.027). In agreement with these findings, analysis of two publicly available datasets, including USA Caucasian cohorts, unveiled an increased frequency of 1513CC and 489CC genotypes with age (P = 0.0055 and P = 0.0019, respectively). Thus, hypomorphic P2RX7 genotypes may be positively selected with age in European and North American Caucasian populations. We hypothesize that Caucasian individuals bearing an anti-inflammatory P2X7R phenotype and living in high-income countries may have a longer life expectancy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00023</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Current evidence indicates that certain immune molecules such as components of the complement system are directly involved in neurobiological processes related to brain development, including neurogenesis, neuronal migration, synaptic remodeling, and response to prenatal or early postnatal brain insults. Consequently, complement system dysfunction has been increasingly implicated in disorders of neurodevelopmental origin, such as schizophrenia, autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and Rett syndrome. However, the mechanistic evidence for a causal relationship between impaired complement regulation and these disorders varies depending on the disease involved. Also, it is still unclear to what extent altered complement expression plays a role in these disorders through inflammation-independent or -dependent mechanisms. Furthermore, pathogenic mutations in specific complement components have been implicated in the etiology of 3MC syndrome, a rare autosomal recessive developmental disorder. The aims of this review are to discuss the current knowledge on the roles of the complement system in sculpting brain architecture and function during normal development as well as after specific inflammatory insults, such as maternal immune activation (MIA) during pregnancy, and to evaluate the existing evidence associating aberrant complement with developmental brain disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Background&lt;p&gt;Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the posterior subthalamic area (PSA) provides a potentially effective treatment for medication-refractory essential tremor (ET).&lt;/p&gt;Objective&lt;p&gt;To study the clinical benefits and adverse-event profile of bilateral PSA-DBS for refractory ET.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;Seven patients with refractory ET underwent bilateral PSA-DBS surgery under general anesthesia between September 2017 and May 2018. Clinical outcome assessments, using the Essential Tremor Rating Scale, were performed at 1-, 6-, and 12-month follow-up, except for the last assessment of one patient who was followed up to 9 months. Analysis was focused on changes in patients’ motor symptoms and quality of life following surgery as well as documenting the adverse-event profile associated with the surgical PSA-DBS treatment.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;After surgery, patients’ motor symptoms, including upper limb tremor and head tremor, were improved by 84.2% and their quality of life by 81.25% at 1-month follow-up. The clinical benefits to patients were maintained at 6-month and last follow-up. Adverse side effects included dysarthria (n = 4), balance disorder (n = 2), and paresthesia of the right limb (n = 1). No habituation effects were observed throughout the follow-up.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;Bilateral PSA-DBS seems to offer an effective and safe alternative treatment for medically intractable ET, warranting further research into its clinical utility, adverse-event profile, and comparative effectiveness.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Extremely Low Frequency Magnetic Fields Do Not Affect LTP-Like Plasticity in Healthy Humans</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00014</link>
	<content:encoded>Introduction&lt;p&gt;Several studies explored the biological effects of extremely low-frequency magnetic fields (ELF-MFs) in vitro, reporting the induction of functional changes in neuronal activity. In particular, ELF-MFs can influence synaptic plasticity both in vitro and in animal models but some studies reported an increase in long-term potentiation (LTP) whereas others suggested its reduction. However, no specific study has investigated such effect on humans.&lt;/p&gt;Aims&lt;p&gt;To evaluate whether ELF-MFs affect the propensity of the human cortex to undergo LTP-like plasticity.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;We designed a randomized, single-blind, sham-controlled, cross-over study on 10 healthy subjects. Cortical plasticity was induced by intermittent theta burst stimulation (iTBS) before and after 45-min ELF-MFs (75 Hz; 1.8 mT) or sham exposure and was estimated by measuring the changes of motor evoked potentials (MEP) amplitude before and after each iTBS.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;No adverse events were reported. No significant effects of ELF-MFs on cortical plasticity were found.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;Whole-brain exposure to ELF-MFs (75 Hz; 1.8 mT) is safe and does not seem to significantly affect LTP-like plasticity in human motor cortex.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Effects of Transcranial Stimulation With Direct and Alternating Current on Resting-State Functional Connectivity: An Exploratory Study Simultaneously Combining Stimulation and Multiband Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2019.00474</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Background: Transcranial stimulation with direct (tDCS) and alternating current (tACS) has increasingly gained interest in various fields, from cognitive neuroscience to clinical investigations. Transcranial current stimulation used alone may modulate brain activity that consequently influences behaviors, without providing information on potentially induced brain activity changes. The combination of transcranial current stimulation and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) may help to address this. This exploratory study investigated instantaneous and subsequent effects of tDCS and tACS on resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) in healthy adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: We conducted a randomized crossover study with 15 healthy subjects receiving three stimulation conditions (tDCS, tACS, and sham) on separate days. Stimulation was applied over the left and right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) for 30 min (1 mA). rsFC of the targeted prefrontal areas was assessed before, during, and after stimulation using multiband fMRI and using left and right DLPFC as seeds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Both tDCS and tACS increased rsFC during and after the stimulation period, as compared to sham. tDCS-induced changes were observed between the left DLPFC and bilateral parietal regions at the junction of the superior parietal and the inferior parietal lobules. tACS-induced changes were observed between the left DLPFC and the right inferior parietal lobule.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: Overall, these results suggest that a single session with a low dose, 1 mA, of tDCS or tACS can cause changes in fronto-parietal connectivity that occur rapidly, that is, within the first 15 min. Although exploratory, this work contributes to the discussion of the potential of transcranial current stimulation to modulate resting-state networks and the interest of combining transcranial current stimulation with neuroimaging to identify these changes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2019.00590</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Aging, noise, and ototoxic drug-induced hair cell (HC) loss are the major causes of sensorineural hearing loss. Aminoglycoside antibiotics are commonly used in the clinic, but these often have ototoxic side effects due to the accumulation of oxygen-free radicals and the subsequent induction of HC apoptosis. Blebbistatin is a myosin II inhibitor that regulates microtubule assembly and myosin–actin interactions, and most research has focused on its ability to modulate cardiac or urinary bladder contractility. By regulating the cytoskeletal structure and reducing the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), blebbistatin can prevent apoptosis in many different types of cells. However, there are no reports on the effect of blebbistatin in HC apoptosis. In this study, we found that the presence of blebbistatin significantly inhibited neomycin-induced apoptosis in HC-like HEI-OC-1 cells. We also found that blebbistatin treatment significantly increased the mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), decreased ROS accumulation, and inhibited pro-apoptotic gene expression in both HC-like HEI-OC-1 cells and explant-cultured cochlear HCs after neomycin exposure. Meanwhile, blebbistatin can protect the synaptic connections between HCs and cochlear spiral ganglion neurons. This study showed that blebbistatin could maintain mitochondrial function and reduce the ROS level and thus could maintain the viability of HCs after neomycin exposure and the neural function in the inner ear, suggesting that blebbistatin has potential clinic application in protecting against ototoxic drug-induced HC loss.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroanatomy | New and Recent Articles: Cytoarchitectonic Characterization and Functional Decoding of Four New Areas in the Human Lateral Orbitofrontal Cortex</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnana.2020.00002</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A comprehensive concept of the biological basis of reward, social and emotional behavior, and language requires a deeper understanding of the microstructure and connectivity of the underlying brain regions. Such understanding could provide deeper insights into their role in functional networks, and form the anatomical basis of the functional segregation of this region as shown in recent in vivo imaging studies. Here, we investigated the cytoarchitecture of the lateral orbitofrontal cortex (lateral OFC) in serial histological sections of 10 human postmortem brains by image analysis and a statistically reproducible approach to detect borders between cortical areas. Profiles of the volume fraction of cell bodies were therefore extracted from digitized histological images, describing laminar changes from the layer I/layer II boundary to the white matter. As a result, four new areas, Fo4–7, were identified. Area Fo4 was mainly found in the anterior orbital gyrus (AOG), Fo5 anteriorly in the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), Fo6 in the lateral orbital gyrus (LOG), and Fo7 in the lateral orbital sulcus. Areas differed in cortical thickness, abundance and size of pyramidal cells in layer III and degree of granularity in layer IV. A hierarchical cluster analysis was used to quantify cytoarchitectonic differences between them. The 3D-reconstructed areas were transformed into the single-subject template of the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI), where probabilistic maps and a maximum probability map (MPM) were calculated as part of the JuBrain Cytoarchitectonic Atlas. These maps served as reference data to study the functional properties of the areas using the BrainMap database. The type of behavioral tasks that activated them was analyzed to get first insights of co-activation patterns of the lateral OFC and its contribution to cognitive networks. Meta-analytic connectivity modeling (MACM) showed that functional decoding revealed activation in gustatory perception in Fo4; reward and somesthetic perception in Fo5; semantic processing and pain perception in Fo6; and emotional processing and covert reading in Fo7. Together with existing maps of the JuBrain Cytoarchitectonic Atlas, the new maps can now be used as an open-source reference for neuroimaging studies, allowing to further decode brain function.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Objectives: Blood lipid profiles have been ambiguously reported as biomarkers of AD in recent years. This study was conducted to evaluate the correlation between blood lipid levels and AD in later-life and to explore the effectiveness and reliability of blood lipid profiles as biomarkers of AD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Database searching was conducted using PubMed, the Cochrane Library, EMBASE, and Medline. This study was designed following the Meta-analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (MOOSE) criteria. Review Manager 5.3 (RevMan 5.3) software was adopted to perform meta-analysis evaluating the standard mean difference (SMD) with its 95% confidence intervals (CI).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: A total of 5,286 participants were enrolled from 27 case–control studies in this meta-analysis. The pooled results demonstrated that total cholesterol (TC) level was significantly associated with AD in late-life (SMD = 0.17, 95% CI: [0.01, 0.32], P = 0.03), especially in the subgroup under 70 years old (SMD: 0.45, 95% CI: [0.11, 0.79], P = 0.01) and the subgroup of Western population (SMD: 0.29, 95% CI: [0.04, 0.53], P = 0.02). In the subgroup under 70 years old, the high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) level (SMD = −0.50, 95% CI: [−0.76, −0.25], P = 0.0001) and the low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) level (SMD = 0.59, 95% CI: [0.02, 1.16], P = 0.04) in the AD group were significantly lower and higher than in the control group, respectively. In the subgroup with a sample size larger than 100 subjects, the LDL-C level was significantly higher in AD patients than in the control elderly group (SMD = 0.31, 95% CI: [0.05, 0.56], P = 0.02). There was no significant association between triglyceride (TG) levels and AD in later-life (SMD = −0.00, 95% CI: [−0.12, 0.12], P = 1.00).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: TC can be a new predictive biomarker of AD or cognitive decline in later-life. Increased TC levels are found to be associated with an elevated risk of AD. Decreased HDL-C levels and increased LDL-C levels may relate to an elevated risk of AD in subjects aged 60–70. Further comprehensive researches will be necessary in the future.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Interference with HIV infection of the first cell is essential for viral clearance at sub-optimal levels of drug inhibition</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/kF2hd7QFppY/article</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Ana Moyano, Gila Lustig, Hylton E. Rodel, Tibor Antal, Alex Sigal&lt;/p&gt;

HIV infection can be cleared with antiretroviral drugs if they are administered before exposure, where exposure occurs at low viral doses which infect one or few cells. However, infection clearance does not happen once infection is established, and this may be because of the very early formation of a reservoir of latently infected cells. Here we investigated whether initial low dose infection could be cleared with sub-optimal drug inhibition which allows ongoing viral replication, and hence does not require latency for viral persistence. We derived a model for infection clearance with inputs being drug effects on ongoing viral replication and initial number of infected cells. We experimentally tested the model by inhibiting low dose infection with the drug tenofovir, which interferes with initial infection, and atazanavir, which reduces the cellular virion burst size and hence inhibits replication only after initial infection. Drugs were used at concentrations which allowed infection to expand. Under these conditions, tenofovir dramatically increased clearance while atazanavir did not. Addition of latency to the model resulted in a minor decrease in clearance probability if the drug inhibited initial infection. If not, latency strongly decreased clearance even at low latent cell frequencies. Therefore, the ability of drugs to clear initial but not established infection can be recapitulated without latency and depends only on the ability to target initial infection. The presence of latency can dramatically decrease infection clearance, but only if the drug is unable to interfere with infection of the first cells.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/kF2hd7QFppY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Localization of odors is essential to animal survival, and thus animals are adept at odor navigation. In natural conditions animals encounter odor sources in which odor is carried by air flow varying in complexity. We sought to identify potential minimalist strategies that can effectively be used for odor-based navigation and asses their performance in an increasingly chaotic environment. To do so, we compared mouse, &lt;i&gt;in silico&lt;/i&gt; model, and Arduino-based robot odor-localization behavior in a standardized odor landscape. Mouse performance remains robust in the presence of increased complexity, showing a shift in strategy towards faster movement with increased environmental complexity. Implementing simple binaral and temporal models of tropotaxis and klinotaxis, an &lt;i&gt;in silico&lt;/i&gt; model and Arduino robot, in the same environment as the mice, are equally successful in locating the odor source within a plume of low complexity. However, performance of these algorithms significantly drops when the chaotic nature of the plume is increased. Additionally, both algorithm-driven systems show more successful performance when using a strictly binaral model at a larger sensor separation distance and more successful performance when using a temporal and binaral model when using a smaller sensor separation distance. This suggests that with an increasingly chaotic odor environment, mice rely on complex strategies that allow for robust odor localization that cannot be resolved by minimal algorithms that display robust performance at low levels of complexity. Thus, highlighting that an animal’s ability to modulate behavior with environmental complexity is beneficial for odor localization.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>RSS PAP: Proportional downscaling of glutamatergic release sites by the general anesthetic propofol at Drosophila motor nerve terminals</title>
	<link>http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0422-19.2020v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Propofol is the most common general anesthetic used for surgery in humans, yet its complete mechanism of action remains elusive. In addition to potentiating inhibitory synapses in the brain, propofol also impairs excitatory neurotransmission. We use electrophysiological recordings from individual glutamatergic boutons in male and female larval &lt;i&gt;Drosophila melanogaster&lt;/i&gt; motor nerve terminals to characterize this effect. We recorded from two bouton types, which have distinct presynaptic physiology and different average numbers of release sites or active zones. We show that a clinically relevant dose of propofol (3μM) impairs neurotransmitter release similarly at both bouton types, by decreasing the number of active release sites by half, without affecting release probability. In contrast, an analog of propofol has no effect on glutamate release. Co-expressing a truncated syntaxin1A protein in presynaptic boutons completely blocked this effect of propofol. Overexpressing wild-type syntaxin1A in boutons also conferred a level of resistance, by increasing the number of active release sites to a physiological ceiling set by the number of active zones or T-bars, and in this way counteracting the effect of propofol. These results point to the presynaptic release machinery as a target for the general anesthetic. Proportionally equivalent effects of propofol on the number of active release sites across the different bouton types suggests that smaller glutamatergic boutons with fewer release sites may be more vulnerable to the presynaptic effects of the drug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance statement&lt;/b&gt; Over 200 million surgeries are performed worldwide under general anesthesia every year, and the anesthetic of choice is increasingly the intravenous agent propofol. Sedation produced by propofol is understood to result from postsynaptic activation of inhibitory mechanisms in the brain. We have identified a presynaptic effect of propofol, on excitatory synapses. Recording from individual glutamatergic boutons in fly larvae, we found that a clinically relevant dose of propofol impairs glutamate release, by proportionally decreasing the participation of release sites across different bouton types. This suggests that propofol anesthesia involves presynaptic as well as postsynaptic mechanisms, and a proportional effect in large and small boutons may explain why some circuits are more vulnerable than others to the effects of the drug.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>RSS PAP: Synaptic integration of thalamic and limbic inputs in rodent gustatory cortex</title>
	<link>http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0199-19.2019v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Neurons in the gustatory cortex (GC) process multiple aspects of a tasting experience, encoding not only the physiochemical identity of tastes, but also their anticipation and hedonic value. Information pertaining to these stimulus features is relayed to GC via the gustatory thalamus (VPMpc) and basolateral amygdala (BLA). It is not known if these inputs drive separate groups of neurons, thus activating separate channels of information, or are integrated by neurons that receive both afferents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here, we used anterograde labeling and &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; intracellular recordings in anesthetized rats to assess the potential convergence of BLA and VPMpc inputs in GC, and to investigate the dynamics of integration of these inputs. We report substantial anatomical overlap of BLA and VPMpc axonal fields across GC, and identify a population of GC neurons receiving converging BLA and VPMpc inputs. Our data show that BLA modulates the gain of VPMpc-evoked responses in a time-dependent fashion and that this modulation is dependent on the recruitment of synaptic inhibition by both BLA and VPMpc. Our results suggest that BLA shapes cortical processing of thalamic inputs by dynamically gating the excitatory/inhibitory balance of the GC circuit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; The gustatory cortex (GC) is ideal for studying sensory and limbic signals to primary sensory cortices. GC encodes the chemosensory and affective components of taste by integrating inputs from thalamus and basolateral amygdala. Classic studies postulated a separation of sensory and limbic channels. However, reports of GC neurons encoding taste, palatability, and expectation in their dynamic firing modulations challenge this view. Here, we show the synaptic basis of the convergence and integration of thalamic and amygdalar inputs onto single GC neurons. Our data reveal a population of GC neurons receiving monosynaptic drive from both regions and show that amygdalar inputs can gate the processing of thalamic signals. Altogether, our data demonstrate that GC integrates, rather than segregates, these channels.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2002.00920</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Regression models are popular tools in empirical sciences to infer the
influence of a set of variables onto a dependent variable given an experimental
dataset. In neuroscience and cognitive psychology, Generalized Linear Models
(GLMs) -including linear regression, logistic regression, and Poisson GLM- is
the regression model of choice to study the factors that drive participant's
choices, reaction times and neural activations. These methods are however
limited as they only capture linear contributions of each regressors. Here, we
introduce an extension of GLMs called Generalized Unrestricted Models (GUMs),
which allows to infer a much richer set of contributions of the regressors to
the dependent variable, including possible interactions between the regressors.
In a GUM, each regressor is passed through a linear or nonlinear function, and
the contribution of the different resulting transformed regressors can be
summed or multiplied to generate a predictor for the dependent variable. We
propose a Bayesian treatment of these models in which we endow functions with
Gaussian Process priors, and we present two methods to compute a posterior over
the functions given a dataset: the Laplace method and a sparse variational
approach, which scales better for large dataset. For each method, we assess the
quality of the model estimation and we detail how the hyperparameters (defining
for example the expected smoothness of the function) can be fitted. Finally, we
illustrate the power of the method on a behavioral dataset where subjects
reported the average perceived orientation of a series of gratings. The method
allows to recover the mapping of the grating angle onto perceptual evidence for
each subject, as well as the impact of the grating based on its position.
Overall, GUMs provides a very rich and flexible framework to run nonlinear
regression analysis in neuroscience, psychology, and beyond.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Inferring population statistics of receptor neurons sensitivities and firing-rates from general functional requirements. (arXiv:2002.00895v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2002.00895</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;On the basis of the evident ability of neuronal olfactory systems to evaluate
the intensity of an odorous stimulus and also recognize the identity of the
odorant over a large range of concentrations, a few biologically-realistic
hypotheses on some of the underlying neural processes are made. The
mathematical implementation of such phenomenological postulates allows to infer
quite simply a functional relationship between the mean firing-rate of the
neural population and the concentration of any odorant as well as the
statistical distribution of the sensitivity of any receptor neuron to any
odorant across the population; both of them turn out to be power-laws and an
arithmetic, testable relationship between the respective exponents naturally
appears.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to compare quantitatively the prediction of power-law dependence of
population mean firing-rate on odorant concentration, a probabilistic model is
created to extract information from data available in the experimental
literature which, inter alia, allows to pool together several data-sets and
hence increase statistical accuracy. The values of the free parameters of the
model are estimated by a Bayesian maximum likelihood inference which keeps into
account the prior distribution of the parameters making use of theorems from
Information Geometry. The eventual goodness of fit is quantified by means of a
distribution-independent test.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The probabilistic model results to be accurate, thus confirming the
theoretical prediction of a power-law dependence on odorant concentration. The
experimental data available about the distribution of sensitivities also agree
with the other predictions, though they are not statistically sufficient for a
very stringent verification. The theory also suggests a possible explanation
for the range of values of the exponent of the sensitivity power-law found in
experiments.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;LAMA2-related congenital muscular dystrophy, also known as MDC1A, is caused by loss-of-function mutations in the alpha2 chain of Laminin-211. Loss of this protein interrupts the connection between the muscle cell and its extracellular environment and results in an aggressive, congenital-onset muscular dystrophy characterized by severe hypotonia, lack of independent ambulation, and early mortality driven by respiratory complications and/or failure to thrive. Of the pathomechanisms of MDC1A, the earliest and most prominent is widespread and rampant fibrosis. Here, we will discuss some of the key drivers of fibrosis including TGF-beta and renin–angiotensin system signaling and consequences of these pathways including myofibroblast transdifferentiation and matrix remodeling. We will also highlight some of the differences in fibrogenesis in congenital muscular dystrophy (CMD) with that seen in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). Finally, we will connect the key signaling pathways in the pathogenesis of MDC1A to the current status of the therapeutic approaches that have been tested in the preclinical models of MDC1A to treat fibrosis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00075</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Brain structural plasticity is an extraordinary tool that allows the mature brain to adapt to environmental changes, to learn, to repair itself after lesions or disease, and to slow aging. A long history of neuroscience research led to fascinating discoveries of different types of plasticity, involving changes in the genetically determined structure of nervous tissue, up to the ultimate dream of neuronal replacement: a stem cell-driven “adult neurogenesis” (AN). Yet, this road does not seem a straight one, since mutable dogmas, conflicting results and conflicting interpretations continue to warm the field. As a result, after more than 10,000 papers published on AN, we still do not know its time course, rate or features with respect to other kinds of structural plasticity in our brain. The solution does not appear to be behind the next curve, as differences among mammals reveal a very complex landscape that cannot be easily understood from rodents models alone. By considering evolutionary aspects, some pitfalls in the interpretation of cell markers, and a novel population of undifferentiated cells that are not newly generated [immature neurons (INs)], we address some conflicting results and controversies in order to find the right road forward. We suggest that considering plasticity in a comparative framework might help assemble the evolutionary, anatomical and functional pieces of a very complex biological process with extraordinary translational potential.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00064</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Hemiparkinsonism-hemiatrophy syndrome (HPHA) and hemidystonia-hemiatrophy syndrome (HDHA) are rare movement disorders composed of hemidystonia or hemiparkinsonism that present with unilateral limb, face, trunk, or cerebral hemiatrophy and mostly occur following head trauma or postanoxic events. However, relatively little is known about the pathogenesis of these conditions. In our case series, we present three HPHA patients and one HDHA patient who underwent detailed neuropsychological, radiological, motor, and non-motor functional assessments with a mean follow-up of 2 years. We followed two patients who showed differences in their progression for more than 2 years: one barely progressed with no treatment, and the other exhibited levodopa-induce dyskinesia (LID) and definitive progression while receiving multiple adjunctive therapies. In addition, we performed positron emission tomography (PET) with 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) and 18F-dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA) in one HPHA patient who showed bilaterally symmetrical uptake of FDG with no significant increase or decrease in the cerebral hemispheres, including the striatum, but exhibited a significant reduction in the uptake of 18F-DOPA in the contralateral posterior striatum. In this study, we followed HPHA patients who showed different disease courses to explore the clinical characteristics and pathogenesis of HPHA and HDHA and illustrate the clinical heterogeneity of these diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Neurodegeneration section | New and Recent Articles: Acute Treatment With Gleevec Does Not Promote Early Vascular Recovery Following Intracerebral Hemorrhage in Adult Male Rats</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00046</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) remains one of the most debilitating types of stroke and is characterized by a sudden bleeding from a ruptured blood vessel. ICH often results in high mortality and in survivors, permanent disability. Most studies have focused on neuroprotective strategies designed to minimize secondary consequences and prevent further pathology. Lacking is an understanding of how ICH acutely affects cerebrovascular components and their response to therapeutic interventions. We hypothesized that ICH alters cortical vessel complexity in the parenchyma adjacent to site of the initial vascular disruption and that vascular abnormalities would be mitigated by administration of the PDGFR inhibitor, Imatinib mesylate (Gleevec). Briefly, ICH was induced in male adult rats by injection of collagenase into basal ganglia, followed by Gleevec administration (60 mg/kg) 1 h after injury. Rats were then perfused using vessel painting methodology (Salehi et al., 2018b) to stain whole brain vascular networks at 1 day post-ICH. Axial and coronal wide field fluorescence microscopy was performed. Analyses for vascular features were undertaken and fractal analysis for vascular complexity. Data were collected from four groups of rats: Sham + Vehicle; Sham + Gleevec; ICH + Vehicle; ICH + Gleevec. Microscopy revealed that cortical vessels in both ipsi- and contralateral hemispheres exhibited significantly reduced density and branching by 22 and 34%, respectively. Fractal measures confirmed reduced complexity as well. Gleevec treatment further reduced vascular parameters, including reductions in vessel density in tissues adjacent to the ICH. The reductions in brain wide vascular networks after Gleevec in the current study after ICH is contrasted by previous reports of improved behavioral outcomes and decreased lCH lesion volumes Reductions in the vascular network after Gleevec may be involved in long-term repair mechanisms by pruning injured vessels to ultimately promote new vessel growth.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Neurodegeneration section | New and Recent Articles: Benign Regulation of the Astrocytic Phospholipase A2-Arachidonic Acid Pathway: The Underlying Mechanism of the Beneficial Effects of Manual Acupuncture on CBF</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.01354</link>
	<content:encoded>Background&lt;p&gt;The astrocytic phospholipase A&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (PLA&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)-arachidonic acid (AA) pathway is crucial in understanding the reduction of cerebral blood flow (CBF) prior to cognitive deterioration. In complementary and alternative medicine, manual acupuncture (MA) is used as one of the most important therapies for Alzheimer’s disease (AD). The beneficial effects of MA on CBF were reported in our previous study. However, the underlying molecular mechanism remains largely elusive.&lt;/p&gt;Objective&lt;p&gt;To investigate the effect of MA on the astrocytic PLA&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-AA pathway in SAMP8 mice hippocampi.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;SAMP8 mice were divided into the SAMP8 control (Pc) group, the SAMP8 MA (Pm) group and the SAMP8 donepezil (Pd) group. SAMR1 mice were used as the SAMRl control (Rc) group. Mice in the Pd group were treated with donepezil hydrochloride at 0.65 μg/g. In the Pm group, MA was applied at Baihui (GV20) and Yintang (GV29) for 20 min. The above treatments were administered once a day for 26 consecutive days. The Morris water maze was applied to assess spatial learning and memory. Immunofluorescence staining, western blot and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry were used to investigate the expression of related proteins and measure the contents of the metabolic intermediates of the PLA&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-AA pathway.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Compared with that in the Rc group, the escape latency in the Pc group significantly increased (p &amp;lt; 0.01); whereas, the platform crossover number and percentage of time and swimming distance in the platform quadrant decreased (p &amp;lt; 0.01). The hippocampal expression of PLA&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, cyclooxygenase-1, cytochrome P450 proteins 2C23 and the levels of AA, prostaglandin E&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and epoxyeicosatrienoic acids of the Pc group was drastically higher than that in the Rc group (p &amp;lt; 0.01). These changes were reversed by MA and donepezil (p &amp;lt; 0.01 or p &amp;lt; 0.05).&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;MA can effectively improve the learning and memory abilities of SAMP8 mice and has a negative regulatory effect on the PLA&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-AA pathway. We propose that the increase of the arterial tone, which is induced by the inhibition of vasodilatory pathway, may be a reason for the beneficial effect of MA on CBF.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroinformatics | New and Recent Articles: Magia: Robust Automated Image Processing and Kinetic Modeling Toolbox for PET Neuroinformatics</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fninf.2020.00003</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Processing of positron emission tomography (PET) data typically involves manual work, causing inter-operator variance. Here we introduce the Magia toolbox that enables processing of brain PET data with minimal user intervention. We investigated the accuracy of Magia with four tracers: [&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;C]carfentanil, [&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;C]raclopride, [&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;C]MADAM, and [&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;C]PiB. We used data from 30 control subjects for each tracer. Five operators manually delineated reference regions for each subject. The data were processed using Magia using the manually and automatically generated reference regions. We first assessed inter-operator variance resulting from the manual delineation of reference regions. We then compared the differences between the manually and automatically produced reference regions and the subsequently obtained binding potentials and standardized-uptake-value-ratios. The results show that manually produced reference regions can be remarkably different from each other, leading to substantial differences also in outcome measures. While the Magia-derived reference regions were anatomically different from the manual ones, Magia produced outcome measures highly consistent with the average of the manually obtained estimates. For [&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;C]carfentanil and [&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;C]PiB there was no bias, while for [&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;C]raclopride and [&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;C]MADAM Magia produced 3–5% higher binding potentials. Based on these results and considering the high inter-operator variance of the manual method, we conclude that Magia can be reliably used to process brain PET data.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The aim of the present study was to investigate whether EEG resting state connectivity correlates with intelligence. One-hundred and sixty five participants took part in the study. Six minutes of eyes closed EEG resting state was recorded for each participant. Graph theoretical connectivity metrics were calculated separately for two well-established synchronization measures [weighted Phase Lag Index (wPLI) and Imaginary Coherence (iMCOH)] and for sensor- and source EEG space. Non-verbal intelligence was measured with Raven’s Progressive Matrices. In line with the Neural Efficiency Hypothesis, path lengths characteristics of the brain networks (Average and Characteristic Path lengths, Diameter and Closeness Centrality) within alpha band range were significantly correlated with non-verbal intelligence for sensor space but no for source space. According to our results, variance in non-verbal intelligence measure can be mainly explained by the graph metrics built from the networks that include both weak and strong connections between the nodes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Representation of Perceptual Evidence in the Human Brain Assessed by Fast, Within-Trial Dynamic Stimuli</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00009</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In perceptual decision making the brain extracts and accumulates decision evidence from a stimulus over time and eventually makes a decision based on the accumulated evidence. Several characteristics of this process have been observed in human electrophysiological experiments, especially an average build-up of motor-related signals supposedly reflecting accumulated evidence, when averaged across trials. Another recently established approach to investigate the representation of decision evidence in brain signals is to correlate the within-trial fluctuations of decision evidence with the measured signals. We here report results of this approach for a two-alternative forced choice reaction time experiment measured using magnetoencephalography (MEG) recordings. Our results show: (1) that decision evidence is most strongly represented in the MEG signals in three consecutive phases and (2) that posterior cingulate cortex is involved most consistently, among all brain areas, in all three of the identified phases. As most previous work on perceptual decision making in the brain has focused on parietal and motor areas, our findings therefore suggest that the role of the posterior cingulate cortex in perceptual decision making may be currently underestimated.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Modeling the Effect of Temperature on Membrane Response of Light Stimulation in Optogenetically-Targeted Neurons</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2020.00005</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Optogenetics is revolutionizing Neuroscience, but an often neglected effect of light stimulation of the brain is the generation of heat. In extreme cases, light-generated heat kills neurons, but mild temperature changes alter neuronal function. To date, most in vivo experiments rely on light stimulation of neural tissue using fiber-coupled lasers of various wavelengths. Brain tissue is irradiated with high light power that can be deleterious to neuronal function. Furthermore, absorbed light generates heat that can lead to permanent tissue damage and affect neuronal excitability. Thus, light alone can generate effects in neuronal function that are unrelated to the genuine “optogenetic effect.” In this work, we perform a theoretical analysis to investigate the effects of heat transfer in rodent brain tissue for standard optogenetic protocols. More precisely, we first use the Kubelka-Munk model for light propagation in brain tissue to observe the absorption phenomenon. Then, we model the optothermal effect considering the common laser wavelengths (473 and 593 nm) used in optogenetic experiments approaching the time/space numerical solution of Pennes' bio-heat equation with the Finite Element Method. Finally, we then modeled channelrhodopsin-2 in a single and spontaneous-firing neuron to explore the effect of heat in light stimulated neurons. We found that, at commonly used light intensities, laser radiation considerably increases the temperature in the surrounding tissue. This effect alters action potential size and shape and causes an increase in spontaneous firing frequency in a neuron model. However, the shortening of activation time constants generated by heat in the single firing neuron model produces action potential failures in response to light stimulation. We also found changes in the power spectrum density and a reduction in the time required for synchronization in an interneuron network model of gamma oscillations. Our findings indicate that light stimulation with intensities used in optogenetic experiments may affect neuronal function not only by direct excitation of light sensitive ion channels and/or pumps but also by generating heat. This approach serves as a guide to design optogenetic experiments that minimize the role of tissue heating in the experimental outcome.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Regulation of CSF and Brain Tissue Sodium Levels by the Blood-CSF and Blood-Brain Barriers During Migraine</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2020.00004</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and brain tissue sodium levels increase during migraine. However, little is known regarding the underlying mechanisms of sodium homeostasis disturbance in the brain during the onset and propagation of migraine. Exploring the cause of sodium dysregulation in the brain is important, since correction of the altered sodium homeostasis could potentially treat migraine. Under the hypothesis that disturbances in sodium transport mechanisms at the blood-CSF barrier (BCSFB) and/or the blood-brain barrier (BBB) are the underlying cause of the elevated CSF and brain tissue sodium levels during migraines, we developed a mechanistic, differential equation model of a rat's brain to compare the significance of the BCSFB and the BBB in controlling CSF and brain tissue sodium levels. The model includes the ventricular system, subarachnoid space, brain tissue and blood. Sodium transport from blood to CSF across the BCSFB, and from blood to brain tissue across the BBB were modeled by influx permeability coefficients P&lt;sub&gt;BCSFB&lt;/sub&gt; and P&lt;sub&gt;BBB&lt;/sub&gt;, respectively, while sodium movement from CSF into blood across the BCSFB, and from brain tissue to blood across the BBB were modeled by efflux permeability coefficients PBCSFB′ and PBBB′, respectively. We then performed a global sensitivity analysis to investigate the sensitivity of the ventricular CSF, subarachnoid CSF and brain tissue sodium concentrations to pathophysiological variations in P&lt;sub&gt;BCSFB&lt;/sub&gt;, P&lt;sub&gt;BBB&lt;/sub&gt;, PBCSFB′ and PBBB′. Our results show that the ventricular CSF sodium concentration is highly influenced by perturbations of P&lt;sub&gt;BCSFB&lt;/sub&gt;, and to a much lesser extent by perturbations of PBCSFB′. Brain tissue and subarachnoid CSF sodium concentrations are more sensitive to pathophysiological variations of P&lt;sub&gt;BBB&lt;/sub&gt; and PBBB′ than variations of P&lt;sub&gt;BCSFB&lt;/sub&gt; and PBCSFB′ within 30 min of the onset of the perturbations. However, P&lt;sub&gt;BCSFB&lt;/sub&gt; is the most sensitive model parameter, followed by P&lt;sub&gt;BBB&lt;/sub&gt; and PBBB′, in controlling brain tissue and subarachnoid CSF sodium levels within 3 h of the perturbation onset.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00010</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The voltage-gated Kv7.2/Kv7.3 potassium channel is a critical regulator of neuronal excitability. It is strategically positioned at the axon initial segment (AIS) of neurons, where it effectively inhibits repetitive action potential firing. While the selective accumulation of Kv7.2/Kv7.3 channels at the AIS requires binding to the adaptor protein ankyrin G, it is currently unknown if additional molecular mechanisms contribute to the localization and fine-tuning of channel numbers at the AIS. Here, we utilized a chimeric approach to pinpoint regions within the Kv7.3 C-terminal tail with an impact upon AIS localization. This strategy identified two domains with opposing effects upon the AIS localization of Kv7.3 chimeras expressed in cultured hippocampal neurons. While a membrane proximal domain reduced AIS localization of Kv7.3 chimeras, helix D increased and stabilized chimera AIS localization. None of the identified domains were required for AIS localization. However, the domains modulated the relative efficiency of the localization raising the possibility that the two domains contribute to the regulation of Kv7 channel numbers and nanoscale organization at the AIS.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Objectives&lt;p&gt;This study aimed to explore the relationship between 18 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and Alzheimer’s disease (AD) within the southern Chinese population.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;A total of 420 participants, consisting of 215 AD patients and 205 sex- and age-matched controls, were recruited. The SNaPshot technique and polymer chain reaction (PCR) were used to detect the 18 SNPs. Combined with the apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 allele and age at onset, we performed an association analysis between these SNPs and AD susceptibility. Furthermore, we analyzed SNP-associated gene expression using the expression quantitative trait loci analysis.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Our study found that rs17125924 of FERMT2 was associated with the risk of developing AD in the dominant (P = 0.022, odds ratio [OR] = 1.57, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.07–2.32) and overdominant (P = 0.005, OR = 1.76, 95% CI: 1.18–2.61) models. Moreover, compared with APOE ε4 non-carriers, the frequency of the G-allele at rs17125924 was significantly higher among AD patients in APOE ε4 allele carriers (P = 0.029). The rs9271058 of HLA-DRB1 (dominant, overdominant, and additive models), rs9473117 of CD2AP (dominant and additive models), and rs73223431 of PTK2B (dominant, overdominant, and additive models) were associated with early onset AD (EOAD). Using the genotype-tissue expression (GTEx) and Braineac database, we found a significant association between rs9271058 genotypes and HLA-DRB1 expression levels, while the CC genotype at rs9473117 and the TT genotype of rs73223431 increased CD2AP and PTK2B gene expression, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;Our study identifies the G-allele at rs17125924 as a risk factor for developing AD, especially in APOE ε4 carriers. In addition, we found that rs9271058 of HLA-DRB1, rs9473117 of CD2AP, and rs73223431 of PTK2B were associated with EOAD.

Interactions between proteins and nucleic acids are at the heart of many essential biological processes. Despite increasing structural information about how these interactions may take place, our understanding of the usage made of protein surfaces by nucleic acids is still very limited. This is in part due to the inherent complexity associated to protein surface deformability and evolution. In this work, we present a method that contributes to decipher such complexity by predicting protein-DNA interfaces and characterizing their properties. It relies on three biologically and physically meaningful descriptors, namely evolutionary conservation, physico-chemical properties and surface geometry. We carefully assessed its performance on several hundreds of protein structures and compared it to several machine-learning state-of-the-art methods. Our approach achieves a higher sensitivity compared to the other methods, with a similar precision. Importantly, we show that it is able to unravel ‘hidden’ binding sites by applying it to unbound protein structures and to proteins binding to DNA via multiple sites and in different conformations. It is also applicable to the detection of RNA-binding sites, without significant loss of performance. This confirms that DNA and RNA-binding sites share similar properties. Our method is implemented as a fully automated tool, JET DNA 2, freely accessible at: http://www.lcqb.upmc.fr/JET2DNA.

Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) identify genetic variants associated with traits or diseases. GWAS never directly link variants to regulatory mechanisms. Instead, the functional annotation of variants is typically inferred by &lt;i&gt;post hoc&lt;/i&gt; analyses. A specific class of deep learning-based methods allows for the prediction of regulatory effects per variant on several cell type-specific chromatin features. We here describe “DeepWAS”, a new approach that integrates these regulatory effect predictions of single variants into a multivariate GWAS setting. Thereby, single variants associated with a trait or disease are directly coupled to their impact on a chromatin feature in a cell type. Up to 61 regulatory SNPs, called dSNPs, were associated with multiple sclerosis (MS, 4,888 cases and 10,395 controls), major depressive disorder (MDD, 1,475 cases and 2,144 controls), and height (5,974 individuals). These variants were mainly non-coding and reached at least nominal significance in classical GWAS. The prediction accuracy was higher for DeepWAS than for classical GWAS models for 91% of the genome-wide significant, MS-specific dSNPs. DSNPs were enriched in public or cohort-matched expression and methylation quantitative trait loci and we demonstrated the potential of DeepWAS to generate testable functional hypotheses based on genotype data alone.

Drug combinations are becoming a standard treatment of many complex diseases due to their capability to overcome resistance to monotherapy. In the current preclinical drug combination screening, the top combinations for further study are often selected based on synergy alone, without considering the combination efficacy and toxicity effects, even though these are critical determinants for the clinical success of a therapy. To promote the prioritization of drug combinations based on integrated analysis of synergy, efficacy and toxicity profiles, we implemented a web-based open-source tool, SynToxProfiler (Synergy-Toxicity-Profiler). When applied to 20 anti-cancer drug combinations tested both in healthy control and T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia (T-PLL) patient cells, as well as to 77 anti-viral drug pairs tested in Huh7 liver cell line with and without Ebola virus infection, SynToxProfiler prioritized as top hits those synergistic drug pairs that showed higher selective efficacy (difference between efficacy and toxicity), which offers an improved likelihood for clinical success.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/T8ZpXLeyEIA&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Antoine Allard, M. Ángeles Serrano&lt;/p&gt;

Connectomes are spatially embedded networks whose architecture has been shaped by physical constraints and communication needs throughout evolution. Using a decentralized navigation protocol, we investigate the relationship between the structure of the connectomes of different species and their spatial layout. As a navigation strategy, we use greedy routing where nearest neighbors, in terms of geometric distance, are visited. We measure the fraction of successful greedy paths and their length as compared to shortest paths in the topology of connectomes. In Euclidean space, we find a striking difference between the navigability properties of mammalian and non-mammalian species, which implies the inability of Euclidean distances to fully explain the structural organization of their connectomes. In contrast, we find that hyperbolic space, the effective geometry of complex networks, provides almost perfectly navigable maps of connectomes for all species, meaning that hyperbolic distances are exceptionally congruent with the structure of connectomes. Hyperbolic maps therefore offer a quantitative meaningful representation of connectomes that suggests a new cartography of the brain based on the combination of its connectivity with its effective geometry rather than on its anatomy only. Hyperbolic maps also provide a universal framework to study decentralized communication processes in connectomes of different species and at different scales on an equal footing.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/HeQwerXRw1s&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Optimality of sparse olfactory representations is not affected by network plasticity</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/90jqG38tcyw/article</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Collins Assisi, Mark Stopfer, Maxim Bazhenov&lt;/p&gt;

The neural representation of a stimulus is repeatedly transformed as it moves from the sensory periphery to deeper layers of the nervous system. Sparsening transformations are thought to increase the separation between similar representations, encode stimuli with great specificity, maximize storage capacity of associative memories, and provide an energy efficient instantiation of information in neural circuits. In the insect olfactory system, odors are initially represented in the periphery as a combinatorial code with relatively simple temporal dynamics. Subsequently, in the antennal lobe this representation is transformed into a dense and complex spatiotemporal activity pattern. Next, in the mushroom body Kenyon cells (KCs), the representation is dramatically sparsened. Finally, in mushroom body output neurons (MBONs), the representation takes on a new dense spatiotemporal format. Here, we develop a computational model to simulate this chain of olfactory processing from the receptor neurons to MBONs. We demonstrate that representations of similar odorants are maximally separated, measured by the distance between the corresponding MBON activity vectors, when KC responses are sparse. Sparseness is maintained across variations in odor concentration by adjusting the feedback inhibition that KCs receive from an inhibitory neuron, the Giant GABAergic neuron. Different odor concentrations require different strength and timing of feedback inhibition for optimal processing. Importantly, as observed &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;, the KC–MBON synapse is highly plastic, and, therefore, changes in synaptic strength after learning can change the balance of excitation and inhibition, potentially leading to changes in the distance between MBON activity vectors of two odorants for the same level of KC population sparseness. Thus, what is an optimal degree of sparseness before odor learning, could be rendered sub–optimal post learning. Here, we show, however, that synaptic weight changes caused by spike timing dependent plasticity increase the distance between the odor representations from the perspective of MBONs. A level of sparseness that was optimal before learning remains optimal post-learning.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/90jqG38tcyw&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Function, Innervation, and Neurotransmitter Signaling in Mice Lacking Type-II Taste Cells</title>
	<link>http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/7/1/ENEURO.0339-19.2020?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;i&gt;Skn-1a&lt;/i&gt; transcription factor (&lt;i&gt;Pou2f3&lt;/i&gt;) is required for Type II taste cell differentiation in taste buds. Taste buds in &lt;i&gt;Skn-1a&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; mice lack Type II taste cells but have a concomitant expansion of Type III cells, providing an ideal model to determine the relative role of taste cell types in response specificity. We confirmed that chorda tympani responses to sweet, bitter, and umami stimuli were greatly reduced in the knock-outs (KOs) compared with wild-type (WT) littermates. &lt;i&gt;Skn-1a&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; mice also had reductions to NaCl that were partially amiloride-insensitive, suggesting that both Type II and Type III cells contribute to amiloride-insensitive salt detection in anterior tongue. We also confirmed that responses to sour stimuli are equivalent in the KOs, despite the large increase in the number of Type III taste cells. To examine their innervation, we crossed the &lt;i&gt;Htr3a&lt;/i&gt;-GFP (5-HT&lt;sub&gt;3A&lt;/sub&gt;-GFP) reporter mouse with the &lt;i&gt;Skn-1a&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; mice and examined geniculate ganglion neurons for GFP expression and responses to 5-HT. We found no change in the number of 5-HT&lt;sub&gt;3A&lt;/sub&gt;-expressing neurons with KO of &lt;i&gt;Skn-1a&lt;/i&gt;. Calcium imaging showed that only 5-HT&lt;sub&gt;3A&lt;/sub&gt;-expressing neurons respond to exogenous 5-HT, while most neurons respond to ATP, similar to WT mice. Interestingly, despite loss of all Type II cells, the P2X3 antagonist AF353 blocked all chorda tympani responses. These data collectively raise questions pertaining the source of ATP signaling in the absence of Type II taste cells and whether the additional Type III cells are innervated by fibers that would have normally innervated Type II cells.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>RSS PAP: Does birth trigger cell death in the developing brain?</title>
	<link>http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0517-19.2020v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Developmental cell death eliminates half of the neurons initially generated in the mammalian brain, and occurs perinatally in many species. It is possible that the timing of neuronal cell death is developmentally programmed, and only coincidentally associated with birth. Alternatively, birth may play a role in shaping cell death. To test these competing hypotheses, we experimentally advanced or delayed birth by one day in mice (within the normal range of gestation for the species) and examined effects on the &lt;i&gt;temporal pattern&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;magnitude&lt;/i&gt; (amount) of neuronal cell death, using immunohistochemical detection of activated caspase-3 as a cell death marker. In order to detect effects of subtle changes in birth timing, we focused on brain areas that exhibit sharp postnatal peaks in cell death. We find that advancing birth advances peak cell death, supporting the hypothesis that birth triggers cell death. However, a delay of birth does not delay cell death. Thus, birth can advance cell death, but if postponed, a developmental program governs. Advancing or delaying birth also caused region-specific changes in the overall magnitude of cell death. Our findings shed light on the long-standing question of what controls the timing and magnitude of developmental neuronal cell death, and position birth as an orchestrator of brain development. Because humans across the world now routinely alter birth timing, these findings may have implications for current obstetric practices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; The importance of neuronal cell death for brain development has been recognized for decades, but it is unknown what regulates its timing, or accounts for differences in the amount of cell death between brain regions. In many species, including mice, developmental cell death occurs perinatally. We find that advancing birth by one day in mice advances patterns of cell death, but does not advance overall forebrain growth. Because humans across the world routinely alter birth timing, usually to advance birth, our findings may have implications for current obstetric practices. Birth timing also affects the magnitude of cell death in a region-specific manner, suggesting that birth has important, previously unrecognized, effects on brain development.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0103-19.2019v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;A fundamental challenge in studying principles of organization used by the olfactory system to encode odor concentration information has been identifying comprehensive sets of activated odorant receptors (ORs) across a broad concentration range inside freely behaving animals. In mammals, this has recently become feasible with high-throughput sequencing-based methods that identify populations of activated ORs &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. In this study, we characterized the mouse OR repertoires activated by the two odorants, acetophenone and 2,5-dihydro-2,4,5-trimethylthiazoline, from 0.01% to 100% (v/v) as starting concentrations using phosphorylated ribosomal protein S6 capture followed by RNA-Seq. We found Olfr923 to be one of the most sensitive ORs that is enriched by acetophenone. Using a mouse line that genetically labels Olfr923-positive axons, we provided evidence that acetophenone activates the Olfr923 glomeruli in the olfactory bulb. Through molecular dynamics stimulations, we identified amino acid residues in the Olfr923 binding cavity that facilitate acetophenone binding. This study sheds light on the active process by which unique OR repertoires may collectively facilitate the discrimination of odorant concentrations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; The ability of animals to discriminate odors over a range of odor concentrations while recognizing concentration-invariant odor identity presents an encoding challenge for the olfactory system. To further our understanding on how animals sense odors at different concentrations, it is important to describe how odor concentration information is represented at the receptor level. Here, we establish a sensitive &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; approach to screen populations of odorant receptors enriched in the odor-activated sensory neurons in mice. We identified comprehensive lists of enriched odorant receptors against a 10,000-fold concentration range for two odorants. Describing the concentration-dependent activation for unique populations of odorant receptors is fundamental for future studies in determining how individual odorant receptors contribute to olfactory sensitivity and odor intensity coding.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;The auditory brainstem compares sound-evoked excitation and inhibition from both ears to compute sound source location and determine spatial acuity. Although alterations to the anatomy and physiology of the auditory brainstem have been demonstrated in fragile X syndrome (FXS), it is not known whether these changes cause spatial acuity deficits in FXS. To test the hypothesis that FXS-related alterations to brainstem circuits impair spatial hearing abilities, a reflexive prepulse inhibition (PPI) task, with variations in sound (gap, location, masking) as the prepulse stimulus, was used on &lt;i&gt;Fmr1&lt;/i&gt; knock-out mice and B6 controls. Specifically, &lt;i&gt;Fmr1&lt;/i&gt; mice show decreased PPI compared with wild-type mice during gap detection, changes in sound source location, and spatial release from masking with no alteration to their overall startle thresholds compared with wild-type mice. Last, &lt;i&gt;Fmr1&lt;/i&gt; mice have increased latency to respond in these tasks, suggesting additional impairments in the pathway responsible for reacting to a startling sound. This study further supports data in humans with FXS that show similar deficits in PPI.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Hsc70 Ameliorates the Vesicle Recycling Defects Caused by Excess {alpha}-Synuclein at Synapses</title>
	<link>http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/7/1/ENEURO.0448-19.2020?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;α-Synuclein overexpression and aggregation are linked to Parkinson’s disease (PD), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), and several other neurodegenerative disorders. In addition to effects in the cell body, α-synuclein accumulation occurs at presynapses where the protein is normally localized. While it is generally agreed that excess α-synuclein impairs synaptic vesicle trafficking, the underlying mechanisms are unknown. We show here that acute introduction of excess human α-synuclein at a classic vertebrate synapse, the lamprey reticulospinal (RS) synapse, selectively impaired the uncoating of clathrin-coated vesicles (CCVs) during synaptic vesicle recycling, leading to an increase in endocytic intermediates and a severe depletion of synaptic vesicles. Furthermore, human α-synuclein and lamprey -synuclein both interact &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; with Hsc70, the chaperone protein that uncoats CCVs at synapses. After introducing excess α-synuclein, Hsc70 availability was reduced at stimulated synapses, suggesting Hsc70 sequestration as a possible mechanism underlying the synaptic vesicle trafficking defects. In support of this hypothesis, increasing the levels of exogenous Hsc70 along with α-synuclein ameliorated the CCV uncoating and vesicle recycling defects. These experiments identify a reduction in Hsc70 availability at synapses, and consequently its function, as the mechanism by which α-synuclein induces synaptic vesicle recycling defects. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a viable chaperone-based strategy for reversing the synaptic vesicle trafficking defects associated with excess α-synuclein, which may be of value for improving synaptic function in PD and other synuclein-linked diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>RSS PAP: MANF ablation causes prolonged activation of the UPR without neurodegeneration in the mouse midbrain dopamine system</title>
	<link>http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0477-19.2019v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Mesencephalic astrocyte-derived neurotrophic factor (MANF) is an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) localized protein that regulates ER homeostasis and unfolded protein response (UPR). The biology of endogenous MANF in the mammalian brain is unknown and therefore we studied the brain phenotype of MANF-deficient female and male mice at different ages focusing on the midbrain dopamine system and cortical neurons. We show that a lack of MANF from the brain led to the chronic activation of UPR by upregulation of the endoribonuclease activity of the IRE1α pathway. Furthermore, in the aged MANF-deficient mouse brain in addition the PERK and ATF6 branches of the UPR pathways were activated. Neuronal loss in neurodegenerative diseases has been associated with chronic ER stress. In our mouse model, increased UPR activation did not lead to neuronal cell loss in the substantia nigra, decrease of striatal dopamine or behavioural changes of MANF-deficient mice. However, cortical neurons lacking MANF were more vulnerable to chemical induction of additional ER stress &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;. We conclude that embryonic neuronal deletion of MANF does not cause the loss of midbrain dopamine neurons in mice. However, endogenous MANF is needed for maintenance of neuronal ER homeostasis both &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Exogenous mesencephalic astrocyte-derived neurotrophic factor (MANF) is neuroprotective in animal models of Parkinson’s disease and stroke, but the function of endogenous MANF in neurons is still elusive. This is the first study on the role of endogenous MANF in the adult mouse brain with focus on the midbrain dopamine system. We discovered chronic unfolded protein response (UPR) in the brains of mice lacking MANF. Despite activation of all three UPR pathways, we did not observe degeneration of dopamine neurons, which contrasts to the previously reported detrimental effect of chronic UPR in pancreatic beta cells lacking MANF. Our findings highlight the complexity of the UPR and reveal that the terminal consequences of chronic UPR differ in cell types and context.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>RSS PAP: SIGNAL PROPAGATION VIA OPEN-LOOP INTRATHALAMIC ARCHITECTURES: A COMPUTATIONAL MODEL</title>
	<link>http://www.eneuro.org/cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0441-19.2020v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract:&lt;p&gt;Propagation of signals across the cerebral cortex is a core component of many cognitive processes and is generally thought to be mediated by direct intracortical connectivity. The thalamus, by contrast, is considered to be devoid of internal connections and organized as a collection of parallel inputs to the cortex. Here, we provide evidence that &quot;open-loop&quot; intrathalamic pathways involving the thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN) can support propagation of oscillatory activity across the cortex. Recent studies support the existence of open-loop thalamo-reticulo-thalamic (TC-TRN-TC) synaptic motifs in addition to traditional closed-loop architectures. We hypothesized that open-loop structural modules, when connected in series, might underlie thalamic and, therefore cortical, signal propagation. Using a supercomputing platform to simulate thousands of permutations of a thalamocortical network based on physiological data collected in mice, rats, ferrets, and cats and in which select synapses were allowed to vary both by class and individually, we evaluated the relative capacities of closed- and open-loop TC-TRN-TC synaptic configurations to support both propagation and oscillation. We observed that 1) signal propagation was best supported in networks possessing strong open-loop TC-TRN-TC connectivity; 2) intrareticular synapses were neither primary substrates of propagation nor oscillation; and 3) heterogeneous synaptic networks supported more robust propagation of oscillation than their homogeneous counterparts. These findings suggest that open-loop, heterogeneous intrathalamic architectures might complement direct intracortical connectivity to facilitate cortical signal propagation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement:&lt;/b&gt; Interactions between the dorsal thalamus and thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN) are speculated to contribute to phenomena such as arousal, attention, sleep, and seizures. Despite the importance of the TRN, the synaptic microarchitectures forming the basis for dorsal thalamus-TRN interactions are not fully understood. The computational neural model we present incorporates &quot;open-loop&quot; thalamo-reticular-thalamic (TC-TRN-TC) synaptic motifs, which have been experimentally observed. We elucidate how open-loop motifs possess the capacity to shape the propagative properties of signals intrinsic to the thalamus and evaluate the wave dynamics they support relative to closed-loop TC-TRN-TC pathways and intrareticular synaptic connections. Our model also generates predictions regarding how different spatial distributions of reticulothalamic and intrareticular synapses affect these signaling properties.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Reversing Hemianopia by Multisensory Training Under Anesthesia</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2020.00004</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Hemianopia is characterized by blindness in one half of the visual field and is a common consequence of stroke and unilateral injury to the visual cortex. There are few effective rehabilitative strategies that can relieve it. Using the cat as an animal model of hemianopia, we found that blindness induced by lesions targeting all contiguous areas of the visual cortex could be rapidly reversed by a non-invasive, multisensory (auditory-visual) exposure procedure even while animals were anesthetized. Surprisingly few trials were required to reinstate vision in the previously blind hemisphere. That rehabilitation was possible under anesthesia indicates that the visuomotor behaviors commonly believed to be essential are not required for this recovery, nor are factors such as attention, motivation, reward, or the various other cognitive features that are generally thought to facilitate neuro-rehabilitative therapies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Pathological ATPergic Signaling in Major Depression and Bipolar Disorder</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2019.00331</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The mood disorders, major depression (MD) and bipolar disorder (BD), have a high lifetime prevalence in the human population and accordingly generate huge costs for health care. Efficient, rapidly acting, and side-effect-free pharmaceuticals are hitherto not available, and therefore, the identification of new therapeutic targets is an imperative task for (pre)clinical research. Such a target may be the purinergic P2X7 receptor (P2X7R), which is localized in the central nervous system (CNS) at microglial and neuroglial cells mediating neuroinflammation. MD and BD are due to neuroinflammation caused in the first line by the release of the pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-1β (IL-1β) from the microglia. IL-1β in turn induces the secretion of corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) and in consequence the secretion of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and cortisol, which together with a plethora of further cytokines/chemokines lead to mood disorders. A number of biochemical/molecular biological measurements including the use of P2X7R- or IL-1β-deficient mice confirmed this chain of events. More recent studies showed that a decrease in the astrocytic release of ATP in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus is a major cause of mood disorders. It is an attractive hypothesis that compensatory increases in P2X7Rs in these areas of the brain are the immediate actuators of MD and BD. Hence, blood-brain barrier-permeable P2X7R antagonists may be promising therapeutic tools to improve depressive disorders in humans.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Currently, there is no effective treatment of proteinopathies, as well as their diagnosis in the early stages of the disease until the first clinical symptoms appear. The proposed model of fibrillation of the Aβ peptide and its fragments not only describes molecular rearrangements, but also offers models of processes that occur during the formation of amyloid aggregates. Since this model is also characteristic of other proteins and peptides, a new potential target for drug development in the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and other proteinopathies is proposed on the basis of this model. In our opinion, it is oligomers that are promising targets for innovative developments in the treatment of these diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Integrative Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Effects of Mongolian Warm Acupuncture on iNOS/NO and Inflammatory Cytokines in the Hippocampus of Chronic Fatigue Rats</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnint.2019.00078</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The inducible nitric oxide synthase/nitric oxide (iNOS/NO) signaling pathway and inflammatory cytokines play important roles in the pathogenesis of exercise-induced fatigue. Studies have found that Mongolian warm acupuncture (WA) could alleviate exercise-induced fatigue. However, the exact mechanisms underlying its effects remain unclear. In the present study, we investigated the effects of Mongolian WA on iNOS/NO signaling pathway and proinflammatory cytokines in a chronic exhaustive swimming-induced fatigue rat model. Animals were randomly divided into Control group, Ctrl + WA group, Model group, and Model + WA group. The body weight, exhaustive swimming time test, and Morris water maze test were performed before and after the chronic exhaustive swimming. The serum levels of interleukin-1β (IL-1β), interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interferon-γ (IFN-γ), and iNOS were detected by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The mRNA expressions of IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, IFN-γ, and iNOS in the hippocampus were measured by real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Moreover, the protein expression of iNOS in the hippocampus was measured by western blot, and the NO productions in the serum and hippocampus were detected by Griess reaction system. Chronic exhaustive exercise significantly reduced the body weight and exhaustive swimming time, and induced impairment in learning and memory, and which were reversed by WA treatment. Chronic exhaustive exercise also increased the expressions of iNOS and proinflammatory cytokines, while WA treatment significantly decreased the level of iNOS and proinflammatory cytokines. However, chronic exhaustive exercise did not affect the NO production. These findings demonstrated that WA could alleviate the chronic exhaustive swimming-induced fatigue and improve the learning and memory ability, and the actions might be related to the reduction of inflammatory response and iNOS expression.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00054</link>
	<content:encoded>Objective&lt;p&gt;Previous studies have shown that combing with color properties may be used as part of the display presented to BCI users in order to improve performance. Build on this, we explored the effects of combinations of face stimuli with three primary colors (RGB) on BCI performance which is assessed by classification accuracy and information transfer rate (ITR). Furthermore, we analyzed the waveforms of three patterns.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;We compared three patterns in which semitransparent face is overlaid three primary colors as stimuli: red semitransparent face (RSF), green semitransparent face (GSF), and blue semitransparent face (BSF). Bayesian linear discriminant analysis (BLDA) was used to construct the individual classifier model. In addition, a Repeated-measures ANOVA (RM-ANOVA) and Bonferroni correction were chosen for statistical analysis.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;The results indicated that the RSF pattern achieved the highest online averaged accuracy with 93.89%, followed by the GSF pattern with 87.78%, while the lowest performance was caused by the BSF pattern with an accuracy of 81.39%. Furthermore, significant differences in classification accuracy and ITR were found between RSF and GSF (p &amp;lt; 0.05) and between RSF and BSF patterns (p &amp;lt; 0.05).&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;The semitransparent faces colored red (RSF) pattern yielded the best performance of the three patterns. The proposed patterns based on ERP-BCI system have a clinically significant impact by increasing communication speed and accuracy of the P300-speller for patients with severe motor impairment.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Neurodegeneration section | New and Recent Articles: Structural Variants May Be a Source of Missing Heritability in sALS</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00047</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The underlying genetic and molecular mechanisms that drive amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) remain poorly understood. Structural variants within the genome can play a significant role in neurodegenerative disease risk, such as the repeat expansion in C9orf72 and the tri-nucleotide repeat in ATXN2, both of which are associated with familial and sporadic ALS. Many such structural variants reside in uncharacterized regions of the human genome, and have been under studied. Therefore, characterization of structural variants located in and around genes associated with ALS could provide insight into disease pathogenesis, and lead to the discovery of highly informative genetic tools for stratification in clinical trials. Such genomic variants may provide a deeper understanding of how gene expression can affect disease etiology, disease severity and trajectory, patient response to treatment, and may hold the key to understanding the genetics of sporadic ALS. This article outlines the current understanding of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis genetics and how structural variations may underpin some of the missing heritability of this disease.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Objectives&lt;p&gt;Visuospatial dysfunction (VSD) is one of the most important symptoms for the diagnosis of dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). The aim of this study was to validate a novel VSD questionnaire and determine the cutoff score for the screening for VSD in DLB.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;This is a retrospective analysis of data from a project of the History-based Artificial Intelligent Clinical Dementia Diagnostic System (HAICDDS). VSD of non-demented control (NDC), Alzheimer’s disease (AD), and DLB participants were analyzed and compared using the visuospatial questionnaire in the HAICDDS (HAI-VSQ), the Draw subscale in the Cognitive Abilities Screening Instrument (CASI-Draw), and the visuospatial subscale in Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA-VS).&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;A total of 440 individuals were studied, including 154 NDC, 229 AD, and 57 DLB participants. Compared to NDC or AD participants, DLB participants showed a higher total score on HAI-VSQ after adjustment for age. Using HAI-VSQ, a cutoff score ≥ 2 was useful for the screening for VSD in DLB with a sensitivity of 0.77 and a specificity of 0.94. Compared with CASI-Draw or MoCA-VS, HAI-VSQ was least influenced by gender, age, and education and had the highest correlation with the sum of boxes of the Clinical Dementia Rating scale. After adjustment for age, education, gender, and global cognitive function, HAI-VSQ significantly discriminated DLB from AD and NDC whereas MoCA-VS or CASI-Draw did not.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;Our study showed that the newly designed simple questionnaire was a practical screening tool for VSD in DLB that can be applied in clinical practice as well as on a registration platform.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Neural Technology section | New and Recent Articles: Subcortical Intermittent Theta-Burst Stimulation (iTBS) Increases Theta-Power in Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex (DLPFC)</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00041</link>
	<content:encoded>Introduction&lt;p&gt;Cognitive symptoms from Parkinson’s disease cause severe disability and significantly limit quality of life. Little is known about mechanisms of cognitive impairment in PD, although aberrant oscillatory activity in basal ganglia-thalamo-prefrontal cortical circuits likely plays an important role. While continuous high-frequency deep brain stimulation (DBS) improves motor symptoms, it is generally ineffective for cognitive symptoms. Although we lack robust treatment options for these symptoms, recent studies with transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), applying intermittent theta-burst stimulation (iTBS) to dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), suggest beneficial effects for certain aspects of cognition, such as memory or inhibitory control. While TMS is non-invasive, its results are transient and require repeated application. Subcortical DBS targets have strong reciprocal connections with prefrontal cortex, such that iTBS through the permanently implanted lead might represent a more durable solution. Here we demonstrate safety and feasibility for delivering iTBS from the DBS electrode and explore changes in DLPFC electrophysiology.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;We enrolled seven participants with medically refractory Parkinson’s disease who underwent DBS surgery targeting either the subthalamic nucleus (STN) or globus pallidus interna (GPi). We temporarily placed an electrocorticography strip over DLPFC through the DBS burr hole. After placement of the DBS electrode into either GPi (n = 3) or STN (n = 4), awake subjects rested quietly during iTBS (three 50-Hz pulses delivered at 5 Hz for 2 s, followed by 8 s of rest). We contrasted power spectra in DLPFC local field potentials during iTBS versus at rest, as well as between iTBS and conventional high-frequency stimulation (HFS).&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Dominant frequencies in DLPFC at rest varied among subjects and along the subdural strip electrode, though they were generally localized in theta (3–8 Hz) and/or beta (10–30 Hz) ranges. Both iTBS and HFS were well-tolerated and imperceptible. iTBS increased theta-frequency activity more than HFS. Further, GPi stimulation resulted in significantly greater theta-power versus STN stimulation in our sample.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;Acute subcortical iTBS from the DBS electrode was safe and well-tolerated. This novel stimulation pattern delivered from the GPi may increase theta-frequency power in ipsilateral DLPFC. Future studies will confirm these changes in DLPFC activity during iTBS and evaluate whether they are associated with improvements in cognitive or behavioral symptoms from PD.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Neural Technology section | New and Recent Articles: The Hemodynamic Mass Action of a Central Pattern Generator</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00038</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The hemodynamic response is a neurovascular and metabolic process in which there is rapid delivery of blood flow to a neuronal tissue in response to neuronal activation. The functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and the functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), for instance, are based on the physiological principles of such hemodynamic responses. Both techniques allow the mapping of active neuronal regions in which the neurovascular and metabolic events are occurring. However, although both techniques have revolutionized the neurosciences, they are mostly employed for neuroimaging of the human brain but not for the spinal cord during functional tasks. Moreover, little is known about other techniques measuring the hemodynamic response in the spinal cord. The purpose of the present study was to show for the first time that a simple optical system termed direct current photoplethysmography (DC-PPG) can be employed to detect hemodynamic responses of the spinal cord and the brainstem during the functional activation of the spinal central pattern generator (CPG). In particular, we positioned two DC-PPG systems directly on the brainstem and spinal cord during fictive scratching in the cat. The optical DC-PPG systems allowed the trial-by-trial recording of massive hemodynamic signals. We found that the “strength” of the flexor-plus-extensor motoneuron activities during motor episodes of fictive scratching was significantly correlated to the “strengths” of the brainstem and spinal DC-PPG signals. Because the DC-PPG was robustly detected in real-time, we claim that such a functional signal reflects the hemodynamic mass action of the brainstem and spinal cord associated with the CPG motor action. Our findings shed light on an unexplored hemodynamic observable of the spinal CPGs, providing a proof of concept that the DC-PPG can be used for the assessment of the integrity of the human CPGs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Brain Imaging Methods section | New and Recent Articles: Resting-State Functional Connectivity Estimated With Hierarchical Bayesian Diffuse Optical Tomography</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00032</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) has been generally assessed with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) thanks to its high spatial resolution. However, fMRI has several disadvantages such as high cost and low portability. In addition, fMRI may not be appropriate for people with metal or electronic implants in their bodies, with claustrophobia and who are pregnant. Diffuse optical tomography (DOT), a method of neuroimaging using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) to reconstruct three-dimensional brain activity images, offers a non-invasive alternative, because fNIRS as well as fMRI measures changes in deoxygenated hemoglobin concentrations and, in addition, fNIRS is free of above disadvantages. We recently proposed a hierarchical Bayesian (HB) DOT algorithm and verified its performance in terms of task-related brain responses. In this study, we attempted to evaluate the HB DOT in terms of estimating RSFC. In 20 healthy males (21–38 years old), 10 min of resting-state data was acquired with 3T MRI scanner or high-density NIRS on different days. The NIRS channels consisted of 96 long (29-mm) source-detector (SD) channels and 56 short (13-mm) SD channels, which covered bilateral frontal and parietal areas. There were one and two resting-state runs in the fMRI and fNIRS experiments, respectively. The reconstruction performances of our algorithm and the two currently prevailing algorithms for DOT were evaluated using fMRI signals as a reference. Compared with the currently prevailing algorithms, our HB algorithm showed better performances in both the similarity to fMRI data and inter-run reproducibility, in terms of estimating the RSFC.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Object&lt;p&gt;Excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) is common in Parkinson disease (PD), but the neural basis of EDS in PD is unclear. We aim to analyze the neural activity changes in PD-related EDS.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;In the present study, 38 PD patients and 19 healthy controls underwent clinical assessments and resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at 3T. Patients were further classified into PD patients with EDS (n = 17) and PD patients without EDS (n = 21), according to the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) cutoff score with greater than 10 or less than 3. We evaluated all patients using PD-related motor and non-motor clinical scales. An analysis of covariance and post hoc two-sample t-tests were performed to examine between-groups differences of the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFF) and functional connectivity (FC).&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;We found that, all PD-EDS subjects in our study were male. Compared with the control subjects, PD patients with EDS had decreased ALFF in the Pons and increased ALFF in the Frontal_Mid_Orb_L (p &amp;lt; 0.01, corrected). Moreover, PD patients with EDS showed decreased ALFF in the left posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) relative to PD without EDS, which was negatively correlated with the ESS score (p &amp;lt; 0.001). After that, the FC analysis with the left PCC region of interest showed reduced FC of the right PCC and right precuneus in PD with EDS compared with PD without EDS (p &amp;lt; 0.01, corrected).&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;We hypothesized the wake-promoting pathways and the default mode network dysfunction underlying the EDS in male PD patients.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.01451</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Measures of brain activity through functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) or electroencephalography (EEG), two complementary modalities, are ground solutions in the context of neurofeedback (NF) mechanisms for brain rehabilitation protocols. While NF-EEG (in which real-time neurofeedback scores are computed from EEG signals) has been explored for a very long time, NF-fMRI (in which real-time neurofeedback scores are computed from fMRI signals) appeared more recently and provides more robust results and more specific brain training. Using fMRI and EEG simultaneously for bi-modal neurofeedback sessions (NF-EEG-fMRI, in which real-time neurofeedback scores are computed from fMRI and EEG) is very promising for the design of brain rehabilitation protocols. However, fMRI is cumbersome and more exhausting for patients. The original contribution of this paper concerns the prediction of bi-modal NF scores from EEG recordings only, using a training phase where EEG signals as well as the NF-EEG and NF-fMRI scores are available. We propose a sparse regression model able to exploit EEG only to predict NF-fMRI or NF-EEG-fMRI in motor imagery tasks. We compared different NF-predictors stemming from the proposed model. We showed that predicting NF-fMRI scores from EEG signals adds information to NF-EEG scores and significantly improves the correlation with bi-modal NF sessions compared to classical NF-EEG scores.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Systems Biology section | New and Recent Articles: Multiple Pathways Involved in Palmitic Acid-Induced Toxicity: A System Biology Approach</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.01410</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Inflammation is a complex biological response to injuries, metabolic disorders or infections. In the brain, astrocytes play an important role in the inflammatory processes during neurodegenerative diseases. Recent studies have shown that the increase of free saturated fatty acids such as palmitic acid produces a metabolic inflammatory response in astrocytes generally associated with damaging mechanisms such as oxidative stress, endoplasmic reticulum stress, and autophagic defects. In this aspect, the synthetic neurosteroid tibolone has shown to exert protective functions against inflammation in neuronal experimental models without the tumorigenic effects exerted by sexual hormones such as estradiol and progesterone. However, there is little information regarding the specific mechanisms of tibolone in astrocytes during inflammatory insults. In the present study, we performed a genome-scale metabolic reconstruction of astrocytes that was used to study astrocytic response during an inflammatory insult by palmitate through Flux Balance Analysis methods and data mining. In this aspect, we assessed the metabolic fluxes of human astrocytes under three different scenarios: healthy (normal conditions), induced inflammation by palmitate, and tibolone treatment under palmitate inflammation. Our results suggest that tibolone reduces the L-glutamate-mediated neurotoxicity in astrocytes through the modulation of several metabolic pathways involved in glutamate uptake. We also identified a set of reactions associated with the protective effects of tibolone, including the upregulation of taurine metabolism, gluconeogenesis, cPPAR and the modulation of calcium signaling pathways. In conclusion, the different scenarios studied in our model allowed us to identify several metabolic fluxes perturbed under an inflammatory response and the protective mechanisms exerted by tibolone.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Systems Biology section | New and Recent Articles: Simplified Model of PKCγ Signaling Dysregulation and Cytosol-to-Membrane Translocation Kinetics During Neurodegenerative Spinocerebellar Ataxia Type 14 (SCA14)</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.01397</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Spinocerebellar ataxia type 14 (SCA14) is an autosomal neurodegenerative disease clinically characterized by progressive ataxia in the patient’s gait, accompanied by slurred speech and abnormal eye movements. These symptoms are linked to the loss of Purkinje cells (PCs), which leads to cerebellar neurodegeneration. PC observations link the mutations in PRKCG gene encoding protein kinase C γ (PKCγ) to SCA14. Observations also show that the link between PKCγ and SCA14 relies on a gain-of-function mechanism, and, in fact, both positive and negative regulation of PKCγ expression and activity may result in changes in cellular number, size, and complexity of the dendritic arbors in PCs. Here, through a systems biology approach, we investigate a key question relating to this system: why is PKCγ membrane residence time reduced in SCA14 mutant PCs compared to wild-type (WT) PCs? In this study, we investigate this question through two contrasting PKCγ signaling models in PCs. The first model proposed in this study describes the mechanism through which PKCγ signaling activity may be regulated in WT PCs. In contrast, the second model explores how mutations in PKCγ signaling affect the state of SCA14 in PCs. Numerical simulations of both models show that, in response to extracellular stimuli-induced depolarization of the membrane compartment, PKCγ and diacylglycerol kinase γ (DGKγ) translocate to the membrane. Results from our computational approach indicate that, for the same set of parameters, PKCγ membrane residence time is shorter in the SCA14 mutant model compared to the WT model. These results show how PKCγ membrane residence time is regulated by diacylglycerol (DAG), causing translocated PKCγ to return to the cytosol as DAG levels drop. This study shows that, when the strength of the extracellular signal is held constant, the membrane lifetime of mutant PKCγ is reduced. This reduction is due to the presence of constitutively active mutant PKCγ in the cytosol. Cytosolic PKCγ, in turn, leads to phosphorylation and activation of DGKγ while it is still residing in the cytosol. This effect occurs even during the resting conditions. Thus, the SCA14 mutant model explains that, when both DAG effector molecules are active in the cytosol, their interactions in the membrane compartment are reduced, critically influencing PKCγ membrane residence time.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Atypical Dynamic-Connectivity Recruitment in Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder Children: An Insight Into Task-Based Dynamic Connectivity Through an fNIRS Study</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00003</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Connectivity between brain regions has been redefined beyond a stationary state. Even when a person is in a resting state, brain connectivity dynamically shifts. However, shifted brain connectivity under externally evoked stimulus is still little understood. The current study, therefore, focuses on task-based dynamic functional-connectivity (FC) analysis of brain signals measured by functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). We hypothesize that a stimulus may influence not only brain connectivity but also the occurrence probabilities of task-related and task-irrelevant connectivity states. fNIRS measurement (of the prefrontal-to-inferior parietal lobes) was conducted on 21 typically developing (TD) and 21 age-matched attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) children performing an inhibitory control task, namely, the Go/No-Go (GNG) task. It has been reported that ADHD children lack inhibitory control; differences between TD and ADHD children in terms of task-based dynamic FC were also evaluated. Four connectivity states were found to occur during the temporal task course. Two dominant connectivity states (states 1 and 2) are characterized by strong connectivities within the frontoparietal network (occurrence probabilities of 40%–56% and 26%–29%), and presumptively interpreted as task-related states. A connectivity state (state 3) shows strong connectivities in the bilateral medial frontal-to-parietal cortices (occurrence probability of 7–15%). The strong connectivities were found at the overlapped regions related the default mode network (DMN). Another connectivity state (state 4) visualizes strong connectivities in all measured regions (occurrence probability of 10%–16%). A global effect coming from cerebral vascular may highly influence this connectivity state. During the GNG stimulus interval, the ADHD children tended to show decreased occurrence probability of the dominant connectivity state and increased occurrence probability of other connectivity states (states 3 and 4). Bringing a new perspective to explain neuropathophysiology, these findings suggest atypical dynamic network recruitment to accommodate task demands in ADHD children.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Plasmacytoid Dendritic Cells Protect Against Middle Cerebral Artery Occlusion Induced Brain Injury by Priming Regulatory T Cells</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00008</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Regulatory T cells (Tregs) play an anti-inflammatory effect to protect against ischemic stroke. Plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) can induce regulatory T cells tolerance in sterile-inflammation conditions. However, whether and how pDCs-mediated Tregs response play a part in the pathology of ischemic stroke remains unclear. In this study, we showed that pDCs were increased in the brain of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) mice. Depletion of pDCs with 120G8 exacerbated MCAO-induced brain injury, peripheral pro-inflammation response and decreased the systemic Tregs in mice. Furthermore, the data of mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR) in vitro demonstrate that splenic pDCs from MCAO mice can significantly promote Tregs proliferation, accompanying with the increased expression of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1) on pDCs. Taken together, the findings here suggested that under the pathologic state of stroke, pDCs protect against MCAO-induced brain injury by priming Tregs, illustrating that pDCs represented as a therapeutic target for the prevention of ischemic brain injury.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Increased Presence of Cerebral Microbleeds Correlates With Ventricular Enlargement and Increased White Matter Hyperintensities in Alzheimer’s Disease</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00013</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Objective: To investigate whether the number of cerebral microbleeds (CMB) could be a useful indicator to predict glymphatic system dysfunction in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) patients, by comparing the degree of cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) and interstitial fluid (ISF) stasis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Forty probable AD patients were included, with those exhibiting two or more CMB were included in the multiple CMB group (mCMB, n = 21, mean = 11.1), and none or one CMB included in the non-multiple CMB group (nmCMB, n = 19, mean = 0.84). CMB was defined in axial gradient recalled echo (GRE) T2*-weighted images. Evans index (EI) was calculated to measure lateral ventricle enlargement, Voxel-based Specific Regional Analysis System for Alzheimer’s Disease (VSRAD) software was used to determine the extent of gray and white matter atrophy, and Fazekas scale (FS) was used to determine white matter hyperintensities (WMH).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: EI was significantly larger in mCMB than in nmCMB, while the gray and white matter volume was not different between groups. Thus, the difference in lateral ventricle enlargement between AD with and without multiple CMB reflects a combination of the degree of brain atrophy and the extent of CSF stasis. FS was higher in mCMB than in the nmCMB, suggesting the failure of ISF elimination was more severe in mCMB cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: The difference in lateral ventricle enlargement and WMH between AD with or without multiple CMB may reflect a difference in the degree of CSF/ISF stagnation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Functional Connectivity of the Anterior and Posterior Hippocampus: Differential Effects of Glucose in Younger and Older Adults</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00008</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The hippocampus features structurally and functionally distinct anterior and posterior segments. Relatively few studies have examined how these change during aging or in response to pharmacological interventions. Alterations in hippocampal connectivity and changes in glucose regulation have each been associated with cognitive decline in aging. A distinct line of research suggests that administration of glucose can lead to a transient improvement in hippocampus-dependent memory. Here, we probe age, glucose and human cognition with a special emphasis on resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) of the hippocampus along its longitudinal axis to the rest of the brain. Using a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, crossover design 32 healthy adults (16 young and 16 older) ingested a drink containing 25 g glucose or placebo across two counter balanced sessions. They then underwent resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) and cognitive testing. There was a clear dissociation in the effects of glucose by age. Magnitude change in rsFC from posterior hippocampus (pHPC) to medial frontal cortex (mPFC) was correlated with individual glucose regulation and gains in performance on a spatial navigation task. Our results demonstrate that glucose administration can attenuate cognitive performance deficits in older adults with impaired glucose regulation and suggest that increases in pHPC-mPFC rsFC are beneficial for navigation task performance in older participants.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00004</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Parkinson’s disease (PD) is the second-leading cause of dementia and is characterized by a progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra alongside the presence of intraneuronal α-synuclein-positive inclusions. Therapies to date have been directed to the restoration of the dopaminergic system, and the prevention of dopaminergic neuronal cell death in the midbrain. This review discusses the physiological mechanisms involved in PD as well as new and prospective therapies for the disease. The current data suggest that prevention or early treatment of PD may be the most effective therapeutic strategy. New advances in the understanding of the underlying mechanisms of PD predict the development of more personalized and integral therapies in the years to come. Thus, the development of more reliable biomarkers at asymptomatic stages of the disease, and the use of genetic profiling of patients will surely permit a more effective treatment of PD.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: The Decline in Intrinsic Connectivity Between the Salience Network and Locus Coeruleus in Older Adults: Implications for Distractibility</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00002</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;We examined functional connectivity between the locus coeruleus (LC) and the salience network in healthy young and older adults to investigate why people become more prone to distraction with age. Recent findings suggest that the LC plays an important role in focusing processing on salient or goal-relevant information from multiple incoming sensory inputs (Mather et al., 2016). We hypothesized that the connection between LC and the salience network declines in older adults, and therefore the salience network fails to appropriately filter out irrelevant sensory signals. To examine this possibility, we used resting-state-like fMRI data, in which all task-related activities were regressed out (Fair et al., 2007; Elliott et al., 2019) and performed a functional connectivity analysis based on the time-course of LC activity. Older adults showed reduced functional connectivity between the LC and salience network compared with younger adults. Additionally, the salience network was relatively more coupled with the frontoparietal network than the default-mode network in older adults compared with younger adults, even though all task-related activities were regressed out. Together, these findings suggest that reduced interactions between LC and the salience network impairs the ability to prioritize the importance of incoming events, and in turn, the salience network fails to initiate network switching (e.g., Menon and Uddin, 2010; Uddin, 2015) that would promote further attentional processing. A chronic lack of functional connection between LC and salience network may limit older adults’ attentional and executive control resources.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2019.00375</link>
	<content:encoded>Background&lt;p&gt;The cognitive effects of wearing a denture are not well understood. This study was conducted to clarify the effects of denture use on prefrontal and chewing muscle activities, occlusal state, and subjective chewing ability in partially edentulous elderly individuals.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;A total of 16 partially edentulous patients were enrolled. Chewing-related prefrontal cortex and jaw muscle activities were simultaneously examined using a functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) device and electromyography, under the conditions of unwearing, and wearing a denture. Occlusal state and masticatory score were also determined under both conditions. Using multiple linear regression analysis, associations between prefrontal and chewing activities with wearing were examined using change rates.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Chewing rhythmicity was maintained under both conditions. As compared with unwearing, the wearing condition was associated with improved prefrontal cortex and chewing muscle activities, occlusal state in regard to force and area, and masticatory score. Also, prefrontal activities were positively associated with burst duration and peak amplitude in masseter (Mm) and temporal muscle activities, as well as masticatory scores. In contrast, prefrontal activities were negatively associated with occlusal force.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;Wearing a denture induced a positive association between burst duration and peak amplitude in Mm and temporal muscle activities and prefrontal activity, which may indicate a parallel consolidation of prefrontal cortex and rhythmical chewing activities, as well as masticatory scores. On the other hand, denture use induced a negative association of occlusal force with prefrontal activities, which might suggest that prefrontal compensative associations for the physiocognitive acquisition depended on biomechanical efficacy gained by wearing a denture.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2019.00365</link>
	<content:encoded>Introduction&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative dementia with the key pathological hallmarks amyloid-beta deposition and neurofibrillary tangles composed of hyperphosphorylated tau. microRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs that contribute to the pathogenesis of AD. In this study, we investigated the effect of the loss of miR-369 on the phosphorylation of tau protein and the activation of the kinases Fyn and serine/threonine-protein kinase 2 (SRPK2) as the upstream molecules facilitating tau phosphorylation in miR-369 knockout 3xTg-AD mice.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;We generated miR-369 knockout 3xTg-AD mice and investigated their cognitive behaviors by maze tests. Real-time qPCR, western blot, and immunohistochemistry were performed to evaluate the expression of the miR-369 gene, phosphorylation of tau protein, and activation of Fyn and SRPK2. Luciferase reporter assays were applied to confirm the predicted targets of miR-369.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Knocking out miR-369 in 3xTg AD mice aggravated cognitive impairment, promoted hyperphosphorylation of tau, and upregulated Fyn and SRPK2. Restoring miR-369 reversed the hyperphosphorylation of tau and downregulated Fyn and SRPK2. Additionally, miR-369 was shown to target the 3′UTRs of Fyn and SRPK2 to regulate their expression levels.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;Loss of miR-369 promotes tau phosphorylation by targeting the Fyn and SRPK2 signaling pathways in AD mice, and supplementation with miR-369 might be a valuable option for AD therapeutic studies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aging is a major risk factor for numerous neurological disorders, and the mechanisms underlying brain aging remain elusive. Recent animal studies demonstrated a tight relationship between impairment of the glymphatic pathway, meningeal lymphatic vessels, and aging. However, the relationship in the human brain remains uncertain.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this observational cohort study, patients underwent magnetic resonance imaging before and at multiple time points after intrathecal administration of a contrast agent. Head T1‐weighted imaging was performed to assess the function of the glymphatic pathway and head high‐resolution T2–fluid attenuated inversion recovery imaging to visualize putative meningeal lymphatic vessels (pMLVs). We measured the signal unit ratio (SUR) of 6 locations in the glymphatic pathway and pMLVs, defined the percentage change in SUR from baseline to 39 hours as the clearance of the glymphatic pathway and pMLVs, and then analyzed their relationships with aging.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In all patients (N = 35), the SUR of the glymphatic pathway and pMLVs changed significantly after intrathecal injection of the contrast agent. The clearance of both the glymphatic pathway and pMLVs was related to aging (all &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05). The clearance of pMLVs was significantly related to the clearance of the glymphatic pathway (all &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05), and the clearance of the glymphatic pathway was significantly faster in patients with early filling of pMLVs than those with late filling (all &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We revealed that both the glymphatic pathway and pMLVs might be impaired in the aging human brain through the novel, clinically available method to simultaneously visualize their clearance. Our findings also support that in humans, pMLVs are the downstream of the glymphatic pathway. ANN NEUROL 2020&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2020.00007</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Background: An imbalance between total training load and total recovery may cause overtraining (OT). The purpose of the present study was to verify the effects of OT on the expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), its receptor tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB) and p75 and the dynamic expression patterns of brain-specific miR-34a and miR-124 or inflammation-related miR-21 and miR-132 in the mouse hippocampus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Method: Eight weeks old C57BL/6J mice were randomly assigned to the control (CON), normal training (NT) and OT groups. An 8-week OT training protocol was applied to evaluate the phenotype of mice endurance (incremental load test, ILT) and cognitive capacity (Morris water maze test). We used qRT-PCR and immunoblotting to detect changes in the molecular level of hippocampal samples.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Result: Compared with the CON, both NT and OT decreased bodyweight after 8-week training. After 8-week of training, NT increased the exhaustion velocity (EV) while the EV of OT was lower than NT. Mice in NT decreased the escape latency than CON. The percentage of time spent in the probe quadrant and the number of crossing platform times in NT were higher than CON and OT. The BDNF, p75 and TrkB mRNA levels were increased in NT than CON, only the p75 mRNA was increased in OT. The NT exhibited increased protein levels of BDNF and TrkB compared to CON. The protein expression of BDNF was decreased in OT than NT and CON. The protein level of p75 in the OT was higher than in NT and CON. In addition, the phosphorylation level of TrkB in OT was higher than CON and NT. Only the miR-34a level was increased in the OT. Moreover, the expression of miR-34a was found to be negatively correlated with the expression of BDNF, and the increase in miR-34a level was accompanied by a decrease in performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: In summary, the training-evoked increase in the BDNF level may help to improve performance, whereas this conditioning is lost after OT. Moreover, miR-34a potentially mediated changes in the expression of BDNF and may reflect the decrease in performance after OT.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Background: Amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) has a high conversion risk to Alzheimer’s disease (AD). The aMCI patients may have only a memory deficit (single-domain-aMCI, sd-aMCI) or deficits in multiple cognitive domains (multiple-domain-aMCI, md-aMCI). However, differences in intrinsic brain activity between these two sub-types remain unclear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Method: Neuropsychological and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data were acquired from 24 patients with sd-aMCI, 23 patients with md-aMCI, and 32 healthy controls (HCs). We used the fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (fALFF) to characterize the intensity of spontaneous brain activity. The analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) and post hoc tests was performed to determine the between-group differences in fALFF.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: We found higher fALFF in left-sided superior-to-middle frontal gyri and middle-to-inferior temporal gyri in sd-aMCI compared to both the md-aMCI and HCs. Conversely, a lower fALFF was found in the left inferior parietal lobe in both the md-aMCI and sd-aMCI patients. The fALFF values in the left middle and inferior temporal gyri were correlated with cognitive performances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: The gradual reduction in the left inferior parietal lobe from single to multiple domain aMCI suggest a functional inefficiency underlying cognitive impairment, while increased activity in the frontal and temporal gyri in sd-aMCI rather than md-aMCI might indicate functional compensation. This study indicates differential functional profiles in the sd-aMCI and md-aMCI, which may be helpful for the prediction of the future conversion of aMCI to AD.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neural Circuits | New and Recent Articles: Using Neural Circuit Interrogation in Rodents to Unravel Human Speech Decoding</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncir.2020.00002</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The neural circuits responsible for social communication are among the least understood in the brain. Human studies have made great progress in advancing our understanding of the global computations required for processing speech, and animal models offer the opportunity to discover evolutionarily conserved mechanisms for decoding these signals. In this review article, we describe some of the most well-established speech decoding computations from human studies and describe animal research designed to reveal potential circuit mechanisms underlying these processes. Human and animal brains must perform the challenging tasks of rapidly recognizing, categorizing, and assigning communicative importance to sounds in a noisy environment. The instructions to these functions are found in the precise connections neurons make with one another. Therefore, identifying circuit-motifs in the auditory cortices and linking them to communicative functions is pivotal. We review recent advances in human recordings that have revealed the most basic unit of speech decoded by neurons is a phoneme, and consider circuit-mapping studies in rodents that have shown potential connectivity schemes to achieve this. Finally, we discuss other potentially important processing features in humans like lateralization, sensitivity to fine temporal features, and hierarchical processing. The goal is for animal studies to investigate neurophysiological and anatomical pathways responsible for establishing behavioral phenotypes that are shared between humans and animals. This can be accomplished by establishing cell types, connectivity patterns, genetic pathways and critical periods that are relevant in the development and function of social communication.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Unsuspected Involvement of Spinal Cord in Alzheimer Disease</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00006</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Objective: Brain atrophy is an established biomarker for dementia, yet spinal cord involvement has not been investigated to date. As the spinal cord is relaying sensorimotor control signals from the cortex to the peripheral nervous system and vice-versa, it is indeed a very interesting question to assess whether it is affected by atrophy due to a disease that is known for its involvement of cognitive domains first and foremost, with motor symptoms being clinically assessed too. We, therefore, hypothesize that in Alzheimer’s disease (AD), severe atrophy can affect the spinal cord too and that spinal cord atrophy is indeed an important in vivo imaging biomarker contributing to understanding neurodegeneration associated with dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: 3DT1 images of 31 AD and 35 healthy control (HC) subjects were processed to calculate volume of brain structures and cross-sectional area (CSA) and volume (CSV) of the cervical cord [per vertebra as well as the C2-C3 pair (CSA23 and CSV23)]. Correlated features (ρ &amp;gt; 0.7) were removed, and the best subset identified for patients’ classification with the Random Forest algorithm. General linear model regression was used to find significant differences between groups (p ≤ 0.05). Linear regression was implemented to assess the explained variance of the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score as a dependent variable with the best features as predictors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Spinal cord features were significantly reduced in AD, independently of brain volumes. Patients classification reached 76% accuracy when including CSA23 together with volumes of hippocampi, left amygdala, white and gray matter, with 74% sensitivity and 78% specificity. CSA23 alone explained 13% of MMSE variance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Discussion: Our findings reveal that C2-C3 spinal cord atrophy contributes to discriminate AD from HC, together with more established features. The results show that CSA23, calculated from the same 3DT1 scan as all other brain volumes (including right and left hippocampi), has a considerable weight in classification tasks warranting further investigations. Together with recent studies revealing that AD atrophy is spread beyond the temporal lobes, our result adds the spinal cord to a number of unsuspected regions involved in the disease. Interestingly, spinal cord atrophy explains also cognitive scores, which could significantly impact how we model sensorimotor control in degenerative diseases with a primary cognitive domain involvement. Prospective studies should be purposely designed to understand the mechanisms of atrophy and the role of the spinal cord in AD.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Treatment With Liraglutide Exerts Neuroprotection After Hypoxic–Ischemic Brain Injury in Neonatal Rats via the PI3K/AKT/GSK3β Pathway</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2019.00585</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Neonatal hypoxic–ischemic (HI) brain injury is a detrimental disease, which results in high mortality and long-term neurological deficits. Nevertheless, the treatment options for this disease are limited. Thus, the aim of the present study was to assess the role of liraglutide in neonatal HI brain injury in rats and investigate the associated mechanisms. The results showed that treatment with liraglutide significantly reduced infarct volume and ameliorated cerebral edema, decreased inflammatory response, promoted the recovery of tissue structure, and improved prognosis following HI brain injury. Moreover, treatment with liraglutide inhibited apoptosis and promoted neuronal survival both in the rat model and following oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) insult. LY294002, an inhibitor of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), partially reversed these therapeutic effects, suggesting that the PI3K/protein kinase B (Akt) pathway was involved. In conclusion, our data revealed that treatment with liraglutide exerts neuroprotection after neonatal HI brain injury via the PI3K/Akt/glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK3β) pathway and may be a promising therapy for this disease.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Depression, Anxiety, and Apathy in Mild Cognitive Impairment: Current Perspectives</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00009</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Objective: Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is an important risk state for dementia, particularly Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Depression, anxiety, and apathy are commonly observed neuropsychiatric features in MCI, which have been linked to cognitive and functional decline in daily activities, as well as disease progression. Accordingly, the study’s objective is to review the prevalence, neuropsychological characteristics, and conversion rates to dementia between MCI patients with and without depression, anxiety, and apathy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: A PubMed search and critical review were performed relating to studies of MCI, depression, anxiety, and apathy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: MCI patients have a high prevalence of depression/anxiety/apathy; furthermore, patients with MCI and concomitant depression/anxiety/apathy have more pronounced cognitive deficits and progress more often to dementia than MCI patients without depression/anxiety/apathy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions and Implications: Depression, anxiety, and apathy are common in MCI and represent possible risk factors for cognitive decline and progression to dementia. Further studies are needed to better understand the role and neurobiology of depression, anxiety, and apathy in MCI.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Objective: To assess the association between low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c) and risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Embase, Pubmed, and Web of Science were searched until June 2019. Standard mean difference (SMD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) was estimated using random-effects models.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Our meta-analysis of 26 studies revealed higher levels of LDL-c in AD than that of non-dementia controls (SMD = 0.35, 95% CI 0.12–0.58, p &amp;lt; 0.01). The meta-regression analysis on confounders showed that age (p &amp;lt; 0.01, Adj R-squared = 92.41%) and cardiovascular disease (p = 0.01, Adj R-squared = 85.21%), but not the body mass index, education, smoking, hypertension and diabetes mellitus, exerted an impact on the relationship between LDL-c and risk of ICH. Further subgroup analysis of age showed LDL-c levels in AD patients aged 60–70 were higher than that of non-dementia (60 ≤ age &amp;lt; 70: SMD = 0.80, 95% CI 0.23–1.37, p &amp;lt; 0.01); but no association between the SMD of AD in LDL-c and age over 70 was noted across the studies (70 ≤ age &amp;lt; 77: SMD = −0.02, 95% CI −0.39~0.34, p = 9.0; 77 ≤ age &amp;lt; 80: SMD = 0.15, 95% CI −0.17~0.47, p = 0.35; ≥80: SMD = 0.53, 95% CI −0.04~1.11, p = 0.07). The concentrations of LDL-c during the quintile interval of 3~4 were positively associated with AD (121 ≤ concentration &amp;lt; 137: SMD = 0.98, 95% CI 0.13~1.82, p = 0.02; ≥137: SMD = 0.62, 95% CI 0.18~1.06, p &amp;lt; 0.01); whereas there was no correlation between AD and LDL-c within the quintile interval of 1~2 (103.9 ≤ concentration &amp;lt; 112: SMD = 0.08, 95% CI −0.20~0.35, p = 0.59; 112 ≤ concentration &amp;lt; 121: SMD = −0.26, 95% CI −0.58~0.06, p = 0.11).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: Elevated concentration of LDL-c (&amp;gt;121 mg/dl) may be a potential risk factor for AD.

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: CHIT1 at Diagnosis Reflects Long‐Term Multiple Sclerosis Disease Activity</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25691?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Evidence for a role of microglia in the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis (MS) is growing. We investigated association of microglial markers at time of diagnostic lumbar puncture (LP) with different aspects of disease activity (relapses, disability, magnetic resonance imaging parameters) up to 6 years later in a cohort of 143 patients.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), we measured 3 macrophage and microglia‐related proteins, chitotriosidase (CHIT1), chitinase‐3–like protein 1 (CHI3L1 or YKL‐40), and soluble triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (sTREM2), as well as a marker of neuronal damage, neurofilament light chain (NfL), using enzyme‐linked immunosorbent assay and electrochemiluminescence. We investigated the same microglia‐related markers in publicly available RNA expression data from postmortem brain tissue.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CHIT1 levels at diagnostic LP correlated with 2 aspects of long‐term disease activity after correction for multiple testing. First, CHIT1 increased with reduced tissue integrity in lesions at a median 3 years later (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 9.6E‐04). Second, CHIT1 reflected disease severity at a median 5 years later (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 1.2E‐04). Together with known clinical covariates, CHIT1 levels explained 12% and 27% of variance in these 2 measures, respectively, and were able to distinguish slow and fast disability progression (area under the curve = 85%). CHIT1 was the best discriminator of chronic active versus chronic inactive lesions and the only marker correlated with NfL (&lt;i&gt;r&lt;/i&gt; = 0.3, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.0019). Associations with disease activity were, however, independent of NfL.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CHIT1 CSF levels measured during the diagnostic LP reflect microglial activation early on in MS and can be considered a valuable prognostic biomarker for future disease activity. ANN NEUROL 2020&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: Independent functional outcomes after prolonged coma following cardiac arrest: a mechanistic hypothesis</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25690?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Survivors of prolonged (&amp;gt; 2 weeks) post‐cardiac arrest (CA) coma are expected to remain permanently disabled. We aimed to investigate three outlier patients who ultimately achieved independent functional outcomes after prolonged post‐CA coma to identify electroencephalographic (EEG) markers of their recovery potential. For validation purposes, we also aimed to evaluate these markers in an independent cohort of post‐CA patients.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We identified three patients with late recovery from coma (17‐37 days) following CA who recovered to functionally independent behavioral levels. We performed spectral power analyses of available EEGs during prominent burst suppression patterns (BSP) present in all three patients. Using identical methods, we also assessed the relationship of intra‐burst spectral power and outcomes in a prospectively enrolled cohort of post‐CA patients. We performed chart reviews of common clinical, imaging, EEG prognostic variables and clinical outcomes for all patients.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All three patients with late recovery from coma lacked evidence of overwhelming cortical injury but demonstrated prominent BSP on EEG. Spectral analyses revealed a prominent theta (~4‐7Hz) feature dominating the bursts during BSP in these patients. In the prospective cohort, similar intra‐burst theta spectral features were evident in patients with favorable outcomes; patients with BSP and unfavorable outcomes showed either no features, transient burst features or decreasing intra‐burst frequencies with time.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BSP with theta (~4‐7Hz) peak intra‐burst spectral power after CA may index a recovery potential. We discuss our results in the context of optimizing metabolic substrate availability and stimulating the cortico‐thalamic system during recovery from prolonged post‐CA coma.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: Natural History of Adult Patients with GM2 Gangliosidosis</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25689?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GM2 gangliosidoses are lysosomal diseases due to biallelic mutations in the &lt;i&gt;HEXA&lt;/i&gt; (Tay–Sachs disease [TS]) or &lt;i&gt;HEXB&lt;/i&gt; (Sandhoff disease [SD]) genes, with subsequent low hexosaminidase(s) activity. Most patients have childhood onset, but some experience the first symptoms during adolescence/adulthood. This study aims to clarify the natural history of adult patients with GM2 gangliosidosis.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We retrospectively described 12 patients from a French cohort and 45 patients from the literature.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We observed 4 typical presentations: (1) lower motoneuron disorder responsible for proximal lower limb weakness that subsequently expanded to the upper limbs, (2) cerebellar ataxia, (3) psychosis and/or severe mood disorder (only in the TS patients), and (4) a complex phenotype mixing the above 3 manifestations. The psoas was the first and most affected muscle in the lower limbs, whereas the triceps and interosseous were predominantly involved in the upper limbs. A longitudinal study of compound motor action potentials showed a progressive decrease in all nerves, with different kinetics. Sensory potentials were sometimes abnormally low, mainly in the SD patients. The main brain magnetic resonance imaging feature was cerebellar atrophy, even in patients without cerebellar symptoms or leukodystrophy. The prognosis was mainly related to gait disorder, as we showed that beyond 20 years of disease evolution, half of the patients were wheelchair users.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Improved knowledge of GM2 gangliosidosis in adults will help clinicians achieve correct diagnoses and better inform patients on the evolution and prognosis. It may also contribute to defining proper outcome measures when testing emerging therapies. ANN NEUROL 2020&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Soluble Epoxide Hydrolase and Brain Cholesterol Metabolism</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2019.00325</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The bifunctional enzyme soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) is found in all regions of the brain. It has two different catalytic activities, each assigned to one of its terminal domains: the C-terminal domain presents hydrolase activity, whereas the N-terminal domain exhibits phosphatase activity. The enzyme’s C-terminal domain has been linked to cardiovascular protective and anti-inflammatory effects. Cholesterol-related disorders have been associated with sEH, which plays an important role in the metabolism of cholesterol precursors. The role of sEH’s phosphatase activity has been so far poorly investigated in the context of the central nervous system physiology. Given that brain cholesterol disturbances play a role in the onset of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) as well as of other neurodegenerative diseases, understanding the functions of this enzyme could provide pivotal information on the pathophysiology of these conditions. Moreover, the sEH phosphatase domain could represent an underexplored target for drug design and therapeutic strategies to improve symptoms related to neurodegenerative diseases. This review discusses the function of sEH in mammals and its protein structure and catalytic activities. Particular attention was given to the distribution and expression of sEH in the human brain, deepening into the enzyme’s phosphatase activity and its participation in brain cholesterol synthesis. Finally, this review focused on the metabolism of cholesterol and its association with AD.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Neurodegeneration section | New and Recent Articles: Axonal Endoplasmic Reticulum Dynamics and Its Roles in Neurodegeneration</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00048</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The physical continuity of axons over long cellular distances poses challenges for their maintenance. One organelle that faces this challenge is endoplasmic reticulum (ER); unlike other intracellular organelles, this forms a physically continuous network throughout the cell, with a single membrane and a single lumen. In axons, ER is mainly smooth, forming a tubular network with occasional sheets or cisternae and low amounts of rough ER. It has many potential roles: lipid biosynthesis, glucose homeostasis, a Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; store, protein export, and contacting and regulating other organelles. This tubular network structure is determined by ER-shaping proteins, mutations in some of which are causative for neurodegenerative disorders such as hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP). While axonal ER shares many features with the tubular ER network in other contexts, these features must be adapted to the long and narrow dimensions of axons. ER appears to be physically continuous throughout axons, over distances that are enormous on a subcellular scale. It is therefore a potential channel for long-distance or regional communication within neurons, independent of action potentials or physical transport of cargos, but involving its physiological roles such as Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; or organelle homeostasis. Despite its apparent stability, axonal ER is highly dynamic, showing features like anterograde and retrograde transport, potentially reflecting continuous fusion and breakage of the network. Here we discuss the transport processes that must contribute to this dynamic behavior of ER. We also discuss the model that these processes underpin a homeostatic process that ensures both enough ER to maintain continuity of the network and repair breaks in it, but not too much ER that might disrupt local cellular physiology. Finally, we discuss how failure of ER organization in axons could lead to axon degenerative diseases, and how a requirement for ER continuity could make distal axons most susceptible to degeneration in conditions that disrupt ER continuity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Neural Technology section | New and Recent Articles: Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation Ameliorates Cognitive Impairment via Modulating Oxidative Stress, Inflammation, and Autophagy in a Rat Model of Vascular Dementia</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00028</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;To investigate the potential applications and the molecular mechanisms of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) on cognitive impairment in a vascular dementia (VD) animal model. Sprague-Dawley rats were used in this study. VD rat model was induced by modified permanent bilateral common carotid artery occlusion (2-VO) approach. Anodal tDCS was applied to the animals. Morris water maze was used to analyze spatial memory and navigation ability. The pathological changes in the hippocampal CA1 region and cerebral cortex were examined via Hematoxylin-Eosin staining. The rats were sacrificed for the measurement of the level of superoxide (SOD), glutathione (GSH), reactive oxidative species (ROS), malondialdehyd (MDA), Interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α level in the hippocampus. Western blot was carried out to measure the hippocampal expression of microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC-3) and p62. Rats with VD have decreased number of neurons in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex, as well as worse cognitive impairment. The proliferation of activated microglia and astroglia, accompanied with attenuation of myelination were observed in the white matter about 1 month after 2-VO operation. These abnormalities were significantly ameliorated by tDCS treatment. Further study revealed that anodal tDCS could suppress the MDA and ROS level, while enhance the SOD and GSH level to reduce the oxidative stress. Anodal tDCS could inhibit hypoperfusion-induced IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α expression to attenuate inflammatory response in hippocampus. Moreover, anodal tDCS treatment could alleviate autophagy level. The study has demonstrated a possible therapeutic role of tDCS in the treatment of cognitive impairment in VD.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00022</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Early life stress can exert detrimental or beneficial effects on neural development and postnatal behavior depending on the timing, duration, strength, and ability to control the stressors. In this study, we utilized a maternal and social deprivation (MSD) model to investigate the effects of early life stress on neural stem cells (NSCs) and neurogenesis in the adult brain. We found that MSD during the stress-hyporesponsive period (SHRP) (early-MSD), when corticosterone secretion is suppressed, increased the size of the NSC population, whereas the same stress beyond the SHRP abrogated these effects. Early-MSD enhanced neurogenesis not only in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus, one of the classic neurogenic regions, but also in the amygdala. In addition, mice exposed to early-MSD exhibited a reduction in amygdala/hippocampus-dependent fear memory. These results suggest that animals exposed to early life stress during the SHRP have reinforced stress resilience to cope with perceived stressors to maintain a normal homeostatic state.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Neurodegeneration section | New and Recent Articles: A Role of Cholesterol in Modulating the Binding of α-Synuclein to Synaptic-Like Vesicles</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00018</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;α-Synuclein (αS) is a presynaptic protein whose aggregation is associated with Parkinson’s disease (PD). Although the physiological function of αS is still unclear, several lines of evidence indicate that this protein may play a role in the trafficking of synaptic vesicles (SVs) during neurotransmitter release, a task associated with its ability to bind SVs and promote their clustering. It is therefore crucial to identify the cellular factors that modulate this process. To address this question, using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy we have characterized the role of cholesterol, a major component of the membrane of SVs, in the binding of αS with synaptic-like vesicles. Our results indicate that cholesterol can act as a modulator of the overall affinity of αS for SVs by reducing the local affinity of the region spanning residues 65–97 in the non-amyloid-β component (NAC) of the protein. The increased population of bound states that expose the region 65–97 to the solvent was found to induce stronger vesicle-vesicle interactions by αS. These results provide evidence that cholesterol modulates the clustering of synaptic vesicles induced by (α)S, and supports the role of the disorder-to-order equilibrium of the NAC region in the modulation of the biological properties of the membrane-bound state of αS.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Neurogenesis section | New and Recent Articles: Environmental Tobacco Smoke During the Early Postnatal Period of Mice Interferes With Brain 18 F-FDG Uptake From Infancy to Early Adulthood – A Longitudinal Study</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00005</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Exposure to environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) is associated with high morbidity and mortality, mainly in childhood. Our aim was to evaluate the effects of postnatal ETS exposure in the brain 2-deoxy-2-[&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]-fluoro-D-glucose (&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F-FDG) uptake of mice by positron emission tomography (PET) neuroimaging in a longitudinal study. C57BL/6J mice were exposed to ETS that was generated from 3R4F cigarettes from postnatal day 3 (P3) to P14. PET analyses were performed in male and female mice during infancy (P15), adolescence (P35), and adulthood (P65). We observed that ETS exposure decreased &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F-FDG uptake in the whole brain, both left and right hemispheres, and frontal cortex in both male and female infant mice, while female infant mice exposed to ETS showed decreased &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F-FDG uptake in the cerebellum. In addition, all mice showed reduced &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F-FDG uptake in infancy, compared to adulthood in all analyzed VOIs. In adulthood, ETS exposure during the early postnatal period decreased brain &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F-FDG uptake in adult male mice in the cortex, striatum, hippocampus, cingulate cortex, and thalamus when compared to control group. ETS induced an increase in &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F-FDG uptake in adult female mice when compared to control group in the brainstem and cingulate cortex. Moreover, male ETS-exposed animals showed decreased &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F-FDG uptake when compared to female ETS-exposed in the whole brain, brainstem, cortex, left amygdala, striatum, hippocampus, cingulate cortex, basal forebrain and septum, thalamus, hypothalamus, and midbrain. The present study shows that several brain regions are vulnerable to ETS exposure during the early postnatal period and these effects on &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F-FDG uptake are observed even a long time after the last exposure. This study corroborates our previous findings, strengthening the idea that exposure to tobacco smoke in a critical period interferes with brain development of mice from late infancy to early adulthood.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Neurodegeneration section | New and Recent Articles: Interplay Between Mitochondrial Oxidative Disorders and Proteostasis in Alzheimer’s Disease</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.01444</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Although the basis of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) etiology remains unknown, oxidative stress (OS) has been recognized as a prodromal factor associated to its progression. OS refers to an imbalance between oxidant and antioxidant systems, which usually consist in an overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS) which overwhelms the intrinsic antioxidant defenses. Due to this increased production of ROS and RNS, several biological functions such as glucose metabolism or synaptic activity are impaired. In AD, growing evidence links the ROS-mediated damages with molecular targets including mitochondrial dynamics and function, protein quality control system, and autophagic pathways, affecting the proteostasis balance. In this scenario, OS should be considered as not only a major feature in the pathophysiology of AD but also a potential target to combat the progression of the disease. In this review, we will discuss the role of OS in mitochondrial dysfunction, protein quality control systems, and autophagy associated to AD and suggest innovative therapeutic strategies based on a better understanding of the role of OS and proteostasis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.01443</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Iron is an essential transition metal for numerous biologic processes in mammals. Iron metabolism is regulated via several coordination mechanisms including absorption, utilization, recycling, and storage. Iron dyshomeostasis can result in intracellular iron retention, thereby damaging cells, tissues, and organs through free oxygen radical generation. Numerous studies have shown that brain iron overload is involved in the pathological mechanism of neurodegenerative disease including Alzheimer’s disease (AD). However, the underlying mechanisms have not been fully elucidated. Ferroptosis, a newly defined iron-dependent form of cell death, which is distinct from apoptosis, necrosis, autophagy, and other forms of cell death, may provide us a new viewpoint. Here, we set out to summarize the current knowledge of iron metabolism and ferroptosis, and review the contributions of iron and ferroptosis to AD.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: A Machine Learning Approach to the Differentiation of Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging Data of Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS) From a Sedentary Control</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2020.00002</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS) is a debilitating condition estimated to impact at least 1 million individuals in the United States, however there persists controversy about its existence. Machine learning algorithms have become a powerful methodology for evaluating multi-regional areas of fMRI activation that can classify disease phenotype from sedentary control. Uncovering objective biomarkers such as an fMRI pattern is important for lending credibility to diagnosis of CFS. fMRI scans were evaluated for 69 patients (38 CFS and 31 Control) taken before (Day 1) and after (Day 2) a submaximal exercise test while undergoing the n-back memory paradigm. A predictive model was created by grouping fMRI voxels into the Automated Anatomical Labeling (AAL) atlas, splitting the data into a training and testing dataset, and feeding these inputs into a logistic regression to evaluate differences between CFS and control. Model results were cross-validated 10 times to ensure accuracy. Model results were able to differentiate CFS from sedentary controls at a 80% accuracy on Day 1 and 76% accuracy on Day 2 (Table 3). Recursive features selection identified 29 ROI's that significantly distinguished CFS from control on Day 1 and 28 ROI's on Day 2 with 10 regions of overlap shared with Day 1 (Figure 3). These 10 shared regions included the putamen, inferior frontal gyrus, orbital (F3O), supramarginal gyrus (SMG), temporal pole; superior temporal gyrus (T1P) and caudate ROIs. This study was able to uncover a pattern of activated neurological regions that differentiated CFS from Control. This pattern provides a first step toward developing fMRI as a diagnostic biomarker and suggests this methodology could be emulated for other disorders. We concluded that a logistic regression model performed on fMRI data significantly differentiated CFS from Control.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: An Information Theoretic Approach to Reveal the Formation of Shared Representations</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2020.00001</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Modality-invariant categorical representations, i.e., shared representation, is thought to play a key role in learning to categorize multi-modal information. We have investigated how a bimodal autoencoder can form a shared representation in an unsupervised manner with multi-modal data. We explored whether altering the depth of the network and mixing the multi-modal inputs at the input layer affect the development of the shared representations. Based on the activation of units in the hidden layers, we classified them into four different types: visual cells, auditory cells, inconsistent visual and auditory cells, and consistent visual and auditory cells. Our results show that the number and quality of the last type (i.e., shared representation) significantly differ depending on the depth of the network and are enhanced when the network receives mixed inputs as opposed to separate inputs for each modality, as occurs in typical two-stage frameworks. In the present work, we present a way to utilize information theory to understand the abstract representations formed in the hidden layers of the network. We believe that such an information theoretic approach could potentially provide insights into the development of more efficient and cost-effective ways to train neural networks using qualitative measures of the representations that cannot be captured by analyzing only the final outputs of the networks.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neural Circuits | New and Recent Articles: A Step-by-Step Protocol for Optogenetic Kindling</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncir.2020.00003</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Electrical kindling, repeated brain stimulation eventually resulting in seizures, is widely used as an animal model of epileptogenesis and epilepsy. However, the stimulation electrode used for electric kindling targets unknown neuronal populations and may introduce tissue damage and inflammation. Optogenetics can be used to circumvent these shortcomings by permitting millisecond control of activity in genetically defined neurons without gross injury or inflammation. Here we describe an easy step-by-step protocol for optogenetic kindling – optokindling – by which seizures are eventually elicited in initially healthy mice through repeated light stimulation of neurons expressing Channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2). Chronic EEG recordings may be performed over large time scales to monitor activity while video camera monitoring may be used to assess the behavioral severity of seizures. In conclusion, with optokindling, neuroscientists can elucidate the circuit changes that underpin epilepsy while minimizing the contribution of confounding factors such as brain damage and inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00007</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Müller cells are the predominant glial elements in the retina, extending vertically across this structure, and they fulfill a wealth support roles that are critical for neurons. Alterations to the behavior and phenotype of Müller glia are often seen in animal models of retinal degeneration and in retinal tissue from patients with a variety of retinal disorders. Thus, elucidating the mechanisms underlying the development of retinal diseases would help better understand the cellular processes involved in such pathological changes. Studies into Müller cell activity in vitro have been hindered by the difficulty in obtaining pure cell populations and the tendency of these cells to rapidly differentiate in culture. Most protocols currently used to isolate Müller glia use neonatal or embryonic tissue but here, we report an optimized protocol that facilitates the reliable and straightforward isolation and culture of Müller cells from adult pigs, rats and mice. The protocol described here provides an efficient method for the rapid isolation of adult mammalian Müller cells, which represents a reliable platform to study therapeutic targets and to test the effects of drugs that might combat retinal diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00010</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;An inverse association may exist between cancers and neurodegenerative diseases, although convenient biomarkers for verifying this inverse association are lacking. Plasma neurofilament light chain (NfL) is a novel biomarker for neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD), but it has not been measured in patients with cancers, such as gastric cancer (GC). We aimed to explore whether plasma NfL could be a biomarker for GC and AD and whether an inverse association of NfL exists between GC and AD. In this study, plasma NfL levels of 60 normal controls (NC), 91 GC subjects, and 74 AD subjects were measured by a highly sensitive single-molecule array assay. We found that GC subjects expressed lower plasma NfL levels but AD subjects expressed higher plasma NfL levels than NCs. After controlling for confounding factors, plasma NfL levels in the GC group were associated with serum tumor marker levels, and plasma NfL levels in the AD group were associated with cognitive performance and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pathological marker levels. Across the entire cohort, plasma NfL levels were associated with cognitive performance, CSF pathological marker levels and serum tumor marker levels. These results suggest thatplasma NfL may be a potential biomarker for GC and AD and may be convenient for evaluating the inverse association between cancers and neurodegenerative diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25681?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To determine the clinical and molecular features in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis 4 (ALS4) due to mutations in the senataxin (&lt;i&gt;SETX&lt;/i&gt;) gene and to develop tools for evaluating &lt;i&gt;SETX&lt;/i&gt; variants.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our study involved 32 patients, including 31 with mutation in &lt;i&gt;SETX&lt;/i&gt; at c.1166 T&amp;gt;C (p.Leu389Ser) and 1 with mutation at c.1153 G&amp;gt;A (p.Glu385Lys). Clinical characterization of the patients included neurological examination, blood tests, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and dual‐energy x‐ray absorptiometry (DEXA). Fibroblasts and motor neurons were obtained to model the disease and characterize the molecular alteration in senataxin function.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We report key clinical features of ALS4. Laboratory analysis showed alteration of serum creatine kinase and creatinine in the Leu389Ser ALS4 cohort. MRI showed increased muscle fat fraction in the lower extremities, which correlates with disease duration (thigh fat fraction &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.35, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.01; lower leg fat fraction &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.49, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.01). DEXA measurements showed lower extremities are more affected than upper extremities (average fat &lt;i&gt;z&lt;/i&gt; scores of 2.1 and 0.6, respectively). A cellular assay for SETX function confirmed that like the Leu389Ser mutation, the Glu385Lys variant leads to a decrease in R loops, likely from a gain of function.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We identified clinical laboratory and radiological features of ALS4, and hence they should be monitored for disease progression. The molecular characterization of R‐loop levels in patient‐derived cells provides insight into the disease pathology and assays to evaluate the pathogenicity of candidate mutations in the &lt;i&gt;SETX&lt;/i&gt; gene.

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Decreased Density of Perineuronal Net in Prelimbic Cortex Is Linked to Depressive-Like Behavior in Young-Aged Rats</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2020.00004</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Perineuronal nets (PNNs) are condensed extracellular matrix (ECM) structures regulating developmental plasticity and protecting neurons against oxidative stress. PNN abnormalities have been observed in various psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, but the relationship between PNN density and depression still remains unclear. In the present study, we examined the density and components of PNNs including aggrecan, neurocan and Tenascin-R in the prelimbic cortex (PrL) after chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS). We found that depressive-like behaviors were induced after 30 days of CUMS accompanied by decreases in PNN&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cell density and aggrecan expression in the PrL. In addition, rats subjected to 20 days of CUMS were separated into vulnerable and resilient subpopulations that differ along several behavioral domains. Consistently, the density of PNNs and the expression level of neurocan in the vulnerable group were decreased compared to control and resilient groups. Finally, we examined individual differences based on locomotion in a novel context and classified rats as high responding (HR) and low responding (LR) phenotypes. The density of PNNs and the expression level of neurocan in the LR group were lower than the HR group. Moreover, the LR rats were more susceptible to depressive-like behaviors compared with HR rats. Altogether, these results suggest that the density of PNNs in the PrL is associated with depressive-like behaviors in young-aged rats, and it may serve as a potential endophenotype or therapeutic target for depression.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Neurodegeneration section | New and Recent Articles: Systematic Review on Fractal Dimension of the Retinal Vasculature in Neurodegeneration and Stroke: Assessment of a Potential Biomarker</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00016</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Introduction: Ocular manifestations in several neurological pathologies accentuate the strong relationship between the eye and the brain. Retinal alterations in particular can serve as surrogates for cerebral changes. Offering a “window to the brain,” the transparent eye enables non-invasive imaging of these changes in retinal structure and vasculature. Fractal dimension (FD) reflects the overall complexity of the retinal vasculature. Changes in FD could reflect subtle changes in the cerebral vasculature that correspond to preclinical stages of neurodegenerative diseases. In this review, the potential of this retinal vessel metric to serve as a biomarker in neurodegeneration and stroke will be explored.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: A literature search was conducted, following the PRISMA Statement 2009 criteria, in four large bibliographic databases (Pubmed, Embase, Web Of Science and Cochrane Library) up to 12 October 2019. Articles have been included based upon their relevance. Wherever possible, level of evidence (LOE) has been assessed by means of the Oxford Centre for Evidence-based Medicine Level of Evidence classification.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Twenty-one studies were included for qualitative synthesis. We performed a narrative synthesis and produced summary tables of findings of included papers because methodological heterogeneity precluded a meta-analysis. A significant association was found between decreased FD and neurodegenerative disease, mainly addressing cognitive impairment (CI) and dementia. In acute, subacute as well as chronic settings, decreased FD seems to be associated with stroke. Differences in FD between subtypes of ischemic stroke remain unclear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: This review provides a summary of the scientific literature regarding the association between retinal FD and neurodegenerative disease and stroke. Central pathology is associated with a decreased FD, as a measure of microvascular network complexity. As retinal FD reflects the global integrity of the cerebral microvasculature, it is an attractive parameter to explore. Despite obvious concerns, mainly due to a lack of methodological standardization, retinal FD remains a promising non-invasive and low-cost diagnostic biomarker for neurodegenerative and cerebrovascular disease. Before FD can be implemented in clinic as a diagnostic biomarker, the research community should strive for uniformization and standardization.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Path Learning From Navigation in Aging: The Role of Cognitive Functioning and Wayfinding Inclinations</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00008</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Aging coincides with a decline in navigation and wayfinding abilities, but it is unclear to what extent factors relating to a given individual may contribute to mitigating this decline. The present study aims to analyze how older adults’ objective cognitive functioning and self-reported subjective wayfinding inclinations predict their navigation performance. Sixty-four older adults were assessed on their general cognitive functioning (all scoring from 22 to 30 on the Montreal Cognitive Assessment, MoCA), visuospatial working memory (VSWM), and perspective-taking abilities. Their self-assessed wayfinding inclinations (such as their sense of direction, pleasure in exploring places, and spatial anxiety) were also examined. Then participants learned a path in an environment from video navigation and performed a route repetition task (which maintained the same egocentric perspective as the learning phase), and a sketch map task (which involved switching from an egocentric perspective used in the learning phase to an allocentric perspective). The results showed that positive wayfinding inclinations (in terms of pleasure in exploring) related to participants’ route repetition accuracy, while their general cognitive performance (MoCA scores) related to their sketch map drawing accuracy. Individual factors such as cognitive functioning and wayfinding inclinations relate differently to older people’s navigation performance, depending on the demands of the tasks used to test their environment learning.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Right Temporoparietal Junction Involvement in Autonomic Responses to the Suffering of Others: A Preliminary Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation Study</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00007</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Functional neuroimaging studies have emphasized distinct networks for social cognition and affective aspects of empathy. However, studies have not considered whether substrates of social cognition, such as the right temporoparietal junction (TPJ), play a role in affective responses to complex empathy-related stimuli. Here, we used repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to test whether the right TPJ contributes to psychophysiological responses to another person’s emotional suffering. We used a theory of mind functional localizer and image-guided TMS to target the sub-region of the right TPJ implicated in social cognition, and measured autonomic and subjective responses to an empathy induction video. We found evidence that TMS applied at 1 Hz over the right TPJ increased withdrawal of parasympathetic nervous system activity during the empathy induction (n = 32), but did not affect sympathetic nervous system activity (n = 27). Participants who received TMS over the right TPJ also reported feeling more irritation and annoyance, and were less likely to report feeling compassion over and above empathic sadness, than participants who received TMS over the vertex (N = 34). This study provides preliminary evidence for the role of right TPJ functioning in empathy-related psychophysiological and affective responding, potentially blurring the distinction between neural regions specific to social cognition vs. affective aspects of empathy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neural Circuits | New and Recent Articles: Neural Correlates of Learning Pure Tones or Natural Sounds in the Auditory Cortex</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncir.2019.00082</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Associative learning of pure tones is known to cause tonotopic map expansion in the auditory cortex (ACx), but the function this plasticity sub-serves is unclear. We developed an automated training platform called the “Educage,” which was used to train mice on a go/no-go auditory discrimination task to their perceptual limits, for difficult discriminations among pure tones or natural sounds. Spiking responses of excitatory and inhibitory parvalbumin (PV&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) L2/3 neurons in mouse ACx revealed learning-induced overrepresentation of the learned frequencies, as expected from previous literature. The coordinated plasticity of excitatory and inhibitory neurons supports a role for PV&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; neurons in homeostatic maintenance of excitation–inhibition balance within the circuit. Using a novel computational model to study auditory tuning curves, we show that overrepresentation of the learned tones does not necessarily improve discrimination performance of the network to these tones. In a separate set of experiments, we trained mice to discriminate among natural sounds. Perceptual learning of natural sounds induced “sparsening” and decorrelation of the neural response, consequently improving discrimination of these complex sounds. This signature of plasticity in A1 highlights its role in coding natural sounds.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Activation of Melanocortin-4 Receptor Inhibits Both Neuroinflammation Induced by Early Exposure to Ethanol and Subsequent Voluntary Alcohol Intake in Adulthood in Animal Models: Is BDNF the Key Mediator?</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00005</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The concept that neuroinflammation induced by excessive alcohol intake in adolescence triggers brain mechanisms that perpetuate consumption has strengthened in recent years. The melanocortin system, composed of the melanocortin 4 receptor (MC4R) and its ligand α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (α-MSH), has been implicated both in modulation of alcohol consumption and in ethanol-induced neuroinflammation decrease. Chronic alcohol consumption in adolescent rats causes a decrease in an α-MSH release by the hypothalamus, while the administration of synthetic agonists of MC4R causes a decrease in neuroinflammation and a decrease in voluntary alcohol consumption. However, the mechanism that connects the activation of MC4R with the decrease of both neuroinflammation and voluntary alcohol consumption has not been elucidated. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) has been implicated in alcohol drinking motivation, dependence and withdrawal, and its levels are reduced in alcoholics. Deficiencies in BDNF levels increased ethanol self-administration in rats. Further, BDNF triggers important anti-inflammatory effects in the brain, and this could be one of the mechanisms by which BDNF reduces chronic alcohol intake. Interestingly, MC4R signaling induces BDNF expression through the activation of the cAMP-responsive element-binding protein (CREB). We hypothesize that ethanol exposure during adolescence decreases the expression of α-MSH and hence MC4R signaling in the hippocampus, leading to a lower BDNF activity that causes dramatic changes in the brain (e.g., neuroinflammation and decreased neurogenesis) that predispose to maintain alcohol abuse until adulthood. The activation of MC4R either by α-MSH or by synthetic agonist peptides can induce the expression of BDNF, which would trigger several processes that lead to lower alcohol consumption.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: Human Cerebrospinal Fluid Monoclonal LGI1 Autoantibodies Increase Neuronal Excitability</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25666?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leucine‐rich glioma‐inactivated 1 (LGI1) encephalitis is the second most common antibody‐mediated encephalopathy, but insight into the intrathecal B‐cell autoimmune response, including clonal relationships, isotype distribution, frequency, and pathogenic effects of single LGI1 antibodies, has remained limited.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We cloned, expressed, and tested antibodies from 90 antibody‐secreting cells (ASCs) and B cells from the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of several patients with LGI1 encephalitis.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eighty‐four percent of the ASCs and 21% of the memory B cells encoded LGI1‐reactive antibodies, whereas reactivities to other brain epitopes were rare. All LGI1 antibodies were of IgG1, IgG2, or IgG4 isotype and had undergone affinity maturation. Seven of the overall 26 LGI1 antibodies efficiently blocked the interaction of LGI1 with its receptor ADAM22 in vitro, and their mean LGI1 signal on mouse brain sections was weak compared to the remaining, non–ADAM22‐competing antibodies. Nevertheless, both types of LGI1 antibodies increased the intrinsic cellular excitability and glutamatergic synaptic transmission of hippocampal CA3 neurons in slice cultures.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our data show that the patients’ intrathecal B‐cell autoimmune response is dominated by LGI1 antibodies and that LGI1 antibodies alone are sufficient to promote neuronal excitability, a basis of seizure generation. Fundamental differences in target specificity and antibody hypermutations compared to the CSF autoantibody repertoire in N‐methyl‐D‐aspartate receptor encephalitis underline the clinical concept that autoimmune encephalitides are very distinct entities.

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: Predicting Upper Limb Motor Impairment Recovery after Stroke: A Mixture Model</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25679?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spontaneous recovery is an important determinant of upper extremity recovery after stroke and has been described by the 70% proportional recovery rule for the Fugl–Meyer motor upper extremity (FM‐UE) scale. However, this rule is criticized for overestimating the predictability of FM‐UE recovery. Our objectives were to develop a longitudinal mixture model of FM‐UE recovery, identify FM‐UE recovery subgroups, and internally validate the model predictions.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We developed an exponential recovery function with the following parameters: subgroup assignment probability, proportional recovery coefficient &lt;span&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;r&lt;/i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;
      &lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt;
   &lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;, time constant in weeks &lt;span&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;τ&lt;/i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;
      &lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt;
   &lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;, and distribution of the initial FM‐UE scores. We fitted the model to FM‐UE measurements of 412 first‐ever ischemic stroke patients and cross‐validated endpoint predictions and FM‐UE recovery cluster assignment.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The model distinguished 5 subgroups with different recovery parameters (&lt;span&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;r&lt;/i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.09&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;τ&lt;/i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = 5.3&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;r&lt;/i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.46&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;τ&lt;/i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = 10.1&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;r&lt;/i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.86&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;τ&lt;/i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; = 9.8&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;r&lt;/i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.89&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;τ&lt;/i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; = 2.7&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;r&lt;/i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.93&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;τ&lt;/i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; = 1.2&lt;/span&gt;). Endpoint FM‐UE was predicted with a median absolute error of 4.8 (interquartile range [IQR] = 1.3–12.8) at 1 week poststroke and 4.2 (IQR = 1.3–9.8) at 2 weeks. Overall accuracy of assignment to the poor (subgroup 1), moderate (subgroups 2 and 3), and good (subgroups 4 and 5) FM‐UE recovery clusters was 0.79 (95% equal‐tailed interval [ETI] = 0.78–0.80) at 1 week poststroke and 0.81 (95% ETI = 0.80–0.82) at 2 weeks.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FM‐UE recovery reflects different subgroups, each with its own recovery profile. Cross‐validation indicates that FM‐UE endpoints and FM‐UE recovery clusters can be well predicted. Results will contribute to the understanding of upper limb recovery patterns in the first 6 months after stroke. ANN NEUROL 2020&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: Neuroinflammatory markers associate with cognitive decline after major surgery: Findings of an explorative study</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25678?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Long‐term cognitive decline is an adverse outcome after major surgery associated with increased risk for mortality and morbidity. We studied the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and serum biochemical inflammatory response to a standardized orthopedic surgical procedure and the possible association with long‐term changes in cognitive function. We hypothesized that the CSF inflammatory response pattern after surgery would differ in patients having long‐term cognitive decline defined as a composite cognitive &lt;i&gt;z&lt;/i&gt; score of ≥1.0 compared to patients without long‐term cognitive decline at 3 months postsurgery.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Serum and CSF biomarkers of inflammation and blood–brain barrier (BBB) integrity were measured preoperatively and up to 48 hours postoperatively, and cognitive function was assessed preoperatively and at 2 to 5 days and 3 months postoperatively.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Surgery was associated with a pronounced increase in inflammatory biomarkers in both CSF and blood throughout the 48‐hour study period. A principal component (PC) analysis was performed on 52 inflammatory biomarkers. The 2 first PC (PC1 and PC2) construct outcome variables on CSF biomarkers were significantly associated with long‐term cognitive decline at 3 months, but none of the PC construct serum variables showed a significant association with long‐term cognitive decline at 3 months. Patients both with and patients without long‐term cognitive decline showed early transient increases of the astroglial biomarkers S‐100B and glial fibrillary acidic protein in CSF, and in BBB permeability (CSF/serum albumin ratio).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Surgery rapidly triggers a temporal neuroinflammatory response closely associated with long‐term cognitive outcome postsurgery. The findings of this explorative study require validation in a larger surgical patient cohort. ANN NEUROL 2020&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To systematically investigate causal relationships between obesity and cerebrovascular disease, and the extent to which hypertension and hyperglycemia mediate the effect of obesity on cerebrovascular disease.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We used summary statistics from genome‐wide association studies for body mass index (BMI), waist‐to‐hip ratio (WHR) and multiple cerebrovascular disease phenotypes. We explored causal associations with two‐sample Mendelian randomization (MR) accounting for genetic covariation between BMI and WHR; and assessed what proportion of the association between obesity and cerebrovascular disease was mediated by systolic blood pressure (SBP) and blood glucose levels respectively.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Genetic predisposition to higher BMI did not increase the risk of cerebrovascular disease. In contrast, for each 10% increase in WHR there was a 75% increase (95% confidence interval (CI)=44%‐113%) in risk for large artery ischemic stroke, a 57% (CI=29%‐91%) increase in risk for small vessel ischemic stroke, a 197% increase (CI=59%‐457%) in risk of intracerebral hemorrhage, as well as an increase in white matter hyperintensity volume (β=0.11; CI=0.01‐0.21). These WHR associations persisted after adjusting for genetic determinants of BMI. Approximately one tenth of the observed effect of WHR was mediated by SBP for ischemic stroke (12%; CI=4%‐20%), but no evidence of mediation was found for average blood glucose.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abdominal adiposity may trigger causal pathological processes, partially independent from blood pressure and totally independent from glucose levels, that lead to cerebrovascular disease. Potential targets of these pathological processes could represent novel therapeutic opportunities for stroke.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: Fine‐mapping of SNCA in REM sleep behavior disorder and overt synucleinopathies</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25687?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;REM‐sleep behavior disorder (RBD) is a prodromal synucleinopathy, as &amp;gt;80% will eventually convert to overt synucleinopathy. We performed an in‐depth analysis of the &lt;i&gt;SNCA&lt;/i&gt; locus to identify RBD‐specific risk variants.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Full sequencing and genotyping of &lt;i&gt;SNCA&lt;/i&gt; was performed in isolated/idiopathic RBD (iRBD, n=1,076), Parkinson's disease (PD, n=1,013), and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB, n=415), and in control subjects (n=6,155). iRBD cases were diagnosed with RBD prior to neurodegeneration, although some have since converted. A replication cohort from 23andMe of PD patients with probable RBD (pRBD) was also analyzed (cases n=1,782, controls n=131,250). Adjusted logistic regression models and meta‐analyses were performed. Effects on conversion rate were analyzed in 432 RBD patients with available data using Kaplan‐Meier survival analysis.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A 5'‐region &lt;i&gt;SNCA&lt;/i&gt; variant (rs10005233) was associated with iRBD (OR=1.43, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;=1.1E‐08), which was replicated in pRBD. This variant is in linkage disequilibrium (LD) with other 5' risk variants across the different synucleinopathies. An independent iRBD‐specific suggestive association (rs11732740) was detected at the 3' of &lt;i&gt;SNCA&lt;/i&gt; (OR=1.32, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;=4.7E‐04, not statistically significant after Bonferroni correction). Homozygous carriers of both iRBD‐specific SNPs were at highly increased risk for iRBD (OR=5.74, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;=2E‐06). The known top PD‐associated variant (3' variant rs356182) had an opposite direction of effect in iRBD compared to PD.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a distinct pattern of association at the &lt;i&gt;SNCA&lt;/i&gt; locus in RBD as compared to PD, with an opposite direction of effect at the 3' of &lt;i&gt;SNCA&lt;/i&gt;. Several 5' &lt;i&gt;SNCA&lt;/i&gt; variants are associated with iRBD and with pRBD in overt synucleinopathies.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Plasticity in Limbic Regions at Early Time Points in Experimental Models of Tinnitus</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2019.00088</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Tinnitus is one of the most prevalent auditory disorders worldwide, manifesting in both chronic and acute forms. The pathology of tinnitus has been mechanistically linked to induction of harmful neural plasticity stemming from traumatic noise exposure, exposure to ototoxic medications, input deprivation from age-related hearing loss, and in response to injuries or disorders damaging the conductive apparatus of the ears, the cochlear hair cells, the ganglionic cells of the VIIIth cranial nerve, or neurons of the classical auditory pathway which link the cochlear nuclei through the inferior colliculi and medial geniculate nuclei to auditory cortices. Research attempting to more specifically characterize the neural plasticity occurring in tinnitus have used a wide range of techniques, experimental paradigms, and sampled at different windows of time to reach different conclusions about why and which specific brain regions are crucial in the induction or ongoing maintenance of tinnitus-related plasticity. Despite differences in experimental methodologies, evidence reveals similar findings that strongly suggest that immediate and prolonged activation of non-classical auditory structures (i.e., amygdala, hippocampus, and cingulate cortex) may contribute to the initiation and development of tinnitus in addition to the ongoing maintenance of this devastating condition. The overarching focus of this review, therefore, is to highlight findings from the field supporting the hypothesis that abnormal early activation of non-classical sensory limbic regions are involved in tinnitus induction, with activation of these regions continuing to occur at different temporal stages. Since initial/early stages of tinnitus are difficult to control and to quantify in human clinical populations, a number of different animal paradigms have been developed and assessed in experimental investigations. Reviews of traumatic noise exposure and ototoxic doses of sodium salicylate, the most prevalently used animal models to induce experimental tinnitus, indicate early limbic system plasticity (within hours, minutes, or days after initial insult), supports subsequent plasticity in other auditory regions, and contributes to the pathophysiology of tinnitus. Understanding this early plasticity presents additional opportunities for intervention to reduce or eliminate tinnitus from the human condition.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Regulator of G-Protein Signaling (RGS) Protein Modulation of Opioid Receptor Signaling as a Potential Target for Pain Management</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2020.00005</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Opioid drugs are the gold standard for the management of pain, but their use is severely limited by dangerous and unpleasant side effects. All clinically available opioid analgesics bind to and activate the mu-opioid receptor (MOR), a heterotrimeric G-protein-coupled receptor, to produce analgesia. The activity of these receptors is modulated by a family of intracellular RGS proteins or regulators of G-protein signaling proteins, characterized by the presence of a conserved RGS Homology (RH) domain. These proteins act as negative regulators of G-protein signaling by serving as GTPase accelerating proteins or GAPS to switch off signaling by both the Gα and βγ subunits of heterotrimeric G-proteins. Consequently, knockdown or knockout of RGS protein activity enhances signaling downstream of MOR. In this review we discuss current knowledge of how this activity, across the different families of RGS proteins, modulates MOR activity, as well as activity of other members of the opioid receptor family, and so pain and analgesia in animal models, with particular emphasis on RGS4 and RGS9 families. We discuss inhibition of RGS proteins with small molecule inhibitors that bind to sensitive cysteine moieties in the RH domain and the potential for targeting this family of intracellular proteins as adjuncts to provide an opioid sparing effect or as standalone analgesics by promoting the activity of endogenous opioid peptides. Overall, we conclude that RGS proteins may be a novel drug target to provide analgesia with reduced opioid-like side effects, but that much basic work is needed to define the roles for specific RGS proteins, particularly in chronic pain, as well as a need to develop newer inhibitors.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Herpes Simplex Virus 1-Induced Blood-Brain Barrier Damage Involves Apoptosis Associated With GM130-Mediated Golgi Stress</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2020.00002</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Herpes simplex encephalitis (HSE) caused by herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) infection can lead to a high mortality rate and severe neurological sequelae. The destruction of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) is an important pathological mechanism for the development of HSE. However, the specific mechanism underlying the BBB destruction remains unclear. Our previous study found that the Golgi apparatus (GA) plays a crucial role in maintaining the integrity of the BBB. Therefore, this present study aimed to investigate the role of the GA in the destruction of the BBB and its underlying mechanisms. Mouse brain endothelial cells (Bend.3) were cultured to establish a BBB model in vitro, and then infected with HSV-1. The results showed that HSV-1 infection caused downregulation of the Golgi-associated protein GM130, accompanied by Golgi fragmentation, cell apoptosis, and downregulation of tight junction proteins occludin and claudin 5. Knockdown of GM130 with small interfering RNA in uninfected Bend.3 cells triggered Golgi fragmentation, apoptosis, and downregulation of occludin and claudin 5. However, overexpression of GM130 in HSV-1 infected Bend.3 cells by transient transfection partially attenuated the aforementioned damage caused by HSV-1 infection. When the pan-caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-fmk was used after HSV-1 infection to inhibit apoptosis, the protein levels of GM130, occludin and claudin 5 were partially restored. Taken together, these observations indicate that HSV-1 infection of Bend.3 cells triggers a GM130-mediated Golgi stress response that is involved in apoptosis, which in turn results in downregulation of occludin and claudin 5 protein levels. Meanwhile, GM130 downregulation is partially due to apoptosis triggered by HSV-1 infection. Our findings reveal an association between the GA and the BBB during HSV-1 infection and identify potentially novel targets for protecting the BBB and therapeutic approaches for patients with HSE.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Low and High Molecular Weight FGF-2 Have Differential Effects on Astrocyte Proliferation, but Are Both Protective Against Aβ-Induced Cytotoxicity</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2019.00328</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Astrocytes are the most abundant type of glial cells in the brain, and they play a key role in Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Fibroblast Growth Factor-2 (FGF-2) has been implicated as a potential therapeutic agent for treating AD. In the present study, we investigated the protective effects of low molecular weight (LMW; 17 KDa) and high molecular weight (HMW; 23 KDa) forms of FGF-2 on Aβ&lt;sub&gt;1–42&lt;/sub&gt;-induced toxicity, and proliferation in astrocytes. We show that both isoforms of FGF-2 have similar protective effects against Aβ&lt;sub&gt;1–42&lt;/sub&gt;-induced cytotoxicity in primary cultured cortical astrocytes as measured by Lactate Dehydrogenase (LDH) release assay. Additionally, 17 KDa FGF-2 significantly promoted astrocyte proliferation as measured by Trypan Blue, DRAQ5 and 5-ethynyl-2’-deoxyuridine (EdU) staining, but not 23 kDa FGF-2. Furthermore, our results demonstrated that AKT signaling pathway was required for the protective and proliferative effects of FGF-2. Downstream effector studies indicated that 17 kDa FGF-2 promoted astrocyte proliferation by enhanced expression of c-Myc, Cyclin D1, Cyclin E. Furthermore, our data suggested that Cyclin D1 was required for the proliferative effect of LMW FGF2 in astrocytes. Taken together, our findings provide important information for the similarities and differences between 23 kDa and17 kDa isoforms of FGF-2 on astrocyte survival and proliferation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Neurogranin Regulates Metaplasticity</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2019.00322</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD) are two major forms of synaptic plasticity that are widely accepted as cellular mechanisms involved in learning and memory. Metaplasticity is a process whereby modifications in synaptic processes shift the threshold for subsequent plasticity. While metaplasticity has been functionally observed, its molecular basis is not well understood. Here, we report that neurogranin (Ng) regulates metaplasticity by shifting the threshold toward potentiation, i.e., increasing Ng in hippocampal neurons lowers the threshold for LTP and augments the threshold for LTD. We also show that Ng does not change the ultrastructural localization of calmodulin (CaM)-dependent protein Kinase II (CaMKII) or calcineurin, critical enzymes for the induction of LTP and LTD, respectively. Interestingly, while CaMKII concentrates close to the plasma membrane, calcineurin concentrates away from the plasma membrane. These data, along with the previous observation showing Ng targets CaM closer to the plasma membrane, suggesting that shifting the localization of CaM within the dendritic spines and closer to the plasma membrane, where there is more CaMKII, may be favoring the activation of CaMKII vs. that of calcineurin. Thus, the regulation of CaM localization/targeting within dendritic spines by Ng may provide a mechanistic basis for the regulation of metaplasticity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Spaced Training Enhances Contextual Fear Memory via Activating Hippocampal 5-HT2A Receptors</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2019.00317</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Spaced training is robustly superior to massed training, which is a well-documented phenomenon in humans and animals. However, the mechanisms underlying the spacing effect still remain unclear. We have reported previously that spacing training exerts memory-enhancing effects by inhibiting forgetting via decreasing hippocampal Rac1 activity. Here, using contextual fear conditioning in rat, we found that spaced but not massed training increased hippocampal 5-HT2A receptors’ expression. Furthermore, hippocampal administration of 5-HT2A receptor antagonist MDL11939 before spaced training blocked the enhanced memory, while hippocampal administration of 5-HT2A receptor agonist TCB-2 before massed training promoted the memory. Moreover, MDL11939 activated hippocampal Rac1, while TCB-2 decreased hippocampal Rac1 activity in naïve rats. These results indicated the possibility of interaction between 5-HT2A receptors and Rac1, which was demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation experiments. Our study first demonstrates that activation of hippocampal 5-HT2A is a mechanism underlying the spacing effect, and forgetting related molecular Rac1 is engaged in this process through interacting with 5-HT2A receptors, which suggest a promising strategy to modulate abnormal learning in cognitive disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Integrative Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Afterdischarges of Spinal Interneurons Following a Brief High-Frequency Stimulation of Ia Afferents in the Cat</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnint.2019.00075</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Spinal motoneurons exhibit sustained afterdischarges and plateau potentials following a brief high-frequency stimulation of Ia afferents. Also, there is evidence that spinal cord interneurons exhibit plateau potentials. However, to our knowledge, there are no reports about the possible afterdischarge behavior of lumbar spinal interneurons activated by Ia afferents. Given that there are spinal interneurons receiving monosynaptic inputs from Ia afferents, these cells could then be activated in parallel to motoneurons after repetitive muscle stretch. We explored this possibility in cats with a precollicular-postmammillary decerebration. We found that a brief high-frequency stimulation of Ia afferents produces afterdischarges that are highly correlated to a DC slow potential recorded at the cord dorsum. We conclude that in the cat spinal cord, not only the motoneurons but also the interneurons from the superficial and deep dorsal horn produce sustained afterdischarges, thus highlighting the importance of interneurons in the spinal neuronal circuitry. The significance of our finding is that it opens the possibility that the spinal cord interneurons activated by Ia afferents could also exhibit bistability, a relevant phenomenon well-characterized in the motoneurons.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Brain Imaging Methods section | New and Recent Articles: Shape Information Improves the Cross-Cohort Performance of Deep Learning-Based Segmentation of the Hippocampus</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00015</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Performing an accurate segmentation of the hippocampus from brain magnetic resonance images is a crucial task in neuroimaging research, since its structural integrity is strongly related to several neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer’s Disease (AD). Some automatic segmentation tools are already being used, but, in recent years, new deep learning (DL) based methods have been proven to be much more accurate in various medical image segmentation tasks. In this work, we propose a DL-based hippocampus segmentation framework that embeds statistical shape of the hippocampus as context information into the deep neural network (DNN). The inclusion of shape information is achieved with three main steps: (1) a U-Net based segmentation, (2) a shape model estimation and (3) a second U-Net based segmentation which uses both the original input data and the fitted shape model. The trained DL architectures were tested on image data of three diagnostic groups (AD patients, subjects with mild cognitive impairment and controls) from two cohorts (ADNI and AddNeuroMed). Both intra-cohort validation and cross-cohort validation were performed and compared with the conventional U-net architecture and some variations with other types of context information (i.e. autocontext and tissue-class context). Our results suggest that adding shape information can improve the segmentation accuracy in cross-cohort validation, i.e. when DNNs are trained on one cohort and applied to another. However, no significant benefit is observed in intra-cohort validation, i.e. training and testing DNNs on images from the same cohort. Moreover, compared to other types of context information, the use of shape context was shown to be the most successful in increasing the accuracy, while keeping the computational time in the order of a few minutes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00003</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms are prevalent in both civilian and military service members. As the number of smartphone-based applications (apps) grows rapidly in health care, apps are also increasingly used to help individuals with subthreshold PTSD or full PTSD. Yet, if the apps are self-managed, the feasibility and efficacy of such interventions are still rather unclear in these two populations with PTSD symptoms. Hence, the present meta-analysis set out to evaluate the effect of self-management smartphone-based apps on PTSD and depressive symptoms in populations with subthreshold PTSD or full PTSD. Studies were included if they conducted randomized controlled trials or pre-post comparisons. Six studies (n = 2 randomized controlled trials) were identified for meta-analysis. In pre-post comparisons, N = 209 participants were included in the analyses. In randomized controlled trials, N = 87 participants received smartphone-based self-management interventions and N = 82 participants were in waitlist control conditions. Meta-analysis for pre-post comparisons concluded an effect of g = 0.55 (p &amp;lt; 0.001) regarding the overall reduction in PTSD symptoms (n = 6) and g = 0.45 (p &amp;lt; 0.001) for reduction in depressive symptoms (n = 5). Yet, in randomized controlled trials, no significant difference was found between app-based treatment and waitlist control groups (g = 0.09, p = 0.574). The duration of the interventions did not significantly influence the results. Overall, despite positive pre-post effects, current results indicate that smartphone-apps for PTSD patients are not significantly more effective than waitlist control conditions. Nevertheless, a combined smartphone and standard therapy approach may be a fruitful field for future research.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Brain Imaging Methods section | New and Recent Articles: Improving Patch-Based Convolutional Neural Networks for MRI Brain Tumor Segmentation by Leveraging Location Information</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.01449</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The manual brain tumor annotation process is time consuming and resource consuming, therefore, an automated and accurate brain tumor segmentation tool is greatly in demand. In this paper, we introduce a novel method to integrate location information with the state-of-the-art patch-based neural networks for brain tumor segmentation. This is motivated by the observation that lesions are not uniformly distributed across different brain parcellation regions and that a locality-sensitive segmentation is likely to obtain better segmentation accuracy. Toward this, we use an existing brain parcellation atlas in the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space and map this atlas to the individual subject data. This mapped atlas in the subject data space is integrated with structural Magnetic Resonance (MR) imaging data, and patch-based neural networks, including 3D U-Net and DeepMedic, are trained to classify the different brain lesions. Multiple state-of-the-art neural networks are trained and integrated with XGBoost fusion in the proposed two-level ensemble method. The first level reduces the uncertainty of the same type of models with different seed initializations, and the second level leverages the advantages of different types of neural network models. The proposed location information fusion method improves the segmentation performance of state-of-the-art networks including 3D U-Net and DeepMedic. Our proposed ensemble also achieves better segmentation performance compared to the state-of-the-art networks in BraTS 2017 and rivals state-of-the-art networks in BraTS 2018. Detailed results are provided on the public multimodal brain tumor segmentation (BraTS) benchmarks.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.01430</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The coordination of brain activity between disparate neural populations is highly dynamic. Investigations into intrinsic brain organization by evaluating dynamic resting-state functional connectivity (dRSFC) have attracted great attention in recent years. However, there are few dRSFC studies based on functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) even though it has some advantages for studying the temporal evolution of brain function. In this research, we recruited 20 young adults and measured their resting-state brain fluctuations in several areas of the frontal, parietal, temporal, and occipital lobes using fNIRS-electroencephalography (EEG) simultaneous recording. Based on a sliding-window approach, we found that the variability of the dRSFC within any region of interest was significantly lower than the connections between region of interests but noticeably greater than the correlation between the channels with a short interoptode distance, which mainly consist of physiological fluctuations occurring in the superficial layers. Furthermore, based on a time-resolved k-means clustering analysis, the temporal evolution was extracted for three dominant functional networks. These networks were roughly consistent between different subject subgroups and in varying sliding time window lengths of 20, 30, and 60 s. Between these three functional networks, there were obvious time-varied and system-specific synchronous relationships. In addition, the oscillation of the frontal-parietal-temporal network showed significant correlation with the switching of one EEG microstate, a finding which is consistent with a previous functional MRI-EEG study. All this evidence implies the functional significance of fNIRS-dRSFC and demonstrates the feasibility of fNIRS for extracting the dominant functional networks based on RSFC dynamics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: A Novel Training Program to Improve Human Spatial Orientation: Preliminary Findings</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00005</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The ability to form a mental representation of the surroundings is a critical skill for spatial navigation and orientation in humans. Such a mental representation is known as a “cognitive map” and is formed as individuals familiarize themselves with the surrounding, providing detailed information about salient environmental landmarks and their spatial relationships. Despite evidence of the malleability and potential for training spatial orientation skills in humans, it remains unknown if the specific ability to form cognitive maps can be improved by an appositely developed training program. Here, we present a newly developed computerized 12-days training program in a virtual environment designed specifically to stimulate the acquisition of this important skill. We asked 15 healthy volunteers to complete the training program and perform a comprehensive spatial behavioral assessment before and after the training. We asked participants to become familiar with the environment by navigating a small area before slowly building them up to navigate within the larger and more complex environment; we asked them to travel back and forth between environmental landmarks until they had built an understanding of where those landmarks resided with respect to one another. This process repeated until participants had visited every landmark in the virtual town and had learned where each landmark resided with respect to the others. The results of this study confirmed the feasibility of the training program and suggested an improvement in the ability of participants to form mental representations of the spatial surrounding. This study provides preliminary findings on the feasibility of a 12-days program in training spatial orientation skills. We discuss the utility and potential impact of this training program in the lives of the many individuals affected by topographical disorientation as a result of an acquired or developmental condition.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Using Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation to Test a Network Model of Perceptual Decision Making in the Human Brain</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00004</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Previous research has suggested that the lateral occipital cortex (LOC) is involved with visual decision making, and specifically with the accumulation of information leading to a decision. In humans, this research has been primarily based on imaging and electroencephalography (EEG), and as such only correlational. One line of such research has led to a model of three spatially distributed brain networks that activate in temporal sequence to enable visual decision-making. The model predicted that disturbing neural processing in the LOC at a specific latency would slow object decision-making, increasing reaction time (RT) in a difficult discrimination task. We utilized transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to test this prediction, perturbing LOC beginning at 400 ms post-stimulus onset, a time in the model corresponding to LOC activation at a particular difficulty level, with the expectation of increased RT. Thirteen healthy adults participated in two TMS sessions in which left and right LOC were stimulated separately utilizing neuronavigation and robotic coil guidance. Participants performed a two-alternative forced-choice task selecting whether a car or face was present on each trial amidst visual noise pre-tested to approximate a 75% accuracy level. In an effort to disrupt processing, pairs of TMS pulses separated by 50 ms were presented at one of five stimulus onset asynchronies (SOAs): −200, 200, 400, 450, or 500 ms. Behavioral performance differed systematically across SOAs for RT and accuracy measures. As predicted, TMS at 400 ms resulted in a significant slowing of RT. TMS delivered at −200 ms resulted in faster RT, indicating early stimulation may result in priming and performance enhancement. Use of TMS thus causally demonstrated the involvement of LOC in this task, and more broadly with perceptual decision-making; additionally, it demonstrated the role of TMS in testing well-developed neural models of perceptual processing.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Semantic Memory and the Hippocampus: Revisiting, Reaffirming, and Extending the Reach of Their Critical Relationship</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2019.00471</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Since Tulving proposed a distinction in memory between semantic and episodic memory, considerable effort has been directed towards understanding their similar and unique features. Of particular interest has been the extent to which semantic and episodic memory have a shared dependence on the hippocampus. In contrast to the definitive evidence for the link between hippocampus and episodic memory, the role of the hippocampus in semantic memory has been a topic of considerable debate. This debate stems, in part, from highly variable reports of new semantic memory learning in amnesia ranging from profound impairment to full preservation, and various degrees of deficit and ability in between. More recently, a number of significant advances in experimental methods have occurred, alongside new provocative data on the role of the hippocampus in semantic memory, making this an ideal moment to revisit this debate, to re-evaluate data, methods, and theories, and to synthesize new findings. In line with these advances, this review has two primary goals. First, we provide a historical lens with which to reevaluate and contextualize the literature on semantic memory and the hippocampus. The second goal of this review is to provide a synthesis of new findings on the role of the hippocampus and semantic memory. With the perspective of time and this critical review, we arrive at the interpretation that the hippocampus does indeed make necessary contributions to semantic memory. We argue that semantic memory, like episodic memory, is a highly flexible, (re)constructive, relational and multimodal system, and that there is value in developing methods and materials that fully capture this depth and richness to facilitate comparisons to episodic memory. Such efforts will be critical in addressing questions regarding the cognitive and neural (inter)dependencies among forms of memory, and the role that these forms of memory play in support of cognition more broadly. Such efforts also promise to advance our understanding of how words, concepts, and meaning, as well as episodes and events, are instantiated and maintained in memory and will yield new insights into our two most quintessentially human abilities: memory and language.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Saccade Latency Provides Evidence for Reduced Face Inversion Effects With Higher Autism Traits</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2019.00470</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Individuals on the autism spectrum are reported to show impairments in the processing of social information, including aspects of eye-movements towards faces. Abnormalities in basic-level visual processing are also reported. In the current study, we sought to determine if the latency of saccades made towards social targets (faces) in a natural scene as opposed to inanimate targets (cars) would be related to sub-clinical autism traits (ATs) in individuals drawn from a neurotypical population. The effect of stimulus inversion was also examined given that difficulties with processing inverted faces are thought to be a function of face expertise. No group differences in saccadic latency were established for face or car targets, regardless of image orientation. However, as expected, we found that individuals with higher autism-like traits did not demonstrate a saccadic face inversion effect, but those with lower autism-like traits did. Neither group showed a car inversion effect. Thus, these results suggest that neurotypical individuals with high autism-like traits also show anomalies in detecting and orienting to faces. In particular, the reduced saccadic face inversion effect established in these participants with high ATs suggests that speed of visual processing and orienting towards faces may be associated with the social difficulties found across the broader autism spectrum.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Novel Volumetric Sub-region Segmentation in Brain Tumors</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2020.00003</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A novel deep learning based model called Multi-Planar Spatial Convolutional Neural Network (MPS-CNN) is proposed for effective, automated segmentation of different sub-regions viz. peritumoral edema (ED), necrotic core (NCR), enhancing and non-enhancing tumor core (ET/NET), from multi-modal MR images of the brain. An encoder-decoder type CNN model is designed for pixel-wise segmentation of the tumor along three anatomical planes (axial, sagittal, and coronal) at the slice level. These are then combined, by incorporating a consensus fusion strategy with a fully connected Conditional Random Field (CRF) based post-refinement, to produce the final volumetric segmentation of the tumor and its constituent sub-regions. Concepts, such as spatial-pooling and unpooling are used to preserve the spatial locations of the edge pixels, for reducing segmentation error around the boundaries. A new aggregated loss function is also developed for effectively handling data imbalance. The MPS-CNN is trained and validated on the recent Multimodal Brain Tumor Segmentation Challenge (BraTS) 2018 dataset. The Dice scores obtained for the validation set for whole tumor (WT :NCR/NE +ET +ED), tumor core (TC:NCR/NET +ET), and enhancing tumor (ET) are 0.90216, 0.87247, and 0.82445. The proposed MPS-CNN is found to perform the best (based on leaderboard scores) for ET and TC segmentation tasks, in terms of both the quantitative measures (viz. Dice and Hausdorff). In case of the WT segmentation it also achieved the second highest accuracy, with a score which was only 1% less than that of the best performing method.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) has been suggested as a reliable, noninvasive, and inexpensive tool for the diagnosis of neurodegenerative dementias. In this study, we assessed the classification performance of TMS parameters in the differential diagnosis of common neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer disease (AD), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), and frontotemporal dementia (FTD).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We performed a multicenter study enrolling patients referred to 4 dementia centers in Italy, in accordance with the Standards for Reporting of Diagnostic Accuracy. All patients underwent TMS assessment at recruitment (index test), with application of reference clinical criteria, to predict different neurodegenerative disorders. The investigators who performed the index test were masked to the results of the reference test and all other investigations. We trained and tested a random forest classifier using 5‐fold cross‐validation. The primary outcome measures were the classification accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score of TMS in differentiating each neurodegenerative disorder.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A total of 694 participants were included, namely 273 patients diagnosed as AD, 67 as DLB, and 207 as FTD, and 147 healthy controls (HC). A series of 3 binary classifiers was employed, and the prediction model exhibited high classification accuracy (ranging from 0.89 to 0.92), high precision (0.86–0.92), high recall (0.93–0.98), and high F1 scores (0.89–0.95) in differentiating each neurodegenerative disorder.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TMS is a noninvasive procedure that reliably and selectively distinguishes AD, DLB, FTD, and HC, representing a useful additional screening tool to be used in clinical practice. ANN NEUROL 2020&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Epidemiological research in multiple sclerosis (MS) has mainly been performed in socioeconomically and ethnically limited populations; influences on MS risk have not been studied in prospectively collected non‐White populations. We set out to study the influence of previously described MS risk factors in an ethnically diverse population.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A nested case–control study was created using primary care records of &amp;gt;1 million individuals, &amp;gt;50% of whom identify as Black, Asian, and Minority Ethnic (BAME). MS cases were compared to an age‐ and sex‐matched control cohort (1:4), and to a large unmatched cohort. Odds ratios (ORs) of disease were determined according to exposure of interest, and a multivariate model including all exposures was created. Potential pairwise interactions were considered where both indicated a significant effect.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A total of 1,344 confirmed MS cases were included. MS OR in blacks aged &amp;lt;40 years was 1.15 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.81–1.62) compared to whites. MS odds in BAME current (OR = 1.71, 95% CI = 1.24–2.31) and ex‐smokers (OR = 2.83, 95% CI = 2.14–3.72) were considerably higher than in Whites (OR = 1.09, 95% CI = 0.88–1.34; OR = 1.44, 95% CI = 1.19–1.74, respectively). Prior infectious mononucleosis was associated with increased odds of MS in Blacks (OR = 4.94, 95% CI = 1.23–17.89). An increase in MS odds was seen in the least‐deprived quintile (OR = 2.46, 95% CI = 1.40–4.24), but no effect across deprived quintiles was seen.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This cohort provides novel data on factors potentially driving MS susceptibility in a diverse population, one‐third of whom live in poverty. Environmental exposures have differential risk across ethnicity. ANN NEUROL 2020&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Lack of Neurosteroid Selectivity at δ vs. γ2-Containing GABAA Receptors in Dentate Granule Neurons</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2020.00006</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptors mediate a large fraction of inhibitory neurotransmission in the central nervous system. Two major classes of GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptors are γ2-containing receptors and δ-containing receptors, which are largely located synaptically and extrasynaptically, respectively. Neuroactive steroids such as allopregnanolone (3α5αP) and allotetrahydrodeoxycorticosterone (THDOC) are hypothesized to selectively affect δ-containing receptors over γ2-containing receptors. However, the selectivity of neurosteroids on GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptor classes is controversial. In this study, we re-examined this issue using mice with picrotoxin resistance associated with either the δ or γ2 subunit. Our results show that 3α5αP potentiated phasic inhibition of GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptors, and this is mainly through γ2-containing receptors. 3α5αP, with or without exogenous GABA, potentiated tonic inhibition through GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptors. Surprisingly, potentiation arose from both γ2- and δ-containing receptors, even when a δ selective agonist THIP was used to activate current. Although ethanol has been proposed to act through neurosteroids and to act selectively at δ receptors, we found no evidence for ethanol potentiation of GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptor function at 50 mM under our experimental conditions. Finally, we found that the actions of pentobarbital exhibited very similar effects on tonic current as 3α5αP, emphasizing the broad spectrum nature of neurosteroid potentiation. Overall, using chemogenetic analysis, our evidence suggests that in a cell population enriched for δ-containing receptors, neurosteroids act through both δ-containing and non-δ-containing receptors.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The lateral parabrachial nucleus, medial parabrachial nucleus, vestibular nuclei complex, and medullary viscero-sensory-motor (VSM) nuclei complex (the latter including among others the solitary nucleus, vagus nerve nucleus, and hypoglossal nucleus) are anatomically and functionally connected brainstem gray matter structures that convey signals across multiple modalities between the brain and the spinal cord to regulate vital bodily functions. It is remarkably difficult to precisely extrapolate the location of these nuclei from ex vivo atlases to conventional 3 Tesla in vivo images; thus, a probabilistic brainstem template in stereotaxic neuroimaging space in living humans is needed. We delineated these nuclei using single-subject high contrast 1.1 mm isotropic resolution 7 Tesla MRI images. After precise coregistration of nuclei labels to stereotaxic space, we generated a probabilistic template of their anatomical locations. Finally, we validated the nuclei labels in the template by assessing their inter-rater agreement, consistency across subjects and volumes. We also performed a preliminary comparison of their location and microstructural properties to histologic sections of a postmortem human brainstem specimen. In future, the resulting probabilistic template of these brainstem nuclei in stereotaxic space may assist researchers and clinicians in evaluating autonomic, vestibular and VSM nuclei structure, function and connectivity in living humans using conventional 3 Tesla MRI scanners.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.01399</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Alpha-synuclein (α-syn) is localized in cellular organelles of most neurons, but many of its physiological functions are only partially understood. α-syn accumulation is associated with Parkinson’s disease, dementia with Lewy bodies, and multiple system atrophy as well as other synucleinopathies; however, the exact pathomechanisms that underlie these neurodegenerative diseases remain elusive. In this review, we describe what is known about α-syn function and pathophysiological changes in different cellular structures and organelles, including what is known about its behavior as a prion-like protein. We summarize current knowledge of α-syn and its pathological forms, covering its effect on each organelle, including aggregation and toxicity in different model systems, with special interest on the mitochondria due to its relevance during the apoptotic process of dopaminergic neurons. Moreover, we explore the effect that α-syn exerts by interacting with chromatin remodeling proteins that add or remove histone marks, up-regulate its own expression, and resume the impairment that α-syn induces in vesicular traffic by interacting with the endoplasmic reticulum. We then recapitulate the events that lead to Golgi apparatus fragmentation, caused by the presence of α-syn. Finally, we report the recent findings about the accumulation of α-syn, indirectly produced by the endolysosomal system. In conclusion, many important steps into the understanding of α-syn have been made using in vivo and in vitro models; however, the time is right to start integrating observational studies with mechanistic models of α-syn interactions, in order to look at a more complete picture of the pathophysiological processes underlying α-synucleinopathies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Effects of Cholinergic Neuromodulation on Thalamocortical Rhythms During NREM Sleep: A Model Study</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2019.00100</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;It has been suggested that cholinergic neurons shape the oscillatory activity of the thalamocortical (TC) network in behavioral and electrophysiological experiments. However, theoretical modeling demonstrating how cholinergic neuromodulation of thalamocortical rhythms during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep might occur has been lacking. In this paper, we first develop a novel computational model (TC-ACH) by incorporating a cholinergic neuron population (CH) into the classical thalamo-cortical circuitry, where connections between populations are modeled in accordance with existing knowledge. The neurotransmitter acetylcholine (ACH) released by neurons in CH, which is able to change the discharge activity of thalamocortical neurons, is the primary focus of our work. Simulation results with our TC-ACH model reveal that the cholinergic projection activity is a key factor in modulating oscillation patterns in three ways: (1) transitions between different patterns of thalamocortical oscillations are dramatically modulated through diverse projection pathways; (2) the model expresses a stable spindle oscillation state with certain parameter settings for the cholinergic projection from CH to thalamus, and more spindles appear when the strength of cholinergic input from CH to thalamocortical neurons increases; (3) the duration of oscillation patterns during NREM sleep including K-complexes, spindles, and slow oscillations is longer when cholinergic input from CH to thalamocortical neurons becomes stronger. Our modeling results provide insights into the mechanisms by which the sleep state is controlled, and provide a theoretical basis for future experimental and clinical studies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2019.00096</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Head-direction cells have been found in several areas in the mammalian brains. The firing rate of an ideal head-direction cell reaches its peak value only when the animal's head points in a specific direction, and this preferred direction stays the same regardless of spatial location. In this paper we combine mathematical analytical techniques and numerical simulations to fully analyze the equilibrium states of a generic ring attractor network, which is a widely used modeling framework for the head-direction system. Under specific conditions, all solutions of the ring network are bounded, and there exists a Lyapunov function that guarantees the stability of the network for any given inputs, which may come from multiple sources in the biological system, including self-motion information for inertially based updating and landmark information for calibration. We focus on the first few terms of the Fourier series of the ring network to explicitly solve for all possible equilibrium states, followed by a stability analysis based on small perturbations. In particular, these equilibrium states include the standard single-peaked activity pattern as well as double-peaked activity pattern, whose existence is unknown but has testable experimental implications. To our surprise, we have also found an asymmetric equilibrium activity profile even when the network connectivity is strictly symmetric. Finally we examine how these different equilibrium solutions depend on the network parameters and obtain the phase diagrams in the parameter space of the ring network.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

To address this, we developed Tracer with Restricted Anterograde Spread (TRAS), a novel vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV)-based neural circuit labeling approach. TRAS makes use of replication-incompetent VSV (VSVΔG) and a helper virus (lentivirus) to enable anterograde transneuronal spread between efferent axons and their direct postsynaptic targets but restricts further spread to downstream areas. We integrated TRAS with the Z-Brain zebrafish 3D atlas for quantitative connectivity analysis and identified targets of the retinal and habenular efferent projections, in patterns consistent with previous reports. We compared retinofugal connectivity patterns between wild-type and down syndrome cell adhesion molecule-like 1 (dscaml1) mutant zebrafish and revealed differences in topographical distribution. These results demonstrate the utility of TRAS for quantitative structural connectivity analysis that would be valuable for detecting novel efferent targets and mapping connectivity changes underlying neurological or behavioral deficits.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neural Circuits | New and Recent Articles: Facilitation of Crossmodal Integration During Emotional Prediction in Methamphetamine Dependents</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncir.2019.00080</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Methamphetamine (meth) can greatly damage the prefrontal cortex of the brain and trigger dysfunction of the cognitive control loop, which triggers not only drug dependence but also emotional disorders. The imbalance between the cognitive and emotional systems will lead to crossmodal emotional deficits. Until now, the negative impact of meth dependence on crossmodal emotional processing has not received attention. Therefore, the present study firstly examined the differences in crossmodal emotional processing between healthy controls and meth dependents (MADs) and then investigated the role of visual- or auditory-leading cues in the promotion of crossmodal emotional processing. Experiment 1 found that MADs made a visual–auditory integration disorder for fearful emotion, which may be related to the defects in information transmission between the auditory and auditory cortex. Experiment 2 found that MADs had a crossmodal disorder pertaining to fear under visual-leading cues, but the fearful sound improved the detection of facial emotions for MADs. Experiment 3 reconfirmed that, for MADs, A-leading cues could induce crossmodal integration immediately more easily than V-leading ones. These findings provided sufficient quantitative indicators and evidences that meth dependence was associated with crossmodal integration disorders, which in turn was associated with auditory-leading cues that enhanced the recognition ability of MADs for complex emotions (all results are available at: https://osf.io/x6rv5/). These results provided a better understanding for individuals using drugs in order to enhance the cognition for the complex crossmodal emotional integration.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25675?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are currently no definitive disease‐modifying therapies for traumatic brain injury (TBI). In this study, we present a strong therapeutic candidate for TBI, immunomodulatory nanoparticles (IMPs), which ablate a specific subset of hematogenous monocytes (hMos). We hypothesized that prevention of infiltration of these cells into brain acutely after TBI would attenuate secondary damage and preserve anatomic and neurologic function.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IMPs, composed of US Food and Drug Administration–approved 500nm carboxylated‐poly(lactic‐co‐glycolic) acid, were infused intravenously into wild‐type C57BL/6 mice following 2 different models of experimental TBI, controlled cortical impact (CCI), and closed head injury (CHI).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IMP administration resulted in remarkable preservation of both tissue and neurological function in both CCI and CHI TBI models in mice. After acute treatment, there was a reduction in the number of immune cells infiltrating into the brain, mitigation of the inflammatory status of the infiltrating cells, improved electrophysiologic visual function, improved long‐term motor behavior, reduced edema formation as assessed by magnetic resonance imaging, and reduced lesion volumes on anatomic examination.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our findings suggest that IMPs are a clinically translatable acute intervention for TBI with a well‐defined mechanism of action and beneficial anatomic and physiologic preservation and recovery. ANN NEUROL 2020&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To investigate β‐amyloid and tau depositions using Pittsburgh compound B (PiB) positron emission tomography (PET) and AV1451 tau PET imaging in aging multiple sclerosis (MS) patients.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patients with MS (n = 16) and controls (n = 80) matched for age, sex, and &lt;i&gt;APOE&lt;/i&gt; ε4 status from the population‐based Mayo Clinic Study of Aging who underwent PiB PET imaging were studied. Of these individuals, 12 patients with MS and 60 matching controls also underwent AV1451 tau PET. Cortical PiB and AV1451 standard uptake value ratios (SUVrs) from the entire cortex and previously determined Alzheimer disease (AD) signature regions in the same population were calculated for group comparisons and testing for associations with age.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AD signature PiB SUVr (odds ratio [OR] [95% confidence interval (CI)] = 0.52 [0.27–0.98], &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.044), total cortical PiB SUVr (OR [95% CI] = 0.52 [0.28–0.99], &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.048), and the frequency of abnormal PiB SUVrs (OR [95% CI] = 0.10 [0.01–0.90], &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.040) were lower in MS than controls. Although AD‐signature and total cortical AV1451 SUVrs were not different between the groups, the frequency of abnormal AV1451 SUVrs was higher (OR [95% CI] = 10.65 [1.10–103.35], &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.041) in MS than controls. The association of AD signature PiB SUVr with age was steeper in the controls compared to patients with MS (estimate [95% CI] = −0.14 [−0.023 to −0.006], &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.002). Similarly, the association of total cortical PiB SUVr with age was steeper in the controls compared to patients with MS (estimate [95% CI] = −0.13 [−0.021 to −0.005], &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.002). There was no difference in the association of AV1451 SUVr findings with age between the MS patients and controls.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although both β‐amyloid and tau are biomarkers of cognitive aging and AD, cortical β‐amyloid deposition was lower in MS than age‐matched controls, suggesting that some aspect of MS pathobiology retards the accumulation of β‐amyloid but not the accumulation of tau.

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.01456</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Quality assessment of diffusion MRI (dMRI) data is essential prior to any analysis, so that appropriate pre-processing can be used to improve data quality and ensure that the presence of MRI artifacts do not affect the results of subsequent image analysis. Manual quality assessment of the data is subjective, possibly error-prone, and infeasible, especially considering the growing number of consortium-like studies, underlining the need for automation of the process. In this paper, we have developed a deep-learning-based automated quality control (QC) tool, QC-Automator, for dMRI data, that can handle a variety of artifacts such as motion, multiband interleaving, ghosting, susceptibility, herringbone, and chemical shifts. QC-Automator uses convolutional neural networks along with transfer learning to train the automated artifact detection on a labeled dataset of ∼332,000 slices of dMRI data, from 155 unique subjects and 5 scanners with different dMRI acquisitions, achieving a 98% accuracy in detecting artifacts. The method is fast and paves the way for efficient and effective artifact detection in large datasets. It is also demonstrated to be replicable on other datasets with different acquisition parameters.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.01452</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The neurovascular unit (NVU) is a relatively recent concept in neuroscience that broadly describes the relationship between brain cells and their blood vessels. The NVU incorporates cellular and extracellular components involved in regulating cerebral blood flow and blood–brain barrier function. The NVU within the adult brain has attracted strong research interest and its structure and function is well described, however, the NVU in the developing brain over the fetal and neonatal period remains much less well known. One area of particular interest in perinatal brain development is the impact of known neuropathological insults on the NVU. The aim of this review is to synthesize existing literature to describe structure and function of the NVU in the developing brain, with a particular emphasis on exploring the effects of perinatal insults. Accordingly, a brief overview of NVU components and function is provided, before discussion of NVU development and how this may be affected by perinatal pathologies. We have focused this discussion around three common perinatal insults: prematurity, acute hypoxia, and chronic hypoxia. A greater understanding of processes affecting the NVU in the perinatal period may enable application of targeted therapies, as well as providing a useful basis for research as it expands further into this area.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Unfortunately, the diffusible nature of these ions renders them difficult to study with traditional microscopy in situ within ex vivo brain tissue sections. This mini-review examines the recent progress in the field, using direct elemental mapping techniques to study ion homeostasis during normal brain physiology and pathophysiology, through measurement of ion distribution and concentration in ex vivo brain tissue sections. The mini-review examines the advantages and limitations of specific techniques: proton induced X-ray emission (PIXE), X-ray fluorescence microscopy (XFM), secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS), laser-ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS), and the sample preparation requirements to study diffusible ions with these methods.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fninf.2019.00078</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Animal whole-brain functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) provides a non-invasive window into brain activity. A collection of associated methods aims to replicate observations made in humans and to identify the mechanisms underlying the distributed neuronal activity in the healthy and disordered brain. Animal fMRI studies have developed rapidly over the past years, fueled by the development of resting-state fMRI connectivity and genetically encoded neuromodulatory tools. Yet, comparisons between sites remain hampered by lack of standardization. Recently, we highlighted that mouse resting-state functional connectivity converges across centers, although large discrepancies in sensitivity and specificity remained. Here, we explore past and present trends within the animal fMRI community and highlight critical aspects in study design, data acquisition, and post-processing operations, that may affect the results and influence the comparability between studies. We also suggest practices aimed to promote the adoption of standards within the community and improve between-lab reproducibility. The implementation of standardized animal neuroimaging protocols will facilitate animal population imaging efforts as well as meta-analysis and replication studies, the gold standards in evidence-based science.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Spectro-Temporal Processing in a Two-Stream Computational Model of Auditory Cortex</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2019.00095</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Neural processing of sounds in the dorsal and ventral streams of the (human) auditory cortex is optimized for analyzing fine-grained temporal and spectral information, respectively. Here we use a Wilson and Cowan firing-rate modeling framework to simulate spectro-temporal processing of sounds in these auditory streams and to investigate the link between neural population activity and behavioral results of psychoacoustic experiments. The proposed model consisted of two core (A1 and R, representing primary areas) and two belt (Slow and Fast, representing rostral and caudal processing respectively) areas, differing in terms of their spectral and temporal response properties. First, we simulated the responses to amplitude modulated (AM) noise and tones. In agreement with electrophysiological results, we observed an area-dependent transition from a temporal (synchronization) to a rate code when moving from low to high modulation rates. Simulated neural responses in a task of amplitude modulation detection suggested that thresholds derived from population responses in core areas closely resembled those of psychoacoustic experiments in human listeners. For tones, simulated modulation threshold functions were found to be dependent on the carrier frequency. Second, we simulated the responses to complex tones with missing fundamental stimuli and found that synchronization of responses in the Fast area accurately encoded pitch, with the strength of synchronization depending on number and order of harmonic components. Finally, using speech stimuli, we showed that the spectral and temporal structure of the speech was reflected in parallel by the modeled areas. The analyses highlighted that the Slow stream coded with high spectral precision the aspects of the speech signal characterized by slow temporal changes (e.g., prosody), while the Fast stream encoded primarily the faster changes (e.g., phonemes, consonants, temporal pitch). Interestingly, the pitch of a speaker was encoded both spatially (i.e., tonotopically) in Slow area and temporally in Fast area. Overall, performed simulations showed that the model is valuable for generating hypotheses on how the different cortical areas/streams may contribute toward behaviorally relevant aspects of auditory processing. The model can be used in combination with physiological models of neurovascular coupling to generate predictions for human functional MRI experiments.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: A Computational Model of Interactions Between Neuronal and Astrocytic Networks: The Role of Astrocytes in the Stability of the Neuronal Firing Rate</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2019.00092</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Recent research in neuroscience indicates the importance of tripartite synapses and gliotransmission mediated by astrocytes in neuronal system modulation. Although the astrocyte and neuronal network functions are interrelated, they are fundamentally different in their signaling patterns and, possibly, the time scales at which they operate. However, the exact nature of gliotransmission and the effect of the tripartite synapse function at the network level are currently elusive. In this paper, we propose a computational model of interactions between an astrocyte network and a neuron network, starting from tripartite synapses and spanning to a joint network level. Our model focuses on a two-dimensional setup emulating a mixed in vitro neuron-astrocyte cell culture. The model depicts astrocyte-released gliotransmitters exerting opposing effects on the neurons: increasing the release probability of the presynaptic neuron while hyperpolarizing the post-synaptic one at a longer time scale. We simulated the joint networks with various levels of astrocyte contributions and neuronal activity levels. Our results indicate that astrocytes prolong the burst duration of neurons, while restricting hyperactivity. Thus, in our model, the effect of astrocytes is homeostatic; the firing rate of the network stabilizes to an intermediate level independently of neuronal base activity. Our computational model highlights the plausible roles of astrocytes in interconnected astrocytic and neuronal networks. Our simulations support recent findings in neurons and astrocytes in vivo and in vitro suggesting that astrocytic networks provide a modulatory role in the bursting of the neuronal network.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Based on earlier in-vitro and in-silico experiments, we define the conditions necessary in a network with spike-timing dependent plasticity for the organism to go from reactive to proactive behavior. Our results support the existence of specific evolutionary steps and four conditions necessary for embodied neural networks to evolve predictive and inductive abilities from an initial reactive strategy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnana.2019.00103</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Microglia (MG) are the first cells to react to the abnormal incoming signals that follow an injury of sensory nerves and play a critical role in the development and maintenance of neuropathic pain, a common sequel of nerve injuries. Here we present population data on cell number, soma size, and length of processes of MG in the caudal division of the spinal trigeminal nucleus (Sp5C) in control mice and at the peak of microgliosis (7 days) following unilateral transection of the infraorbital nerve (IoN). The study is performed combining several bias- and assumption-free imaging and stereological approaches with different immunolabeling procedures, with the objective of tackling some hard problems that often hinder proper execution of MG morphometric studies. Our approach may easily be applied to low-density MG populations, but also works, with limited biases, in territories where MG cell bodies and processes form dense meshworks. In controls, and contralaterally to the deafferented side, MG cell body size and shape and branching pattern matched well the descriptions of “resting” or “surveillant” MG described elsewhere, with only moderate intersubject variability. On the superficial laminae of the deafferented side, however, MG displayed on average larger somata and remarkable diversity in shape. The number of cells and the length of MG processes per mm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; increased 5 and 2.5 times, respectively, indicating a net 50% decrease in the mean length of processes per cell. By using specific immunolabeling and cell sorting of vascular macrophages, we found only a negligible fraction of these cells in Sp5C, with no differences between controls and deafferented animals, suggesting that blood-borne monocytes play at most a very limited role in the microgliosis occurring following sensory nerve deafferentation. In sum, here we present reliable morphometric data on MG in control and deafferented trigeminal nuclei using efficient methods that we propose may equally be applied to any morphometric population analysis of these cells under different physiological or pathological conditions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

This relationship between the gut microbiota and the brain is pivotal for the development of the newborn, which receives its commensal microbiota at birth; dysbiosis may result in altered neurodevelopment. The hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) axis is actively involved in the stress response but is undeveloped in the newborn. Here, we describe how changes in the commensal microbiota influence the normal development of the HPA axis and review recent findings describing the essential crosstalk between the gut microbiota and the HPA axis and suggesting a role for the maternal and commensal microbiota in the development of the HPA axis and of the stress response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience | Neural Technology section | New and Recent Articles: The Brand Scandal Spillover Effect at the Country Level: Evidence From Event-Related Potentials</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2019.01426</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The spillover effect of brand scandals commonly exists, and this effect will damage the image of the company, industry or even country in which the scandal occurred. Most previous studies on the brand scandal spillover effect have mainly focused on the corporate and industry levels. However, with the development of brand internalization and media technology, the spillover effect at the country level is becoming increasingly common. In the current study, we conducted an event-related potentials study to explore the spillover effect of brand scandals on the country level as well as its underlying neural basis. Specifically, we compared consumers’ attitudes toward countries of origin with different stereotypes during different types of brand scandals. When a competence scandal took place in a competence stereotype country, a larger P2 mean amplitude was elicited compared to a warmth stereotype country. When a morality scandal took place in a warmth stereotype country, a larger LPP mean amplitude was induced compared to a competence stereotype country. We explain the current results based on expectancy violations theory. When competence scandals take place in competence stereotype countries, there will be a greater degree of violation of expectations compared with that in warmth stereotype countries, which leads to a negative evaluation of the country of origin. When morality scandals take place in warmth stereotype countries, people had a stronger negative emotional arousal when morality scandals happened in the warmth stereotype country.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: The Musical Structure of Time in the Brain: Repetition, Rhythm, and Harmony in fMRI During Rest and Passive Movie Viewing</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2019.00098</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Space generally overshadows time in the construction of theories in cognitive neuroscience. In this paper, we pivot from the spatial axes to the temporal, analyzing fMRI image series to reveal structures in time rather than space. To determine affinities among global brain patterns at different times, core concepts in network analysis (derived from graph theory) were applied temporally, as relations among brain images at every time point during an fMRI scanning epoch. To explore the temporal structures observed through this adaptation of network analysis, data from 180 subjects in the Human Connectome Project were examined, during two experimental conditions: passive movie viewing and rest. The temporal brain, like the spatial brain, exhibits a modular structure, where “modules” are intermittent (distributed in time). These temporal entities are here referred to as themes. Short sequences of themes – motifs – were studied in sequences from 4 to 11 s in length. Many motifs repeated at constant intervals, and are therefore rhythmic; rhythms, converted to frequencies, were often harmonic. We speculate that the structure and interaction of these global oscillations underwrites the capacity to experience and navigate a world which is both recognizably stable and noticeably changing at every moment – a temporal world. In its temporal structure, this brain-constituted world resembles music.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2019.00087</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Brain computer interfaces (BCI) for the rehabilitation of motor impairments exploit sensorimotor rhythms (SMR) in the electroencephalogram (EEG). However, the neurophysiological processes underpinning the SMR often vary over time and across subjects. Inherent intra- and inter-subject variability causes covariate shift in data distributions that impede the transferability of model parameters amongst sessions/subjects. Transfer learning includes machine learning-based methods to compensate for inter-subject and inter-session (intra-subject) variability manifested in EEG-derived feature distributions as a covariate shift for BCI. Besides transfer learning approaches, recent studies have explored psychological and neurophysiological predictors as well as inter-subject associativity assessment, which may augment transfer learning in EEG-based BCI. Here, we highlight the importance of measuring inter-session/subject performance predictors for generalized BCI frameworks for both normal and motor-impaired people, reducing the necessity for tedious and annoying calibration sessions and BCI training.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Comparing Cyclicity Analysis With Pre-established Functional Connectivity Methods to Identify Individuals and Subject Groups Using Resting State fMRI</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2019.00094</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The resting state fMRI time series appears to have cyclic patterns, which indicates presence of cyclic interactions between different brain regions. Such interactions are not easily captured by pre-established resting state functional connectivity methods including zero-lag correlation, lagged correlation, and dynamic time warping distance. These methods formulate the functional interaction between different brain regions as similar temporal patterns within the time series. To use information related to temporal ordering, cyclicity analysis has been introduced to capture pairwise interactions between multiple time series. In this study, we compared the efficacy of cyclicity analysis with aforementioned similarity-based techniques in representing individual-level and group-level information. Additionally, we investigated how filtering and global signal regression interacted with these techniques. We obtained and analyzed fMRI data from patients with tinnitus and neurotypical controls at two different days, a week apart. For both patient and control groups, we found that the features generated by cyclicity and correlation (zero-lag and lagged) analyses were more reliable than the features generated by dynamic time warping distance in identifying individuals across visits. The reliability of all features, except those generated by dynamic time warping, improved as the global signal was regressed. Nevertheless, removing fluctuations &amp;gt;0.1 Hz deteriorated the reliability of all features. These observations underscore the importance of choosing appropriate preprocessing steps while evaluating different analytical methods in describing resting state functional interactivity. Further, using different machine learning techniques including support vector machines, discriminant analyses, and convolutional neural networks, our results revealed that the manifestation of the group-level information within all features was not sufficient enough to dissociate tinnitus patients from controls with high sensitivity and specificity. This necessitates further investigation regarding the representation of group-level information within different features to better identify tinnitus-related alternation in the functional organization of the brain. Our study adds to the growing body of research on developing diagnostic tools to identify neurological disorders, such as tinnitus, using resting state fMRI data.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Role of Propriospinal Neurons in Control of Respiratory Muscles and Recovery of Breathing Following Injury</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2019.00084</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Respiratory motor failure is the leading cause of death in spinal cord injury (SCI). Cervical injuries disrupt connections between brainstem neurons that are the primary source of excitatory drive to respiratory motor neurons in the spinal cord and their targets. In addition to direct connections from bulbospinal neurons, respiratory motor neurons also receive excitatory and inhibitory inputs from propriospinal neurons, yet their role in the control of breathing is often overlooked. In this review, we will present evidence that propriospinal neurons play important roles in patterning muscle activity for breathing. These roles likely include shaping the pattern of respiratory motor output, processing and transmitting sensory afferent information, coordinating ventilation with motor activity, and regulating accessory and respiratory muscle activity. In addition, we discuss recent studies that have highlighted the importance of propriospinal neurons for recovery of respiratory muscle function following SCI. We propose that molecular genetic approaches to target specific developmental neuron classes in the spinal cord would help investigators resolve the many roles of propriospinal neurons in the control of breathing. A better understanding of how spinal circuits pattern breathing could lead to new treatments to improve breathing following injury or disease.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Integrative Neuroscience | New and Recent Articles: Feedback Modulates Audio-Visual Spatial Recalibration</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnint.2019.00074</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In an ever-changing environment, crossmodal recalibration is crucial to maintain precise and coherent spatial estimates across different sensory modalities. Accordingly, it has been found that perceived auditory space is recalibrated toward vision after consistent exposure to spatially misaligned audio-visual stimuli (VS). While this so-called ventriloquism aftereffect (VAE) yields internal consistency between vision and audition, it does not necessarily lead to consistency between the perceptual representation of space and the actual environment. For this purpose, feedback about the true state of the external world might be necessary. Here, we tested whether the size of the VAE is modulated by external feedback and reward. During adaptation audio-VS with a fixed spatial discrepancy were presented. Participants had to localize the sound and received feedback about the magnitude of their localization error. In half of the sessions the feedback was based on the position of the VS and in the other half it was based on the position of the auditory stimulus. An additional monetary reward was given if the localization error fell below a certain threshold that was based on participants’ performance in the pretest. As expected, when error feedback was based on the position of the VS, auditory localization during adaptation trials shifted toward the position of the VS. Conversely, feedback based on the position of the auditory stimuli reduced the visual influence on auditory localization (i.e., the ventriloquism effect) and improved sound localization accuracy. After adaptation with error feedback based on the VS position, a typical auditory VAE (but no visual aftereffect) was observed in subsequent unimodal localization tests. By contrast, when feedback was based on the position of the auditory stimuli during adaptation, no auditory VAE was observed in subsequent unimodal auditory trials. Importantly, in this situation no visual aftereffect was found either. As feedback did not change the physical attributes of the audio-visual stimulation during adaptation, the present findings suggest that crossmodal recalibration is subject to top–down influences. Such top–down influences might help prevent miscalibration of audition toward conflicting visual stimulation in situations in which external feedback indicates that visual information is inaccurate.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Transcranial direct and alternating current stimulation (tDCS and tACS, respectively) entail capability to modulate human brain dynamics and cognition. However, the comparability of these approaches at the level of large-scale functional networks has not been thoroughly investigated. In this study, 44 subjects were randomly assigned to receive sham (N = 15), tDCS (N = 15), or tACS (N = 14). The first electrode (anode in tDCS) was positioned over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, the target area, and the second electrode (cathode in tDCS) was placed over the right supraorbital region. tDCS was delivered with a constant current of 2 mA. tACS was fixed to 2 mA peak-to-peak with 6 Hz frequency. Stimulation was applied concurrently with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) acquisitions, both at rest and during the performance of a verbal working memory (WM) task. After stimulation, subjects repeated the fMRI WM task. Our results indicated that at rest, tDCS increased functional connectivity particularly within the default-mode network (DMN), while tACS decreased it. When comparing both fMRI WM tasks, it was observed that tDCS displayed decreased brain activity post-stimulation as compared to online. Conversely, tACS effects were driven by neural increases online as compared to post-stimulation. Interestingly, both effects primarily occurred within DMN-related areas. Regarding the differences in each fMRI WM task, during the online fMRI WM task, tACS engaged distributed neural resources which did not overlap with the WM-dependent activity pattern, but with some posterior DMN regions. In contrast, during the post-stimulation fMRI WM task, tDCS strengthened prefrontal DMN deactivations, being these activity reductions associated with faster responses. Furthermore, it was observed that tDCS neural responses presented certain consistency across distinct fMRI modalities, while tACS did not. In sum, tDCS and tACS modulate fMRI-derived network dynamics differently. However, both effects seem to focus on DMN regions and the WM network-DMN shift, which are highly affected in aging and disease. Thus, albeit exploratory and needing further replication with larger samples, our results might provide a refined understanding of how the DMN functioning can be externally modulated through commonly used non-invasive brain stimulation techniques, which may be of eventual clinical relevance.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>
