	<title>arXiv: Quantitative Biology: Neurons and Cognition: Hippocampal Spatial Mapping As Fast Graph Learning. (arXiv:2107.00567v1 [cs.AI])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.00567</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The hippocampal formation is thought to learn spatial maps of environments,
and in many models this learning process consists of forming a sensory
association for each location in the environment. This is inefficient, akin to
learning a large lookup table for each environment. Spatial maps can be learned
much more efficiently if the maps instead consist of arrangements of sparse
environment parts. In this work, I approach spatial mapping as a problem of
learning graphs of environment parts. Each node in the learned graph,
represented by hippocampal engram cells, is associated with feature information
in lateral entorhinal cortex (LEC) and location information in medial
entorhinal cortex (MEC) using empirically observed neuron types. Each edge in
the graph represents the relation between two parts, and it is associated with
coarse displacement information. This core idea of associating arbitrary
information with nodes and edges is not inherently spatial, so this proposed
fast-relation-graph-learning algorithm can expand to incorporate many spatial
and non-spatial tasks.

	<title>arXiv: Computer Science: Neural and Evolutionary Computing: CarSNN: An Efficient Spiking Neural Network for Event-Based Autonomous Cars on the Loihi Neuromorphic Research Processor. (arXiv:2107.00401v1 [cs.NE])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.00401</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Autonomous Driving (AD) related features provide new forms of mobility that
are also beneficial for other kind of intelligent and autonomous systems like
robots, smart transportation, and smart industries. For these applications, the
decisions need to be made fast and in real-time. Moreover, in the quest for
electric mobility, this task must follow low power policy, without affecting
much the autonomy of the mean of transport or the robot. These two challenges
can be tackled using the emerging Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs). When deployed
on a specialized neuromorphic hardware, SNNs can achieve high performance with
low latency and low power consumption. In this paper, we use an SNN connected
to an event-based camera for facing one of the key problems for AD, i.e., the
classification between cars and other objects. To consume less power than
traditional frame-based cameras, we use a Dynamic Vision Sensor (DVS). The
experiments are made following an offline supervised learning rule, followed by
mapping the learnt SNN model on the Intel Loihi Neuromorphic Research Chip. Our
best experiment achieves an accuracy on offline implementation of 86%, that
drops to 83% when it is ported onto the Loihi Chip. The Neuromorphic Hardware
implementation has maximum 0.72 ms of latency for every sample, and consumes
only 310 mW. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first
implementation of an event-based car classifier on a Neuromorphic Chip.

	<title>arXiv: Computer Science: Neural and Evolutionary Computing: Learning-based pose edition for efficient and interactive design. (arXiv:2107.00397v1 [cs.GR])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.00397</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Authoring an appealing animation for a virtual character is a challenging
task. In computer-aided keyframe animation artists define the key poses of a
character by manipulating its underlying skeletons. To look plausible, a
character pose must respect many ill-defined constraints, and so the resulting
realism greatly depends on the animator's skill and knowledge. Animation
software provide tools to help in this matter, relying on various algorithms to
automatically enforce some of these constraints. The increasing availability of
motion capture data has raised interest in data-driven approaches to pose
design, with the potential of shifting more of the task of assessing realism
from the artist to the computer, and to provide easier access to nonexperts. In
this article, we propose such a method, relying on neural networks to
automatically learn the constraints from the data. We describe an efficient
tool for pose design, allowing na{\&quot;i}ve users to intuitively manipulate a pose
to create character animations.

of the Radio Sky at Twenty Centimeters (FIRST) to classify radio galaxies into
four classes: Fanaroff-Riley Class I (FRI), Fanaroff-Riley Class II (FRII),
Bent-Tailed (BENT), and Compact (COMPT). The model presented in this work is
based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The proposed architecture
comprises three parallel blocks of convolutional layers combined and processed
for final classification by two feed-forward layers. Our model classified
selected classes of radio galaxy sources on an independent testing subset with
an average of 96\% for precision, recall, and F1 score. The best selected
augmentation techniques were rotations, horizontal or vertical flips, and
increase of brightness. Shifts, zoom and decrease of brightness worsened the
performance of the model. The current results show that model developed in this
work is able to identify different morphological classes of radio galaxies with
a high efficiency and performance

	<title>arXiv: Computer Science: Neural and Evolutionary Computing: Circuit Complexity of Visual Search. (arXiv:2107.00223v1 [cs.CC])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.00223</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;We study computational hardness of feature and conjunction search through the
lens of circuit complexity. Let $x = (x_1, ... , x_n)$ (resp., $y = (y_1, ... ,
y_n)$) be Boolean variables each of which takes the value one if and only if a
neuron at place $i$ detects a feature (resp., another feature). We then simply
formulate the feature and conjunction search as Boolean functions ${\rm
FTR}_n(x) = \bigvee_{i=1}^n x_i$ and ${\rm CONJ}_n(x, y) = \bigvee_{i=1}^n x_i
\wedge y_i$, respectively. We employ a threshold circuit or a discretized
circuit (such as a sigmoid circuit or a ReLU circuit with discretization) as
our models of neural networks, and consider the following four computational
resources: [i] the number of neurons (size), [ii] the number of levels (depth),
[iii] the number of active neurons outputting non-zero values (energy), and
[iv] synaptic weight resolution (weight).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We first prove that any threshold circuit $C$ of size $s$, depth $d$, energy
$e$ and weight $w$ satisfies $\log rk(M_C) \le ed (\log s + \log w + \log n)$,
where $rk(M_C)$ is the rank of the communication matrix $M_C$ of a
$2n$-variable Boolean function that $C$ computes. Since ${\rm CONJ}_n$ has rank
$2^n$, we have $n \le ed (\log s + \log w + \log n)$. Thus, an exponential
lower bound on the size of even sublinear-depth threshold circuits exists if
the energy and weight are sufficiently small. Since ${\rm FTR}_n$ is computable
independently of $n$, our result suggests that computational capacity for the
feature and conjunction search are different. We also show that the inequality
is tight up to a constant factor if $ed = o(n/ \log n)$. We next show that a
similar inequality holds for any discretized circuit. Thus, if we regard the
number of gates outputting non-zero values as a measure for sparse activity,
our results suggest that larger depth helps neural networks to acquire sparse
activity.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1911.02728</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;There has been huge interest in studying human brain connectomes inferred
from different imaging modalities and exploring their relationship with human
traits, such as cognition. Brain connectomes are usually represented as
networks, with nodes corresponding to different regions of interest (ROIs) and
edges to connection strengths between ROIs. Due to the high-dimensionality and
non-Euclidean nature of networks, it is challenging to depict their population
distribution and relate them to human traits. Current approaches focus on
summarizing the network using either pre-specified topological features or
principal components analysis (PCA). In this paper, building on recent advances
in deep learning, we develop a nonlinear latent factor model to characterize
the population distribution of brain graphs and infer the relationships between
brain structural connectomes and human traits. We refer to our method as Graph
AuTo-Encoding (GATE). We applied GATE to two large-scale brain imaging
datasets, the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study and the Human
Connectome Project (HCP) for adults, to understand the structural brain
connectome and its relationship with cognition. Numerical results demonstrate
huge advantages of GATE over competitors in terms of prediction accuracy,
statistical inference and computing efficiency. We found that structural
connectomes have a stronger association with a wide range of human cognitive
traits than was apparent using previous approaches.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Sampling the live brain is difficult and dangerous, and withdrawing cerebrospinal fluid is uncomfortable and frightening to the subject, so new sources of real-time analysis are constantly sought. Cell-free DNA (cfDNA) derived from glia and neurons offers the potential for wide-ranging neurological disease diagnosis and monitoring. However, new laboratory and bioinformatic strategies are needed. DNA methylation patterns on individual cfDNA fragments can be used to ascribe their cell-of-origin. Here we describe bisulfite sequencing assays and bioinformatic processing methods to identify cfDNA derived from glia and neurons. In proof-of-concept experiments, we describe the presence of both glia- and neuron-cfDNA in the blood plasma of human subjects following mild trauma. This detection of glia- and neuron-cfDNA represents a significant step forward in the translation of liquid biopsies for neurological diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The incretin hormone glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) has neuroprotective effects in animal models of Parkinson’s disease (PD), and GLP-1 receptor agonists are associated with clinical improvements in human PD patients. GLP-1 is produced and secreted by intestinal L-cells in response to consumption of a meal. Specifically, intestinal microbiota produce short chain fatty acids (SCFA) which, in turn, promote secretion of GLP-1 into the systemic circulation, from which it can enter the brain. Our group and others have reported that PD patients have an altered intestinal microbial community that produces less SCFA compared to age-matched controls. In this report, we demonstrate that PD patients have diminished GLP-1 secretion in response to a meal compared to their household controls. Peak postprandial GLP-1 levels did not correlate with PD disease severity, motor function, or disease duration. These data provide the scientific rationale for future studies designed to elucidate the role of GLP-1 in the pathogenesis of PD and test the potential utility of GLP-1-directed therapies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Purpose: Since their first generation in 2013, the use of cerebral organoids has spread exponentially. Today, the amount of generated data is becoming challenging to analyze manually. This review aims to overview the current image acquisition methods and to subsequently identify the needs in image analysis tools for cerebral organoids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: To address this question, we went through all recent articles published on the subject and annotated the protocols, acquisition methods, and algorithms used.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Over the investigated period of time, confocal microscopy and bright-field microscopy were the most used acquisition techniques. Cell counting, the most common task, is performed in 20% of the articles and area; around 12% of articles calculate morphological parameters. Image analysis on cerebral organoids is performed in majority using ImageJ software (around 52%) and Matlab language (4%). Treatments remain mostly semi-automatic. We highlight the limitations encountered in image analysis in the cerebral organoid field and suggest possible solutions and implementations to develop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: In addition to providing an overview of cerebral organoids cultures and imaging, this work highlights the need to improve the existing image analysis methods for such images and the need for specific analysis tools. These solutions could specifically help to monitor the growth of future standardized cerebral organoids.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Major WM pathways were reconstructed. No significant group-level change in WM tract microstructure following an AE training was observed. Without adjustment for multiple comparisons, an increase in fractional anisotropy (FA) and a decrease in mean diffusivity (MD) of the uncinate fasciculus were observed post-intervention in the AE group in comparison with the stretching group. In the AE group, a significant increase in cardiorespiratory fitness was measured but did not correlate with FA and MD change. The present results of this study are in accordance with similar studies in healthy adults that did not show significant benefit on WMM after participating in an AE program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clinical Trial Registration:Clinicaltrials.gov identifier, NCT01179958.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Presurgical Evaluation of Epilepsy Using Resting-State MEG Functional Connectivity</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.649074</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Epilepsy is caused by abnormal electrical discharges (clinically identified by electrophysiological recording) in a specific part of the brain [originating in only one part of the brain, namely, the epileptogenic zone (EZ)]. Epilepsy is now defined as an archetypical hyperexcited neural network disorder. It can be investigated through the network analysis of interictal discharges, ictal discharges, and resting-state functional connectivity. Currently, there is an increasing interest in embedding resting-state connectivity analysis into the preoperative evaluation of epilepsy. Among the various neuroimaging technologies employed to achieve brain functional networks, magnetoencephalography (MEG) with the excellent temporal resolution is an ideal tool for estimating the resting-state connectivity between brain regions, which can reveal network abnormalities in epilepsy. What value does MEG resting-state functional connectivity offer for epileptic presurgical evaluation? Regarding this topic, this paper introduced the origin of MEG and the workflow of constructing source–space functional connectivity based on MEG signals. Resting-state functional connectivity abnormalities correlate with epileptogenic networks, which are defined by the brain regions involved in the production and propagation of epileptic activities. This paper reviewed the evidence of altered epileptic connectivity based on low- or high-frequency oscillations (HFOs) and the evidence of the advantage of using simultaneous MEG and intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) recordings. More importantly, this review highlighted that MEG-based resting-state functional connectivity has the potential to predict postsurgical outcomes. In conclusion, resting-state MEG functional connectivity has made a substantial progress toward serving as a candidate biomarker included in epileptic presurgical evaluations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.691067</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The neuroinflammatory basis of depression encompasses the detrimental role of otherwise supportive non-neuronal cells and neuroinflammation in hampering neuronal function, leading to depressive behavior. Animals subjected to different stress paradigms show glial cell activation and a surge in proinflammatory cytokines in various brain regions. The concept of sterile inflammation observed in animal models of depression has intrigued many researchers to determine the possible triggers of central immune cell activation. Notably, microglial activation and subsequent phenotypic polarization in depression have been strongly advocated by the wealth of recent preclinical studies; however, findings from human studies have shown contradictory results. Despite intensive investigation, many research gaps still exist to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of neuroinflammatory cascades underlying the pathophysiology of depression. In this mini-review, recent progress in understanding neuroinflammatory mechanisms in light of experimental models of depression will be thoroughly discussed. The challenges of mirroring depression in animal and in vitro models will also be highlighted. Furthermore, prospects of targeting neuroinflammation to treat depressive disorder will be covered.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Background and Purpose&lt;p&gt;The effect of antiplatelet therapy (APT) on early postoperative rehemorrhage and outcomes of patients with spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is still unclear. This study is to evaluate the effect of preoperative APT on early postoperative rehemorrhage and outcomes in ICH patients.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;This was a multicenter cohort study. ICH patients undergoing surgery were divided into APT group and no antiplatelet therapy (nAPT) group according to whether patients received APT or not. Chi-square test, t-test, and Mann–Whitney U test were used to compare the differences in variables, postoperative rehematoma, and outcomes between groups. Multivariate logistics regression analysis was used to correct for confounding variables, which were different in group comparison.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;One hundred fifty ICH patients undergoing surgical treatment were consecutively included in this study. Thirty five (23.33%) people were included in the APT group, while 115 (76.67%) people were included in the nAPT group. The incidence of early postoperative rehemorrhage in the APT group was significantly higher than that in the nAPT group (25.7% VS 10.4%, p = 0.047 &amp;lt; 0.05). After adjustment for age, ischemic stroke history, and ventricular hematoma, preoperative APT had no significant effect on early postoperative rehemorrhage (p = 0.067). There was no statistical difference between the two groups in early poorer outcomes (p = 0.222) at 14 days after surgery. After adjustment for age, ischemic stroke history, and ventricular hematoma, preoperative APT also had no significant effect on early poorer modified Rankin Scale (mRS) (p = 0.072).&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, preoperative APT appears to be safe and have no significant effect on early postoperative rehematoma and outcomes in ICH patients.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: PKC Delta Activation Promotes Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress (ERS) and NLR Family Pyrin Domain-Containing 3 (NLRP3) Inflammasome Activation Subsequent to Asynuclein-Induced Microglial Activation: Involvement of Thioredoxin-Interacting Protein (TXNIP)/Thioredoxin (Trx) Redoxisome Pathway</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.661505</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A classical hallmark of Parkinson’s disease (PD) pathogenesis is the accumulation of misfolded alpha-synuclein (αSyn) within Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites, although its role in microglial dysfunction and resultant dopaminergic (DAergic) neurotoxicity is still elusive. Previously, we identified that protein kinase C delta (PKCδ) is activated in post mortem PD brains and experimental Parkinsonism and that it participates in reactive microgliosis; however, the relationship between PKCδ activation, endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS) and the reactive microglial activation state in the context of α-synucleinopathy is largely unknown. Herein, we show that oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, NLR family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome activation, and PKCδ activation increased concomitantly with ERS markers, including the activating transcription factor 4 (ATF-4), serine/threonine-protein kinase/endoribonuclease inositol-requiring enzyme 1α (p-IRE1α), p-eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF2α) as well as increased generation of neurotoxic cytokines, including IL-1β in aggregated αSyn&lt;sub&gt;agg&lt;/sub&gt;-stimulated primary microglia. Importantly, in mouse primary microglia-treated with αSyn&lt;sub&gt;agg&lt;/sub&gt; we observed increased expression of Thioredoxin-interacting protein (TXNIP), an endogenous inhibitor of the thioredoxin (Trx) pathway, a major antioxidant protein system. Additionally, αSyn&lt;sub&gt;agg&lt;/sub&gt; promoted interaction between NLRP3 and TXNIP in these cells. In vitro knockdown of PKCδ using siRNA reduced ERS and led to reduced expression of TXNIP and the NLRP3 activation response in αSyn&lt;sub&gt;agg&lt;/sub&gt;-stimulated mouse microglial cells (MMCs). Additionally, attenuation of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mitoROS) via mito-apocynin and amelioration of ERS via the eIF2α inhibitor salubrinal (SAL) reduced the induction of the ERS/TXNIP/NLRP3 signaling axis, suggesting that mitochondrial dysfunction and ERS may act in concert to promote the αSyn&lt;sub&gt;agg&lt;/sub&gt;-induced microglial activation response. Likewise, knockdown of TXNIP by siRNA attenuated the αSyn&lt;sub&gt;agg&lt;/sub&gt;-induced NLRP3 inflammasome activation response. Finally, unilateral injection of αSyn preformed fibrils (αSyn&lt;sub&gt;PFF&lt;/sub&gt;) into the striatum of wild-type mice induced a significant increase in the expression of nigral p-PKCδ, ERS markers, and upregulation of the TXNIP/NLRP3 inflammasome signaling axis prior to delayed loss of TH&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; neurons. Together, our results suggest that inhibition of ERS and its downstream signaling mediators TXNIP and NLRP3 might represent novel therapeutic avenues for ameliorating microglia-mediated neuroinflammation in PD and other synucleinopathies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder. AD is characterized by the production and aggregation of beta-amyloid (Aβ) peptides, hyperphosphorylated tau proteins that form neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), and subsequent neuroinflammation, synaptic dysfunction, autophagy and oxidative stress. Non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) can be used as potential therapeutic targets and biomarkers due to their vital regulatory roles in multiple biological processes involved in disease development. The involvement of ncRNAs in the pathogenesis of AD has been increasingly recognized. Here, we review the ncRNAs implicated in AD and elaborate on their main regulatory pathways, which might have contributions for discovering novel therapeutic targets and drugs for AD.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: A deep learning algorithm to translate and classify cardiac electrophysiology</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/68335</link>
	<content:encoded>The development of induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (iPSC-CMs) has been a critical in vitro advance in the study of patient-specific physiology, pathophysiology and pharmacology. We designed a new deep learning multitask network approach intended to address the low throughput, high variability and immature phenotype of the iPSC-CM platform. The rationale for combining translation and classification tasks is because the most likely application of the deep learning technology we describe here is to translate iPSC-CMs following application of a perturbation. The deep learning network was trained using simulated action potential (AP) data and applied to classify cells into the drug-free and drugged categories and to predict the impact of electrophysiological perturbation across the continuum of aging from the immature iPSC-CMs to the adult ventricular myocytes. The phase of the AP extremely sensitive to perturbation due to a steep rise of the membrane resistance was found to contain the key information required for successful network multitasking. We also demonstrated successful translation of both experimental and simulated iPSC-CM AP data validating our network by prediction of experimental drug-induced effects on adult cardiomyocyte APs by the latter.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: Pak1 and PP2A antagonize aPKC function to support cortical tension induced by the Crumbs-Yurt complex</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/67999</link>
	<content:encoded>The &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; polarity protein Crumbs is essential for the establishment and growth of the apical domain in epithelial cells. The protein Yurt limits the ability of Crumbs to promote apical membrane growth, thereby defining proper apical/lateral membrane ratio that is crucial for forming and maintaining complex epithelial structures such as tubes or acini. Here, we show that Yurt also increases Myosin-dependent cortical tension downstream of Crumbs. Yurt overexpression thus induces apical constriction in epithelial cells. The kinase aPKC phosphorylates Yurt, thereby dislodging the latter from the apical domain and releasing apical tension. In contrast, the kinase Pak1 promotes Yurt dephosphorylation through activation of the phosphatase PP2A. The Pak1-PP2A module thus opposes aPKC function and supports Yurt-induced apical constriction. Hence, the complex interplay between Yurt, aPKC, Pak1 and PP2A contributes to the functional plasticity of Crumbs. Overall, our data increase our understanding of how proteins sustaining epithelial cell polarization and Myosin-dependent cell contractility interact with one another to control epithelial tissue architecture.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: Two de novo GluN2B mutations affect multiple NMDAR-functions and instigate severe pediatric encephalopathy</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/67555</link>
	<content:encoded>The N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs; GluNRS) are glutamate receptors, commonly located at excitatory synapses. Mutations affecting receptor function often lead to devastating neurodevelopmental disorders. We have identified two toddlers with different heterozygous missense mutations of the same, and highly conserved, glycine residue located in the ligand-binding-domain of &lt;i&gt;GRIN2B&lt;/i&gt;: G689C and G689S. Structure simulations suggest severely impaired glutamate binding which we confirm by functional analysis. Both variants show three-orders of magnitude reductions in glutamate EC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;, with G689S exhibiting the largest reductions observed in &lt;i&gt;GRIN2B&lt;/i&gt; (~2000-fold). Moreover, variants multimerize with, and upregulate, GluN2B&lt;i&gt;wt&lt;/i&gt;-subunits, thus engendering a strong dominant-negative effect on mixed channels. In neurons, overexpression of the variants instigates suppression of synaptic GluNRs. Lastly, while exploring spermine potentiation as a potential treatment, we discovered that the variants fail to respond due to G689's novel role in proton-sensing. Together, we describe two unique variants with extreme effects on channel function. We employ protein-stability measures to explain why current (and future) LBD mutations in GluN2B primarily instigate Loss-of-Function.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: A novel mechanosensitive channel controls osmoregulation, differentiation and infectivity in Trypanosoma cruzi</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/67449</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;i&gt;Trypanosoma cruzi&lt;/i&gt;, the causative agent of Chagas disease, undergoes drastic morphological and biochemical modifications as it passes between hosts and transitions from extracellular to intracellular stages. The osmotic and mechanical aspects of these cellular transformations are not understood. Here we identify and characterize a novel mechanosensitive channel in T. &lt;i&gt;cruzi&lt;/i&gt; (TcMscS) belonging to the superfamily of small conductance mechanosensitive channels (MscS). TcMscS is activated by membrane tension and forms a large pore permeable to anions, cations, and small osmolytes. The channel changes its location from the contractile vacuole complex in epimastigotes to the plasma membrane as the parasites develop into intracellular amastigotes. TcMscS knockout parasites show significant fitness defects, including increased cell volume, calcium dysregulation, impaired differentiation, and a dramatic decrease in infectivity. Our work provides mechanistic insights into components supporting pathogen adaptation inside the host thus opening the exploration of mechanosensation as a prerequisite of protozoan infectivity.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: The molecular basis of coupling between poly(A)-tail length and translational efficiency</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/66493</link>
	<content:encoded>In animal oocytes and early embryos, mRNA poly(A)-tail length strongly influences translational efficiency (TE), but later in development this coupling between tail length and TE disappears. Here, we elucidate how this coupling is first established and why it disappears. Overexpressing cytoplasmic poly(A)-binding protein (PABPC) in &lt;i&gt;Xenopus&lt;/i&gt; oocytes specifically improved translation of short-tailed mRNAs, thereby diminishing coupling between tail length and TE. Thus, strong coupling requires limiting PABPC, implying that in coupled systems longer-tail mRNAs better compete for limiting PABPC. In addition to expressing excess PABPC, post-embryonic mammalian cell lines had two other properties that prevented strong coupling: terminal-uridylation-dependent destabilization of mRNAs lacking bound PABPC, and a regulatory regime wherein PABPC contributes minimally to TE. Thus, these results revealed three fundamental mechanistic requirements for coupling and defined the context-dependent functions for PABPC, which promotes TE but not mRNA stability in coupled systems and mRNA stability but not TE in uncoupled systems.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/64951</link>
	<content:encoded>Cell cycle duration changes dramatically during development, starting out fast to generate cells quickly and slowing down over time as the organism matures. The cell cycle can also act as a transcriptional filter to control the expression of long gene transcripts which are partially transcribed in short cycles. Using mathematical simulations of cell proliferation, we identify an emergent property, that this filter can act as a tuning knob to control gene transcript expression, cell diversity and the number and proportion of different cell types in a tissue. Our predictions are supported by comparison to single-cell RNA-seq data captured over embryonic development. Additionally, evolutionary genome analysis shows that fast developing organisms have a narrow genomic distribution of gene lengths while slower developers have an expanded number of long genes. Our results support the idea that cell cycle dynamics may be important across multicellular animals for controlling gene transcript expression and cell fate.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: Crash landing of Vibrio cholerae by MSHA pili-assisted braking and anchoring in a viscoelastic environment</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/60655</link>
	<content:encoded>Mannose-sensitive hemagglutinin (MSHA) pili and flagellum are critical for the surface attachment of &lt;i&gt;Vibrio cholerae&lt;/i&gt;, the first step of &lt;i&gt;V. cholerae&lt;/i&gt; colonization on host surfaces. However, the cell landing mechanism remains largely unknown, particularly in viscoelastic environments such as the mucus layers of intestines. Here, combining the cysteine-substitution-based labelling method with single-cell tracking techniques, we quantitatively characterized the landing of &lt;i&gt;V. cholerae &lt;/i&gt;by directly observing both pili and flagellum of cells in a viscoelastic non-Newtonian solution consisting of 2% Luria-Bertani and 1% methylcellulose (LB+MC). The results show that MSHA pili are evenly distributed along the cell length and can stick to surfaces at any point along the filament. With such properties, MSHA pili are observed to act as a brake and anchor during cell landing which include three phases: running, lingering, and attaching. Importantly, loss of MSHA pili results in a more dramatic increase in mean path length in LB+MC than in 2% LB only or in 20% Ficoll solutions, indicating that the role of MSHA pili during cell landing is more apparent in viscoelastic non-Newtonian fluids than viscous Newtonian ones. Our work provides a detailed picture of the landing dynamics of &lt;i&gt;V. cholerae&lt;/i&gt; under viscoelastic conditions, which can provide insights into ways to better control &lt;i&gt;V. cholerae&lt;/i&gt; infections in real mucus-like environment.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/59341</link>
	<content:encoded>Neural control of muscle function is fundamental to animal behavior. Many muscles can generate multiple distinct behaviors. Nonetheless, individual muscle cells are generally regarded as the smallest units of motor control. We report that muscle cells can alter behavior by contracting subcellularly. We previously discovered that noxious tastes reverse the net flow of particles through the &lt;i&gt;C. elegans&lt;/i&gt; pharynx, a neuromuscular pump, resulting in spitting. We now show that spitting results from the subcellular contraction of the anterior region of the pm3 muscle cell. Subcellularly localized calcium increases accompany this contraction. Spitting is controlled by an 'hourglass' circuit motif: parallel neural pathways converge onto a single motor neuron that differentially controls multiple muscles and the critical subcellular muscle compartment. We conclude that subcellular muscle units enable modulatory motor control and propose that subcellular muscle contraction is a fundamental mechanism by which neurons can reshape behavior.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: On the topochronic map of the human brain dynamics</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.07.01.447872v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Large-scale brain activity evolves dynamically over time across multiple time-scales. The structural connectome imposes a spatial network constraint since two structurally connected brain regions are more likely to coordinate their activity. It also imposes a temporal network constraint by virtue of time delays via signal transmission, which has modulatory effects on oscillatory signals. Specifically, the lengths of the structural bundles, their widths, myelination, and the topology of the structural connectome influence the timing of the interactions across the brain network. Together, they define a space-time structure (topochronic map) spanned by connection strengths (space) and signal transmission delays (time), which together establish the deterministic scaffold underlying the evolution of brain dynamics. We introduce a novel in vivo approach for directly measuring functional delays across the whole brain using magneto/electroencephalography and integrating them with the structural connectome derived from magnetic resonance imaging. We developed a map of the functional delays characterizing the connections across the human brain and a map of the corresponding functional velocities. This yields a topochronic map of the human brain dynamics. The functional delays are tightly regulated, with a trend showing, as expected, that larger structural bundles had faster velocities, with the delays varying much less than expected if they only depended upon distance. Then, we estimated the delays from magnetoencephalography (MEG) data in a cohort of multiple sclerosis patients, who have damaged myelin sheaths, and demonstrated that patients showed greater delays across the whole network than a matched control group. Furthermore, within each patient, individual lesioned connections were slowed down more than unaffected ones. Our technique provides a practical approach for estimating functional transmission delays in vivo at the single-subject and single-fiber level and, thus, opens the possibility for novel diagnostic and curative interventions as well as providing empirical, subject-specific constraints to tailor brain models.</content:encoded>

Metabolomics and proteomics, like other omics domains, usually face a data mining challenge in providing an understandable output to advance in biomarker discovery and precision medicine. Often, statistical analysis is one of the most difficult challenges and it is critical in the subsequent biological interpretation of the results. Because of this, combined with the computational programming skills needed for this type of analysis, several bioinformatic tools aimed at simplifying metabolomics and proteomics data analysis have emerged. However, sometimes the analysis is still limited to a few hidebound statistical methods and to data sets with limited flexibility. POMAShiny is a web-based tool that provides a structured, flexible and user-friendly workflow for the visualization, exploration and statistical analysis of metabolomics and proteomics data. This tool integrates several statistical methods, some of them widely used in other types of omics, and it is based on the POMA R/Bioconductor package, which increases the reproducibility and flexibility of analyses outside the web environment. POMAShiny and POMA are both freely available at https://github.com/nutrimetabolomics/POMAShiny and https://github.com/nutrimetabolomics/POMA, respectively.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/w8oDgONs5wU&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

In the real world, many relationships between events are uncertain and probabilistic. Uncertainty is also likely to be a more common feature of daily experience for youth because they have less experience to draw from than adults. Some studies suggest probabilistic learning may be inefficient in youths compared to adults, while others suggest it may be more efficient in youths in mid adolescence. Here we used a probabilistic reinforcement learning task to test how youth age 8-17 (N = 187) and adults age 18-30 (N = 110) learn about stable probabilistic contingencies. Performance increased with age through early-twenties, then stabilized. Using hierarchical Bayesian methods to fit computational reinforcement learning models, we show that all participants’ performance was better explained by models in which negative outcomes had minimal to no impact on learning. The performance increase over age was driven by 1) an increase in learning rate (i.e. decrease in integration time scale); 2) a decrease in noisy/exploratory choices. In mid-adolescence age 13-15, salivary testosterone and learning rate were positively related. We discuss our findings in the context of other studies and hypotheses about adolescent brain development.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/YWuy92-1tZE&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

It has been widely accepted that dopamine (DA) plays a major role in motivation, yet the specific contribution of DA signaling at D&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-like receptor (D&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;R) and D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-like receptor (D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;R) to cost–benefit trade-off remains unclear. Here, by combining pharmacological manipulation of DA receptors (DARs) and positron emission tomography (PET) imaging, we assessed the relationship between the degree of D&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;R/D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;R blockade and changes in benefit- and cost-based motivation for goal-directed behavior of macaque monkeys. We found that the degree of blockade of either D&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;R or D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;R was associated with a reduction of the positive impact of reward amount and increasing delay discounting. Workload discounting was selectively increased by D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;R antagonism. In addition, blocking both D&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;R and D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;R had a synergistic effect on delay discounting but an antagonist effect on workload discounting. These results provide fundamental insight into the distinct mechanisms of DA action in the regulation of the benefit- and cost-based motivation, which have important implications for motivational alterations in both neurological and psychiatric disorders.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/AbZP7xw0cCU&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.16225</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The Hessian of a neural network captures parameter interactions through
second-order derivatives of the loss. It is a fundamental object of study,
closely tied to various problems in deep learning, including model design,
optimization, and generalization. Most prior work has been empirical, typically
focusing on low-rank approximations and heuristics that are blind to the
network structure. In contrast, we develop theoretical tools to analyze the
range of the Hessian map, providing us with a precise understanding of its rank
deficiency as well as the structural reasons behind it. This yields exact
formulas and tight upper bounds for the Hessian rank of deep linear networks,
allowing for an elegant interpretation in terms of rank deficiency. Moreover,
we demonstrate that our bounds remain faithful as an estimate of the numerical
Hessian rank, for a larger class of models such as rectified and hyperbolic
tangent networks. Further, we also investigate the implications of model
architecture (e.g.~width, depth, bias) on the rank deficiency. Overall, our
work provides novel insights into the source and extent of redundancy in
overparameterized networks.

	<title>arXiv: Quantitative Biology: Neurons and Cognition: Do grid codes afford generalization and flexible decision-making?. (arXiv:2106.16219v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.16219</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Behavioral flexibility is learning from previous experiences and planning
appropriate actions in a changing or novel environment. Successful behavioral
adaptation depends on internal models the brain builds to represent the
relational structure of an abstract task. Emerging evidence suggests that the
well-known roles of the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex (HC-EC) in
integrating spatial relationships into cognitive maps can be extended to map
the transition structure between states in non-spatial abstract tasks. However,
what the EC grid-codes actually compute to afford generalization remains
elusive. We introduce two non-exclusive ideas regarding what grid-codes may
represent to afford higher-level cognition. One idea is that grid-codes are
eigenvectors of the successor representation (SR) learned online during a task.
This view assumes that the grid codes serve as an efficient basis function for
learning and representing experienced relationships between entities.
Subsequently, the grid codes facilitate generalization in novel contexts such
as when the goal changes. The second idea is that the grid-codes reflect the
inferred global task structure. This view assumes that the grid-code represents
a structural code that is factorized from specific sensory content, enabling
structural information to be transferred across tasks. Subsequently, the brain
could afford one-shot inferences without requiring experience. The ability to
generalize experiences and make appropriate decisions in novel situations is
critical for both animals and machines. Here we review proposed computations of
the grid-code in the brain, which is potentially critical to behavioral
flexibility.

track the set concentration successfully. We are using simple LIF neurons for
the neural network implementation, considering the feasibility of its

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.16154</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Intracellular access with high spatiotemporal resolution can enhance our
understanding of how neurons or cardiomyocytes regulate and orchestrate network
activity, and how this activity can be affected with pharmacology or other
interventional modalities. Nanoscale devices often employ electroporation to
transiently permeate the cell membrane and record intracellular potentials,
which tend to decrease rapidly to extracellular potential amplitudes with time.
Here, we report innovative scalable, vertical, ultra-sharp nanowire arrays that
are individually addressable to enable long-term, native recordings of
intracellular potentials. We report large action potential amplitudes that are
indicative of intracellular access from 3D tissue-like networks of neurons and
cardiomyocytes across recording days and that do not decrease to extracellular
amplitudes for the duration of the recording of several minutes. Our findings
are validated with cross-sectional microscopy, pharmacology, and electrical
interventions. Our experiments and simulations demonstrate that individual
electrical addressability of nanowires is necessary for high-fidelity
intracellular electrophysiological recordings. This study advances our
understanding of and control over high-quality multi-channel intracellular
recordings, and paves the way toward predictive, high-throughput, and low-cost

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.15691</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;This paper surveys the field of multiagent deep reinforcement learning. The
combination of deep neural networks with reinforcement learning has gained
increased traction in recent years and is slowly shifting the focus from
single-agent to multiagent environments. Dealing with multiple agents is
inherently more complex as (a) the future rewards depend on the joint actions
of multiple players and (b) the computational complexity of functions
increases. We present the most common multiagent problem representations and
their main challenges, and identify five research areas that address one or
more of these challenges: centralised training and decentralised execution,
opponent modelling, communication, efficient coordination, and reward shaping.
We find that many computational studies rely on unrealistic assumptions or are
not generalisable to other settings; they struggle to overcome the curse of
dimensionality or nonstationarity. Approaches from psychology and sociology
capture promising relevant behaviours such as communication and coordination.
We suggest that, for multiagent reinforcement learning to be successful, future
research addresses these challenges with an interdisciplinary approach to open
up new possibilities for more human-oriented solutions in multiagent
reinforcement learning.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.15685</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Biological synaptic plasticity exhibits nonlinearities that are not accounted
for by classic Hebbian learning rules. Here, we introduce a simple family of
generalized, nonlinear Hebbian learning rules. We study the computations
implemented by their dynamics in the simple setting of a neuron receiving
feedforward inputs. We show that these nonlinear Hebbian rules allow a neuron
to learn tensor decompositions of its higher-order input correlations. The
particular input correlation decomposed, and the form of the decomposition,
depend on the location of nonlinearities in the plasticity rule. For simple,
biologically motivated parameters, the neuron learns tensor eigenvectors of
higher-order input correlations. We prove that each tensor eigenvector is an
attractor and determine their basins of attraction. We calculate the volume of
those basins, showing that the dominant eigenvector has the largest basin of
attraction. We then study arbitrary learning rules, and find that any learning
rule that admits a finite Taylor expansion into the neural input and output
also has stable equilibria at tensor eigenvectors of its higher-order input
correlations. Nonlinearities in synaptic plasticity thus allow a neuron to
encode higher-order input correlations in a simple fashion.

an update strength $F$ and a success rate. We analyze in this work how the
performance of the (1+1) Evolutionary Algorithm on LeadingOnes depends on these
two hyper-parameters. Our main result shows that the best performance is
obtained for small update strengths $F=1+o(1)$ and success rate $1/e$. We also
prove that the running time obtained by this parameter setting is, apart from
lower order terms, the same that is achieved with the best fitness-dependent
mutation rate. We show similar results for the resampling variant of the (1+1)
Evolutionary Algorithm, which enforces to flip at least one bit per iteration.

                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Vitamin D receptor (VDR) signaling has been reported to affect neurodevelopment, thus participating in the risk of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). We have measured expression amounts of &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;VDR&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;CYP27B1&lt;/em&gt;, and two related long non-coding RNAs, namely &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;SNHG6&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;LINC00511&lt;/em&gt;, in the circulation of ASD patients compared with normal controls. Expression of &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;CYP27B1&lt;/em&gt; was remarkably higher in ASD cases compared with controls (posterior beta = 2.38, SE = 0.46, adjusted &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; value &amp;lt; 0.0001, 95% credible interval (CrI) for beta = [1.49, 3.27]). Level of &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;SNHG6&lt;/em&gt; was lower in ASD cases compared with controls (posterior beta = − 0.791, SE = 0.24, adjusted &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; value = 0.029, 95% CrI for beta = [− 1.27, − 0.33]). Expression levels of &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;VDR&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;LINC00511&lt;/em&gt; were similar between ASD cases and controls (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; values = 0.97 and 0.46, respectively). Expressions of &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;VDR&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;CYP27B1&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;SNHG6&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;LINC00511&lt;/em&gt; were not correlated with age of children. However, significant correlations were perceived between expressions of &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;CYP27B1&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;LINC00511&lt;/em&gt; (r = 0.47, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.0001), &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;VDR&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;CYP27B1&lt;/em&gt; (r = 0.42, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.0001), and &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;VDR&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;SNHG6&lt;/em&gt; (r = 0.32, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.0001). Therefore, these results imply dysregulation of a number of VDR-related genes in ASD patients.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Data from preclinical studies propose nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD&lt;sup class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) as a neuroprotective and bioenergetics stimulant agent to treat Alzheimer’s disease (AD); however, there seems to be inconsistency between behavioral and molecular outcomes. We performed this systematic review to provide a better understanding of the effects of NAD&lt;sup class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; in rodent AD models and to summarize the literature.&lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Studies were identified by searching PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, Google Scholar, and the reference lists of relevant review articles published through December 2020. The search strategy was restricted to articles about NAD&lt;sup class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, its derivatives, and their association with cognitive function in AD rodent models. The initial search yielded 320 articles, of which 11 publications were included in our systematic review.&lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Based on the primary outcomes, it was revealed that NAD&lt;sup class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; improves learning and memory. The secondary endpoints also showed neuroprotective effects of NAD&lt;sup class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; on different AD models. The proposed neuroprotective mechanisms included, but were not limited to, the attenuation of the oxidative stress, inflammation, and apoptosis, while enhancing the mitochondrial function.&lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;The current systematic review summarizes the preclinical studies on NAD&lt;sup class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; precursors and provides evidence favoring the pro-cognitive effects of such components in rodent models of AD.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Molecular Neuroscience: Gut Microbiota Composition and Epigenetic Molecular Changes Connected to the Pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s Disease</title>

	<content:encoded>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder, and its pathogenesis is not fully known. Although there are several hypotheses, such as neuroinflammation, tau hyperphosphorylation, amyloid-β plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, and oxidative stress, none of them completely explain the origin and progression of AD. Emerging evidence suggests that gut microbiota and epigenetics can directly influence the pathogenesis of AD via their effects on multiple pathways, including neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, and amyloid protein. Various gut microbes such as &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Actinobacteria&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Bacteroidetes&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Firmicutes&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Proteobacteria&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Tenericutes&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Verrucomicrobia&lt;/em&gt; are known to play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of AD. These microbes and their metabolites modulate various physiological processes that contribute to AD pathogenesis, such as neuroinflammation and other inflammatory processes, amyloid deposition, cytokine storm syndrome, altered BDNF and NMDA signaling, impairing neurodevelopmental processes. Likewise, epigenetic markers associated with AD mainly include histone modifications and DNA methylation, which are under the direct control of a variety of enzymes, such as acetylases and methylases. The activity of these enzymes is dependent upon the metabolites generated by the host’s gut microbiome, suggesting the significance of epigenetics in AD pathogenesis. It is interesting to know that both gut microbiota and epigenetics are dynamic processes and show a high degree of variation according to diet, stressors, and environmental factors. The bidirectional relation between the gut microbiota and epigenetics suggests that they might work in synchrony to modulate AD representation, its pathogenesis, and progression. They both also provide numerous targets for early diagnostic biomarkers and for the development of AD therapeutics. This review discusses the gut microbiota and epigenetics connection in the pathogenesis of AD and aims to highlight vast opportunities for diagnosis and therapeutics of AD.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Accumulation of amyloid-β (Aβ) in the brain is a central component of pathology in Alzheimer’s disease. A growing volume of evidence demonstrates close associations between periodontal pathogens including &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Porphyromonas gingivalis&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;P. gingivalis&lt;/em&gt;) and &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Treponema denticola&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;T. denticola&lt;/em&gt;) and AD. However, the effect and mechanisms of &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;T. denticola&lt;/em&gt; on accumulation of Aβ remain to be unclear. In this study, we demonstrated that &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;T. denticola&lt;/em&gt; was able to enter the brain and act directly on nerve cells resulting in intra- and extracellular Aβ&lt;sub class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;1–40&lt;/sub&gt; and Aβ&lt;sub class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;1–42&lt;/sub&gt; accumulation in the hippocampus of C57BL/6 mice by selectively activating both β-secretase and γ-secretase. Furthermore, both KMI1303, an inhibitor of β-secretase, as well as DAPT, an inhibitor of γ- secretase, were found to be able to inhibit the effect of &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;T. denticola&lt;/em&gt; on Aβ accumulation in N2a neuronal cells. Overall, it is concluded that &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;T. denticola&lt;/em&gt; increases the expression of Aβ&lt;sub class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;1–42&lt;/sub&gt; and Aβ&lt;sub class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;1–40&lt;/sub&gt; by its regulation on beta-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme-1 and presenilin 1.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Neurodevelopmental disorders are defined as a set of abnormal brain developmental conditions marked by the early childhood onset of cognitive, behavioral, and functional deficits leading to memory and learning problems, emotional instability, and impulsivity. Autism spectrum disorder, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, Tourette syndrome, fragile X syndrome, and Down’s syndrome are a few known examples of neurodevelopmental disorders. Although they are relatively common in both developed and developing countries, very little is currently known about their underlying molecular mechanisms. Both genetic and environmental factors are known to increase the risk of neurodevelopmental disorders. Current diagnostic and screening tests for neurodevelopmental disorders are not reliable; hence, individuals with neurodevelopmental disorders are often diagnosed in the later stages. This negatively affects their prognosis and quality of life, prompting the need for a better diagnostic biomarker. Recent studies on microRNAs and their altered regulation in diseases have shed some light on the possible role they could play in the development of the central nervous system. This review attempts to elucidate our current understanding of the role that microRNAs play in neurodevelopmental disorders with the hope of utilizing them as potential biomarkers in the future.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s12031-021-01818-6</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Accumulation of misfolded tau, amyloid β (Aβ), and alpha-synuclein (α-syn) proteins is the fundamental contributor to many neurodegenerative diseases, namely Parkinson’s (PD) and AD. Such protein aggregations trigger activation of immune mechanisms in neuronal and glial, mainly M1-type microglia cells, leading to release of pro-inflammatory mediators, and subsequent neuronal dysfunction and apoptosis. Despite the described neurotoxic features for glial cells, recruitment of peripheral leukocytes to the brain and their conversion to neuroprotective M2-type microglia can mitigate neurodegeneration by clearing extracellular protein accumulations or residues. Based on these observations, it was speculated that Dendritic cell (DC)-based vaccination, by making use of DCs as natural adjuvants, could be used for treatment of neurodegenerative disorders. DCs potentiated by disease-specific antigens can also enhance T helper 2 (Th2)-specific immune response and by production of specific antibodies contribute to clearance of intracellular aggregations, as well as enhancing regulatory T cell response. Thus, enhancement of immune response by DC vaccine therapy can potentially augment glial polarization into the neuroprotective phenotype, enhance antibody production, and at the same time balance neuronal cells’ repair, renewal, and protection. The characteristic feature of this method of treatment is to maintain the equilibrium in the immune response rather than targeting a single mediator in the disease and their application in other neurodegenerative diseases should be addressed. However, the safety of these methods should be investigated by clinical trials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Twenty-five Wistar rats were randomly divided into 5 groups (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 5 in each): (1) healthy control (control), (2) Alzheimer disease (AD), (3) AD with treadmill exercise (AD + Exe), (4) AD with probiotic (combined administration of &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Bifidobacterium bifidum&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Lactobacillus plantarum&lt;/em&gt;) treatment (AD + Pro), and (5) AD with treadmill exercise and probiotic treatment (AD + Exe + Pro). AD was induced by intra-cerebroventricular injection of Aβ1-42 peptide. Then, the training groups exercised on treadmill for 8 weeks, 5 days per weeks. The rats were treated daily with probiotic supplements via gavage for 8 weeks. The Morris water maze (MWM) test was administered to measure spatial learning. Then, the animals were sacrificed and &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Vegf&lt;/em&gt; and ACH were analyzed using the qPCR and immunohistochemistry (IHC) methods, respectively. Results showed that the β-amyloid plaques were significantly increased in the brains of the AD group compared with the control group (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001). The combined use of probiotics and exercise training significantly increased the time spent in the target quadrant after removing the platform, compared with the AD group in the Morris water maze test (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001). Crystal violet analysis showed that sole (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.01) and combined exercise training and probiotic supplementation (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001) significantly reduced the number of dead cells in the brains of rats compared with the AD group. AD significantly decreased &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Vegf&lt;/em&gt; mRNA and ACH in the CA1 area of the hippocampus (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001). However, mono and combined therapy (exercise and probiotics) significantly increased ACH in the rats’ brain compared with the AD group. Overall, 8 weeks of an administration of &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Bifidobacterium bifidum &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Lactobacillus plantarum&lt;/em&gt; combined with exercise training can improve spatial learning impairment in the AD rats. Exercise and probiotics seem to offer potential benefits to AD patients by upregulating ACH.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Neuroinflammation-induced neurodegeneration and immune cell infiltration are two features of Alzheimer disease (AD). This study aimed to identify potential peripheral biomarkers that interact with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and infiltrating immune cells in AD. Blood and CSF data were downloaded from the Alzheimer’s disease Neuroimaging Initiative database. We identified differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in AD and assessed infiltrating immune cells using the Immune Cell Abundance Identifier (ImmuCellAI) algorithm. Blood-brain barrier (BBB) and immune-related genes were identified from medical databases, and common genes were used to construct a protein-protein interaction network (PPI). Potential biomarkers reflecting the clinical features of AD were screened using Pearson correlations and logistic regression analysis. We identified 210 DEGs in the AD group. ImmuCellAI indicated that blood samples from patients with AD had a higher abundance of exhausted T (Tex; 0.196 vs. 0.132) and induced regulatory T (iTreg; 0.180 vs. 0.137) cells than controls. Thirty-two genes overlapped between the BBB and immune-related genes, and 27 genes in the PPI network were associated with eight pathways, including the cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction pathway (hsa04060) and the chemokine signaling pathway (hsa04062). Pearson correlations showed that five genes were associated with the CSF biomarkers, Aβ, total, and phosphorylated tau. Logistics analysis showed that the B cell-associated genes, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;CXCL12&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;TNFRSF13C&lt;/em&gt;, were independent risk factors for AD diagnosis. Peripheral &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;CXCL12&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;TNFRSF13C&lt;/em&gt; genes that correlated with immune cell infiltration in AD might serve as easily accessible biomarkers for the early diagnosis of AD.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Brain insulin system dysfunction has been proposed as a key player in the pathogenesis of sporadic Alzheimer’s disease (sAD). Given this fact, an adult rat model for sAD has been developed by intracerebroventricular injection of a subdiabetogenic streptozotocin dosage (icv-STZ). A low dose of icv-STZ in adult rats leads to a subclinical model of Alzheimer’s disease. According to the brain developmental origin for sAD occurrence, the present study evaluated the effect of neonatal injection of icv-STZ on the development and progression of Alzheimer’s disease later in the adult animals treated with a low dose of icv-STZ. Although no alteration was observed in the rats receiving an adult low dose of icv-STZ, these animals displayed cognitive deficits if they were also treated neonatally with icv-STZ. These impairments were associated with altered gene expression of insulin receptor, tau and choline acetyltransferase, along with increased astrocyte and dark neuron densities in the hippocampus. This study highlights neonatal brain insulin system dysfunction in the programming of brain insulin signaling sensitivity and provides more evidence for the developmental origin of sAD.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Although genetic factors occupy an important place in the development of autism spectrum disorder (ASD), oxidative stress and exposure to environmental toxicants have also been linked to the condition. The aim of this study was to examine dynamic thiol/disulfide homeostasis in children diagnosed with ASD. Forty-eight children aged 3–12 years diagnosed with ASD and 40 age- and sex-matched healthy children were included in the study. A sociodemographic data form was completed for all the cases, and the Childhood Autism Rating Scale (CARS) was applied to the patients. Thiol/disulfide parameters in serum were measured in all cases and compared between the two groups. Mean native thiol, total thiol concentrations (μmol/L), and median reduced thiol ratios were significantly lower in the ASD group than in the control group (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.001 for all). Median disulfide concentrations (μmol/L), redox potential, and median oxidized thiol ratios were significantly higher in the ASD group than in the control group (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.001, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.001, and &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.001, respectively). ROC analysis revealed that area under the curve (AUC&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;)&lt;/em&gt; values with “excellent discriminatory potential,” for native thiol, total thiol, the reduced thiol ration, the oxidized thiol ratio, and redox potential and with “acceptable discriminatory potential” for disulfide were significantly capable of differentiating individuals with ASD from healthy individuals. No correlation was determined between the severity of autism and laboratory parameters. Impaired dynamic thiol/disulfide homeostasis was observed in children with ASD, suggesting that dynamic thiol/disulfide homeostasis in serum may be of diagnostic value in autism.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Main risk factors of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) include both genetic and non-genetic factors, especially prenatal and perinatal events. Newborn screening dried blood spot (DBS) samples have great potential for the study of early biochemical markers of disease. To study DBS strengths and limitations in the context of ASD research, we analyzed the metabolomic profiles of newborns later diagnosed with ASD. We performed LC-MS/MS-based untargeted metabolomics on DBS from 37 case-control pairs randomly selected from the iPSYCH sample. After preprocessing using MZmine 2.41, metabolites were putatively annotated using mzCloud, GNPS feature-based molecular networking, and MolNetEnhancer. A total of 4360 mass spectral features were detected, of which 150 (113 unique) could be putatively annotated at a high confidence level. Chemical structure information at a broad level could be retrieved for 1009 metabolites, covering 31 chemical classes. Although no clear distinction between cases and controls was revealed, our method covered many metabolites previously associated with ASD, suggesting that biochemical markers of ASD are present at birth and may be monitored during newborn screening. Additionally, we observed that gestational age, age at sampling, and month of birth influence the metabolomic profiles of newborn DBS, which informs us on the important confounders to address in future studies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Molecular Neuroscience: Alteration of TRIM33 Expression at Transcriptional and Translational Levels is Correlated with Autism Symptoms</title>

                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;As a complex neurodevelopmental disorder, autism affects children in three major cognitive domains including social interactions, language learning and repetitive stereotyped behaviors. Abnormal regulation of cell proliferation in the brain during the embryonic period via the TGF-β signaling pathway and TRIM33 gene that encodes a protein with a corepressor and regulatory role in this pathway has been considered as an etiology for autism. Here, we investigated the association of a variation of TRIM33 with autism symptoms at levels of mRNA and protein expression. We used Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised (ADI-R) and Childhood Autism Rating Scale (CARS) as behavioral diagnostic tools. Normal and autistic children were genotyped for a TRIM33 polymorphism (rs11102807), and then expression was assessed at transcriptional and translational levels. Results demonstrated that the frequency of the homozygous A allele (AA genotype of rs11102807) was significantly higher in children with autism (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001), whereas carriers of the G allele were mostly among healthy individuals. Children homozygous for the rs11102807 A allele were associated with an increase in CARS and ADI-R scores, indicating a significant correlation with autism symptoms. TRIM33 gene expression at both mRNA (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.01) and protein (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001) levels was significantly higher in controls compared to autistic children. A remarkable association between higher TRIM33 gene expression at the transcriptional level and lower scores for both CARS and ADI-R was observed in non-autistic children. It seems that rs11102807 modulates the function and expression of the TRIM33 gene, implying that the A allele may increase the risk of autism in children by reducing gene expression and altering the TGF-β signaling pathway.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a condition that includes a number of neurodevelopmental mental disorders. Recent genetic/genomic investigations have reported an increased prevalence of copy number variations (CNVs) in individuals with autism. Despite the extensive evidence of a genetic component, the genes involved are not known and the background is heterogeneous among subjects. As such, it is highly likely that multiple events (molecular cascades) are implicated in the development of autism. The aim of this work was to shed some light on the biological background behind this condition. We hypothesized that the heterogeneous alterations found within different individuals may converge into one or more specific biological functions (pathways) linked to the heterogeneous phenotypes commonly observed in subjects with ASD. We analyzed a sample of 107 individuals for CNV alterations and checked the genes located within the altered loci (1366). Then, we characterized the subjects for distinct phenotypes. After creating subsamples based on symptoms, the CNVs related to each specific symptom were used to create distinct networks associated with each phenotype (18 in total in the sample under analysis). These networks were independently clustered and enriched to identify potential common pathways involved in autism and variably combined with the clinical phenotype. The first 10 pathways of the analysis are discussed.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Nigrostriatal pathway disturbance is one of the major pathogenic factors in Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Dopaminergic neuron dysfunction results in bradykinesia and akinesia (inability to initiate movement), indicating a significant risk factor for substantia nigra pars compacta lesions. Furthermore, the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD&lt;sup class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) is associated with Aβ toxicity decline in AD therapy. Nicotinamide mononucleotide adenylyltransferase 1 (Nmnat1) is an essential enzyme that preserves normal neuronal function and protects neurons from insult. This study aimed to investigate the potential therapeutic effects of Nmnat1 and its underlying mechanisms in a triple-transgenic mouse model of AD (3xTgAD). Results showed that Nmnat1 improved the substantial behavioral measures of cognitive impairments compared with the 3xTgAD control. Additionally, Nmnat1 overexpression significantly increased tyrosine hydroxylase-positive neurons and anti-apoptotic protein Bcl2 and caspase-3 expression levels in 3xTgAD mice. Nmnat1 also effectively controlled SOD1 activation. In conclusion, Nmnat1 substantially decreases multiple AD-associated pathological characteristics at least partially by the increase of caspase-3 activation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

In order to investigate the effect of T-006 prophylactic treatment on an Alzheimer’s disease (AD) model and identify the target of T-006, we intragastrically administered T-006 (3 mg/kg) to Alzheimer’s disease (AD) transgenic mice (APP/PS1-2xTg and APP/PS1/Tau-3xTg) for 6 and 8 months, respectively. T-006 improved cognitive ability after long-term administration in two AD mouse models and targeted mitochondrial-related protein alpha-F1-ATP synthase (ATP5A). T-006 significantly reduced the expression of phosphorylated-tau, total tau, and APP while increasing the expression of synapse-associated proteins in 3xTg mice. In addition, T-006 modulated the JNK and mTOR-ULK1 pathways to reduce both p-tau and total tau levels. Our data suggested that T-006 mitigated cognitive decline primarily by reducing the p-tau and total tau levels in 3xTg mice, supporting further investigation into its development as a candidate drug for AD treatment.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Analysis of microcircuits provides a system-level understanding of the neurobiology of health and disease. Causal discovery aims to detect causal relationships among variables based on observational data. A key barrier in causal discovery is the high dimensionality of the variable space. A method called Causal Inference for Microcircuits (CAIM) is proposed to reconstruct causal networks from calcium imaging or electrophysiology time series. CAIM combines neural recording, Bayesian network modeling, and neuron clustering. Validation experiments based on simulated data and a real-world reaching task dataset demonstrated that CAIM accurately revealed causal relationships among neural clusters.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Electroencephalogram data used in the domain of brain–computer interfaces typically has subpar signal-to-noise ratio and data acquisition is expensive. An effective and commonly used classifier to discriminate event-related potentials is the linear discriminant analysis which, however, requires an estimate of the feature distribution. While this information is provided by the feature covariance matrix its large number of free parameters calls for regularization approaches like Ledoit–Wolf shrinkage. Assuming that the noise of event-related potential recordings is not time-locked, we propose to decouple the time component from the covariance matrix of event-related potential data in order to further improve the estimates of the covariance matrix for linear discriminant analysis. We compare three regularized variants thereof and a feature representation based on Riemannian geometry against our proposed novel linear discriminant analysis with time-decoupled covariance estimates. Extensive evaluations on 14 electroencephalogram datasets reveal, that the novel approach increases the classification performance by up to four percentage points for small training datasets, and gracefully converges to the performance of standard shrinkage-regularized LDA for large training datasets. Given these results, practitioners in this field should consider using our proposed time-decoupled covariance estimation when they apply linear discriminant analysis to classify event-related potentials, especially when few training data points are available.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Rhythms of the brain are generated by neural oscillations across multiple frequencies. These oscillations can be decomposed into distinct frequency intervals associated with specific physiological processes. In practice, the number and ranges of decodable frequency intervals are determined by sampling parameters, often ignored by researchers. To improve the situation, we report on an open toolbox with a graphical user interface for decoding rhythms of the brain system (DREAM). We provide worked examples of DREAM to investigate frequency-specific performance of both neural (spontaneous brain activity) and neurobehavioral (in-scanner head motion) oscillations. DREAM decoded the head motion oscillations and uncovered that younger children moved their heads more than older children across all five frequency intervals whereas boys moved more than girls in the age of 7 to 9 years. It is interesting that the higher frequency bands contain more head movements, and showed stronger age-motion associations but weaker sex-motion interactions. Using data from the Human Connectome Project, DREAM mapped the amplitude of these neural oscillations into multiple frequency bands and evaluated their test-retest reliability. The resting-state brain ranks its spontaneous oscillation’s amplitudes spatially from high in ventral-temporal areas to low in ventral-occipital areas when the frequency band increased from low to high, while those in part of parietal and ventral frontal regions are reversed. The higher frequency bands exhibited more reliable amplitude measurements, implying more inter-individual variability of the amplitudes for the higher frequency bands. In summary, DREAM adds a reliable and valid tool to mapping human brain function from a multiple-frequency window into brain waves.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Neuroinformatics: Generating Longitudinal Atrophy Evaluation Datasets on Brain Magnetic Resonance Images Using Convolutional Neural Networks and Segmentation Priors</title>

                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Brain atrophy quantification plays a fundamental role in neuroinformatics since it permits studying brain development and neurological disorders. However, the lack of a ground truth prevents testing the accuracy of longitudinal atrophy quantification methods. We propose a deep learning framework to generate longitudinal datasets by deforming T1-w brain magnetic resonance imaging scans as requested through segmentation maps. Our proposal incorporates a cascaded multi-path U-Net optimised with a multi-objective loss which allows its paths to generate different brain regions accurately. We provided our model with baseline scans and real follow-up segmentation maps from two longitudinal datasets, ADNI and OASIS, and observed that our framework could produce synthetic follow-up scans that matched the real ones (Total scans= 584; Median absolute error: 0.03 ± 0.02; Structural similarity index: 0.98 ± 0.02; Dice similarity coefficient: 0.95 ± 0.02; Percentage of brain volume change: 0.24 ± 0.16; Jacobian integration: 1.13 ± 0.05). Compared to two relevant works generating brain lesions using U-Nets and conditional generative adversarial networks (CGAN), our proposal outperformed them significantly in most cases (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.01), except in the delineation of brain edges where the CGAN took the lead (Jacobian integration: Ours - 1.13 ± 0.05 vs CGAN - 1.00 ± 0.02; &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.01). We examined whether changes induced with our framework were detected by FAST, SPM, SIENA, SIENAX, and the Jacobian integration method. We observed that induced and detected changes were highly correlated (Adj. &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;R&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;gt; 0.86).

	<content:encoded>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Brain atlases have proven to be valuable neuroscience tools for localizing regions of interest and performing statistical inferences on populations. Although many human brain atlases exist, most do not contain information about white matter structures, often neglecting them completely or labelling all white matter as a single homogenous substrate. While few white matter atlases do exist based on diffusion MRI fiber tractography, they are often limited to descriptions of white matter as spatially separate “regions” rather than as white matter “bundles” or fascicles, which are well-known to overlap throughout the brain. Additional limitations include small sample sizes, few white matter pathways, and the use of outdated diffusion models and techniques. Here, we present a new population-based collection of white matter atlases represented in both volumetric and surface coordinates in a standard space. These atlases are based on 2443 subjects, and include 216 white matter bundles derived from 6 different automated state-of-the-art tractography techniques. This atlas is freely available and will be a useful resource for parcellation and segmentation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Neuroinformatics: RippleNet: a Recurrent Neural Network for Sharp Wave Ripple (SPW-R) Detection</title>

	<content:encoded>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Hippocampal sharp wave ripples (SPW-R) have been identified as key bio-markers of important brain functions such as memory consolidation and decision making. Understanding their underlying mechanisms in healthy and pathological brain function and behaviour rely on accurate SPW-R detection. In this multidisciplinary study, we propose a novel, self-improving artificial intelligence (AI) detection method in the form of deep Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) with Long Short-Term memory (LSTM) layers that can learn features of SPW-R events from raw, labeled input data. The approach contrasts conventional routines that typically relies on hand-crafted, heuristic feature extraction and often laborious manual curation. The algorithm is trained using supervised learning on hand-curated data sets with SPW-R events obtained under controlled conditions. The input to the algorithm is the local field potential (LFP), the low-frequency part of extracellularly recorded electric potentials from the CA1 region of the hippocampus. Its output predictions can be interpreted as time-varying probabilities of SPW-R events for the duration of the inputs. A simple thresholding applied to the output probabilities is found to identify times of SPW-R events with high precision. The non-causal, or bidirectional variant of the proposed algorithm demonstrates consistently better accuracy compared to the causal, or unidirectional counterpart. Reference implementations of the algorithm, named ‘RippleNet’, are open source, freely available, and implemented using a common open-source framework for neural networks (&lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus emphasis fontcategory-non-proportional&quot;&gt;tensorflow.keras&lt;/span&gt;) and can be easily incorporated into existing data analysis workflows for processing experimental data.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Neuroinformatics: Deep Representational Similarity Learning for Analyzing Neural Signatures in Task-based fMRI Dataset</title>
	<link>http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s12021-020-09494-4</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Similarity analysis is one of the crucial steps in most fMRI studies. Representational Similarity Analysis (RSA) can measure similarities of neural signatures generated by different cognitive states. This paper develops Deep Representational Similarity Learning (DRSL), a deep extension of RSA that is appropriate for analyzing similarities between various cognitive tasks in fMRI datasets with a large number of subjects, and high-dimensionality — such as whole-brain images. Unlike the previous methods, DRSL is not limited by a linear transformation or a restricted fixed nonlinear kernel function — such as Gaussian kernel. DRSL utilizes a multi-layer neural network for mapping neural responses to linear space, where this network can implement a customized nonlinear transformation for each subject separately. Furthermore, utilizing a gradient-based optimization in DRSL can significantly reduce runtime of analysis on large datasets because it uses a batch of samples in each iteration rather than all neural responses to find an optimal solution. Empirical studies on multi-subject fMRI datasets with various tasks — including visual stimuli, decision making, flavor, and working memory — confirm that the proposed method achieves superior performance to other state-of-the-art RSA algorithms.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Neuroinformatics: 3D Deep Neural Network Segmentation of Intracerebral Hemorrhage: Development and Validation for Clinical Trials</title>

	<content:encoded>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) occurs when a blood vessel ruptures in the brain. This leads to significant morbidity and mortality, the likelihood of which is predicated on the size of the bleeding event. X-ray computed tomography (CT) scans allow clinicians and researchers to qualitatively and quantitatively diagnose hemorrhagic stroke, guide interventions and determine inclusion criteria of patients in clinical trials. There is no currently available open source, validated tool to quickly segment hemorrhage. Using an automated pipeline and 2D and 3D deep neural networks, we show that we can quickly and accurately estimate ICH volume with high agreement with time-consuming manual segmentation. The training and validation datasets include significant heterogeneity in terms of pathology, such as the presence of intraventricular (IVH) or subdural hemorrhages (SDH) as well as variable image acquisition parameters. We show that deep neural networks trained with an appropriate anatomic context in the network receptive field, can effectively perform ICH segmentation, but those without enough context will overestimate hemorrhage along the skull and around calcifications in the ventricular system. We trained with all data from a multi-center phase II study (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 112) achieving a best mean and median Dice coefficient of 0.914 and 0.919, a volume correlation of 0.979 and an average volume difference of 1.7 ml and root mean squared error of 4.7 ml in 500 out-of-sample scans from the corresponding multi-center phase III study. 3D networks with appropriate anatomic context outperformed both 2D and random forest models. Our results suggest that deep neural network models, when carefully developed can be incorporated into the workflow of an ICH clinical trial series to quickly and accurately segment ICH, estimate total hemorrhage volume and minimize segmentation failures. The model, weights and scripts for deployment are located at &lt;a class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot; href=&quot;https://github.com/msharrock/deepbleed&quot;&gt;https://github.com/msharrock/deepbleed&lt;/a&gt;. This is the first publicly available neural network model for segmentation of ICH, the only model evaluated with the presence of both IVH and SDH and the only model validated in the workflow of a series of clinical trials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;The volumetric assessment and accurate grading of meningiomas before surgery are highly relevant for therapy planning and prognosis prediction. This study was to design a deep learning algorithm and evaluate the performance in detecting meningioma lesions and grade classification. In total, 5088 patients with histopathologically confirmed meningioma were retrospectively included. The pyramid scene parsing network (PSPNet) was trained to automatically detect and delineate the meningiomas. The results were compared to manual segmentations by evaluating the mean intersection over union (mIoU). The performance of grade classification was evaluated by accuracy. For the automated detection and segmentation of meningiomas, the mean pixel accuracy, tumor accuracy, background accuracy and mIoU were 99.68%, 81.36%, 99.88% and 81.36% for all patients; 99.52%, 84.86%, 99.93% and 84.86% for grade I meningiomas; 99.57%, 80.11%, 99.92% and 80.12% for grade II meningiomas; and 99.75%, 78.40%, 99.99% and 78.40% for grade III meningiomas, respectively. For grade classification, the accuracy values of the training and test datasets were 99.93% and 81.52% for all patients; 99.98% and 98.51% for grade I meningiomas; 99.91% and 66.67% for grade II meningiomas; and 99.88% and 73.91% for grade III meningiomas, respectively. The automated detection, segmentation and grade classification of meningiomas based on deep learning were accurate and reliable and may improve the monitoring and treatment of this frequently occurring tumor entity. Furthermore, the method could function as a useful tool for preassessment and preselection for radiologists, offering auxiliary information for clinical decision making in presurgical evaluation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2021.708004</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a leading cause of disability worldwide. Although the etiology and pathophysiology of MDD remain poorly understood, aberrant neuroplasticity mediated by the epigenetic dysregulation of gene expression within the brain, which may occur due to genetic and environmental factors, may increase the risk of this disorder. Evidence has also been reported for sex-related differences in the pathophysiology of MDD, with female patients showing a greater severity of symptoms, higher degree of functional impairment, and more atypical depressive symptoms. Males and females also differ in their responsiveness to antidepressants. These clinical findings suggest that sex-dependent molecular and neural mechanisms may underlie the development of depression and the actions of antidepressant medications. This review discusses recent advances regarding the role of epigenetics in stress and depression. The first section presents a brief introduction of the basic mechanisms of epigenetic regulation, including histone modifications, DNA methylation, and non-coding RNAs. The second section reviews their contributions to neural plasticity, the risk of depression, and resilience against depression, with a particular focus on epigenetic modulators that have causal relationships with stress and depression in both clinical and animal studies. The third section highlights studies exploring sex-dependent epigenetic alterations associated with susceptibility to stress and depression. Finally, we discuss future directions to understand the etiology and pathophysiology of MDD, which would contribute to optimized and personalized therapy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Structures of Pathological and Functional Amyloids and Prions, a Solid-State NMR Perspective</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2021.670513</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Infectious proteins or prions are a remarkable class of pathogens, where pathogenicity and infectious state correspond to conformational transition of a protein fold. The conformational change translates into the formation by the protein of insoluble amyloid aggregates, associated in humans with various neurodegenerative disorders and systemic protein-deposition diseases. The prion principle, however, is not limited to pathogenicity. While pathological amyloids (and prions) emerge from protein misfolding, a class of functional amyloids has been defined, consisting of amyloid-forming domains under natural selection and with diverse biological roles. Although of great importance, prion amyloid structures remain challenging for conventional structural biology techniques. Solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (SSNMR) has been preferentially used to investigate these insoluble, morphologically heterogeneous aggregates with poor crystallinity. SSNMR methods have yielded a wealth of knowledge regarding the fundamentals of prion biology and have helped to solve the structures of several prion and prion-like fibrils. Here, we will review pathological and functional amyloid structures and will discuss some of the obtained structural models. We will finish the review with a perspective on integrative approaches combining solid-state NMR, electron paramagnetic resonance and cryo-electron microscopy, which can complement and extend our toolkit to structurally explore various facets of prion biology.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Effects of Voluntary Running Wheel Exercise-Induced Extracellular Vesicles on Anxiety</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2021.665800</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Anxiety disorders are the most frequently diagnosed psychological condition, associated with serious comorbidities including excessive fear and interference with daily life. Drugs for anxiety disorders are typically prescribed but the side effects include weight gain, nausea, and sleepiness. Exercise is an effective treatment for anxiety. Exercise induces the release of extracellular vesicles (EVs) into the circulation, which transmit signals between organs. However, the effects of exercise-induced EVs on anxiety remain poorly understood. Here, we isolated EVs from the sera of mice that were sedentary or that voluntarily exercised. We characterized the changes in the miRNA profile of serum EVs after 4 weeks of voluntary exercise. miRNA sequencing showed that 82 miRNAs (46 of which were positive and 36 negative regulators) changed after exercise. We selected genes affected by at least two miRNAs. Of these, 27.27% were associated with neurotrophin signaling (9.09% with each of central nervous system neuronal development, cerebral cortical cell migration, and peripheral neuronal development). We also analyzed behavioral changes in mice with 3 weeks of restraint stress-induced anxiety after injection of 20 μg amounts of EVs from exercised or sedentary mice into the left cerebral ventricle. We found that exercise-derived EVs reduced anxiety (compared to a control group) in a nest-building test but found no between-group differences in the rotarod or open field tests. Exercise-derived EVs enhanced the expression of neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction genes. Thus, exercise-derived EVs may exhibit anti-anxiety effects and may be of therapeutic utility.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: LPC-DHA/EPA-Enriched Diets Increase Brain DHA and Modulate Behavior in Mice That Express Human APOE4</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.690410</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Compared with APOE3, APOE4 is associated with greater age-related cognitive decline and higher risk of neurodegenerative disorders. Therefore, development of supplements that target APOE genotype-modulated processes could provide a great benefit for the aging population. Evidence suggests a link between APOE genotype and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA); however, clinical studies with current DHA supplements have produced negative results in dementia. The lack of beneficial effects with current DHA supplements may be related to limited bioavailability, as the optimal form of DHA for brain uptake is lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC)-DHA. We previously developed a method to enrich the LPC-DHA content of krill oil through lipase treatment (LT-krill oil), which resulted in fivefold higher enrichment in brain DHA levels in wild-type mice compared with untreated krill oil. Here, we evaluated the effect of a control diet, diet containing krill oil, or a diet containing LT-krill oil in APOE3- and APOE4-targeted replacement mice (APOE-TR mice; treated from 4 to 12 months of age). We found that DHA levels in the plasma and hippocampus are lower in APOE4-TR mice and that LT-krill oil increased DHA levels in the plasma and hippocampus of both APOE3- and APOE4-TR mice. In APOE4-TR mice, LT-krill oil treatment resulted in higher levels of the synaptic vesicle protein SV2A and improved performance on the novel object recognition test. In conclusion, our data demonstrate that LPC-DHA/EPA-enriched krill oil can increase brain DHA and improve memory-relevant behavior in mice that express APOE4. Therefore, long-term use of LT-krill oil supplements may on some level protect against age-related neurodegeneration.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.688818</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Pain from Parkinson's disease (PD) is a non-motor symptom affecting the quality of life and has prevalence of 20–80%. However, it is unclear whether subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation (STN–DBS), a well-established treatment for PD, is effective forPD-related pain. Thus, the objective of this meta-analysis was to investigate the efficacy of STN-DBS on PD-related pain and explore how its duration affects the efficacy of STN-DBS. A systematic search was performed using PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library. Nine studies included numerical rating scale (NRS), visual analog scale (VAS), or non-motor symptom scale (NMSS) scores at baseline and at the last follow-up visit and therefore met the inclusion criteria of the authors. These studies exhibited moderate- to high-quality evidence. Two reviewers conducted assessments for study eligibility, risk of bias, data extraction, and quality of evidence rating. Random effect meta-analysis revealed a significant change in PD-related pain as assessed by NMSS, NRS, and VAS (P &amp;lt;0.01). Analysis of the short and long follow-up subgroups indicated delayed improvement in PD-related pain. These findings (a) show the efficacy of STN-DBS on PD-related pain and provide higher-level evidence, and (b) implicate delayed improvement in PD-related pain, which may help programming doctors with supplement selecting target and programming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Systematic Review Registration: This study is registered in Open Science Framework (DOI: 10.17605/OSF.IO/DNM6K).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Connectivity Measures Differentiate Cortical and Subcortical Sub-Acute Ischemic Stroke Patients</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.669915</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Brain lesions caused by cerebral ischemia lead to network disturbances in both hemispheres, causing a subsequent reorganization of functional connectivity both locally and remotely with respect to the injury. Quantitative electroencephalography (qEEG) methods have long been used for exploring brain electrical activity and functional connectivity modifications after stroke. However, results obtained so far are not univocal. Here, we used basic and advanced EEG methods to characterize how brain activity and functional connectivity change after stroke. Thirty-three unilateral post stroke patients in the sub-acute phase and ten neurologically intact age-matched right-handed subjects were enrolled. Patients were subdivided into two groups based on lesion location: cortico-subcortical (CS, n = 18) and subcortical (S, n = 15), respectively. Stroke patients were evaluated in the period ranging from 45 days since the acute event (T0) up to 3 months after stroke (T1) with both neurophysiological (resting state EEG) and clinical assessment (Barthel Index, BI) measures, while healthy subjects were evaluated once. Brain power at T0 was similar between the two groups of patients in all frequency bands considered (δ, θ, α, and β). However, evolution of θ-band power over time was different, with a normalization only in the CS group. Instead, average connectivity and specific network measures (Integration, Segregation, and Small-worldness) in the β-band at T0 were significantly different between the two groups. The connectivity and network measures at T0 also appear to have a predictive role in functional recovery (BI T1-T0), again group-dependent. The results obtained in this study showed that connectivity measures and correlations between EEG features and recovery depend on lesion location. These data, if confirmed in further studies, on the one hand could explain the heterogeneity of results so far observed in previous studies, on the other hand they could be used by researchers as biomarkers predicting spontaneous recovery, to select homogenous groups of patients for the inclusion in clinical trials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Accordingly, sixteen healthy young adults performed the TMT using a touch-sensitive tablet to capture enhanced performance metrics, such as the speed of linking movements, during simultaneous electroencephalography (EEG). Linking and non-linking periods were derived as estimates of the time spent executing and preparing movements, respectively. The seconds per link (SPL) was also used to quantify TMT performance. A strong effect of TMT Part A and B was observed on the SPL value as expected (Part B showing increased SPL value); whereas the EEG results indicated robust effects of linking and non-linking periods in multiple frequency bands, and effects consistent with the underlying cognitive demands of the test.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neural Circuits: The Drosophila Larval Locomotor Circuit Provides a Model to Understand Neural Circuit Development and Function</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncir.2021.684969</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;It is difficult to answer important questions in neuroscience, such as: “how do neural circuits generate behaviour?,” because research is limited by the complexity and inaccessibility of the mammalian nervous system. Invertebrate model organisms offer simpler networks that are easier to manipulate. As a result, much of what we know about the development of neural circuits is derived from work in crustaceans, nematode worms and arguably most of all, the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster. This review aims to demonstrate the utility of the Drosophila larval locomotor network as a model circuit, to those who do not usually use the fly in their work. This utility is explored first by discussion of the relatively complete connectome associated with one identified interneuron of the locomotor circuit, A27h, and relating it to similar circuits in mammals. Next, it is developed by examining its application to study two important areas of neuroscience research: critical periods of development and interindividual variability in neural circuits. In summary, this article highlights the potential to use the larval locomotor network as a “generic” model circuit, to provide insight into mammalian circuit development and function.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.703944</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The meninges are the fibrous covering of the central nervous system (CNS) which contain vastly heterogeneous cell types within its three layers (dura, arachnoid, and pia). The dural compartment of the meninges, closest to the skull, is predominantly composed of fibroblasts, but also includes fenestrated blood vasculature, an elaborate lymphatic system, as well as immune cells which are distinct from the CNS. Segregating the outer and inner meningeal compartments is the epithelial-like arachnoid barrier cells, connected by tight and adherens junctions, which regulate the movement of pathogens, molecules, and cells into and out of the cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) and brain parenchyma. Most proximate to the brain is the collagen and basement membrane-rich pia matter that abuts the glial limitans and has recently be shown to have regional heterogeneity within the developing mouse brain. While the meninges were historically seen as a purely structural support for the CNS and protection from trauma, the emerging view of the meninges is as an essential interface between the CNS and the periphery, critical to brain development, required for brain homeostasis, and involved in a variety of diseases. In this review, we will summarize what is known regarding the development, specification, and maturation of the meninges during homeostatic conditions and discuss the rapidly emerging evidence that specific meningeal cell compartments play differential and important roles in the pathophysiology of a myriad of diseases including: multiple sclerosis, dementia, stroke, viral/bacterial meningitis, traumatic brain injury, and cancer. We will conclude with a list of major questions and mechanisms that remain unknown, the study of which represent new, future directions for the field of meninges biology.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Large-conductance Ca2&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-activated K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; currents are expressed in activated microglia, and BK channel knockout aggravates cerebral ischemic injury. However, the effect of BK channels on microglial phagocytosis after ischemic stroke remains unknown. Here, we explored whether BK channel activation is beneficial for neurological outcomes through microglial phagocytosis after ischemic stroke. ICR mice after transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO) were treated with dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), BK channel activator NS19504, and inhibitor Paxilline. The results showed a decrease in BK channel expression after tMCAO. BK channel activator NS19504 alleviates neurological deficit after experimental modeling of tMCAO in mice compared to the control. Furthermore, we treated primary microglia with DMSO, NS19504, and Paxilline after oxygen glucose deprivation (OGD). NS19504 promoted primary microglial phagocytosing fluorescent beads and neuronal debris, which reduced neuronal apoptosis after stroke. These effects could be reversed by BK channel inhibitor Paxilline. Finally, NS19504 increased relative phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 expression compared to the Paxilline group at the third day after stroke. Our findings indicate that microglial BK channels are a potential target for acute stage of ischemic stroke therapy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Identifying Mild Cognitive Impairment in Parkinson’s Disease With Electroencephalogram Functional Connectivity</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.701499</link>
	<content:encoded>Objective&lt;p&gt;Cognitive impairment occurs frequently in Parkinson’s disease (PD) and negatively impacts the patient’s quality of life. However, its pathophysiological mechanism remains unclear, hindering the development of new therapies. Changes in brain connectivity are related to cognitive impairment in patients with PD, with the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) being considered the essential region related to PD cognitive impairment. Nevertheless, few studies have focused on the global connectivity responsible for communication with the DLPFC node, the posterior division of the middle frontal gyrus (PMFG) in patients with PD; this was the focus of this study.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;We applied resting-state electroencephalography (EEG) and calculated a reliable functional connectivity measurement, the debiased weighted phase lag index (dWPLI), to examine inter-regional functional connectivity in 68 patients with PD who were classified into two groups according to their cognitive condition.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;We observed that altered left and right PMFG-based functional connectivity associated with cognitive impairment in patients with PD in the theta frequency bands under the eyes closed condition (r = −0.426, p &amp;lt; 0.001 and r = −0.437, p &amp;lt; 0.001, respectively). Exploratory results based on the MoCA subdomains indicated that poorer visuospatial function was associated with higher right PMFG-based functional connectivity (r = −0.335, p = 0.005), and poorer attention function was associated with higher left and right PMFG-based functional connectivity (r = −0.380, p = 0.001 and r = −0.256, p = 0.035, respectively). Further analysis using logistic regression and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves found that this abnormal functional connectivity was an independent risk factor for cognitive impairment [odds ratio (OR): 2.949, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.294–6.725, p = 0.01 for left PMFG; OR: 11.278, 95% CI: 2.578–49.335, p = 0.001 for right PMFG, per 0.1 U], and provided moderate classification power to discriminate between cognitive abilities in patients with PD [area under the ROC curve (AUC) = 0.770 for left PMFG; AUC = 0.809 for right PMFG].&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;These preliminary findings indicate that abnormal PMFG-based functional connectivity patterns associated with cognitive impairment in the theta frequency bands under the eyes closed condition and altered functional connectivity patterns have the potential to act as reliable biomarkers for identifying cognitive impairment in patients with PD.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Mechanistic Analysis of Age-Related Clinical Manifestations in Down Syndrome</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.700280</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Down syndrome (DS) is the most common genetic cause of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) due to trisomy for all or part of human chromosome 21 (Hsa21). It is also associated with other phenotypes including distinctive facial features, cardiac defects, growth delay, intellectual disability, immune system abnormalities, and hearing loss. All adults with DS demonstrate AD-like brain pathology, including amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, by age 40 and dementia typically by age 60. There is compelling evidence that increased APP gene dose is necessary for AD in DS, and the mechanism for this effect has begun to emerge, implicating the C-terminal APP fragment of 99 amino acid (β-CTF). The products of other triplicated genes on Hsa21 might act to modify the impact of APP triplication by altering the overall rate of biological aging. Another important age-related DS phenotype is hearing loss, and while its mechanism is unknown, we describe its characteristics here. Moreover, immune system abnormalities in DS, involving interferon pathway genes and aging, predispose to diverse infections and might modify the severity of COVID-19. All these considerations suggest human trisomy 21 impacts several diseases in an age-dependent manner. Thus, understanding the possible aging-related mechanisms associated with these clinical manifestations of DS will facilitate therapeutic interventions in mid-to-late adulthood, while at the same time shedding light on basic mechanisms of aging.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: No Arachnoid Granulations—No Problems: Number, Size, and Distribution of Arachnoid Granulations From Birth to 80 Years of Age</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.698865</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Introduction: The study aims to quantify changes in the number, size, and distribution of arachnoid granulations during the human lifespan to elucidate their role in cerebrospinal fluid physiology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Material and Methods: 3T magnetic resonance imaging of the brain was performed in 120 subjects of different ages (neonate, 2 years, 10 years, 20 years, 40 years, 60 years, and 80 years) all with the normal findings of the cerebrospinal fluid system (CSF). At each age, 10 male and 10 female subjects were analyzed. Group scanned at neonatal age was re-scanned at the age of two, while all other groups were scanned once. Arachnoid granulations were analyzed on T2 coronal and axial sections. Each arachnoid granulation was described concerning size and position relative to the superior sagittal, transverse, and sigmoid sinuses and surrounding cranial bones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Our study shows that 85% of neonates and 2-year-old children do not have visible arachnoid granulations in the dural sinuses and cranial bones on magnetic resonance imaging. With age, the percentage of patients with arachnoid granulations in the superior sagittal sinus increases significantly, but there is no increase in the sigmoid and transverse sinuses. However, numerous individuals in different age groups do not have arachnoid granulations in dural sinuses. Arachnoid granulations in the cranial bones are found only around the superior sagittal sinus, for the first time at the age of 10, and over time their number increases significantly. From the age of 60 onwards, arachnoid granulations were more numerous in the cranial bones than in the dural sinuses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: The results show that the number, size, and distribution of arachnoid granulations in the superior sagittal sinus and surrounding cranial bones change significantly over a lifetime. However, numerous individuals with a completely normal CSF system do not have arachnoid granulations in the dural sinuses, which calls into question their role in CSF physiology. It can be assumed that arachnoid granulations do not play an essential role in CSF absorption as it is generally accepted. Therefore, the lack of arachnoid granulations does not appear to cause problems in intracranial fluid homeostasis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.696735</link>
	<content:encoded>Background&lt;p&gt;Attempts have been made to explore the biological basis of neurodegeneration in the amnestic mild cognitive impairment (MCI) stage, subdivided by memory performance. However, few studies have evaluated the differential impact of functional connectivity (FC) on memory performances in early- and late-MCI patients.&lt;/p&gt;Objective&lt;p&gt;This study aims to explore the difference in FC of the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) among healthy controls (HC) (n = 37), early-MCI patients (n = 30), and late-MCI patients (n = 35) and to evaluate a group-memory performance interaction against the FC of PCC.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;The subjects underwent resting-state functional MRI scanning and a battery of neuropsychological tests.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;A significant difference among the three groups was found in FC between the PCC (seed region) and bilateral crus cerebellum, right superior medial frontal gyrus, superior temporal gyrus, and left middle cingulate gyrus (Monte Carlo simulation-corrected p &amp;lt; 0.01; cluster p &amp;lt; 0.05). Additionally, the early-MCI patients displayed higher FC values than the HC and late-MCI patients in the right superior medial frontal gyrus, cerebellum crus 1, and left cerebellum crus 2 (Bonferroni-corrected p &amp;lt; 0.05). Furthermore, there was a significant group-memory performance interaction (HC vs. early MCI vs. late MCI) for the FC between PCC and bilateral crus cerebellum, right superior medial frontal gyrus, superior temporal gyrus, and left middle cingulate gyrus (Bonferroni-corrected p &amp;lt; 0.05).&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;These findings contribute to the biological implications of early- and late-MCI stages, categorized by evaluating the impairment of memory performance.

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Abnormal Striatal-Cortical Networks Contribute to the Attention/Executive Function Deficits in Idiopathic REM Sleep Behavior Disorder: A Resting State Functional MRI Study</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.690854</link>
	<content:encoded>Introduction&lt;p&gt;The structural and functional damages of the striatum were evident in idiopathic REM sleep behavior disorder (iRBD). With the research on iRBD deepens, cognitive impairment in iRBD is getting increasing attention. However, the mechanism of cognitive impairment in iRBD was poorly understood.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;Neuropsychological assessment was carried out in 21 polysomnographies (PSGs) confirmed iRBD patients and 22 normal controls. Both regional homogeneity (ReHo) and seed-based functional connectivity (FC) rs-fMRI analyses were applied to explore the FC abnormalities and its association with cognition in iRBD patients. Positive ReHo clusters were set as seeds for further FC analysis.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Idiopathic REM sleep behavior disorder patients presented cognitive deficits in attention/working memory, executive function, immediate memory, and visuo-spatial ability. ReHo analysis revealed abnormal spontaneous brain activities in the striatum (right caudate, left pallidum and bilateral putamen) in iRBD. FC analysis showed decreased striatum-related FCs in the frontal, temporal, occipital lobes, thalamus, anterior cingulate gyrus, as well as decreased intrinsic FCs between bilateral putamen and between caudate and pallidum. Deficits in attention/working memory, executive function, and immediate memory were associated with abnormal striatal-cortical FCs including frontal, temporal, and anterior cingulate cortices.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;Functional changes of striatum and cognitive impairment in iRBD were reconfirmed in the present study. Abnormal striatal-cortical networks, especially the striatal-frontal network, contribute to the working memory/executive function deficits in iRBDs. These findings supported the role of striatum not only in motor but also in cognition impairment in iRBD.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Can Task Specificity Impact tDCS-Linked to Dual Task Training Gains in Parkinson's Disease? A Protocol for a Randomized Controlled Trial</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.684689</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) have difficulties while performing dual-task activities, a condition present in everyday life. It is possible that strategies such as transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) can be associated with motor training enriched with dual-task training to improve the performance of two concurrent tasks. Currently, it is unclear whether specific tasks and clinical conditions of PD patients have different results after the intervention. Therefore, the proposed randomized controlled trial will examine task-dependency in enhancing the effects of tDCS-linked rehabilitation training on PD and the relationships between baseline outcomes in responders and non-responders to therapy. Fifty-six patients with Parkinson's disease will be recruited to participate in this controlled, double-blind randomized multicentric clinical trial. Patients in modified Hoehn &amp;amp; Yahr stage 1.5–3, age between 40 and 70 years will be included. Subjects will be randomly assigned to an experimental group (EG) and a control group (CG). The EG will perform treadmill gait training associated with dual task exercises+tDCS, while the CG will only engage in treadmill gait training+tDCS. Blinded testers will assess patients before and after 12 intervention sessions and after a 4-week follow-up period. All patients will undergo a screening and an initial visit before being assessed for primary and secondary outcomes. The primary outcome measure is functional mobility measured by Timed Up and Go Test. Secondary outcomes include cognitive function, participation, motor function and body function and structure. This study will evaluate the effectiveness of an intervention protocol with tDCS, dual-task training and gait training in patients with PD. The study will also highlight the clinical factors and variability between individuals that could interfere in the training of a specific task and influence the therapeutic effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clinical Trial registration: www.ClinicalTrials.gov, identifier NCT04581590.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Pharmacological Treatment in the Management of Chronic Subdural Hematoma</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.684501</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Background: Several pharmacological treatments have been used to treat patients with chronic subdural hematoma (CSDH), although little is known about the comparative effectiveness of different classes of medication. We performed a Bayesian network meta-analysis to compare and rank the efficacy and safety of five drug regimens to determine the best treatment for this group of patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: We systematically searched PubMed, Medline, clinicaltrials.gov, the Cochrane database, and Embase to identify relevant randomized clinical trials (RCTs) comparing drug treatments in adult patients with CSDH. A network meta-analysis was conducted using a Bayesian framework. Random- and fixed-effects models were used to pool the network results, and the preferred model was selected by comparing the deviance information criteria (DIC). Efficacy outcomes included recurrence requiring surgery, changes in hematoma volume, and a good recovery. The safety outcomes were treatment-related adverse events and all-cause mortality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: In this Bayesian network meta-analysis, available data were obtained from 12 eligible trials, including 2,098 patients and 5 techniques. Compared to placebo, atorvastatin (RR: 0.45, 95% CrI: 0.24–0.81) and dexamethasone (RR: 0.38, 95% CrI: 0.22–0.63) were similarly effective in reducing recurrence requiring surgery by 55% and 62%, respectively. Dexamethasone (RR: 0.46, 95% CrI: 0.23–0.91) was more effective in reducing recurrence requiring surgery than goreisan. Additionally, atorvastatin reduced the hematoma volume to a greater extent than placebo (MD: −7.44, 95% CrI: −9.49 to −5.43) or goreisan (MD: −14.09, 95% CrI: −23.35 to −4.82). Moreover, tranexamic acid (MD: −12.07, 95% CrI: −21.68 to −2.29) reduced the hematoma volume to a greater extent than goreisan. No significant differences were detected between drugs and placebo with regard to a good recovery. In terms of safety, dexamethasone (RR: 1.96, 95% CrI: 1.20–3.28) increased the risk of mortality compared to placebo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: These findings suggest that dexamethasone is the best treatment to reduce recurrence and atorvastatin is the best treatment to reduce hematoma volume in patients with CSDH. However, clinicians should pay close attention to the elevated risk of all-cause mortality and potential adverse events caused by dexamethasone. Future well-designed RCTs with more participants are needed to verify these findings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clinical Trial Registration:http://osf.io/u9hqp.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Circulating CircRNAs Panel Acts as a Biomarker for the Early Diagnosis and Severity of Parkinson’s Disease</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.684289</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a chronic and progressive degenerative disease of the central nervous system. Degenerative neuropathy can occur in patients with PD even before typical clinical symptoms appear in the preclinical stage. Therefore, if the early diagnosis of degenerative diseases can be timely and the correlation with the disease progression can be explored, the disease progression will be slowed down and the quality of life of patients will be improved. In this study, the circRNA microarray was employed to screen the dysregulated circRNA in plasma samples of PD. Four circRNAs (circ_0085869, circ_0004381, circ_0017204, and circ_0090668) were obtained with increased levels in PD patients by cross comparison and preliminary verification in PD comparing with healthy controls. Further validation found the circRNA panel was consistent with the training set. The ROC curve also revealed a high diagnostic ability of circ_0004381 and circ_0017204 in predicting the early stage of PD from healthy controls. circ_0085869, circ_0004381, circ_0017204, and circ_0090668 also presented a high ability to distinguish the late stage of PD from early stage. In conclusion, circulating circRNA panel might be a potential fingerprint for predicting the early diagnosis of PD and may act as a biomarker for disease progression.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.676827</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Objective: This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to assess the effects of the combination of acupuncture-related therapies with conventional medication compared with conventional medication in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: A literature search within eight databases [including Medline, Embase, the Cochrane Library, PubMed, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), China Biology Medicine (CBM), VIP, and Wanfang Database] was performed covering a time frame from their inception to August 2020. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing acupuncture-related therapies combined with conventional medication vs. conventional medication in patients with PD were eligible. Two authors independently assessed the risk of bias. Assessments were performed with the total and subscales scores of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS), 39-item Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire (PDQ-39), the dosage of Madopar, Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), and 17-item Hamilton Depression Scale (HAMD). Data were analyzed by adopting the Cochrane Collaboration's RevMan 5.4 (Review Man, Copenhagen, Denmark); and mean effect sizes and 95% confidence intervals were estimated. Tests for heterogeneity were used to assess differences in treatment effects across different types of acupuncture used.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Sixty-six trials met the inclusion criteria, of which 61 trials provided data for the meta-analysis. We defined high-quality articles as those with a low risk of bias in four or more domains; and only 10 (15.15%) articles were of high quality. Compared with the controls, acupuncture-related therapies with conventional medication achieved a benefit in the primary outcomes of UPDRS (motor subscore: −3.90, −4.33 to −3.49, P &amp;lt; 0.01; total score: −7.37 points, −8.91 to −5.82, P &amp;lt; 0.001; activities of daily living subscore: −3.96, −4.96 to −2.95, P &amp;lt; 0.01). For the subgroup difference test among the effects of different acupuncture methods, significant differences existed in outcomes with the UPDRS-III, UPDRS-I, UPDRS-IV, and PDQ-39 scores and Madopar dosage, while non-significant differences existed with the UPDRS-total, UPDRS-II, HAMD, and MMSE scores.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: Acupuncture-related therapies combined with conventional medication may benefit individuals with PD. Our review findings should be considered with caution because of the methodological weaknesses in the included trials. Future, large randomized trials of acupuncture-related therapies for PD with high methodological quality are warranted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Systematic Review Registration: Identifier CRD42021228110.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Intermittent Hypoxia Training Prevents Deficient Learning-Memory Behavior in Mice Modeling Alzheimer's Disease: A Pilot Study</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.674688</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In mouse models of Alzheimer's disease (AD), normobaric intermittent hypoxia training (IHT) can preserve neurobehavioral function when applied before deficits develop, but IHT's effectiveness after onset of amyloid-β (Aβ) accumulation is unclear. This study tested the hypothesis that IHT improves learning-memory behavior, diminishes Aβ accumulation in cerebral cortex and hippocampus, and enhances cerebrocortical contents of the neuroprotective trophic factors erythropoietin and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in mice manifesting AD traits. Twelve-month-old female 3xTg-AD mice were assigned to untreated 3xTg-AD (n = 6), AD+IHT (n = 6), and AD+sham-IHT (n = 6) groups; 8 untreated wild-type (WT) mice also were studied. AD+IHT mice alternately breathed 10% O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; for 6 min and room air for 4 min, 10 cycles/day for 21 days; AD+sham-IHT mice breathed room air. Spatial learning-memory was assessed by Morris water maze. Cerebrocortical and hippocampal Aβ&lt;sub&gt;40&lt;/sub&gt; and Aβ&lt;sub&gt;42&lt;/sub&gt; contents were determined by ELISA, and cerebrocortical erythropoietin and BDNF were analyzed by immunoblotting and ELISA. The significance of time (12 vs. 12 months + 21 days) and treatment (IHT vs. sham-IHT) was evaluated by two-factor ANOVA. The change in swimming distance to find the water maze platform after 21 d IHT (−1.6 ± 1.8 m) differed from that after sham-IHT (+5.8 ± 2.6 m). Cerebrocortical and hippocampal Aβ&lt;sub&gt;42&lt;/sub&gt; contents were greater in 3xTg-AD than WT mice, but neither time nor treatment significantly affected Aβ&lt;sub&gt;40&lt;/sub&gt; or Aβ&lt;sub&gt;42&lt;/sub&gt; contents in the 3xTg-AD mice. Cerebrocortical erythropoietin and BDNF contents increased appreciably after IHT as compared to untreated 3xTg-AD and AD+sham-IHT mice. In conclusion, moderate, normobaric IHT prevented spatial learning-memory decline and restored cerebrocortical erythropoietin and BDNF contents despite ongoing Aβ accumulation in 3xTg-AD mice.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: A novel mitochondrial Kv1.3–caveolin axis controls cell survival and apoptosis</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/69099</link>
	<content:encoded>The voltage-gated potassium channel Kv1.3 plays an apparent dual physiological role by participating in activation and proliferation of leukocytes as well as promoting apoptosis in several types of tumor cells. Therefore, Kv1.3 is considered a potential pharmacological target for immunodeficiency and cancer. Different cellular locations of Kv1.3, at the plasma membrane or the mitochondria, could be responsible for such duality. While plasma membrane Kv1.3 facilitates proliferation, the mitochondrial channel modulates apoptotic signaling. Several molecular determinants of Kv1.3 drive the channel to the cell surface, but no information is available about its mitochondrial targeting. Caveolins, which are able to modulate cell survival, participate in the plasma membrane targeting of Kv1.3. The channel, via a caveolin-binding domain (CDB), associates with caveolin 1 (Cav1), which localizes Kv1.3 to lipid raft membrane microdomains. The aim of our study was to understand the role of such interactions not only for channel targeting but also for cell survival in mammalian cells. By using a caveolin association-deficient channel (Kv1.3 CDB&lt;i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;less&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/i&gt;), we demonstrate here that while the Kv1.3–Cav1 interaction is responsible for the channel localization in the plasma membrane, a lack of such interaction accumulates Kv1.3 in the mitochondria. Kv1.3 CDB&lt;i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;less&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/i&gt; severely affects mitochondrial physiology and cell survival, indicating that a functional link of Kv1.3 with Cav1 within the mitochondria modulates the pro-apoptotic effects of the channel. Therefore, the balance exerted by these two complementary mechanisms fine-tune the physiological role of Kv1.3 during cell survival or apoptosis. Our data highlight an unexpected role for the mitochondrial caveolin–Kv1.3 axis during cell survival and apoptosis.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/68203</link>
	<content:encoded>Quantitative trait locus mapping for interleukin-1β release after inflammasome priming and activation was performed on bone-marrow-derived macrophages (BMDM) from an AKRxDBA/2 mouse strain intercross. The strongest associated locus mapped very close to the &lt;i&gt;Pycard&lt;/i&gt; gene on chromosome 7, which codes for the inflammasome adaptor protein apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD (ASC). The DBA/2 and AKR &lt;i&gt;Pycard&lt;/i&gt; genes only differ at a single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in their 3’ untranslated region (UTR). DBA/2 vs. AKR BMDM had increased levels of &lt;i&gt;Pycard&lt;/i&gt; mRNA expression and ASC protein, and increased inflammasome speck formation, which was associated with increased &lt;i&gt;Pycard&lt;/i&gt; mRNA stability without an increased transcription rate. CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing was performed on DBA/2 embryonic stem cells to change the &lt;i&gt;Pycard&lt;/i&gt; 3’UTR SNP from the DBA/2 to the AKR allele. This single base change significantly reduced &lt;i&gt;Pycard&lt;/i&gt; expression and inflammasome activity after cells were differentiated into macrophages due to reduced &lt;i&gt;Pycard&lt;/i&gt; mRNA stability.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/66687</link>
	<content:encoded>Enterovirus D68 (EV-D68) has been implicated in outbreaks of severe respiratory illness and is associated with acute flaccid myelitis (AFM). EV-D68 is often detected in patient respiratory samples but has also been detected in stool and wastewater, suggesting the potential for both respiratory and enteric routes of transmission. Here, we used a panel of EV-D68 isolates, including a historical pre-2014 isolate and multiple contemporary isolates from AFM outbreak years, to define the dynamics of viral replication and the host response to infection in primary human airway cells and stem cell-derived enteroids. We show that some recent EV-D68 isolates have decreased sensitivity to acid and temperature compared with earlier isolates and that the respiratory, but not intestinal, epithelium induces a robust type III interferon (IFN) response that restricts infection. Our findings define the differential responses of the respiratory and intestinal epithelium to contemporary EV-D68 isolates and suggest that a subset of isolates have the potential to target both the human airway and gastrointestinal tracts.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/66175</link>
	<content:encoded>Animals learn certain complex tasks remarkably fast, sometimes after a single experience. What behavioral algorithms support this efficiency? Many contemporary studies based on two-alternative-forced-choice (2AFC) tasks observe only slow or incomplete learning. As an alternative, we study the unconstrained behavior of mice in a complex labyrinth and measure the dynamics of learning and the behaviors that enable it. A mouse in the labyrinth makes ~2000 navigation decisions per hour. The animal explores the maze, quickly discovers the location of a reward, and executes correct 10-bit choices after only 10 reward experiences - a learning rate 1000-fold higher than in 2AFC experiments. Many mice improve discontinuously from one minute to the next, suggesting moments of sudden insight about the structure of the labyrinth. The underlying search algorithm does not require a global memory of places visited and is largely explained by purely local turning rules.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: Hepatoenteric recycling is a new disposition mechanism for orally administered phenolic drugs and phytochemicals in rats</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/58820</link>
	<content:encoded>Many orally administered phenolic drugs undergo enterohepatic recycling (EHR), presumably mediated by the hepatic phase II enzymes. However, the disposition of extrahepatically generated phase II metabolites is unclear. This paper aims to determine the new roles of liver and intestine in the disposition of oral phenolics. Sixteen representative phenolics were tested using direct portal vein infusion and/or intestinal perfusion. The results showed that certain glucuronides were efficiently recycled by liver. OATP1B1/1B3/2B1 were the responsible uptake transporters. Hepatic uptake is the rate-limiting step in hepatic recycling. Our findings showed that the disposition of many oral phenolics is mediated by intestinal glucuronidation and hepatic recycling. A new disposition mechanism ‘Hepatoenteric Recycling (HER)”, where intestine is the metabolic organ and liver is the recycling organ, was revealed. Further investigations focusing on HER should help interpret how intestinal aliments or co-administered drugs that alter gut enzymes (e.g. UGTs) expression/activities will impact the disposition of phenolics.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Neural circuits must both function reliably and flexibly adapt to changes in their environment. We studied how both biological neurons and computational models respond to high potassium concentrations. Pyloric neurons of the crab stomatogastric ganglion (STG) initially become quiescent, then recover spiking activity in high potassium saline. The neurons retain this adaptation and recover more rapidly in subsequent high potassium applications, even after hours in control saline. We constructed a novel activity-dependent computational model that qualitatively captures these results. In this model, regulation of conductances is gated on and off depending on how far the neuron is from its target activity. This allows the model neuron to retain a trace of past perturbations even after it returns to its target activity in control conditions. Thus, perturbation, followed by recovery of normal activity, can hide cryptic changes in neuronal properties that are only revealed by subsequent perturbations.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Dopamine D1 receptor activation and cAMP/PKA signalling mediate Brd4 recruitment to chromatin to regulate gene expression in rat striatal neurons</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.07.01.450754v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>The activity of striatal medium-spiny projection neurons is regulated by dopamine acting principally at D1 and D2 dopamine receptors. The dopamine D1 receptor (D1R) is a Gs/olf-coupled GPCR which activates a cAMP/PKA/DARPP-32 signalling cascade that increases excitability and facilitates plasticity, partly through the regulation of transcription. Transcriptional regulation downstream of the D1R involves the activation of PKA, which can translocate to the nucleus to phosphorylate various targets. The chromatin reader Brd4 regulates transcription induced by neurotrophic factors in cortical neurons and has also been implicated in dopamine-dependent striatal functions. Brd4 is activated by phosphorylation; this facilitates its binding to acetylated histones at promoters and enhancers. In non-neuronal cells, Brd4 is recruited to chromatin in response to PKA signalling. However, it is unknown whether Brd4 is involved in transcriptional activation by the D1R in striatal neurons. Here, we demonstrate that cAMP/PKA signalling increases Brd4 recruitment to dopamine-induced genes in striatal neurons, and that knockdown or inhibition of Brd4 modulated D1R-induced gene expression. Specifically, inhibition of Brd4 with the bromodomain inhibitor JQ1 suppressed the expression of ~25% of D1R-upregulated genes, while increasing the expression of a subset of immediate-early genes, including Fos and Jun. This pro-transcriptional effect of JQ1 was P-TEFb-dependent, and mediated through inhibition of the BD1 bromodomain of Brd4. Finally, we report that JQ1 treatment downregulated expression of many GPCRs and also impaired ERK1/2 signalling in striatal neurons. Our findings identify Brd4 as a novel regulator of D1R-dependent transcription and delineate complex bi-directional effects of bromodomain inhibitors on neuronal transcription.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.07.01.450751v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>In retinal neurons, morphology strongly influences visual response features. Ganglion cell (GC) dendrites ramify in distinct strata of the inner plexiform layer (IPL) so that GCs responding to light increments (ON) or decrements (OFF) receive appropriate excitatory inputs. This vertical stratification prescribes response polarity and ensures consistent connectivity between cell types, whereas the lateral extent of GC dendritic arbors typically dictates receptive field (RF) size. Here, we identify circuitry in mouse retina that contradicts these conventions. A2 amacrine cells are interneurons understood to mediate 'cross-over' inhibition by relaying excitatory input from the ON layer to inhibitory outputs in the OFF layer. Ultrastructural and physiological analyses show, however, that some A2s deliver powerful inhibition to OFF GC somas and proximal dendrites in the ON layer, rendering their inhibitory RFs smaller than their dendritic arbors. This OFF pathway, avoiding entirely the OFF region of the IPL, challenges several tenets of retinal circuitry.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.07.01.450734v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>This magnetoencephalography (MEG) study aimed at characterizing the spectro-temporal dynamics of brain oscillatory activity elicited by sentence completion (SC). For that purpose, we adapted a version of the SC experimental paradigm typically used in functional magnetic resonance imaging to MEG investigation constraints. Twenty right-handed healthy young adults underwent MEG recordings while they were sequentially presented with short sentences divided in three parts: the first two giving context and the last requiring completion. MEG data were then analysed using a prior-free, non-parametric statistical approach with stringent control of the family-wise error rate. We identified three successive significant neural response patterns associated with distinct spatial and spectro-temporal characteristics: (i) an early (&amp;lt;300 ms) bioccipital 4-10-Hz event-related synchronization (ERS); (ii) an intermediate (at about 400 ms) 8-30-Hz event-related desynchronization (ERD) in an extended semantic network involving the ventral language stream as well as bilateral posterior nodes of the default mode network (DMN) in both hemispheres; (iii) a late (&amp;gt;800 ms) 8-30 Hz ERD involving the left dorsal language stream. Furthermore, the left component of the ventral language stream displayed prolonged ERD after 800 ms compared to the right which showed signs of inhibition in the form of ERS. Overall, this study elucidates the dynamics of the recruitment of the language network that accompany SC and the spectro-temporal signature of an extended semantic network. This MEG adaptation of an SC paradigm also paves the way for novel approaches in presurgical language mapping and may help to understand the neural underpinnings of the alterations of sentence completion in various neurologic disorders affecting language.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>The human hippocampal formation plays a central role in Alzheimer's disease (AD) progression, cognitive traits, and the onset of dementia; yet its molecular states in AD remain uncharacterized. Here, we report a comprehensive single-cell transcriptomic dissection of the human hippocampus and entorhinal cortex across 489,558 cells from 65 individuals with varying stages of AD pathology. We transcriptionally characterize major brain cell types and neuronal classes, including 17 glutamatergic and 8 GABAergic neuron subpopulations. Combining evidence from human and mouse tissue-microdissection, neuronal cell isolation and spatial transcriptomics, we show that single-cell expression patterns capture fine-resolution neuronal anatomical topography. By stratifying subjects into early and late pathology groups, we uncover stage-dependent and cell-type specific transcriptional modules altered during AD progression. These include early-stage cell-type specific dysregulation of cellular and cholesterol metabolism, late-stage neuron-glia alterations in neurotransmission, and late-stage signatures of cellular stress, apoptosis, and DNA damage broadly shared across cell types. Late-stage signatures show signs of convergence in hippocampal and cortical cells, while early changes diverge; highlighting the relevance of characterizing molecular pathology across brain regions and AD progression. Finally, we characterize neuron subregion-specific responses to AD pathology and show that CA1 pyramidal neurons are the most transcriptionally altered while CA3 and dentate gyrus granule neurons the least. Our study provides a valuable resource to extend cell type-specific studies of AD to clinically relevant brain regions affected early by pathology in disease progression.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.07.01.450665v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>During aging, iron accumulates in brain's regions vulnerable to neurodegeneration: the cerebral cortex and the hippocampus. However, the mechanism of iron regulation in the brain remains scarce. Here, we demonstrated for the first time the involvement of the Hepcidin/Ferroportin1 pathway in brain iron metabolism during aging. We demonstrated the alteration of BBB integrity, that leads to increased iron permeability and deregulation of iron homeostasis during aging. We found that brain iron overload drives Hepcidin upregulation and, consequently, the inhibition of the iron exporter Ferroportin1, neuroinflammation and oxidative stress. Moreover, both in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus Ferroportin1 colocalizes with astrocytes, while the iron storage protein ferritin light-chain with neurons. This differential distribution suggests that astrocytes mediate iron shuttling and neurons are unable to metabolize it. Furthermore, we observed NCOA4-dependent ferritinophagy of ferritin heavy-chain isoforms determining the increase of light-chain enriched ferritin heteropolymers that are more efficient as iron chelators. Altogether, these data highlight the involvement of the Hepcidin/Ferroportin1 axis and NCOA4 during mice aging as a response to a higher iron influx to the brain</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.07.01.450600v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>GABAA receptors mediate rapid responses to the neurotransmitter GABA and are robust regulators of the brain and spinal cord neural networks that control locomotor behaviors, such as walking and swimming. In developing zebrafish, gross pharmacological blockade of these receptors causes hyperactive swimming, which has been embraced as an epilepsy model. Although GABAA receptors are important to control locomotor behavior, the large number of subunits and homeostatic compensatory mechanisms have challenged efforts to determine subunit-selective roles. To address this issue, we mutated each of the eight zebrafish GABAA  subunit genes individually and in pairs using a CRISPR-Cas9 somatic inactivation approach, then we examined the swimming behavior of the mutants at two developmental stages. We found that disrupting the expression of specific pairs of subunits resulted in different abnormalities in swimming behavior at the first development stage. Mutation of 4 and 5 selectively resulted in longer duration swimming episodes, mutations in 3 and 4 selectively caused excess, large-amplitude body flexions (C-bends), and mutation of 3 and 5 resulted in increases in both of these measures of hyperactivity. At the later stage of development, hyperactive phenotypes were nearly absent, suggesting that homeostatic compensation was able to overcome the disruption of even multiple subunits. Taken together, our results identify subunit-selective roles for GABAA 3, 4, and 5 in regulating locomotion. Given that these subunits exhibit spatially restricted expression patterns, these results provide a foundation to identify neurons and GABAergic networks that control discrete aspects of locomotor behavior.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.06.30.450653v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>A fundamental principle of biological motor control is that the neural commands driving movement must conform to the response properties of the motor plants they control. In the oculomotor system, characterizations of oculomotor plant dynamics traditionally supported models in which the plant responds to neural drive to extraocular muscles on exclusively short, subsecond timescales. These models predict that the stabilization of gaze during fixations between saccades requires neural drive that approximates eye position on longer timescales and is generated through the temporal integration of brief eye velocity-encoding signals that cause saccades. However, recent measurements of oculomotor plant behaviour have revealed responses on longer timescales, and measurements of firing patterns in the oculomotor integrator have revealed a more complex encoding of eye movement dynamics. Here we use measurements from new and published experiments in the larval zebrafish to link dynamics in the oculomotor plant to dynamics in the neural integrator. The oculomotor plant in both anaesthetized and awake larval zebrafish was characterized by a broad distribution of response timescales, including those much longer than one second. Analysis of the firing patterns of oculomotor integrator neurons, which exhibited a broadly distributed range of decay time constants, demonstrates the sufficiency of this activity for stabilizing gaze given an oculomotor plant with distributed response timescales. This work suggests that leaky integration on multiple, distributed timescales by the oculomotor integrator reflects an inverse model for generating oculomotor commands, and that multi-timescale dynamics may be a general feature of motor circuitry.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.06.30.450615v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>A growing number of gain-of-function (GOF) BK channelopathy have been identified in patients with epilepsy and paroxysmal movement disorders. Nevertheless, the underlying pathophysiology and corresponding therapeutics remain obscure. Here we utilized a knock-in mouse model carrying human BK-D434G channelopathy to investigate the neuronal mechanism of BK GOF in the pathogenesis of epilepsy and movement disorders. We found that the BK-D434G mice manifest the clinical features of absence epilepsy and exhibit severe motor deficits. BK-D434G mutation causes hyperexcitability of cortical pyramidal neurons and cerebellar Purkinje cells, which contributes to the pathogenesis of absence seizures and the motor defects, respectively. A BK channel blocker paxilline potently suppresses BK-D434G-induced hyperexcitability and effectively mitigates absence seizures in mice. Our study thus uncovered a neuronal mechanism of BK GOF in absence epilepsy and provided the evidence that BK inhibition is a promising therapeutic strategy to mitigate BK GOF-induced neurological disorders.</content:encoded>

Using motion energy analysis, we extracted a time-series representing participants' velocity, and showed a positive relationship between liking and the level of synchronization, complexity, and novelty. Moreover, we found that people create novel and challenging interactions, even though they pay a price - being less synchronized. Thus, we propose that balancing between being synchronized and generating novel and challenging interactions, rather than merely maximizing synchronization, optimizes the interaction quality.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.06.30.450605v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Noninvasive brain stimulation using focused ultrasound (FUS) has many potential applications as a research and clinical tool, including incorporation into neural prosthetics for cognitive rehabilitation. To develop this technology, it is necessary to evaluate the safety and efficacy of FUS neuromodulation for specific brain targets and cognitive functions. It is also important to test whether repeated long-term application of FUS to deep brain targets improves or degrades behavioral and cognitive function. To this end, we investigated the effects of FUS in the dorsal striatum of nonhuman primates (NHP) performing a visual-motor decision-making task for small or large rewards. Over the course of 2 years, we performed 129 and 147 FUS applications, respectively, in two NHP. FUS (0.5 MHz @ 0.2 - 0.8 MPa) was applied to the putamen and caudate in both hemispheres to evaluate the effects on movement accuracy, motivation, decision accuracy, and response time. Sonicating the caudate or the putamen unilaterally resulted in modest but statistically significant improvements in motivation and decision accuracy, but at the cost of slower reaction times. The effects were dose (i.e., FUS pressure) and reward dependent. There was no effect on reaching accuracy, nor was there long-term behavioral impairment or neurological trauma evident on T1-weighted, T2-weighted, or susceptibility-weighted MRI scans. Sonication also resulted in significant changes in resting state functional connectivity between the caudate and multiple cortical regions. The results indicate that applying FUS to the dorsal striatum can positively impact the motivational and cognitive aspects of decision making. The capability of FUS to improve motivation and cognition in NHPs points to its therapeutic potential in treating a wide variety of human neural diseases, and warrants further development as a novel technique for non-invasive deep brain stimulation.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Analyses of intrinsic network activity have been instrumental in revealing cortical processes that are altered in chronic pain patients. However, such studies have not accounted for variable time courses of network activity and subjective pain experience. In a novel approach, we aimed to elucidate how intrinsic functional networks evolve in regard to the fluctuating intensity of the experience of chronic pain. In a longitudinal study with 156 fMRI sessions, 20 chronic back pain patients and 20 chronic migraine patients were asked to continuously rate the intensity of their endogenous pain. Using group independent component analysis and dual-regression, we extracted the time courses of 100 independent components separately for chronic back pain and chronic migraine. We investigated the relationship between the fluctuation of intrinsic network activity with the time course of subjective pain ratings. For chronic back pain, we found increased cortical network activity for the salience network and a local pontine network, as well as decreased network activity in the anterior and posterior default mode network for higher pain intensities. Higher pain intensities in chronic migraine were accompanied with lower activity in a prefrontal cortical network. By taking the perspective of the individual, we focused on the processes that matter for each patient, which are phases of relatively low pain and more straining phases of relatively high pain. The present design of ongoing assessment of the endogenous pain can be a powerful and promising tool to assess the signature of a patient's endogenous pain encoding over weeks and months.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Organization of the catecholaminergic system in the short-lived fish Nothobranchius furzeri</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.06.30.450602v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>The catecholaminergic system has received much attention based on its regulatory role in a wide range of brain functions and its relevance in aging and neurodegenerative diseases. In the present study, we analyzed the neuroanatomical distribution of catecholaminergic neurons based on tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) immunoreactivity in the brain of adult Nothobranchius furzeri. In the telencephalon, numerous TH+ neurons were observed in the olfactory bulbs and the ventral telencephalic area, arranged as strips extending through the rostrocaudal axis. We found the largest TH+ groups in the diencephalon at the preoptic region level, the ventral thalamus, the pretectal region, the posterior tuberculum, and the caudal hypothalamus. In the dorsal mesencephalic tegmentum, we identified a particular catecholaminergic group. The rostral rhombencephalon housed TH+ cells in the locus coeruleus and the medulla oblongata, distributing in a region dorsal to the inferior reticular formation, the vagal lobe, and the area postrema. Finally, scattered TH+ neurons were present in the ventral spinal cord and the retina. From a comparative perspective, the overall organization of catecholaminergic neurons is consistent with the general pattern reported for other teleosts. However, Nothobranchius furzeri shows some particular features, including the presence of catecholaminergic cells in the midbrain. This work provides a detailed neuroanatomical map of the catecholaminergic system of Nothobranchius furzeri, a powerful aging model, also contributing to the phylogenetic understanding of one of the most ancient neurochemical systems.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Genome-wide association study and functional validation implicates JADE1 in tauopathy</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.06.30.450599v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Primary age-related tauopathy (PART) is a neurodegenerative tauopathy with features distinct from but also overlapping with Alzheimer disease (AD). While both exhibit Alzheimer-type temporal lobe neurofibrillary degeneration alongside amnestic cognitive impairment, PART develops independently of amyloid-{beta} (A{beta}) deposition in plaques. The pathogenesis of PART is unknown, but evidence suggests it is associated with genes that promote tau pathology as well as others that protect from A{beta} toxicity. Here, we performed a genetic association study in an autopsy cohort of individuals with PART (n=647) using Braak neurofibrillary tangle stage as a quantitative trait adjusting for sex, age, genotyping platform, and principal components. We found significant associations with some candidate loci associated with AD and progressive supranuclear palsy, a primary tauopathy (SLC24A4, MS4A6A, HS3ST1, MAPT and EIF2AK3). Genome-wide association analysis revealed a novel significant association with a single nucleotide polymorphism on chromosome 4 (rs56405341) in a locus containing three genes, including JADE1 which was significantly upregulated in tangle-bearing neurons by single-soma RNA-seq. Immunohistochemical studies using antisera targeting JADE1 protein revealed localization within tau aggregates in autopsy brain from tauopathies containing isoforms with four microtubule-binding domain repeats (4R) and mixed 3R/4R, but not with 3R exclusively. Co-immunoprecipitation revealed a direct and specific binding of JADE1 protein to tau containing four (4R) and no N-terminal inserts (0N4R) in post-mortem human PART brain tissue. Finally, knockdown of the Drosophila JADE1 homolog rhinoceros (rno) enhanced tau-induced toxicity and apoptosis in vivo in a humanized 0N4R mutant tau knock-in model as quantified by rough eye phenotype and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end-labeling (TUNEL) in the fly brain. Together, these findings indicate that PART has a genetic architecture that partially overlaps with AD and other tauopathies and suggests a novel role for JADE1 as a mediator of neurofibrillary degeneration.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Intrinsic Network Connectivity Reflects the Cyclic Trajectory of Migraine Attacks</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.06.30.450593v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Background. Episodic migraine is considered to be cyclic in nature, triggered by the hypothalamus. To assess the natural trajectory of intrinsic networks over an entire migraine cycle, we designed a longitudinal intra-individual study using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Methods. Intrinsic network connectivity was assessed for 12 migraineurs in 82 sessions including spontaneous, untriggered headache attacks and follow-up recordings towards the next attack. Results. We found cyclic changes in the visual, auditory, and somatosensory networks, in limbic networks (e.g. thalamo-insular, parahippocampal), and in the salience network (anterior insula and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex). Connectivity changes also extended to further cortical networks, such as the central executive network, the default mode network, as well as subcortical networks. Almost all of these network connectivity changes followed the trajectory of a linear increase over the pain-free interval that peaked immediately prior to the headache, and &quot;dropped&quot; to the baseline level during the headache. These network alterations are associated with a number of cortical functions that may explain the variety of ictal and pre-ictal physiological and psychological migraine symptoms. Conclusion. Our results suggest that migraine disease is associated with widespread cyclic alterations of intrinsic networks that develop before the headache is initiated, i.e. during the interictal and premonitory phase. The increasing magnitude of connectivity within these networks towards the next attack may reflect an increasing effort to maintain network integrity.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Intrinsic Network Activity Reflects the Fluctuating Experience of Tonic Pain</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.06.30.450591v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Although we know sensation is continuous, research on long-lasting and continuously changing stimuli is scarce and the dynamic nature of ongoing cortical processing is largely neglected. In a longitudinal study with 152 fMRI sessions, participants were asked to continuously rate the intensity of applied tonic heat pain for 20 minutes. Using group independent component analysis and dual-regression, we extracted the subjects' time courses of intrinsic network activity. The relationship between the dynamic fluctuation of network activity with the varying time courses of three pain processing entities was computed: pain intensity, the direction of pain intensity changes and temperature. We were able to dissociate the spatio-temporal patterns of objective (temperature) and subjective (pain intensity/changes of pain intensity) aspects of pain processing in the human brain. We found two somatosensory networks with distinct functions: one network which encodes the small fluctuations in temperature and consists mainly of bilateral SI. A second right-lateralised network that encodes the intensity of the subjective experience of pain consists of SI, SII, the PCC, and the thalamus. We revealed the somatosensory dynamics that build up towards a current subjective percept of pain. The timing suggests a cascade of subsequent processing steps towards the current pain percept.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Vitamin D modulates cortical transcriptome and behavioral phenotypes in an Mecp2 heterozygous Rett syndrome mouse model</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.06.30.450587v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Rett syndrome (RTT) is an X-linked neurological disorder caused by mutations in the transcriptional regulator MECP2. Mecp2 loss-of-function leads to the disruption of many cellular pathways, including aberrant activation of the NF-{kappa}B pathway. Genetically attenuating the NF-{kappa}B pathway in Mecp2-null mice ameliorates hallmark phenotypes of RTT, including reduced dendritic complexity, raising the question of whether NF-{kappa}B pathway inhibitors could provide a therapeutic avenue for RTT. Vitamin D is a known inhibitor of NF-{kappa}B signaling; further, vitamin D deficiency is prevalent in RTT patients and male Mecp2-null mice. We previously demonstrated that vitamin D rescues the aberrant NF-{kappa}B activity and reduced neurite outgrowth of Mecp2-knockdown cortical neurons in vitro, and that dietary vitamin D supplementation rescues decreased dendritic complexity and soma size of neocortical projection neurons in both male hemizygous Mecp2-null and female heterozygous mice in vivo. Here, we have identified over 200 genes whose dysregulated expression in the Mecp2+/- cortex is modulated by dietary vitamin D. Genes normalized with vitamin D supplementation are involved in dendritic complexity, synapses, and neuronal projections, suggesting that the rescue of their expression could underpin the rescue of neuronal morphology. Further, motor and anxiety-like behavioral phenotypes in Mecp2+/- mice correlate with circulating vitamin D levels, and there is a disruption in the homeostasis of the vitamin D synthesis pathway in Mecp2+/- mice. Thus, our data indicate that vitamin D modulates RTT pathology and its supplementation could provide a simple and cost-effective partial therapeutic for RTT.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.06.30.450586v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>The experience of pain has been dissociated into two interwoven aspects: a sensory-discriminative aspect assessed in ratings of pain intensity and an affective-motivational aspect assessed in ratings of unpleasantness. In a pain attenuation paradigm, participants were asked to evaluate applied cold pain. The majority of the trials showed a distinct rating: Some trials were rated higher for unpleasantness, others were rated higher for intensity. Using linear mixed effect models on single trials, we related the variable difference between unpleasantness and intensity ratings to functional MRI data. The direct comparison revealed a stronger relationship between cortical data and pain ratings for unpleasantness. No region showed a stronger effect for pain intensity. The present study underlines the importance of the emotional-affective aspects of pain-related cortical processes in the brain. These findings reflect the biological function of the pain system to prevent harm and to preserve the physical integrity of the body.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Individually Unique Dynamics of Cortical Connectivity Reflect the Ongoing Intensity of Chronic Pain</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.06.30.450553v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Background. Chronic pain diseases are characterised by an ongoing and fluctuating endogenous pain, yet it remains to be elucidated how this is reflected by the dynamics of ongoing functional cortical connections. The present study addresses this disparity by taking the individual perspective of pain patients into account, which is the varying intensity of endogenous pain. Methods. To this end, we investigated the cortical encoding of 20 chronic back pain patients and 20 chronic migraineurs in four repeated fMRI sessions. During the recording, the patients were asked to continuously rate their pain intensity. A brain parcellation approach subdivided the whole brain into 408 regions. A 10 s sliding-window connectivity analysis computed the pair-wise and time-varying connectivity between all brain regions across the entire recording period. Linear mixed effects models were fitted for each pair of brain regions to explore the relationship between cortical connectivity and the observed trajectory of the patients' fluctuating endogenous pain. Results. Two pain processing entities were taken into account: pain intensity (high, middle, low pain) and the direction of pain intensity changes (rising vs. falling pain). Overall, we found that periods of high and increasing pain were predominantly related to low cortical connectivity. For chronic back pain this applies to the pain intensity-related connectivity for limbic and cingulate areas, and for the precuneus. The change of pain intensity was subserved by connections in left parietal opercular regions, right insular regions, as well as large parts of the parietal, cingular and motor cortices. The change of pain intensity direction in chronic migraine was reflected by decreasing connectivity between the anterior insular cortex and orbitofrontal areas, as well as between the PCC and frontal and ACC regions. Conclusions. Interestingly, the group results were not mirrored by the individual patterns of pain-related connectivity, which is suggested to deny the idea of a common neuronal core problem for chronic pain diseases. In a similar vein, our findings are supported by the experience of clinicians, who encounter patients with a unique composition of characteristics: personality traits, various combinations of symptoms, and a wide range of individual responses to treatment. The diversity of the individual cortical signatures of chronic pain encoding results adds to the understanding of chronic pain as a complex and multifaceted disease. The present findings support recent developments for more personalised medicine.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Sleep deprivation reduces the density of individual spine subtypes in a branch-specific fashion in CA1 neurons</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.06.30.450529v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Sleep deprivation has a negative impact on hippocampus-dependent memory, which are thought to depend on cellular plasticity. We previously found that five hours of sleep deprivation robustly decreases dendritic spine density in the CA1 area of the hippocampus in adult male mice. However, recent work by others suggests that sleep deprivation increases the density of certain spine types on specific dendritic branches. Based on these recent findings and our previous work, we conducted a more in-depth analysis of different spine types on branches 1, 2 and 5 of both apical and basal dendrites to assess whether five hours of sleep deprivation may have previously unrecognized spine-type and branch-specific effects. This analysis shows no spine-type specific changes on branch 1 and 2 of apical dendrites after sleep deprivation. In contrast, sleep deprivation decreases the number of mushroom and branched spines on branch 5. Likewise, sleep deprivation reduces thin, mushroom, and filopodia spine density on branch 5 of the basal dendrites, without affecting spines on branch 1 and 2. Our findings indicate that sleep deprivation leads to local branch-specific reduction in the density of individual spine types, and that local effects might not reflect the overall impact of sleep deprivation on CA1 structural plasticity. Moreover, our analysis underscores that focusing on a subset of dendritic branches may lead to potential misinterpretation of the overall impact of in this case sleep deprivation on structural plasticity.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.06.30.450520v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>The functional significance of BOLD signals in white matter (WM) remains unclear. The current study investigated whether 7T BOLD fMRI signal from visual WM tracts contains high fidelity retinotopic information and whether it correlates with the effective connectivity between visual areas. Population receptive field (pRF) analysis of the 7T retinotopy dataset from the Human Connectome Project revealed clear contralateral retinotopic representations from two visual WM bundles: optic radiation (OR) and vertical occipital fasciculus (VOF). The retinotopic organization of OR is consistent with post-mortem studies. The pRF size of WM voxels also increases with eccentricity. Based on the retinotopic maps of OR, we investigated whether BOLD signals in OR during visual stimulation are related to the resting-state effective connectivity between the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) and the primary visual cortex (V1). Results show that visually-evoked BOLD responses in OR correlate with the feedforward and feedback connectivity between the LGN and V1 during resting state. These findings demonstrate that WM BOLD signals contain high fidelity information such as visual field maps, and also predict the functional connectivity of brain areas.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: The Ventral Midline Thalamus Mediates Successful Deliberation by Coordinating Prefrontal and Hippocampal Neural Activity</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.06.30.450519v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>When faced with difficult choices, the possible outcomes are considered through a process known as deliberation. In rats, deliberation can be reflected by pause-and-reorienting behaviors, better known as Vicarious Trial and Errors (VTEs). While VTEs are thought to require medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and dorsal hippocampal (dHPC) interactions, no work has demonstrated such a dual requirement. The nucleus reuniens (Re) of the ventral midline thalamus is anatomically connected with both the mPFC and dHPC, is required for HPC-dependent spatial memory tasks, and is critical for mPFC-dHPC neural synchronization. Currently, it is unclear if, or how, the Re is involved in deliberation. Therefore, by examining the role of the Re on VTE behaviors, we can better understand the anatomical and physiological mechanisms supporting deliberation. Here, we examined the impact of Re suppression on VTE behaviors and mPFC-dHPC theta synchrony during well-learned performance of a HPC-dependent delayed alternation (DA) task. Pharmacological suppression of the Re increased VTE behaviors that resulted in erroneous choices. These errors were best characterized as perseverative behaviors, where at the decision-point, some rats repeatedly turned in the direction that previously yielded no reward, while simultaneously deliberating. These failed deliberations were associated with a reduction in mPFC-dHPC theta coherence at the choice-point. Importantly, the reduction in mPFC-dHPC theta synchrony observed during VTE behaviors was almost entirely driven by Re-suppression induced changes to the mPFC theta oscillation. Our findings suggest that the Re is important for successful deliberation, and mPFC-dHPC interactions, by coordinating local theta oscillations in the mPFC.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.06.30.450513v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Genetic risk variants in YWHAZ, encoding 14-3-{zeta}, have been found to contribute to psychiatric disorders such as autism spectrum disorder and schizophrenia, and have been related to an impaired neurodevelopment in humans and mice. Here, we have used a zebrafish model to further understand the mechanisms by which YWHAZ contribute to neurodevelopmental disorders. We first observed pan-neuronal expression of ywhaz during developmental stages, suggesting an important role of this gene in neural development. During adulthood ywhaz expression was restricted to Purkinje cells in the cerebellum, a region that shows alterations in autistic patients. We then established a novel stable ywhaz knockout (KO) zebrafish line using CRISPR/Cas9 genome engineering. We performed whole-brain calcium imaging in wild-type (WT) and ywhaz KO larvae and found altered neural activity and functional connectivity in the hindbrain. Interestingly, adult ywhaz KO fish also display decreased levels of dopamine and serotonin in the hindbrain and freeze when exposed to novel stimuli, a phenotype that can be reversed with fluoxetine and quinpirole, drugs that target serotonin and dopamine neurotransmission. Together, these findings suggest an important role for ywhaz in establishing neuronal connectivity during developmental stages. ywhaz deficiency leads to impaired dopamine and serotonin neurotransmission that may underlie the altered behaviour observed during adulthood.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.06.30.450495v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Microglia and astrocytes undertake numerous essential roles in nervous systems but we know little of their anatomical distribution within numerous nuclei. In the principal nuclei of the mammalian auditory midbrain, the inferior colliculi (IC), the cellular density and relative distribution of glutamate synthetase (GS) expressing astrocytes and ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule 1 (Iba1) expressing microglia is unknown. To address this, the IC of young adult, male Wistar rats were immunohistochemically labelled for GS and Iba1, using chromogenic methods. Sub-regions of imaged IC sections were demarked and soma density of both cell types determined. GS labelled somata were twice more densely packed as Iba1 labelled somata throughout IC parenchyma and peri-vascular regions. Furthermore, GS labelled somata density was significantly lower in dorsal cortex than external cortex or central nucleus. Iba1 labelled somata density exhibited the opposite trend, revealing an inverse density of these glial cell types between IC sub-regions. GS labelled neuropil was strongest in the cortices with and a gradual transition of lighter labelling towards central nucleus. These data provide the first detailed descriptions of GS labelling in IC and demonstrate sub-regional differences in IC glial cell density. Taken together, these findings suggest neurochemical specialization of glia in IC sub-regions, likely related to local physiological and metabolic demands, with implications for IC function.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.06.30.450484v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>High doses of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the main psychoactive component of cannabis, have been shown to have anxiogenic effects. Also, THC effects have been shown to be modulated by genotype, including the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs1130233 at the protein kinase AKT1 gene, a key component of the dopamine signaling cascade. As such, it is likely that epigenetic methylation around this SNP may affect AKT gene expression, which may in turn impact on the acute effects of THC on brain function. We investigated the genetic (AKT1 rs1130233) and epigenetic modulation of brain function during fear processing in a 2-session, double-blind, cross-over, randomized placebo-controlled THC administration, in 36 healthy males. Fear processing was assessed using an emotion (fear processing) paradigm, under functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Complete genetic and fMRI data was available for 34 participants. THC caused an increase in anxiety and transient psychotomimetic symptoms and para-hippocampal gyrus/ amygdala activation. Number of A alleles at the AKT1 rs1130233 SNP, and percentage methylation at the CpG11-12 site, were independently associated with a greater effect of THC on activation in a network of brain regions including left and right parahippocampal gyri, respectively. AKT1 rs1130233 moderation of the THC effect on left parahippocampal activation persisted after covarying for methylation percentage, and was partially mediated in sections of the left parahippocampal gyrus/ hippocampus by methylation percentage. These results may offer an example of how genetic and epigenetic variations influence the psychotomimetic and neurofunctional effects of THC.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.06.30.450477v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Objective: Inclusion body myositis (IBM) has an unclear molecular etiology due to the co-existence of characteristic cytotoxic T-cell activity and degeneration of muscle fibers. Using in-depth gene expression and splicing studies, we aimed at understanding the different components of the molecular pathomechanisms in IBM. Methods: We performed RNA-seq on total RNA extracted from skeletal muscle biopsies of clinically and histopathologically defined IBM (n=24), tibial muscular dystrophy (n=6), and histopathologically normal controls (n=9). In a comprehensive transcriptomics analysis, we analyzed the differential gene expression, differential splicing and exon usage, downstream pathway analysis, and the interplay between coding and non-coding RNAs (micro RNAs and long non-coding RNAs). Results: We observe IBM-specific dysregulation of genes involved in calcium homeostasis, particularly affecting the T-cell activity and regulation, causing disturbed Ca2+ induced apoptotic pathway of T cells in IBM muscles. Additionally, LCK/p56, which is an essential gene in regulating the fate of T-cell apoptosis, shows altered expression and splicing usage in IBM muscles. Interpretation: Our analysis provides a novel understanding of the molecular mechanisms in IBM by showing a detailed dysregulation of genes involved in calcium homeostasis and its effect on T-cell functioning in IBM muscles. Loss of T-cell regulation is hypothesized to be involved in the consistent observation of no response to immune therapies in IBM patients. Our results show that loss of apoptotic control of cytotoxic T cells in IBM could indeed be one component of their abnormal cytolytic activity in IBM muscles.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Early neuroadaptations to an obesogenic diet identify the schizophrenia-related ErbB4 receptor in obesity-induced hippocampal abnormalities</title>

	<content:encoded>Childhood obesity leads to hippocampal atrophy and altered cognition. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying these impairments are poorly understood. The neurotrophic factor neuregulin-1 (NRG1) and its cognate ErbB4 receptor play critical roles in hippocampal maturation and function. This study aimed to determine whether altered NRG1-ErbB4 activities may partly explain hippocampal abnormalities in rats exposed to an obesogenic Western-like diet (WD). Lewis rats were randomly divided into four groups (12 rats/group): 1) control diet+vehicle (CDV); 2) CD+NRG1 (CDN) (daily intraperitoneal injections: 5 g / kg / day; between postnatal day, PND 21-PND 41); 3) WD+VEH (WDV); 4) WD+NRG1 (WDN). Neurobehavioral assessments were performed at PND 43-49. Brains were harvested for MRI and molecular analyses at PND 49. We found that NRG1 administration reduced hippocampal volume (7%) and attenuated hippocampal-dependent cued fear conditioning in CD rats (56%). NRG1 administration reduced PSD-95 protein expression (30%) and selectively reduced hippocampal cytokine levels (IL-33, GM-CSF, CCL-2, IFN-{gamma}) while significantly impacting microglia morphology (increased span ratio and reduced circularity). WD rats exhibited reduced right hippocampal volume (7%), altered microglia morphology (reduced density and increased lacunarity), and increased levels of cytokines implicated in neuroinflammation (IL-1, TNF-, IL-6). Notably, NRG1 synergized with the WD to increase hippocampal ErbB4 phosphorylation and the tumor necrosis alpha converting enzyme (TACE/ADAM17) protein levels. Together, these data suggest a novel interaction between obesogenic diet exposure and TACE/ADAM17-NRG1-ErbB4 signaling during hippocampal maturation. Our results indicate that supraoptimal ErbB4 activities may contribute to the abnormal hippocampal structure and cognitive vulnerabilities observed in obese individuals.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Harnessing the Power of Sex Differences: What a Difference Ten Years Did Not Make</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.06.30.450396v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Sex differences exist in a variety of neurological and psychiatric diseases in terms of prevalence, manifestation, and treatment but most past research has been conducted in males. Multiple mandates have been initiated across funding agencies (National Institute of Health, Horizon Europe, Canadian Institute for Health Research) and scientific publishers (Sex and Gender Equity in Research) for biomedical and clinical research to include both males and females in research and reporting. Although more studies are including males and females in their research there are issues in how studies are incorporating males and females in their experiments, as about a third of studies that use males and females do not report sample size and only half are conducting any analysis by sex. Furthermore, what has been lacking in the literature is a detailed assessment of not only how sex is reported in papers (e.g. sample sizes disclosed, balanced design, sex used consistently throughout the experiments) but also how the variable sex is included in any analyses (e.g. covariate). Here we investigated all papers in 2009 and 2019 in three high ranking journals for each of Neuroscience and Psychiatry. We found that there was a 30% increase in the percentage of papers that included both sexes from 2009 to 2019 such that 68% of studies in Neuroscience and Psychiatry used both males and females in 2019. Despite this increase, in 2019 only 19% of all studies used an optimal design for discovery of possible sex differences and only 5% analyzed with sex as a discovery variable. Of the studies that used males and females - 25% of studies do not disclose sample sizes, 36% of studies used an unbalanced design, and 15% of studies did not use both sexes consistently throughout the paper. The percentage of single sex papers remains unchanged across the ten years at 3% for female-only studies compared to 27% for male-only studies across both disciplines. Neuroscience had fewer papers that analyzed by sex at 20% compared to 61% of Psychiatry papers. We hope that these data will make it evident that more needs to be done to improve the inclusion of males and females in future studies to improve the health of men and women.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.06.30.450390v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>The multifactorial etiology of stress-related disorders is a challenge in developing synchronized medical standards for treatment and diagnosis. It is largely unknown whether there exists molecular convergence in preclinical models of stress generated using disparate construct validity. Using RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq), we investigated the genomic signatures in the ventral hippocampus, which mostly regulates affective behavior, in mouse models that recapitulate the hallmarks of anxiety and depression. Chronic oral corticosterone (CORT), a model that causes a blunted endocrine response to stress, induced anxiety- and depression-like behavior in wildtype mice and mice heterozygous for the gene coding for brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) Val66Met, a variant associated with genetic susceptibility to stress. In a separate set of mice, chronic social defeat stress led to a susceptible or a resilient population, whose proportion was dependent on housing conditions, standard housing or enriched environment. A rank-rank-hypergeometric (RRHO) analysis of the RNA-seq data set across models demonstrated that in mice treated with CORT and susceptible mice raised in standard housing differentially expressed genes (DEGs) converged toward gene networks involved in similar biological functions. Weighted gene co-expression analysis generated 54 unique modules of interconnected gene hubs, two of which included a combination of all experimental groups and were significantly enriched in DEGs, whose function was consistent with that predicted in the RRHO GO analysis. This multimodel approach showed transcriptional synchrony between models of stress with hormonal, environmental or genetic construct validity shedding light on common genomic drivers that embody the multifaceted nature of stress-related disorders.</content:encoded>

The pig is commonly used as an experimental model of human heart disease, including for the study of mechanisms of arrhythmia. However, there exist differences between human and porcine cellular electrophysiology: The pig action potential (AP) has a deeper phase-1 notch, a longer duration at 50% repolarization, and higher plateau potentials than human. Ionic differences underlying the AP include larger rapid delayed-rectifier and smaller inward-rectifier K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-currents (I&lt;sub&gt;Kr&lt;/sub&gt; and I&lt;sub&gt;K1&lt;/sub&gt; respectively) in humans. AP steady-state rate-dependence and restitution is steeper in pigs. Porcine Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; transients can have two components, unlike human. Although a reliable computational model for human ventricular myocytes exists, one for pigs is lacking. This hampers translation from results obtained in pigs to human myocardium. Here, we developed a computational model of the pig ventricular cardiomyocyte AP using experimental datasets of the relevant ionic currents, Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-handling, AP shape, AP duration restitution, and inducibility of triggered activity and alternans. To properly capture porcine Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; transients, we introduced a two-step process with a faster release in the t-tubular region, followed by a slower diffusion-induced release from a non t-tubular subcellular region. The pig model behavior was compared with that of a human ventricular cardiomyocyte (O’Hara-Rudy) model. The pig, but not the human model, developed early afterdepolarizations (EADs) under block of I&lt;sub&gt;K1&lt;/sub&gt;, while I&lt;sub&gt;Kr&lt;/sub&gt; block led to EADs in the human but not in the pig model. At fast rates (pacing cycle length = 400 ms), the human cell model was more susceptible to spontaneous Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; release-mediated delayed afterdepolarizations (DADs) and triggered activity than pig. Fast pacing led to alternans in human but not pig. Developing species-specific models incorporating electrophysiology and Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+-&lt;/sup&gt;handling provides a tool to aid translating antiarrhythmic and arrhythmogenic assessment from the bench to the clinic.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/BVP46t33U0E&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Aberrant signaling through insulin (Ins) and insulin-like growth factor I (IGF1) receptors contribute to the risk and advancement of many cancer types by activating cell survival cascades. Similarities between these pathways have thus far prevented the development of pharmacological interventions that specifically target either Ins or IGF1 signaling. To identify differences in early Ins and IGF1 signaling mechanisms, we developed a dual receptor (IGF1R &amp;amp; InsR) computational response model. The model suggested that ribosomal protein S6 kinase (RPS6K) plays a critical role in regulating MAPK and Akt activation levels in response to Ins and IGF1 stimulation. As predicted, perturbing RPS6K kinase activity led to an increased Akt activation with Ins stimulation compared to IGF1 stimulation. Being able to discern differential downstream signaling, we can explore improved anti-IGF1R cancer therapies by eliminating the emergence of compensation mechanisms without disrupting InsR signaling.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/ZVEt7PIuwF8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Clustering high-dimensional data, such as images or biological measurements, is a long-standing problem and has been studied extensively. Recently, Deep Clustering has gained popularity due to its flexibility in fitting the specific peculiarities of complex data. Here we introduce the Mixture-of-Experts Similarity Variational Autoencoder (MoE-Sim-VAE), a novel generative clustering model. The model can learn multi-modal distributions of high-dimensional data and use these to generate realistic data with high efficacy and efficiency. MoE-Sim-VAE is based on a Variational Autoencoder (VAE), where the decoder consists of a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture. This specific architecture allows for various modes of the data to be automatically learned by means of the experts. Additionally, we encourage the lower dimensional latent representation of our model to follow a Gaussian mixture distribution and to accurately represent the similarities between the data points. We assess the performance of our model on the MNIST benchmark data set and challenging real-world tasks of clustering mouse organs from single-cell RNA-sequencing measurements and defining cell subpopulations from mass cytometry (CyTOF) measurements on hundreds of different datasets. MoE-Sim-VAE exhibits superior clustering performance on all these tasks in comparison to the baselines as well as competitor methods.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/kRd-T1PTHPM&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Xize Xu, Hermann Riecke&lt;/p&gt;

The synchronization of different &lt;i&gt;γ&lt;/i&gt;-rhythms arising in different brain areas has been implicated in various cognitive functions. Here, we focus on the effect of the ubiquitous neuronal heterogeneity on the synchronization of ING (interneuronal network gamma) and PING (pyramidal-interneuronal network gamma) rhythms. The synchronization properties of rhythms depends on the response of their collective phase to external input. We therefore determine the macroscopic phase-response curve for finite-amplitude perturbations (fmPRC) of ING- and PING-rhythms in all-to-all coupled networks comprised of linear (IF) or quadratic (QIF) integrate-and-fire neurons. For the QIF networks we complement the direct simulations with the adjoint method to determine the infinitesimal macroscopic PRC (imPRC) within the exact mean-field theory. We show that the intrinsic neuronal heterogeneity can qualitatively modify the fmPRC and the imPRC. Both PRCs can be biphasic and change sign (type II), even though the phase-response curve for the individual neurons is strictly non-negative (type I). Thus, for ING rhythms, say, external inhibition to the inhibitory cells can, in fact, advance the collective oscillation of the network, even though the same inhibition would lead to a delay when applied to uncoupled neurons. This paradoxical advance arises when the external inhibition modifies the internal dynamics of the network by reducing the number of spikes of inhibitory neurons; the advance resulting from this disinhibition outweighs the immediate delay caused by the external inhibition. These results explain how intrinsic heterogeneity allows ING- and PING-rhythms to become synchronized with a periodic forcing or another rhythm for a wider range in the mismatch of their frequencies. Our results identify a potential function of neuronal heterogeneity in the synchronization of coupled &lt;i&gt;γ&lt;/i&gt;-rhythms, which may play a role in neural information transfer via communication through coherence.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/k7q9H5KmN4I&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Markus K. Klose, Paul J. Shaw&lt;/p&gt;

Circadian rhythms help animals synchronize motivated behaviors to match environmental demands. Recent evidence indicates that clock neurons influence the timing of behavior by differentially altering the activity of a distributed network of downstream neurons. Downstream circuits can be remodeled by Hebbian plasticity, synaptic scaling, and, under some circumstances, activity-dependent addition of cell surface receptors; the role of this receptor respecification phenomena is not well studied. We demonstrate that high sleep pressure quickly reprograms the wake-promoting large ventrolateral clock neurons to express the pigment dispersing factor receptor (PDFR). The addition of this signaling input into the circuit is associated with increased waking and early mating success. The respecification of PDFR in both young and adult large ventrolateral neurons requires 2 dopamine (DA) receptors and activation of the transcriptional regulator &lt;i&gt;nejire&lt;/i&gt; (cAMP response element-binding protein [CREB]). These data identify receptor respecification as an important mechanism to sculpt circuit function to match sleep levels with demand.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/zS__JqbUlLg&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Oxytocin/vasopressin-related neuropeptides are highly conserved and play major roles in regulating social behavior across vertebrates. However, whether their insect orthologue, inotocin, regulates the behavior of social groups remains unknown. Here, we show that in the clonal raider ant &lt;i&gt;Ooceraea biroi&lt;/i&gt;, individuals that perform tasks outside the nest have higher levels of inotocin in their brains than individuals of the same age that remain inside the nest. We also show that older ants, which spend more time outside the nest, have higher inotocin levels than younger ants. Inotocin thus correlates with the propensity to perform tasks outside the nest. Additionally, increasing inotocin pharmacologically increases the tendency of ants to leave the nest. However, this effect is contingent on age and social context. Pharmacologically treated older ants have a higher propensity to leave the nest only in the presence of larvae, whereas younger ants seem to do so only in the presence of pupae. Our results suggest that inotocin signaling plays an important role in modulating behaviors that correlate with age, such as social foraging, possibly by modulating behavioral response thresholds to specific social cues. Inotocin signaling thereby likely contributes to behavioral individuality and division of labor in ant societies.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/TEXK-Kti1r0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Abstract
Reconsolidation of a contextual fear memory is a protein synthesis‐dependent process in which a previously destabilized memory returns to a stable state. This process has become the subject of many studies due to its importance in memory processing, maintenance and updating, and its potential role as a therapeutical target in fear memory disorders such as phobias and post‐traumatic stress disorder. In this sense, understanding the underlying mechanisms of memory reconsolidation is paramount in developing potential treatments for such memory dysfunctions. In the present work, we studied the interaction between two key neural structures involved in the reconsolidation process: the basolateral amygdala complex of the amygdala (BLA) and the dorsal hippocampus (DH). Our results show changes in the structural plasticity of the CA1 region of the DH in the form of dendritic spines density changes associated with the destabilization/reconsolidation process. Furthermore, we demonstrate a modulatory role of BLA over such structural plasticity by infusing different drugs such as ifenprodil, a destabilization blocker, and propranolol, a reconsolidation disruptor, in this brain structure. Altogether our work shows a particular temporal dynamic in the CA1 region of DH that accompanies the destabilization/reconsolidation process and aims to provide new information on the underlying mechanisms of this process that potentially contributes for a better understanding of memory storage, maintenance, expression and updating, and its potential medical applications.</content:encoded>

	<title>arXiv: Computer Science: Neural and Evolutionary Computing: An Ambient Intelligence-Based Human Behavior Monitoring Framework for Ubiquitous Environments. (arXiv:2106.15609v1 [cs.HC])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.15609</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;This framework for human behavior monitoring aims to take a holistic approach
to study, track, monitor, and analyze human behavior during activities of daily
living (ADLs). The framework consists of two novel functionalities. First, it
can perform the semantic analysis of user interactions on the diverse
contextual parameters during ADLs to identify a list of distinct behavioral
patterns associated with different complex activities. Second, it consists of
an intelligent decision-making algorithm that can analyze these behavioral
patterns and their relationships with the dynamic contextual and spatial
features of the environment to detect any anomalies in user behavior that could
constitute an emergency. These functionalities of this interdisciplinary
framework were developed by integrating the latest advancements and
technologies in human-computer interaction, machine learning, Internet of
Things, pattern recognition, and ubiquitous computing. The framework was
evaluated on a dataset of ADLs, and the performance accuracies of these two
functionalities were found to be 76.71% and 83.87%, respectively. The presented
and discussed results uphold the relevance and immense potential of this
framework to contribute towards improving the quality of life and assisted
living of the aging population in the future of Internet of Things (IoT)-based
ubiquitous living environments, e.g., smart homes.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;High levels of sparsity and strong class imbalance are ubiquitous challenges
that are often presented simultaneously in real-world time series data. While
most methods tackle each problem separately, our proposed approach handles both
in conjunction, while imposing fewer assumptions on the data. In this work, we
propose leveraging a self-supervised learning method, specifically
Autoregressive Predictive Coding (APC), to learn relevant hidden
representations of time series data in the context of both missing data and
class imbalance. We apply APC using either a GRU or GRU-D encoder on two
real-world datasets, and show that applying one-step-ahead prediction with APC
improves the classification results in all settings. In fact, by applying GRU-D
- APC, we achieve state-of-the-art AUPRC results on the Physionet benchmark.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.15428</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The modular structure of brain networks supports specialized information
processing, complex dynamics, and cost-efficient spatial embedding.
Inter-individual variation in modular structure has been linked to differences
in performance, disease, and development. There exist many data-driven methods
for detecting and comparing modular structure, the most popular of which is
modularity maximization. Although modularity maximization is a general
framework that can be modified and reparamaterized to address domain-specific
research questions, its application to neuroscientific datasets has, thus far,
been narrow. Here, we highlight several strategies in which the
``out-of-the-box'' version of modularity maximization can be extended to
address questions specific to neuroscience. First, we present approaches for
detecting ``space-independent'' modules and for applying modularity
maximization to signed matrices. Next, we show that the modularity maximization
frame is well-suited for detecting task- and condition-specific modules.
Finally, we highlight the role of multi-layer models in detecting and tracking
modules across time, tasks, subjects, and modalities. In summary, modularity
maximization is a flexible and general framework that can be adapted to detect
modular structure resulting from a wide range of hypotheses. This article
highlights opens multiple frontiers for future research and applications.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.15420</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have shown great potential in solving deep
learning problems in an energy-efficient manner. However, they are still
limited to simple classification tasks. In this paper, we propose Spiking-GAN,
the first spike-based Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). It employs a kind
of temporal coding scheme called time-to-first-spike coding. We train it using
approximate backpropagation in the temporal domain. We use simple
integrate-and-fire (IF) neurons with very high refractory period for our
network which ensures a maximum of one spike per neuron. This makes the model
much sparser than a spike rate-based system. Our modified temporal loss
function called 'Aggressive TTFS' improves the inference time of the network by
over 33% and reduces the number of spikes in the network by more than 11%
compared to previous works. Our experiments show that on training the network
on the MNIST dataset using this approach, we can generate high quality samples.
Thereby demonstrating the potential of this framework for solving such problems
in the spiking domain.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.15392</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Training multi-layer neural networks (MLNNs), a challenging task, involves
finding appropriate weights and biases. MLNN training is important since the
performance of MLNNs is mainly dependent on these network parameters. However,
conventional algorithms such as gradient-based methods, while extensively used
for MLNN training, suffer from drawbacks such as a tendency to getting stuck in
local optima. Population-based metaheuristic algorithms can be used to overcome
these problems. In this paper, we propose a novel MLNN training algorithm,
CenDE-DOBL, that is based on differential evolution (DE), a centroid-based
strategy (Cen-S), and dynamic opposition-based learning (DOBL). The Cen-S
approach employs the centroid of the best individuals as a member of
population, while other members are updated using standard crossover and
mutation operators. This improves exploitation since the new member is obtained
based on the best individuals, while the employed DOBL strategy, which uses the
opposite of an individual, leads to enhanced exploration. Our extensive
experiments compare CenDE-DOBL to 26 conventional and population-based
algorithms and confirm it to provide excellent MLNN training performance.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Neural cellular automata are a recent model used to model biological
phenomena emerging from multicellular organisms. In these models, artificial
neural networks are used as update rules for cellular automata. They are
end-to-end differentiable systems where the parameters of the neural network
can be optimized to achieve a particular task. In this work, we used them to
control a cart-pole agent. The observations of the environment are transmitted
in inputs cells, while the values of output cells are used as readout of the
system. We trained the model using deep-Q learning, where the states of the
output cells were used as the q-value estimates to be optimized. We found that
the computing abilities of the cellular automata were maintained over several
hundreds of thousands of iterations, producing an emergent stable behavior in
the environment it controls for thousands of steps. Moreover, the system
demonstrated life-like phenomena such as a developmental phase, regeneration
after damage, stability despite a noisy environment, and robustness to unseen
disruption such as input deletion.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.14993</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Many transfer problems require re-using previously optimal decisions for
solving new tasks, which suggests the need for learning algorithms that can
modify the mechanisms for choosing certain actions independently of those for
choosing others. However, there is currently no formalism nor theory for how to
achieve this kind of modular credit assignment. To answer this question, we
define modular credit assignment as a constraint on minimizing the algorithmic
mutual information among feedback signals for different decisions. We introduce
what we call the modularity criterion for testing whether a learning algorithm
satisfies this constraint by performing causal analysis on the algorithm
itself. We generalize the recently proposed societal decision-making framework
as a more granular formalism than the Markov decision process to prove that for
decision sequences that do not contain cycles, certain single-step temporal
difference action-value methods meet this criterion while all policy-gradient
methods do not. Empirical evidence suggests that such action-value methods are
more sample efficient than policy-gradient methods on transfer problems that
require only sparse changes to a sequence of previously optimal decisions.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Due to recent technological advances, large brain imaging data sets can now
be collected. Such data are highly complex so extraction of meaningful
information from them remains challenging. Thus, there is an urgent need for
statistical procedures that are computationally scalable and can provide
accurate estimates that capture the neuronal structures and their
functionalities. We propose a fast method for estimating the fiber orientation
distribution(FOD) based on diffusion MRI data. This method models the observed
dMRI signal at any voxel as a convolved and noisy version of the underlying
FOD, and utilizes the spherical harmonics basis for representing the FOD, where
the spherical harmonic coefficients are adaptively and nonlinearly shrunk by
using a James-Stein type estimator. To further improve the estimation accuracy
by enhancing the localized peaks of the FOD, as a second step a
super-resolution sharpening process is then applied. The resulting estimated
FODs can be fed to a fiber tracking algorithm to reconstruct the white matter
fiber tracts. We illustrate the overall methodology using both synthetic data
and data from the Human Connectome Project.

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Inhibition of AKT Signaling Alters βIV Spectrin Distribution at the AIS and Increases Neuronal Excitability</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2021.643860</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The axon initial segment (AIS) is a highly regulated subcellular domain required for neuronal firing. Changes in the AIS protein composition and distribution are a form of structural plasticity, which powerfully regulates neuronal activity and may underlie several neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders. Despite its physiological and pathophysiological relevance, the signaling pathways mediating AIS protein distribution are still poorly studied. Here, we used confocal imaging and whole-cell patch clamp electrophysiology in primary hippocampal neurons to study how AIS protein composition and neuronal firing varied in response to selected kinase inhibitors targeting the AKT/GSK3 pathway, which has previously been shown to phosphorylate AIS proteins. Image-based features representing the cellular pattern distribution of the voltage-gated Na+ (Nav) channel, ankyrin G, βIV spectrin, and the cell-adhesion molecule neurofascin were analyzed, revealing βIV spectrin as the most sensitive AIS protein to AKT/GSK3 pathway inhibition. Within this pathway, inhibition of AKT by triciribine has the greatest effect on βIV spectrin localization to the AIS and its subcellular distribution within neurons, a phenotype that Support Vector Machine classification was able to accurately distinguish from control. Treatment with triciribine also resulted in increased excitability in primary hippocampal neurons. Thus, perturbations to signaling mechanisms within the AKT pathway contribute to changes in βIV spectrin distribution and neuronal firing that may be associated with neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Integrative Neuroscience: Behavioral and Thermoregulatory Responses to Changes in Ambient Temperature and Wheel Running Availability in Octodon degus</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnint.2021.684988</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Octodon degus is primarily a diurnal species, however, in laboratory conditions, it can switch from diurnal to nocturnal in response to wheel running availability. It has been proposed that this activity inversion obeys thermoregulatory constraints induced by vigorous physical exercise. Thus, its activity shifts to the night as the ambient temperature is lower.Here, we investigate the relationship between thermoregulation and the activity phase-inversion in response to wheel-running in this species. We measured behavioral activity and body temperature rhythms in diurnal naïve animals under 12 h light: 12 h dark cycles at four different ambient temperatures (spanning from ~26°C to 32°C), and following access to running wheels while maintained under high ambient temperature.Our results show that naïve degus do not shift their diurnal activity and body temperature rhythms to a nocturnal phase when subjected to sequential increases in ambient temperature. However, when they were provided with wheels under constant high-temperature conditions, all animals inverted their diurnal phase preference becoming nocturnal. Both, negative masking by light and entrainment to the dark phase appeared involved in the nocturnalism of these animals. Analysis of the thermoregulatory response to wheel running revealed some differences between masked and entrained nocturnal chronotypes.These data highlight the importance of the coupling between wheel running availability and ambient temperature in the nocturnalism of the degus. The results support the view that an innate “protective” pre-program mechanism (associating darkness and lower ambient temperature) may change the timing of behavioral activity in this species to reduce the potential risk of hyperthermia.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: In vivo Evaluation of a Newly Synthesized Acetylcholinesterase Inhibitor in a Transgenic Drosophila Model of Alzheimer’s Disease</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.691222</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s disease is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by disrupted memory, learning functions, reduced life expectancy, and locomotor dysfunction, as a result of the accumulation and aggregation of amyloid peptides that cause neuronal damage in neuronal circuits. In the current study, we exploited a transgenic Drosophila melanogaster line, expressing amyloid-β peptides to investigate the efficacy of a newly synthesized acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, named XJP-1, as a potential AD therapy. Behavioral assays and confocal microscopy were used to characterize the drug effect on AD symptomatology and amyloid peptide deposition. The symptomatology induced in this particular transgenic model recapitulates the scenario observed in human AD patients, showing a shortened lifespan and reduced locomotor functions, along with a significant accumulation of amyloid plaques in the brain. XJP-1 treatment resulted in a significant improvement of AD symptoms and a reduction of amyloid plaques by diminishing the amyloid aggregation rate. In comparison with clinically effective AD drugs, our results demonstrated that XJP-1 has similar effects on AD symptomatology, but at 10 times lower drug concentration than donepezil. It also showed an earlier beneficial effect on the reduction of amyloid plaques at 10 days after drug treatment, as observed for donepezil at 20 days, while the other drugs tested have no such effect. As a novel and potent AChE inhibitor, our study demonstrates that inhibition of the enzyme AChE by XJP-1 treatment improves the amyloid-induced symptomatology in Drosophila, by reducing the number of amyloid plaques within the fruit fly CNS. Thus, compound XJP-1 has the therapeutic potential to be further investigated for the treatment of AD.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Monitoring and Prognostic Analysis of Severe Cerebrovascular Diseases Based on Multi-Scale Dynamic Brain Imaging</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.684469</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Severe cerebrovascular disease is an acute cerebrovascular event that causes severe neurological damage in patients, and is often accompanied by severe dysfunction of multiple systems such as breathing and circulation. Patients with severe cerebrovascular disease are in critical condition, have many complications, and are prone to deterioration of neurological function. Therefore, they need closer monitoring and treatment. The treatment strategy in the acute phase directly determines the prognosis of the patient. The case of this article selected 90 patients with severe cerebrovascular disease who were hospitalized in four wards of the Department of Neurology and the Department of Critical Care Medicine in a university hospital. The included cases were in accordance with the guidelines for the prevention and treatment of cerebrovascular diseases. Patients with cerebral infarction are given routine treatments such as improving cerebral circulation, protecting nutrient brain cells, dehydration, and anti-platelet; patients with cerebral hemorrhage are treated within the corresponding safe time window. We use Statistical Product and Service Solutions (SPSS) Statistics21 software to perform statistical analysis on the results. Based on the study of the feature extraction process of convolutional neural network, according to the hierarchical principle of convolutional neural network, a backbone neural network MF (Multi-Features)—Dense Net that can realize the fusion, and extraction of multi-scale features is designed. The network combines the characteristics of densely connected network and feature pyramid network structure, and combines strong feature extraction ability, high robustness and relatively small parameter amount. An end-to-end monitoring algorithm for severe cerebrovascular diseases based on MF-Dense Net is proposed. In the experiment, the algorithm showed high monitoring accuracy, and at the same time reached the speed of real-time monitoring on the experimental platform. An improved spatial pyramid pooling structure is designed to strengthen the network’s ability to merge and extract local features at the same level and at multiple scales, which can further improve the accuracy of algorithm monitoring by paying a small amount of additional computational cost. At the same time, a method is designed to strengthen the use of low-level features by improving the network structure, which improves the algorithm’s monitoring performance on small-scale severe cerebrovascular diseases. For patients with severe cerebrovascular disease in general, APACHEII1, APACHEII2, APACHEII3 and the trend of APACHEII score change are divided into high-risk group and low-risk group. The overall severe cerebrovascular disease, severe cerebral hemorrhage and severe cerebral infarction are analyzed, respectively. The differences are statistically significant.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neural Technology: Multiscale Computational Model Reveals Nerve Response in a Mouse Model for Temporal Interference Brain Stimulation</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.684465</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;There has been a growing interest in the non-invasive stimulation of specific brain tissues, while reducing unintended stimulation in surrounding regions, for the medical treatment of brain disorders. Traditional methods for non-invasive brain stimulation, such as transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) or transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), can stimulate brain regions, but they also simultaneously stimulate the brain and non-brain regions that lie between the target and the stimulation site of the source. Temporal interference (TI) stimulation has been suggested to selectively stimulate brain regions by superposing two alternating currents with slightly different frequencies injected through electrodes attached to the scalp. Previous studies have reported promising results for TI applied to the motor area in mice, but the mechanisms are yet to be clarified. As computational techniques can help reveal different aspects of TI, in this study, we computationally investigated TI stimulation using a multiscale model that computes the generated interference current pattern effects in a neural cortical model of a mouse head. The results indicated that the threshold increased with the carrier frequency and that the beat frequency did not influence the threshold. It was also found that the intensity ratio between the alternating currents changed the location of the responding nerve, which is in agreement with previous experiments. Moreover, particular characteristics of the envelope were investigated to predict the stimulation region intuitively. It was found that regions with high modulation depth (| maximum| − | minimum| values of the envelope) and low minimum envelope (near zero) corresponded with the activation region obtained via neural computation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Randomized Cross Over Study Assessing the Efficacy of Non-invasive Stimulation of the Vagus Nerve in Patients With Axial Spondyloarthritis Resistant to Biotherapies: The ESNV-SPA Study Protocol</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.679775</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Axial spondyloarthritis (SpA), is a major cause of chronic pain and disability that profoundly alters the quality of life of patients. Nearly half of patients with SpA usually develop drug resistance. Non-pharmacological treatments targeting inflammation are an attractive alternative to drug administration. Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS), by promoting a cholinergic anti-inflammatory reflex holds promise for treating inflammatory disease. Inflammatory reflex signaling, which is enhanced by electrically stimulating the vagus nerve, significantly reduces cytokine production and attenuates disease severity in animal models of endotoxemia, sepsis, colitis, and other preclinical models of inflammatory diseases. It has been proposed that vagal efferent fibers release acetylcholine (Ach), which can interact with α7-subunit-containing nicotinic receptors expressed by tissue macrophages and other immune cells to rapidly inhibit the synthesis/release of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNFα, IL-1β, IL-6, and IL-18. External vagal nerve stimulation devices are now available that do not require surgery nor implantation to non-invasively stimulate the vagal nerve. This double-blind randomized cross-over clinical trial aims to study the change in SpA disease activity, according to Assessment in Ankylosing Spondylitis 20 (ASAS20) definition, after 12 weeks of non-invasive VNS treatment vs. non-specific dummy stimulation (control group). One hundred and twenty adult patients with drug resistant SpA, meeting the ASAS classification criteria, will be included in the study. Patients will be randomized into two parallel groups according to a cross over design: either active VNS for 12 weeks, then dummy stimulation for 12 weeks, or dummy stimulation for 12 weeks, then active VNS for 12 weeks. The two stimulation periods will be separated by a 4 weeks wash-out period. A transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulator Tens Eco Plus SCHWA MEDICO&lt;sup&gt;TM&lt;/sup&gt; France will be used in this study. The active VNS stimulation will be applied in the cymba conchae of the left ear upon the auricular branch of the vagus nerve, using low intensity (2–5 mA), once à week, during 1 h. Dummy stimulation will be performed under the same conditions and parameters as active VNS stimulation, but at an irrelevant anatomical site: the left ear lobule. This multicenter study was registered on ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT04286373.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.679086</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Both neural activities and psychological processes vary over time. Individuals with interdependent self-construal tend to define themselves and adjust their behaviors to social contexts and others. The current research tested the hypothesis that the coordination between interdependent self-construal and neural variability could predict life satisfaction changes in university freshmen. We integrated resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging scanning and self-construal assessment to estimate self-dependent neural variability (SDNV). In the whole-brain prediction, SDNV successfully predicted individuals’ life satisfaction changes over 2 years. Interdependent individuals with higher neural variability and independent individuals with lower neural variability became more satisfied with their lives. In the network-based prediction, the predictive effects were significant in the default mode, frontoparietal control, visual and salience networks. The important nodes that contributed to the predictive models were more related to psychological constructs associated with the social and self-oriented functions. The current research sheds light on the neural and psychological mechanisms of the subjective well-being of individuals from a dynamic perspective.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.664039</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The present study aimed to explore the cortical activity underlying mental rotation in high-altitude immigrants via the event-related desynchronization (ERD), the electroencephalogram time–frequency analysis, and source localization based on electroencephalographic data. When compared with the low-altitude individuals, the reaction time of mental rotation tasks was significantly slower in immigrants who had lived in high-altitude areas for 3 years. The time–frequency analysis showed that the alpha ERD and the beta ERD within the time window (400–700 ms) were decreased during the mental rotation tasks in these immigrants. The decreased ERD was observed at the parietal–occipital regions within the alpha band and at the central–parietal regions within the beta band. The decreased ERD might embody the sensorimotor-related cortical activity from hypoxia, which might be involved in cognitive control function in high-altitude immigrants, which provided insights into the neural mechanism of spatial cognition change on aspect of embodied cognition due to high-altitude exposure.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Imagining How Lines Were Drawn: The Appreciation of Calligraphy and the Facilitative Factor Based on the Viewer’s Rating and Heart Rate</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.654610</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;For this study, we examined how recognizing the writing process of calligraphy influences the cognitive and affective processes related to appreciating it, with the aim of contributing to both graphonomics and the psychology of aesthetics. To this end, we conducted two Web-based experiments in which some participants were instructed to view calligraphy by tracing it with their eyes (the tracing method), while others were told to feel free to think and imagine whatever they wanted. Study 1 (N = 103) revealed that the tracing method elicits stronger admiration, inspiration, and empathy in viewers. Study 2 (N = 87) showed that the tracing method decreases the average heart rate of those who do not frequently engage in calligraphy appreciation as they gaze at calligraphy for a minute-and-a-half (during the second half of the stimulus duration); this suggests that the tracing method could keep viewers from becoming bored while looking at calligraphy. In sum, the tracing method has positive effects on viewing calligraphy.

	<title>Frontiers in Neural Circuits: Widely Different Correlation Patterns Between Pairs of Adjacent Thalamic Neurons In vivo</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncir.2021.692923</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;We have previously reported different spike firing correlation patterns among pairs of adjacent pyramidal neurons within the same layer of S1 cortex in vivo, which was argued to suggest that acquired synaptic weight modifications would tend to differentiate adjacent cortical neurons despite them having access to near-identical afferent inputs. Here we made simultaneous single-electrode loose patch-clamp recordings from 14 pairs of adjacent neurons in the lateral thalamus of the ketamine-xylazine anesthetized rat in vivo to study the correlation patterns in their spike firing. As the synapses on thalamic neurons are dominated by a high number of low weight cortical inputs, which would be expected to be shared for two adjacent neurons, and as far as thalamic neurons have homogenous membrane physiology and spike generation, they would be expected to have overall similar spike firing and therefore also correlation patterns. However, we find that across a variety of thalamic nuclei the correlation patterns between pairs of adjacent thalamic neurons vary widely. The findings suggest that the connectivity and cellular physiology of the thalamocortical circuitry, in contrast to what would be expected from a straightforward interpretation of corticothalamic maps and uniform intrinsic cellular neurophysiology, has been shaped by learning to the extent that each pair of thalamic neuron has a unique relationship in their spike firing activity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neural Circuits: Revisiting Persistent Neuronal Activity During Covert Spatial Attention</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncir.2021.679796</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Persistent activity has been observed in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), in particular during the delay periods of visual attention tasks. Classical approaches based on the average activity over multiple trials have revealed that such an activity encodes the information about the attentional instruction provided in such tasks. However, single-trial approaches have shown that activity in this area is rather sparse than persistent and highly heterogeneous not only within the trials but also between the different trials. Thus, this observation raised the question of how persistent the actually persistent attention-related prefrontal activity is and how it contributes to spatial attention. In this paper, we review recent evidence of precisely deconstructing the persistence of the neural activity in the PFC in the context of attention orienting. The inclusion of machine-learning methods for decoding the information reveals that attention orienting is a highly dynamic process, possessing intrinsic oscillatory dynamics working at multiple timescales spanning from milliseconds to minutes. Dimensionality reduction methods further show that this persistent activity dynamically incorporates multiple sources of information. This novel framework reflects a high complexity in the neural representation of the attention-related information in the PFC, and how its computational organization predicts behavior.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The neurovascular unit (NVU) of the brain is composed of multiple cell types that act synergistically to modify blood flow to locally match the energy demand of neural activity, as well as to maintain the integrity of the blood-brain barrier (BBB). It is becoming increasingly recognized that the functional specialization, as well as the cellular composition of the NVU varies spatially. This heterogeneity is encountered as variations in vascular and perivascular cells along the arteriole-capillary-venule axis, as well as through differences in NVU composition throughout anatomical regions of the brain. Given the wide variations in metabolic demands between brain regions, especially those of gray vs. white matter, the spatial heterogeneity of the NVU is critical to brain function. Here we review recent evidence demonstrating regional specialization of the NVU between brain regions, by focusing on the heterogeneity of its individual cellular components and briefly discussing novel approaches to investigate NVU diversity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: HDAC4 Knockdown Alleviates Denervation-Induced Muscle Atrophy by Inhibiting Myogenin-Dependent Atrogene Activation</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.663384</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Denervation can activate the catabolic pathway in skeletal muscle and lead to progressive skeletal muscle atrophy. At present, there is no effective treatment for muscle atrophy. Histone deacetylase 4 (HDAC4) has recently been found to be closely related to muscle atrophy, but the underlying mechanism of HDAC4 in denervation-induced muscle atrophy have not been described clearly yet. In this study, we found that the expression of HDAC4 increased significantly in denervated skeletal muscle. HDAC4 inhibition can effectively diminish denervation-induced muscle atrophy, reduce the expression of muscle specific E3 ubiquitin ligase (MuRF1 and MAFbx) and autophagy related proteins (Atg7, LC3B, PINK1 and BNIP3), inhibit the transformation of type I fibers to type II fibers, and enhance the expression of SIRT1 and PGC-1 α. Transcriptome sequencing and bioinformatics analysis was performed and suggested that HDAC4 may be involved in denervation-induced muscle atrophy by regulating the response to denervation involved in the regulation of muscle adaptation, cell division, cell cycle, apoptotic process, skeletal muscle atrophy, and cell differentiation. STRING analysis showed that HDAC4 may be involved in the process of muscle atrophy by directly regulating myogenin (MYOG), cell cycle inhibitor p21 (CDKN1A) and salt induced kinase 1 (SIK1). MYOG was significantly increased in denervated skeletal muscle, and MYOG inhibition could significantly alleviate denervation-induced muscle atrophy, accompanied by the decreased MuRF1 and MAFbx. MYOG overexpression could reduce the protective effect of HDAC4 inhibition on denervation-induced muscle atrophy, as evidenced by the decreased muscle mass and cross-sectional area of muscle fibers, and the increased mitophagy. Taken together, HDAC4 inhibition can alleviate denervation-induced muscle atrophy by reducing MYOG expression, and HDAC4 is also directly related to CDKN1A and SIK1 in skeletal muscle, which suggests that HDAC4 inhibitors may be a potential drug for the treatment of neurogenic muscle atrophy. These results not only enrich the molecular regulation mechanism of denervation-induced muscle atrophy, but also provide the experimental basis for HDAC4-MYOG axis as a new target for the prevention and treatment of muscular atrophy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is one of the most common microvascular complications associated with diabetes mellitus. However, its correlation with another diabetes-related disorder, cognitive impairment, has not been well studied. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to explore the association between DR and cognitive impairment. MEDLINE (PubMed), the Cochrane Library, and EMBASE databases were searched for observational studies that reported an association between DR and cognitive impairment. Data from selected studies were extracted, and a meta-analysis was conducted using fixed-effects modeling. Fifteen observational studies were included in the systematic review, and 10 studies were included in the meta-analysis. The odds ratio of the association between DR and cognitive impairment was 2.24 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.89–2.66; I&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.8%). The hazard ratio of the association between DR and cognitive impairment was significant in four studies, ranging from 1.09–1.32. Minimal or mild DR was not significantly associated with cognitive impairment (odds ratio [OR], 2.04; 95% CI, 0.87–4.77). However, the association between proliferative DR and cognitive impairment (OR, 3.57; 95% CI, 1.79–7.12; I&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 16.6%) was not stronger than the association between moderate or worse DR and cognitive impairment (OR, 4.26; 95% CI, 2.01–9.07; I&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.0%). DR is associated with cognitive impairment, and screening for DR will be helpful for the early identification of individuals with cognitive impairment. Further studies are needed to confirm the association between proliferative DR and cognitive impairment.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.645649</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Microglia-mediated neuroinflammatory response in the early brain injury after subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) has been reported to have an impact on progress, and the mechanism is not completely understood. Here, we performed genome-wide transcriptome analysis of microglia purified from damaged hemisphere of adult mice at 3 days after SAH or sham operation. Robust transcriptional changes were observed between SAH-induced and healthy microglia, indicating rapid activation of microglia after suffering from SAH. We identified 1576 differentially expressed genes (DEGs; 928 upregulated and 648 downregulated) in SAH-induced microglia compared with sham microglia, representing a strong alteration of the genome (6.85% of total ∼23,000 genes). Functional enrichment of these DEGs indicated that cell division, inflammatory response, cytokine production, and leukocyte chemotaxis were strongly activated in SAH-induced microglia. Moreover, we identified and proved that the TLR2/IRF7 signaling axis was involved in the regulation of this microglia-mediated inflammation in SAH mice by performing flow cytometry and immunofluorescence. Together, these results provided a perspective of microglia-mediated neuroinflammatory response in the early stage of SAH and might give a new therapeutic target for SAH.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/69336</link>
	<content:encoded>Comparing the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic between countries or across time is difficult because the reported numbers of cases and deaths can be strongly affected by testing capacity and reporting policy. Excess mortality, defined as the increase in all-cause mortality relative to the expected mortality, is widely considered as a more objective indicator of the COVID-19 death toll. However, there has been no global, frequently-updated repository of the all-cause mortality data across countries. To fill this gap, we have collected weekly, monthly, or quarterly all-cause mortality data from 94 countries and territories, openly available as the regularly-updated World Mortality Dataset. We used this dataset to compute the excess mortality in each country during the COVID-19 pandemic. We found that in several worst-affected countries (Peru, Ecuador, Bolivia, Mexico) the excess mortality was above 50% of the expected annual mortality. At the same time, in several other countries (Australia, New Zealand) mortality during the pandemic was below the usual level, presumably due to social distancing measures decreasing the non-COVID infectious mortality. Furthermore, we found that while many countries have been reporting the COVID-19 deaths very accurately, some countries have been substantially underreporting their COVID-19 deaths (e.g. Nicaragua, Russia, Uzbekistan), sometimes by two orders of magnitude (Tajikistan). Our results highlight the importance of open and rapid all-cause mortality reporting for pandemic monitoring.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/68651</link>
	<content:encoded>The expression of motivated behaviors depends on both external and internally-arising neural stimuli, yet the intrinsic releasing mechanisms for such variably occurring behaviors remain elusive. In isolated nervous system preparations of &lt;i&gt;Aplysia&lt;/i&gt;, we have found that irregularly expressed cycles of motor output underlying food-seeking behavior arise from regular membrane potential oscillations of varying magnitude in an identified pair of interneurons (B63) in the bilateral buccal ganglia. This rhythmic signal, which is specific to the B63 cells, is generated by organelle-derived intracellular calcium fluxes that activate voltage-independent plasma membrane channels. The resulting voltage oscillation spreads throughout a subset of gap junction-coupled buccal network neurons and by triggering plateau potential-mediated bursts in B63, can initiate motor output driving food-seeking action. Thus, an atypical neuronal pacemaker mechanism, based on rhythmic intracellular calcium store release and intercellular propagation, can act as an autonomous intrinsic releaser for the occurrence of a motivated behavior.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/68215</link>
	<content:encoded>All membrane fusion reactions proceed through an initial fusion pore, including calcium-triggered release of neurotransmitters and hormones. Expansion of this small pore to release cargo is energetically costly and regulated by cells, but the mechanisms are poorly understood. Here we show that the neuronal/exocytic calcium sensor Synaptotagmin-1 (Syt1) promotes expansion of fusion pores induced by SNARE proteins. Pore dilation relied on calcium-induced insertion of the tandem C2 domain hydrophobic loops of Syt1 into the membrane, previously shown to reorient the C2 domain. Mathematical modelling suggests that C2B reorientation rotates a bound SNARE complex so that it exerts force on the membranes in a mechanical lever action that increases the height of the fusion pore, provoking pore dilation to offset the bending energy penalty. We conclude that Syt1 exerts novel non-local calcium-dependent mechanical forces on fusion pores that dilate pores and assist neurotransmitter and hormone release.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/66582</link>
	<content:encoded>Pathological left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) occurs in response to pressure overload and remains the single most important clinical predictor of cardiac mortality. The molecular pathways in the induction of pressure overload LVH are potential targets for therapeutic intervention. Current treatments aim to remove the pressure overload stimulus for LVH, but do not completely reverse adverse cardiac remodelling. Although numerous molecular signalling steps in the induction of LVH have been identified, the initial step by which mechanical stretch associated with cardiac pressure overload is converted into a chemical signal that initiates hypertrophic signalling remains unresolved. In this study, we show that selective deletion of transient receptor potential melastatin 4 (TRPM4) channels in mouse cardiomyocytes results in an approximately 50% reduction in the LVH induced by transverse aortic constriction. Our results suggest that TRPM4 channel is an important component of the mechanosensory signalling pathway that induces LVH in response to pressure overload and represents a potential novel therapeutic target for the prevention of pathological LVH.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/66440</link>
	<content:encoded>WNT/CTNNB1 signaling regulates tissue development and homeostasis in all multicellular animals, but the underlying molecular mechanism remains incompletely understood. Specifically, quantitative insight into endogenous protein behavior is missing. Here we combine CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing and quantitative live-cell microscopy to measure the dynamics, diffusion characteristics and absolute concentrations of fluorescently tagged, endogenous CTNNB1 in human cells under both physiological and oncogenic conditions. State-of-the-art imaging reveals that a substantial fraction of CTNNB1 resides in slow-diffusing cytoplasmic complexes, irrespective of the activation status of the pathway. This cytoplasmic CTNNB1 complex undergoes a major reduction in size when WNT/CTNNB1 is (hyper)activated. Based on our biophysical measurements we build a computational model of WNT/CTNNB1 signaling. Our integrated experimental and computational approach reveals that WNT pathway activation regulates the dynamic distribution of free and complexed CTNNB1 across different subcellular compartments through three regulatory nodes: the destruction complex, nucleocytoplasmic shuttling and nuclear retention.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>The spatiotemporal distribution of mitochondria is crucial for precise ATP provision and calcium buffering required to support neuronal signaling. Fast-spiking GABAergic interneurons expressing parvalbumin (PV) have a high mitochondrial content reflecting their large energy utilization. The importance for correct trafficking and precise mitochondrial positioning remains poorly elucidated in inhibitory neurons. Miro1 is a Ca²⁺-sensing adaptor protein that links mitochondria to the trafficking apparatus, for their microtubule-dependent transport along axons and dendrites, in order to meet the metabolic and Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-buffering requirements of the cell. Here, we explore the role of Miro1 in parvalbumin interneurons and how changes in mitochondrial trafficking could alter network activity in the mouse brain. By employing live and fixed imaging, we found that the impairments in Miro1-directed trafficking in PV+ interneurons altered their mitochondrial distribution and axonal arborization while PV+ interneuron mediated inhibition remained intact. These changes were accompanied by an increase in the &lt;i&gt;ex vivo&lt;/i&gt; hippocampal γ-oscillation (30 – 80 Hz) frequency and promoted anxiolysis. Our findings show that precise regulation of mitochondrial dynamics in PV+ interneurons is crucial for proper neuronal signaling and network synchronization.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Cell entry of enveloped viruses relies on the fusion between the viral and plasma or endosomal membranes, through a mechanism that is triggered by a cellular signal. Here we used a combination of computational and experimental approaches to unravel the main determinants of hepatitis B virus (HBV) membrane fusion process. We discovered that ERp57 is a host factor critically involved in triggering HBV fusion and infection. Then, through modelling approaches, we uncovered a putative allosteric cross-strand disulfide (CSD) bond in the HBV S glycoprotein and we demonstrate that its stabilization could prevent membrane fusion. Finally, we identified and characterized a potential fusion peptide in the preS1 domain of the HBV L glycoprotein. These results underscore a membrane fusion mechanism that could be triggered by ERp57, allowing a thiol/disulfide exchange reaction to occur and regulate isomerization of a critical CSD, which ultimately leads to the exposition of the fusion peptide.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jnr.24906?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
Social interactions are partly driven by our ability to empathize—the capacity to share and understand others’ inner states. While a growing body of evidence suggests a link between past experiences and empathy, to what degree empathy is dependent on our own previous experiences (autobiographical memories, AMs) is still unclear. Whereas neuroimaging studies have shown wide overlapping brain networks underpinning AM and empathic processes, studies on clinical populations with memory loss have not always shown empathy is impaired. The current transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and electroencephalography study will seek to shed light on this neuropsychological puzzle by testing whether self‐perceived empathy is causally linked to AM retrieval. Cortical activity, together with self‐rating of empathy, will be recorded for scenarios that echo personal experiences while a brain region critical for AM retrieval will be transiently inhibited using TMS before task performance.</content:encoded>

State-dependent sodium channel blockers are often prescribed to treat cardiac arrhythmias, but many sodium channel blockers are known to have pro-arrhythmic side effects. While the anti and proarrhythmic potential of a sodium channel blocker is thought to depend on the characteristics of its rate-dependent block, the mechanisms linking these two attributes are unclear. Furthermore, how specific properties of rate-dependent block arise from the binding kinetics of a particular drug is poorly understood. Here, we examine the rate-dependent effects of the sodium channel blocker lidocaine by constructing and analyzing a novel drug-channel interaction model. First, we identify the predominant mode of lidocaine binding in a 24 variable Markov model for lidocaine-sodium channel interaction by Moreno et al. Specifically, we find that (1) the vast majority of lidocaine bound to sodium channels is in the neutral form, i.e., the binding of charged lidocaine to sodium channels is negligible, and (2) neutral lidocaine binds almost exclusively to inactivated channels and, upon binding, immobilizes channels in the inactivated state. We then develop a novel 3-variable lidocaine-sodium channel interaction model that incorporates only the predominant mode of drug binding. Our low-dimensional model replicates an extensive amount of the voltage-clamp data used to parameterize the Moreno et al. model. Furthermore, the effects of lidocaine on action potential upstroke velocity and conduction velocity in our model are similar to those predicted by the Moreno et al. model. By exploiting the low-dimensionality of our model, we derive an algebraic expression for level of rate-dependent block as a function of pacing frequency, restitution properties, diastolic and plateau potentials, and drug binding rate constants. Our model predicts that the level of rate-dependent block is sensitive to alterations in restitution properties and increases in diastolic potential, but it is insensitive to variations in the shape of the action potential waveform and lidocaine binding rates.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/9WWCiVsdDJo&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Biology: FisB relies on homo-oligomerization and lipid binding to catalyze membrane fission in bacteria</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~3/vSwKiN4nIyM/article</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Ane Landajuela, Martha Braun, Christopher D. A. Rodrigues, Alejandro Martínez-Calvo, Thierry Doan, Florian Horenkamp, Anna Andronicos, Vladimir Shteyn, Nathan D. Williams, Chenxiang Lin, Ned S. Wingreen, David Z. Rudner, Erdem Karatekin&lt;/p&gt;

Little is known about mechanisms of membrane fission in bacteria despite their requirement for cytokinesis. The only known dedicated membrane fission machinery in bacteria, fission protein B (FisB), is expressed during sporulation in &lt;i&gt;Bacillus subtilis&lt;/i&gt; and is required to release the developing spore into the mother cell cytoplasm. Here, we characterized the requirements for FisB-mediated membrane fission. FisB forms mobile clusters of approximately 12 molecules that give way to an immobile cluster at the engulfment pole containing approximately 40 proteins at the time of membrane fission. Analysis of FisB mutants revealed that binding to acidic lipids and homo-oligomerization are both critical for targeting FisB to the engulfment pole and membrane fission. Experiments using artificial membranes and filamentous cells suggest that FisB does not have an intrinsic ability to sense or induce membrane curvature but can bridge membranes. Finally, modeling suggests that homo-oligomerization and &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;-interactions with membranes are sufficient to explain FisB accumulation at the membrane neck that connects the engulfment membrane to the rest of the mother cell membrane during late stages of engulfment. Together, our results show that FisB is a robust and unusual membrane fission protein that relies on homo-oligomerization, lipid binding, and the unique membrane topology generated during engulfment for localization and membrane scission, but surprisingly, not on lipid microdomains, negative-curvature lipids, or curvature sensing.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/vSwKiN4nIyM&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

The MAST family of microtubule‐associated serine–threonine kinases (STK) have distinct expression patterns in the developing and mature human and mouse brain. To date, only MAST1 has been conclusively associated with neurological disease, with de novo variants in individuals with a neurodevelopmental disorder, including a mega corpus callosum.


Methods
Using exome sequencing we identify MAST3 missense variants in individuals with epilepsy. We also assess the effect of these variants on the ability of MAST3 to phosphorylate the target gene product ARPP‐16 in HEK293T cells.


Results
We identify de novo missense variants in the STK domain in 11 individuals, including two recurrent variants p.G510S (n = 5) and p.G515S (n = 3). All 11 individuals had developmental and epileptic encephalopathy, with 8 having normal development prior to seizure onset at &amp;lt;2 years of age. All patients developed multiple seizure types, while 9/11 had seizures triggered by fever and 9/11 had drug‐resistant seizures. In vitro analysis of HEK293T cells transfected with MAST3 cDNA carrying a subset of these patient‐specific missense variants demonstrated variable but generally lower expression, with concomitant increased phosphorylation of the MAST3 target, ARPP‐16, compared to wildtype. These findings suggest the patient‐specific variants may confer MAST3 gain‐of‐function. Moreover, single‐nuclei RNA sequencing and immunohistochemistry shows that MAST3 expression is restricted to excitatory neurons in the cortex late in prenatal development and postnatally.


Interpretation
In summary, we describe MAST3 as a novel epilepsy‐associated gene with a potential gain‐of‐function pathogenic mechanism that may be primarily restricted to excitatory neurons in the cortex.

	<content:encoded>Resilience to stress in male rats is lost 2 weeks after social defeat stress.

Abstract
Resilience to stress is the ability to quickly adapt to adversity. There is evidence that exposure to prolonged stress triggers neuroinflammation what produces individual differences in stress vulnerability. However, the relationship between stress resilience, neuroinflammation, and depressive‐like behaviors remains unknown. The aim of this study was to analyze the long‐term effects of social defeat stress (SDS) on neuroinflammation in the hippocampus and depressive‐like behaviors. Male rats were subjected to the SDS paradigm. Social interaction was analyzed 1 and 2 weeks after ending the SDS to determine which animals were susceptible or resilient to stress. Neuroinflammation markers glial fibrillary acidic protein, ionized calcium‐binding adaptor molecule 1, and elevated membrane permeability in astrocytes and microglia, as well as depressive‐like behaviors in the sucrose preference test and forced swim test were evaluated in all rats. One week after SDS, resilient rats increased their sucrose preference, and time spent in the floating behavior decreased in the forced swim test compared to susceptible rats. Surprisingly, resilient rats became susceptible to stress, and presented neuroinflammation 2 weeks after SDS. These findings suggest that SDS‐induced hippocampal neuroinflammation persists in post‐stress stages, regardless of whether rats were initially resilient or not. Our study opens a new approach to understanding the neurobiology of stress resilience.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cne.25203?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
The mediodorsal thalamus (MD) is a higher‐order nucleus located within the central thalamus in many mammalian species. Emerging evidence from MD lesions and tracer injections suggests that the MD is reciprocally connected to the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and plays an essential role in specific cognitive processes and tasks. MD subdivisions (medial, central, and lateral) are poorly segregated at the molecular level in rodents, leading to a lack of MD subdivision‐specific Cre driver mice. Moreover, this lack of molecular identifiers hinder MD subdivision‐ and cell‐type‐specific circuit formation and function analysis. Therefore, using publicly available databases, we explored molecules separately expressed in MD subdivisions. In addition to MD subdivision markers, we identified several genes expressed in a subdivision‐specific combination and classified them. Furthermore, after developing medial MD (MDm) or central MD (MDc) region‐specific Cre mouse lines, we identified diverse region‐ and layer‐specific PFC projection patterns. Comparison between classified MD marker genes in mice and common marmosets, a non‐human primate model, revealed diverging gene expression patterns. These results highlight the species‐specific organization of cell types and their projections in the MD thalamus.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Genome Wide Association Study Identifies Risk Loci For Cluster Headache</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.26150?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Objective
To identify susceptibility loci for cluster headache and obtain insights into relevant disease pathways.


Methods
We carried out a genome‐wide association study, where 852 UK and 591 Swedish cluster headache cases were compared with 5,614 and 1,134 controls, respectively. Following quality control and imputation, single variant association testing was conducted using a logistic mixed model, for each cohort. The two cohorts were subsequently combined in a merged analysis. Downstream analyses, such as gene‐set enrichment, functional variant annotation, prediction and pathway analyses, were performed.


Results
Initial independent analysis identified two replicable cluster headache susceptibility loci on chromosome 2. A merged analysis identified an additional locus on chromosome 1 and confirmed a locus significant in the UK analysis on chromosome 6, which overlaps with a previously known migraine locus. The lead single nucleotide polymorphisms were rs113658130 (p = 1.92 x 10−17, OR [95%CI] = 1.51 [1.37–1.66]) and rs4519530 (p = 6.98 x 10−17, OR = 1.47 [1.34–1.61]) on chromosome 2, rs12121134 on chromosome 1 (p = 1.66 x 10−8, OR = 1.36 [1.22–1.52]) and rs11153082 (p = 1.85 x 10−8, OR = 1.30 [1.19–1.42]) on chromosome 6. Downstream analyses implicated immunological processes in the pathogenesis of cluster headache.


Interpretation
We identified and replicated several genome‐wide‐significant associations supporting a genetic predisposition in cluster headache in a genome‐wide association study involving 1,443 cases. Replication in larger independent cohorts combined with comprehensive phenotyping, in relation to e.g. treatment response and cluster headache subtypes, could provide unprecedented insights into genotype–phenotype correlations and the pathophysiological pathways underlying cluster headache.

	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jnr.24907?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
Neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease (PD) have a huge impact on patients, caregivers, and the health‐care system. To date, the diagnosis of mild cognitive impairments in PD has been established based on domain‐general functions such as executive functions, attention, or working memory. However, specific numerical deficits observed in clinical practice have not yet been systematically investigated. PD‐immanent deterioration of domain‐general functions and domain‐specific numerical areas suggests the mechanisms of both primary and secondary dyscalculia. The current study will systematically investigate basic number processing performance in PD patients for the first time, targeting domain‐specific cognitive representations of numerosity and the influence of domain‐general factors. The overall sample consists of patients with a diagnosis of PD, according to consensus guidelines, and healthy controls. PD patients will be stratified into patients with normal cognition or mild cognitive impairment (level I‐PD‐MCI based on cognitive screening). Basic number processing will be assessed using transcoding, number line estimation, and (non)symbolic number magnitude comparison tasks. Discriminant analysis will be employed to assess whether basic number processing tasks can differentiate between a healthy control group and both PD groups. All participants will be subjected to a comprehensive numerical and a neuropsychological test battery, as well as sociodemographic and clinical measures. Study results will give the first broad insight into the extent of basic numerical deficits in different PD patient groups and will help us to understand the underlying mechanisms of the numerical deficits faced by PD patients in daily life.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Complex network analysis has an increasing relevance in the study of
neurological disorders, enhancing the knowledge of brain's structural and
functional organization. Network structure and efficiency can reveal different
brain states along with different ways of processing the information. In this
work, complex network analysis was performed on the basis of brain connectivity
obtained from Electroencephalography (EEG) data, while different auditory
stimuli were presented to the subjects. This connectivity is inferred from the
Phase-Amplitude coupling (PAC) from different EEG electrodes, to explore
differences between controls and dyslexic subjects. Connectivity data allows
the construction of a graph, and then, graph theory can be used to study the
characteristics of the complex networks throughout time for controls and
dyslexics. This results in a set of metrics including clustering coefficient,
path length and small-worldness. From this, different characteristics linked to
the temporal evolution of networks and connectivity can be pointed out for
dyslexics. Our study revealed patterns related to Dyslexia as losing the
small-world topology. Finally, these graph-based features are used to classify
between controls and dyslexic subjects by means of a support vector machine.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.14612</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A theory of language learning is described, which uses Bayesian induction of
feature structures (scripts) and script functions. Each word sense in a
language is mentally represented by an m-script, a script function which
embodies all the syntax and semantics of the word. M-scripts form a
fully-lexicalised unification grammar, which can support adult language. Each
word m-script can be learnt robustly from about six learning examples. The
theory has been implemented as a computer model, which can bootstrap-learn a
language from zero vocabulary. The Bayesian learning mechanism is (1) Capable:
to learn arbitrarily complex meanings and syntactic structures; (2) Fast:
learning these structures from a few examples each; (3) Robust: learning in the
presence of much irrelevant noise, and (4) Self-repairing: able to acquire
implicit negative evidence, using it to learn exceptions. Children learning
language are clearly all of (1) - (4), whereas connectionist theories fail on
(1) and (2), and symbolic theories fail on (3) and (4). The theory is in good
agreement with many key facts of language acquisition, including facts which
are problematic for other theories. It is compared with over 100 key
cross-linguistic findings about acquisition of the lexicon, phrase structure,
morphology, complementation and control, auxiliaries, verb argument structures,
gaps and movement - in nearly all cases giving unforced agreement without extra
assumptions.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Gradual pattern mining allows for extraction of attribute correlations
through gradual rules such as: &quot;the more X, the more Y&quot;. Such correlations are
useful in identifying and isolating relationships among the attributes that may
not be obvious through quick scans on a data set. For instance, a researcher
may apply gradual pattern mining to determine which attributes of a data set
exhibit unfamiliar correlations in order to isolate them for deeper exploration
or analysis. In this work, we propose an ant colony optimization technique
which uses a popular probabilistic approach that mimics the behavior biological
ants as they search for the shortest path to find food in order to solve
combinatorial problems. In our second contribution, we extend an existing
gradual pattern mining technique to allow for extraction of gradual patterns
together with an approximated temporal lag between the affected gradual item
sets. Such a pattern is referred to as a fuzzy-temporal gradual pattern and it
may take the form: &quot;the more X, the more Y, almost 3 months later&quot;. In our
third contribution, we propose a data crossing model that allows for
integration of mostly gradual pattern mining algorithm implementations into a
Cloud platform. This contribution is motivated by the proliferation of IoT
applications in almost every area of our society and this comes with provision
of large-scale time-series data from different sources.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Deep learning has proven to be a highly effective problem-solving tool for
object detection and image segmentation across various domains such as
healthcare and autonomous driving. At the heart of this performance lies neural
architecture design which relies heavily on domain knowledge and prior
experience on the researchers' behalf. More recently, this process of finding
the most optimal architectures, given an initial search space of possible
operations, was automated by Neural Architecture Search (NAS). In this paper,
we evaluate the robustness of one such algorithm known as Efficient NAS (ENAS)
against data agnostic poisoning attacks on the original search space with
carefully designed ineffective operations. By evaluating algorithm performance
on the CIFAR-10 dataset, we empirically demonstrate how our novel search space
poisoning (SSP) approach and multiple-instance poisoning attacks exploit design
flaws in the ENAS controller to result in inflated prediction error rates for
child networks. Our results provide insights into the challenges to surmount in
using NAS for more adversarially robust architecture search.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Neural interfaces using biocompatible scaffolds provide crucial properties
for the functional repair of nerve injuries and neurodegenerative diseases,
including cell adhesion, structural support, and mass transport. Neural
stimulation has also been found to be effective in promoting neural
regeneration. This work provides a new strategy to integrate photoacoustic (PA)
neural stimulation into hydrogel scaffolds using a nanocomposite hydrogel
approach. Specifically, polyethylene glycol (PEG)-functionalized carbon
nanotubes (CNT), highly efficient photoacoustic agents, are embedded into silk
fibroin to form biocompatible and soft photoacoustic materials. We show that
these photoacoustic functional scaffolds enable non-genetic activation of
neurons with a spatial precision defined by the area of light illumination,
promoting neuron regeneration. These CNT/silk scaffolds offered reliable and
repeatable photoacoustic neural stimulation. 94% of photoacoustic stimulated
neurons exhibit a fluorescence change larger than 10% in calcium imaging in the
light illuminated area. The on-demand photoacoustic stimulation increased
neurite outgrowth by 1.74-fold in a dorsal root ganglion model, when compared
to the unstimulated group. We also confirmed that photoacoustic neural
stimulation promoted neurite outgrowth by impacting the brain-derived
neurotrophic factor (BDNF) pathway. As a multifunctional neural scaffold,
CNT/silk scaffolds demonstrated non-genetic PA neural stimulation functions and
promoted neurite outgrowth, providing a new method for non-pharmacological

	<content:encoded>The illustration of the generation of sympathetic neurons and chromaffin cells from SCPs associated with nerves during zebrafish development. In fish, peripheral nerve‐associated SCPs detach and generate the majority of sympathetic neurons and chromaffin cells over significant periods of development and growth.

Abstract
The autonomic portion of the peripheral nervous system orchestrates tissue homeostasis through direct innervation of internal organs, and via release of adrenalin and noradrenalin into the blood flow. The developmental mechanisms behind the formation of autonomic neurons and chromaffin cells are not fully understood. Using genetic tracing, we discovered that a significant proportion of sympathetic neurons in zebrafish originates from Schwann cell precursors (SCPs) during a defined period of embryonic development. Moreover, SCPs give rise to the main portion of the chromaffin cells, as well as to a significant proportion of enteric and other autonomic neurons associated with internal organs. The conversion of SCPs into neuronal and chromaffin cells is ErbB receptor dependent, as the pharmacological inhibition of the ErbB pathway effectively perturbed this transition. Finally, using genetic ablations, we revealed that SCPs producing neurons and chromaffin cells migrate along spinal motor axons to reach appropriate target locations. This study reveals the evolutionary conservation of SCP‐to‐neuron and SCP‐to‐chromaffin cell transitions over significant growth periods in fish and highlights relevant cellular‐genetic mechanisms. Based on this, we anticipate that multipotent SCPs might be present in postnatal vertebrate tissues, retaining the capacity to regenerate autonomic neurons and chromaffin cells.</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Zinc and Copper Brain Levels and Expression of Neurotransmitter Receptors in Two Rat ASD Models</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2021.656740</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Zinc and copper are important trace elements necessary for the proper functioning of neurons. Impaired zinc and/or copper metabolism and signaling are implicated in many brain diseases, including autism (ASD). In our studies, autistic-like behavior in rat offsprings was induced by application to pregnant mothers valproic acid or thalidomide. Zinc and copper contents were measured in serum and brain structures: hippocampus, cerebral cortex, and cerebellum. Our research shows no interconnections in the particular metal concentrations measured in autistic animal brains and their sera. Based on patient researches, we studied 26 genes belonging to disturbed neurotransmitter pathways. In the same brain regions, we examined the expression of genes encoding proteins of cholinergic, adrenergic, serotonin, and dopamine receptors. In both rats’ ASD models, 17 out of the tested gene expression were decreased. In the cerebellum and cerebral cortex, expression of genes encoding cholinergic, adrenergic, and dopaminergic receptors decreased, whereas in the hippocampus only expression of serotoninergic receptors genes was downregulated. The changes in metals content observed in the rat brain can be secondary phenomena, perhaps elements of mechanisms that compensate for neurotransmission dysfunctions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Integrative Neuroscience: Local Translation in Nervous System Pathologies</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnint.2021.689208</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Dendrites and axons can extend dozens to hundreds of centimeters away from the cell body so that a single neuron can sense and respond to thousands of stimuli. Thus, for an accurate function of dendrites and axons the neuronal proteome needs to be asymmetrically distributed within neurons. Protein asymmetry can be achieved by the transport of the protein itself or the transport of the mRNA that is then translated at target sites in neuronal processes. The latter transport mechanism implies local translation of localized mRNAs. The role of local translation in nervous system (NS) development and maintenance is well established, but recently there is growing evidence that this mechanism and its deregulation are also relevant in NS pathologies, including neurodegenerative diseases. For instance, upon pathological signals disease-related proteins can be locally synthesized in dendrites and axons. Locally synthesized proteins can exert their effects at or close to the site of translation, or they can be delivered to distal compartments like the nucleus and induce transcriptional responses that lead to neurodegeneration, nerve regeneration and other cell-wide responses. Relevant key players in the process of local protein synthesis are RNA binding proteins (RBPs), responsible for mRNA transport to neurites. Several neurological and neurodegenerative disorders, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis or spinal motor atrophy, are characterized by mutations in genes encoding for RBPs and consequently mRNA localization and local translation are impaired. In other diseases changes in the local mRNA repertoire and altered local protein synthesis have been reported. In this review, we will discuss how deregulation of localized translation at different levels can contribute to the development and progression of nervous system pathologies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Up to now, lots of efforts have been made in the incorporation of the bio-inspired sensing and neuromorphic engineering in the booming artificial intelligence industry. In this review, we first introduce neuromorphic devices based on diverse materials and mechanisms. Then we summarize the progress made in the emulation of biological sensing and perception systems. Finally, the challenges and opportunities in these fields are also discussed.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: When Is Simultaneous Recording Necessary? A Guide for Researchers Considering Combined EEG-fMRI</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.636424</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Electroencephalography (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) provide non-invasive measures of brain activity at varying spatial and temporal scales, offering different views on brain function for both clinical and experimental applications. Simultaneous recording of these measures attempts to maximize the respective strengths of each method, while compensating for their weaknesses. However, combined recording is not necessary to address all research questions of interest, and experiments may have greater statistical power to detect effects by maximizing the signal-to-noise ratio in separate recording sessions. While several existing papers discuss the reasons for or against combined recording, this article aims to synthesize these arguments into a flow chart of questions that researchers can consider when deciding whether to record EEG and fMRI separately or simultaneously. Given the potential advantages of simultaneous EEG-fMRI, the aim is to provide an initial overview of the most important concepts and to direct readers to relevant literature that will aid them in this decision.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: How Self-Appraisal Is Mediated by the Brain</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.700046</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Self-appraisal is a process that leads to the formation of self-esteem, which contributes to subjective well-being and mental health. Neuroimaging studies link self-esteem with the activity of the medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC), right temporoparietal junction (rTPJ), posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), anterior insula (AIns), and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. It is not known, however, how the process of self-appraisal itself is mediated by the brain and how different nodes of the self-appraisal network interact with each other. In this study, we used multilevel mediation analysis of functional MRI data recorded during the trait adjective judgment task, treating the emotional valence of adjectives as the predictor, behavioral response as the dependent variable, and brain activity as the mediator. The mediation effect was revealed in the rTPJ. Dynamic causal modeling showed that positive self-descriptions trigger communication within the network, with the rTPJ exerting the strongest excitatory output and MPFC receiving the strongest excitatory input. rAIns receives the strongest inhibitory input and sends exclusively inhibitory connections to other regions pointing out to its role in the processing of negative self-descriptions. Analysis of individual differences showed that in some individuals, self-appraisal is mostly driven by the endorsement of positive self-descriptions and is accompanied by increased activation and communication between rTPJ, MPFC, and PCC. In others, self-appraisal is driven by the rejection of negative self-descriptions and is accompanied by increased activation of rAIns and inhibition of PCC and MPFC. Membership of these groups was predicted by different personality variables. This evidence uncovers different mechanisms of positive self-bias, which may contribute to different facets of self-esteem and are associated with different personality profiles.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Neurofeedback Learning Is Skill Acquisition but Does Not Guarantee Treatment Benefit: Continuous-Time Analysis of Learning-Curves From a Clinical Trial for ADHD</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.668780</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Neurofeedback for attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) has long been studied as an alternative to medication, promising non-invasive treatment with minimal side-effects and sustained outcome. However, debate continues over the efficacy of neurofeedback, partly because existing evidence for efficacy is mixed and often non-specific, with unclear relationships between prognostic variables, patient performance when learning to self-regulate, and treatment outcomes. We report an extensive analysis on the understudied area of neurofeedback learning. Our data comes from a randomised controlled clinical trial in adults with ADHD (registered trial ISRCTN13915109; N = 23; 13:10 female:male; age 25–57). Patients were treated with either theta-beta ratio or sensorimotor-rhythm regimes for 40 one-hour sessions. We classify 11 learners vs 12 non-learners by the significance of random slopes in a linear mixed growth-curve model. We then analyse the predictors, outcomes, and processes of learners vs non-learners, using these groups as mutual controls. Significant predictive relationships were found in anxiety disorder (GAD), dissociative experience (DES), and behavioural inhibition (BIS) scores obtained during screening. Low DES, but high GAD and BIS, predicted positive learning. Patterns of behavioural outcomes from Test Of Variables of Attention, and symptoms from adult ADHD Self-Report Scale, suggested that learning itself is not required for positive outcomes. Finally, the learning process was analysed using structural-equations modelling with continuous-time data, estimating the short-term and sustained impact of each session on learning. A key finding is that our results support the conceptualisation of neurofeedback learning as skill acquisition, and not merely operant conditioning as originally proposed in the literature.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.640329</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Action video gaming (AVG) places sustained cognitive load on various behavioral systems, thus offering new insights into learning-related neural plasticity. This study aims to determine whether AVG experience is associated with resting-state electroencephalogram (rs-EEG) temporal and spatial complexity, and if so, whether this effect is observable across AVG subgenres. Two AVG games – League of Legends (LOL) and Player Unknown’s Battle Grounds (PUBG) that represent two major AVG subgenres – were examined. We compared rs-EEG microstate and omega complexity between LOL experts and non-experts (Experiment 1) and between PUBG experts and non-experts (Experiment 2). We found that the experts and non-experts had different rs-EEG activities in both experiments, thus revealing the adaptive effect of AVG experience on brain development. Furthermore, we also found certain subgenre-specific complexity changes, supporting the recent proposal that AVG should be categorized based on the gaming mechanics of a specific game rather than a generic genre designation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Classification of Microglial Morphological Phenotypes Using Machine Learning</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.701673</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Microglia are the brain’s immunocompetent macrophages with a unique feature that allows surveillance of the surrounding microenvironment and subsequent reactions to tissue damage, infection, or homeostatic perturbations. Thereby, microglia’s striking morphological plasticity is one of their prominent characteristics and the categorization of microglial cell function based on morphology is well established. Frequently, automated classification of microglial morphological phenotypes is performed by using quantitative parameters. As this process is typically limited to a few and especially manually chosen criteria, a relevant selection bias may compromise the resulting classifications. In our study, we describe a novel microglial classification method by morphological evaluation using a convolutional neuronal network on the basis of manually selected cells in addition to classical morphological parameters. We focused on four microglial morphologies, ramified, rod-like, activated and amoeboid microglia within the murine hippocampus and cortex. The developed method for the classification was confirmed in a mouse model of ischemic stroke which is already known to result in microglial activation within affected brain regions. In conclusion, our classification of microglial morphological phenotypes using machine learning can serve as a time-saving and objective method for post-mortem characterization of microglial changes in healthy and disease mouse models, and might also represent a useful tool for human brain autopsy samples.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroanatomy: Evolutionary Modifications Are Moderate in the Astroglial System of Actinopterygii as Revealed by GFAP Immunohistochemistry</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnana.2021.698459</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The present paper is the first comparative study on the astroglia of several actinopterygian species at different phylogenetical positions, teleosts (16 species), and non-teleosts (3 species), based on the immunohistochemical staining of GFAP (glial fibrillary acidic protein), the characteristic cytoskeletal intermediary filament protein, and immunohistochemical marker of astroglia. The question was, how the astroglial architecture reflexes the high diversity of this largest vertebrate group. The actinopterygian telencephalon has a so-called ‘eversive’ development in contrast to the ‘evagination’ found in sarcopterygii (including tetrapods). Several brain parts either have no equivalents in tetrapod vertebrates (e.g., torus longitudinalis, lobus inferior, lobus nervi vagi), or have rather different shapes (e.g., the cerebellum). GFAP was visualized applying DAKO polyclonal anti-GFAP serum. The study was focused mainly on the telencephalon (eversion), tectum (visual orientation), and cerebellum (motor coordination) where the evolutionary changes were most expected, but the other areas were also investigated. The predominant astroglial elements were tanycytes (long, thin, fiber-like cells). In the teleost telencephala a ‘fan-shape’ re-arrangement of radial glia reflects the eversion. In bichir, starlet, and gar, in which the eversion is less pronounced, the ‘fan-shape’ re-arrangement did not form. In the tectum the radial glial processes were immunostained, but in Ostariophysi and Euteleostei it did not extend into their deep segments. In the cerebellum Bergmann-like glia was found in each group, including non-teleosts, except for Cyprinidae. The vagal lobe was uniquely enlarged and layered in Cyprininae, and had a corresponding layered astroglial system, which left almost free of GFAP the zones of sensory and motor neurons. In conclusion, despite the diversity and evolutionary alterations of Actinopterygii brains, the diversity of the astroglial architecture is moderate. In contrast to Chondrichthyes and Amniotes; in Actinopterygii true astrocytes (stellate-shaped extraependymal cells) did not appear during evolution, and the expansion of GFAP-free areas was limited.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Validating Habitual and Goal-Directed Decision-Making Performance Online in Healthy Older Adults</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.702810</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Everyday decision-making is supported by a dual-system of control comprised of parallel goal-directed and habitual systems. Over the past decade, the two-stage Markov decision task has become popularized for its ability to dissociate between goal-directed and habitual decision-making. While a handful of studies have implemented decision-making tasks online, only one study has validated the task by comparing in-person and web-based performance on the two-stage task in children and young adults. To date, no study has validated the dissociation of goal-directed and habitual behaviors in older adults online. Here, we implemented and validated a web-based version of the two-stage Markov task using parameter simulation and recovery and compared behavioral results from online and in-person participation on the two-stage task in both young and healthy older adults. We found no differences in estimated free parameters between online and in-person participation on the two-stage task. Further, we replicate previous findings that young adults are more goal-directed than older adults both in-person and online. Overall, this work demonstrates that the implementation and use of the two-stage Markov decision task for remote participation is feasible in the older adult demographic, which would allow for the study of decision-making with larger and more diverse samples.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

For each Case, 2 patients without dementia observed in the same period study, pair matched for gender, age (±5 years), PaO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/FiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (P/F) ratio at admission (&amp;lt;200, or &amp;gt;200), number of comorbidities (±1; excluding dementia) were chosen (Control group).&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;The majority of patients were males (60.9% of Cases and Controls) and very elderly [median age 82 years (IQR: 75.5–85) in the Cases and 80 (IQR: 75.5–83.75) in the Controls]. The prevalence of co-pathologies was very high: all the Cases and 43 (93.5%) Controls showed a Charlson comorbidity index of at least 2. During hospitalization the patients in the Case group less frequently had a moderate disease of COVID-19 (35 vs. 67.4%, p = 0.02), more frequently a severe disease (48 vs. 22%, p = 0.03) and more frequently died (48 vs. 22%, p = 0.03). Moreover, during coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), 14 (60.8%) patients in the Case group and 1 (2.1%; p &amp;lt; 0.000) in the Control group showed signs and symptoms of delirium.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;Patients with dementia are vulnerable and have an increased risk of a severe disease and death when infected with COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.691691</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Hypothesis-driven studies have demonstrated that sex moderates many of the relationships between brain health and cardiometabolic disease, which impacts risk for later-life cognitive decline. In the present study, we sought to further our understanding of the associations between multiple markers of brain integrity and cardiovascular risk in a midlife sample of 266 individuals by using network analysis, a technique specifically designed to examine complex associations among multiple systems at once. Separate network models were constructed for male and female participants to investigate sex differences in the biomarkers of interest, selected based on evidence linking them with risk for late-life cognitive decline: all components of metabolic syndrome (obesity, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and hyperglycemia); neuroimaging-derived brain-predicted age minus chronological age; ratio of white matter hyperintensities to whole brain volume; seed-based resting state functional connectivity in the Default Mode Network, and ratios of N-acetyl aspartate, glutamate and myo-inositol to creatine, measured through proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Males had a sparse network (87.2% edges = 0) relative to females (69.2% edges = 0), indicating fewer relationships between measures of cardiometabolic risk and brain integrity. The edges in the female network provide meaningful information about potential mechanisms between brain integrity and cardiometabolic health. Additionally, Apolipoprotein ϵ4 (ApoE ϵ4) status and waist circumference emerged as central nodes in the female model. Our study demonstrates that network analysis is a promising technique for examining relationships between risk factors for cognitive decline in a midlife population and that investigating sex differences may help optimize risk prediction and tailor individualized treatments in the future.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Benefits of Higher Cardiovascular and Motor Coordinative Fitness on Driving Behavior Are Mediated by Cognitive Functioning: A Path Analysis</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.686499</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Driving is an important skill for older adults to maintain an independent lifestyle, and to preserve the quality of life. However, the ability to drive safely in older adults can be compromised by age-related cognitive decline. Performing an additional task during driving (e.g., adjusting the radio) increases cognitive demands and thus might additionally impair driving performance. Cognitive functioning has been shown to be positively related to physical activity/fitness such as cardiovascular and motor coordinative fitness. As such, a higher fitness level might be associated with higher cognitive resources and may therefore benefit driving performance under dual-task conditions. For the first time, the present study investigated whether this association of physical fitness and cognitive functioning causes an indirect relationship between physical fitness and dual-task driving performance through cognitive functions. Data from 120 healthy older adults (age: 69.56 ± 3.62, 53 female) were analyzed. Participants completed tests on cardiovascular fitness (cardiorespiratory capacity), motor coordinative fitness (composite score: static balance, psychomotor speed, bimanual dexterity), and cognitive functions (updating, inhibition, shifting, cognitive processing speed). Further, they performed a virtual car driving scenario where they additionally engaged in cognitively demanding tasks that were modeled after typical real-life activities during driving (typing or reasoning). Structural equation modeling (path analysis) was used to investigate whether cardiovascular and motor coordinative fitness were indirectly associated with lane keeping (i.e., variability in lateral position) and speed control (i.e., average velocity) while dual-task driving via cognitive functions. Both cardiovascular and motor coordinative fitness demonstrated the hypothesized indirect effects on dual-task driving. Motor coordinative fitness showed a significant indirect effect on lane keeping, while cardiovascular fitness demonstrated a trend-level indirect effect on speed control. Moreover, both fitness domains were positively related to different cognitive functions (processing speed and/or updating), and cognitive functions (updating or inhibition), in turn, were related to dual-task driving. These findings indicate that cognitive benefits associated with higher fitness may facilitate driving performance. Given that driving with lower cognitive capacity can result in serious consequences, this study emphasizes the importance for older adults to engage in a physically active lifestyle as it might serve as a preventive measure for driving safety.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Retinal Microvascular Features in Alzheimer's Disease</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.683824</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Objective: The aim of this meta-analysis was to investigate retinal microvascular features in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) using optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: PubMed, Cochrane Library, Embase, and Web of Science databases were systematically searched for published articles comparing retinal microvascular characteristics in subjects with AD and controls. The mean difference (MD) with a 95% confidence interval (CI) was used to assess continuous variables. Review Manager Version (RevMan) 5.30, was employed to analyze the data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Nine studies were included in the meta-analysis. The analysis revealed that the macular whole enface superficial and deep vessel density (VD) values measured by OCTA were significantly lower in patients with AD than in controls (MD = −1.10, P &amp;lt; 0.0001; MD = −1.61, P = 0.0001, respectively). The value measured by OCTA for parafoveal superficial VD in patients with AD was also remarkably lower than that in the control group (MD = −1.42, P = 0.001), whereas there was no significant difference in the value for parafoveal deep VD (MD = −3.67, P = 0.19), compared to the controls. In addition, the foveal avascular zone (FAZ) was larger in patients with AD than in the control group (MD = 0.08, P = 0.07), although it did not reach statistical significance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: The present meta-analysis indicated that the macular whole enface and parafoveal vessel densities were reduced in patients with AD. Moreover, our pooled data revealed that FAZ is larger in patients with AD. Consequently, OCTA may be utilized as a diagnostic tool to identify and monitor patients with AD.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Temporal Ordering of Inflammatory Analytes sTNFR2 and sTREM2 in Relation to Alzheimer's Disease Biomarkers and Clinical Outcomes</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.676744</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Inflammatory changes are among the key markers of Alzheimer's disease (AD) related pathological changes. Pro-inflammatory analytes have been related to cognitive decline while others have been related to attenuating neuronal death. Among them, changes in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of soluble triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (sTREM2) and soluble tumor necrosis factor receptor 2 (sTNFR2) have been described as impacting favorable clinical outcomes in AD. We therefore evaluate the effect of CSF sTREM2 and sTNFR2 when taken together on AD biomarkers and longitudinal clinical decline to understand their relative role on impacting AD clinical biomarkers and subsequent clinical outcomes. This longitudinal observational cohort study included 168 amyloid-positive (A+) and p-tau-positive (T+) participants with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or AD dementia from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) with 109 of them having concomitant CSF sTREM2 and sTNFR2 data and 48 A+ T+ participants with MCI from a tertiary memory clinic cohort. An exploratory analysis was performed using data from 86 cognitively normal (CN) participants from ADNI with 72 of them having concomitant CSF AD biomarkers and CSF sTREM2 and sTNFR2 data. General linear models were used to evaluate the effect of sTREM2 and sTNFR2 levels on baseline CSF Aβ42, t-tau, and p-tau, and a linear mixed-effects model was used to assess longitudinal cognitive change after controlling for well-known covariates. Among ADNI A+ T+ MCI and AD dementia participants, CSF sTNFR2 had a stronger association, than CSF sTREM2, with CSF t-tau and p-tau. This was replicated among A+ T+ MCI participants from the memory clinic cohort. On the contrary, among A+ T+ CN participants, CSF sTREM2 explained significant variance in CSF t-tau and p-tau, while CSF sTNFR2 did not. When the effects of CSF sTNFR2 and t-tau on longitudinal cognitive change were taken into account, higher CSF sTREM2 predicted slower cognitive decline in A+ T+ AD dementia participants and faster decline in A+ T+ CN participants. Our results show that given the dynamic changes in sTREM2 and sTNFR2, the clinical impact of these distinct inflammation related biomarkers in tracking AD temporal progression across disease stages are likely to differ.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Case Report: A Homozygous Mutation (p.Y62X) of Phospholipase D3 May Lead to a New Leukoencephalopathy Syndrome</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.671296</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Leukodystrophies are a heterogeneous group of inherited disorders with highly variable clinical manifestations and pathogenetic backgrounds. At present, variants in more than 20 genes have been described and may be responsible for different types of leukodystrophies. Members of the phospholipase D family of enzymes catalyze the hydrolysis of membrane phospholipids. Meanwhile, phospholipase D3 (PLD3) has also been found to exhibit single stranded DNA (ssDNA) acid 5′ exonuclease activity. Variants in phospholipase D3 (PLD3) may increase the risk of Alzheimer's disease and spinocerebellar ataxia, but this hypothesis has not been fully confirmed. In this study, we identified a novel homozygous mutation (NM_012268.3: c.186C&amp;gt;G/ p.Y62X) of PLD3 in a consanguineous family with white matter lesions, hearing and vision loss, and kidney disease by whole exome sequencing. Real-time PCR revealed that the novel mutation may lead to non-sense-mediated messenger RNA (mRNA) decay. This may be the first case report on the homozygous mutation of PLD3 in patients worldwide. Our studies indicated that homozygous mutation of PLD3 may result in a novel leukoencephalopathy syndrome with white matter lesions, hearing and vision loss, and kidney disease.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Time Course and Clinical Relevance of Neurological Deterioration After Endovascular Recanalization Therapy for Anterior Circulation Large Vessel Occlusion Stroke</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.651614</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Neurological deterioration (ND) is a devastating complication for patients with ischemic stroke after endovascular recanalization therapy (EVT). We aimed to investigate the time course and clinical relevance of ND after EVT. Consecutive patients with acute ischemic stroke who underwent EVT for large arterial occlusions of the anterior cerebral circulation were enrolled. The National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) scores were assessed before EVT, at the end of EVT, at 24 h (d1), on day 3 (d3), on day 15 (d15), at discharge and anytime when ND was indicated. ND was defined as an increase of ≥ 4 points in the NIHSS score and was divided into acute ND (AD, within 24 h), subacute ND (SD, d1–d3), and delayed ND (DD, d3–d15 or discharge). Using multivariable logistic regression analysis, we explored predictors and outcomes of ND at different time periods. As a result, of 343 patients, 129 (37.6%) experienced ND, including 90 (26.2%) with AD, 27 (7.9%) with SD and 12 (3.5%) with DD. Multivariable logistic regression analysis revealed that history of hypertension, cardioembolic stroke, lower Alberta Stroke Program Early Computed Tomography Score (ASPECTS), and poor collaterals were significantly associated with an increased risk of AD; history of hypertension, lower ASPECTS, poor collaterals, and unsuccessful recanalization, with SD; and high admission NIHSS score, with DD. In addition, patients who experienced AD (OR = 10.22, P &amp;lt; 0.001), SD (OR = 15.89, P = 0.004), or DD (OR = 8.31, P = 0.015) were more likely to have poor outcomes. ND was a strong predictor of poor stroke outcomes. Management of related risk factors at different ND time periods might improve the prognosis of EVT.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: A phase transition enhances the catalytic activity of SARM1, an NAD+ glycohydrolase involved in neurodegeneration</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/66694</link>
	<content:encoded>Sterile alpha and toll/interleukin receptor (TIR) motif-containing protein 1 (SARM1) is a neuronally expressed NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; glycohydrolase whose activity is increased in response to stress. NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; depletion triggers axonal degeneration, which is a characteristic feature of neurological diseases. Notably, loss of SARM1 is protective in murine models of peripheral neuropathy and traumatic brain injury. Herein, we report that citrate induces a phase transition that enhances SARM1 activity by ~2000-fold. This phase transition can be disrupted by mutating a residue involved in multimerization, G601P. This mutation also disrupts puncta formation in cells. We further show that citrate induces axonal degeneration in &lt;i&gt;C. elegans &lt;/i&gt;that is dependent on the &lt;i&gt;C. elegans&lt;/i&gt; orthologue of SARM1 (TIR-1). Notably, citrate induces the formation of larger puncta indicating that TIR-1/SARM1 multimerization is essential for degeneration in vivo. These findings provide critical insights into SARM1 biology with important implications for the discovery of novel SARM1-targeted therapeutics.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: Mechanical stretch scales centriole number to apical area via Piezo1 in multiciliated cells</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/66076</link>
	<content:encoded>How cells count and regulate organelle number is a fundamental question in cell biology. For example, most cells restrict centrioles to two in number and assemble one cilium; however, multiciliated cells (MCCs) synthesize hundreds of centrioles to assemble multiple cilia. Aberration in centriole/cilia number impairs MCC function and can lead to pathological outcomes. Yet how MCCs control centriole number remains unknown. Using &lt;i&gt;Xenopus&lt;/i&gt;, we demonstrate that centriole number scales with apical area over a remarkable 40-fold change in size. We find that tensile forces that shape the apical area also trigger centriole amplification based on both cell stretching experiments and disruption of embryonic elongation. Unexpectedly, Piezo1, a mechanosensitive ion channel, localizes near each centriole suggesting a potential role in centriole amplification. Indeed, depletion of Piezo1 affects centriole amplification and disrupts its correlation with the apical area in a tension dependent manner. Thus, mechanical forces calibrate cilia/centriole number to the MCC apical area via Piezo1. Our results provide new perspectives to study organelle number control essential for optimal cell function.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/65764</link>
	<content:encoded>Non-overlapping cell populations within dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC), defined by gene expression or projection target, control dissociable aspects of reward seeking through unique activity patterns. However, even within these defined cell populations considerable cell-to-cell variability is found, suggesting that greater resolution is needed to understand information processing in dmPFC. Here we use two-photon calcium imaging in awake, behaving mice to monitor the activity of dmPFC excitatory neurons throughout Pavlovian reward conditioning. We characterize five unique neuronal ensembles that each encode specialized information related to a sucrose reward, reward-predictive cues, and behavioral responses to those cues. The ensembles differentially emerge across daily training sessions - and stabilize after learning - in a manner that improves the predictive validity of dmPFC activity dynamics for deciphering variables related to behavioral conditioning. Our results characterize the complex dmPFC neuronal ensemble dynamics that stably predict reward availability and initiation of conditioned reward seeking following cue-reward learning.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/63021</link>
	<content:encoded>The congenital intellectual disability (ID)-causing gene mutations remain largely unclear, although many genetic variations might relate to ID. We screened gene mutations in Chinese Han children suffering from severe ID and found a single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the 5′-untranslated region (5′-UTR) of fibroblast growth factor 13 (FGF13) mRNA (NM_001139500.1:c.-32c&amp;gt;G) shared by three male children. In both HEK293 cells and patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells, this SNP reduced the translation of FGF13, which stabilizes microtubules in developing neurons. Mice carrying the homologous point mutation in 5′-UTR of &lt;i&gt;Fgf13&lt;/i&gt; showed delayed neuronal migration during cortical development, and weakened learning and memory. Furthermore, this SNP reduced the interaction between &lt;i&gt;FGF13&lt;/i&gt; 5′-UTR and polypyrimidine-tract-binding protein 2 (PTBP2), which was required for &lt;i&gt;FGF13&lt;/i&gt; translation in cortical neurons. Thus, this 5′-UTR SNP of &lt;i&gt;FGF13&lt;/i&gt; interferes with the translational process of &lt;i&gt;FGF13&lt;/i&gt; and causes deficits in brain development and cognitive functions.</content:encoded>

As genomic architectures become more complex, they begin to accumulate degenerate and redundant elements. However, analyses of the molecular mechanisms underlying these genetic architecture features remain scarce, especially in compact but sufficiently complex genomes. In the present study, we followed a proteomic approach together with a computational network analysis to reveal molecular signatures of protein function degeneracy from a plant virus (as virus-host protein-protein interactions). We employed affinity purification coupled to mass spectrometry to detect several host factors interacting with two proteins of &lt;i&gt;Citrus tristeza virus&lt;/i&gt; (p20 and p25) that are known to function as RNA silencing suppressors, using an experimental system of transient expression in a model plant. The study was expanded by considering two different isolates of the virus, and some key interactions were confirmed by bimolecular fluorescence complementation assays. We found that p20 and p25 target a common set of plant proteins including chloroplastic proteins and translation factors. Moreover, we noted that even specific targets of each viral protein overlap in function. Notably, we identified argonaute proteins (key players in RNA silencing) as reliable targets of p20. Furthermore, we found that these viral proteins preferentially do not target hubs in the host protein interactome, but elements that can transfer information by bridging different parts of the interactome. Overall, our results demonstrate that two distinct proteins encoded in the same viral genome that overlap in function also overlap in their interactions with the cell proteome, thereby highlighting an overlooked connection from a degenerate viral system.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/DmgBonblARI&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Regulating synchronous oscillations of cerebellar granule cells by different types of inhibition</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/mUWR-zZDQ7Q/article</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Yuanhong Tang, Lingling An, Quan Wang, Jian K. Liu&lt;/p&gt;

Synchronous oscillations in neural populations are considered being controlled by inhibitory neurons. In the granular layer of the cerebellum, two major types of cells are excitatory granular cells (GCs) and inhibitory Golgi cells (GoCs). GC spatiotemporal dynamics, as the output of the granular layer, is highly regulated by GoCs. However, there are various types of inhibition implemented by GoCs. With inputs from mossy fibers, GCs and GoCs are reciprocally connected to exhibit different network motifs of synaptic connections. From the view of GCs, feedforward inhibition is expressed as the direct input from GoCs excited by mossy fibers, whereas feedback inhibition is from GoCs via GCs themselves. In addition, there are abundant gap junctions between GoCs showing another form of inhibition. It remains unclear how these diverse copies of inhibition regulate neural population oscillation changes. Leveraging a computational model of the granular layer network, we addressed this question to examine the emergence and modulation of network oscillation using different types of inhibition. We show that at the network level, feedback inhibition is crucial to generate neural oscillation. When short-term plasticity was equipped on GoC-GC synapses, oscillations were largely diminished. Robust oscillations can only appear with additional gap junctions. Moreover, there was a substantial level of cross-frequency coupling in oscillation dynamics. Such a coupling was adjusted and strengthened by GoCs through feedback inhibition. Taken together, our results suggest that the cooperation of distinct types of GoC inhibition plays an essential role in regulating synchronous oscillations of the GC population. With GCs as the sole output of the granular network, their oscillation dynamics could potentially enhance the computational capability of downstream neurons.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/mUWR-zZDQ7Q&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

The white matter contains long-range connections between different brain regions and the organization of these connections holds important implications for brain function in health and disease. Tractometry uses diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) to quantify tissue properties along the trajectories of these connections. Statistical inference from tractometry usually either averages these quantities along the length of each fiber bundle or computes regression models separately for each point along every one of the bundles. These approaches are limited in their sensitivity, in the former case, or in their statistical power, in the latter. We developed a method based on the sparse group lasso (SGL) that takes into account tissue properties along all of the bundles and selects informative features by enforcing both global and bundle-level sparsity. We demonstrate the performance of the method in two settings: i) in a classification setting, patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) are accurately distinguished from matched controls. Furthermore, SGL identifies the corticospinal tract as important for this classification, correctly finding the parts of the white matter known to be affected by the disease. ii) In a regression setting, SGL accurately predicts “brain age.” In this case, the weights are distributed throughout the white matter indicating that many different regions of the white matter change over the lifespan. Thus, SGL leverages the multivariate relationships between diffusion properties in multiple bundles to make accurate phenotypic predictions while simultaneously discovering the most relevant features of the white matter.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/rIbdV9_I_VM&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Cancer is the result of mutagenic processes that can be inferred from tumor genomes by analyzing rate spectra of point mutations, or “mutational signatures”. Here we present SparseSignatures, a novel framework to extract signatures from somatic point mutation data. Our approach incorporates a user-specified background signature, employs regularization to reduce noise in non-background signatures, uses cross-validation to identify the number of signatures, and is scalable to large datasets. We show that SparseSignatures outperforms current state-of-the-art methods on simulated data using a variety of standard metrics. We then apply SparseSignatures to whole genome sequences of pancreatic and breast tumors, discovering well-differentiated signatures that are linked to known mutagenic mechanisms and are strongly associated with patient clinical features.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/CyAiWRPg3_k&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Angiogenesis is the process by which blood vessels form from pre-existing vessels. It plays a key role in many biological processes, including embryonic development and wound healing, and contributes to many diseases including cancer and rheumatoid arthritis. The structure of the resulting vessel networks determines their ability to deliver nutrients and remove waste products from biological tissues. Here we simulate the Anderson-Chaplain model of angiogenesis at different parameter values and quantify the vessel architectures of the resulting synthetic data. Specifically, we propose a topological data analysis (TDA) pipeline for systematic analysis of the model. TDA is a vibrant and relatively new field of computational mathematics for studying the shape of data. We compute topological and standard descriptors of model simulations generated by different parameter values. We show that TDA of model simulation data stratifies parameter space into regions with similar vessel morphology. The methodologies proposed here are widely applicable to other synthetic and experimental data including wound healing, development, and plant biology.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/yhP3eEOYSho&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

In most animals, natural stimuli are characterized by a high degree of redundancy, limiting the ensemble of ecologically valid stimuli to a significantly reduced subspace of the representation space. Neural encodings can exploit this redundancy and increase sensing efficiency by generating low-dimensional representations that retain all information essential to support behavior. In this study, we investigate whether such an efficient encoding can be found to support a broad range of echolocation tasks in bats. Starting from an ensemble of echo signals collected with a biomimetic sonar system in natural indoor and outdoor environments, we use independent component analysis to derive a low-dimensional encoding of the output of a cochlear model. We show that this compressive encoding retains all essential information. To this end, we simulate a range of psycho-acoustic experiments with bats. In these simulations, we train a set of neural networks to use the encoded echoes as input while performing the experiments. The results show that the neural networks’ performance is at least as good as that of the bats. We conclude that our results indicate that efficient encoding of echo information is feasible and, given its many advantages, very likely to be employed by bats. Previous studies have demonstrated that low-dimensional encodings allow for task resolution at a relatively high level. In contrast to previous work in this area, we show that high performance can also be achieved when low-dimensional filters are derived from a data set of realistic echo signals, not tailored to specific experimental conditions.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/WPbUhUfiA7g&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

The brain exhibits capabilities of fast incremental learning from few noisy examples, as well as the ability to associate similar memories in autonomously-created categories and to combine contextual hints with sensory perceptions. Together with sleep, these mechanisms are thought to be key components of many high-level cognitive functions. Yet, little is known about the underlying processes and the specific roles of different brain states. In this work, we exploited the combination of context and perception in a thalamo-cortical model based on a soft winner-take-all circuit of excitatory and inhibitory spiking neurons. After calibrating this model to express awake and deep-sleep states with features comparable with biological measures, we demonstrate the model capability of fast incremental learning from few examples, its resilience when proposed with noisy perceptions and contextual signals, and an improvement in visual classification after sleep due to induced synaptic homeostasis and association of similar memories.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/KEA-y1Hdr-s&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: How public reaction to disease information across scales and the impacts of vector control methods influence disease prevalence and control efficacy</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/bOqhziw6mu8/article</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Jing Jiao, Gonzalo P. Suarez, Nina H. Fefferman&lt;/p&gt;

With the development of social media, the information about vector-borne disease incidence over broad spatial scales can cause demand for local vector control before local risk exists. Anticipatory intervention may still benefit local disease control efforts; however, infection risks are not the only focal concerns governing public demand for vector control. Concern for environmental contamination from pesticides and economic limitations on the frequency and magnitude of control measures also play key roles. Further, public concern may be focused more on ecological factors (i.e., controlling mosquito populations) or on epidemiological factors (i.e., controlling infection-carrying mosquitoes), which may lead to very different control outcomes. Here we introduced a generic Ross-MacDonald model, incorporating these factors under three spatial scales of disease information: local, regional, and global. We tailored and parameterized the model for Zika virus transmitted by &lt;i&gt;Aedes aegypti&lt;/i&gt; mosquito. We found that sensitive reactivity caused by larger-scale incidence information could decrease average human infections per patch breeding capacity, however, the associated increase in total control effort plays a larger role, which leads to an overall decrease in control efficacy. The shift of focal concerns from epidemiological to ecological risk could relax the negative effect of the sensitive reactivity on control efficacy when mosquito breeding capacity populations are expected to be large. This work demonstrates that, depending on expected total mosquito breeding capacity population size, and weights of different focal concerns, large-scale disease information can reduce disease infections without lowering control efficacy. Our findings provide guidance for vector-control strategies by considering public reaction through social media.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/bOqhziw6mu8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Proteins of the major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC I), predominantly known for antigen presentation in the immune system, have recently been shown to be necessary for developmental neural refinement and adult synaptic plasticity. However, their roles in nonneuronal cell populations in the brain remain largely unexplored. Here, we identify classical MHC I molecule H2-K&lt;sup&gt;b&lt;/sup&gt; as a negative regulator of proliferation in neural stem and progenitor cells (NSPCs). Using genetic knockout mouse models and in vivo viral-mediated RNA interference (RNAi) and overexpression, we delineate a role for H2-K&lt;sup&gt;b&lt;/sup&gt; in negatively regulating NSPC proliferation and adult hippocampal neurogenesis. Transcriptomic analysis of H2-K&lt;sup&gt;b&lt;/sup&gt; knockout NSPCs, in combination with in vitro RNAi, overexpression, and pharmacological approaches, further revealed that H2-K&lt;sup&gt;b&lt;/sup&gt; inhibits cell proliferation by dampening signaling pathways downstream of fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (Fgfr1). These findings identify H2-K&lt;sup&gt;b&lt;/sup&gt; as a critical regulator of cell proliferation through the modulation of growth factor signaling.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/Gcex-ADRIZs&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Can transcranial direct current stimulation of the primary motor cortex improve implicit motor sequence learning in individuals with Parkinson's disease? A comparison with neurologically healthy, age‐ and sex‐matched controls.

Abstract
Implicit motor sequence learning (IMSL) is a cognitive function that is known to be directly associated with impaired motor function in Parkinson's disease (PD). Research on healthy young participants shows the potential for transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), a noninvasive brain stimulation technique, over the primary motor cortex (M1) to enhance IMSL. tDCS has direct effects on the underlying cortex, but also induces distant (basal ganglia) network effects—hence its potential value in PD, a prime model of basal ganglia dysfunction. To date, only null effects have been reported in persons with PD. However, these studies did not determine the reacquisition effects, although previous studies in healthy young adults suggest that tDCS specifically exerts its beneficial effects on IMSL on reacquisition rather than acquisition. In the current study, we will therefore establish possible reacquisition effects, which are of a particular interest, as long‐term effects are vital for the successful functional rehabilitation of persons with PD. Using a sham‐controlled, counterbalanced design, we will investigate the potential of tDCS delivered over M1 to enhance IMSL, as measured by the serial reaction time task, in persons with PD and a neurologically healthy age‐ and sex‐matched control (HC) group. Multilevel Mixed Models will be implemented to analyze the sequence‐specific aspect of IMSL (primary outcome) and general learning (secondary outcome). We will determine not only the immediate effects that may occur concurrently with the application of tDCS but also the short‐term (5 min post‐tDCS) and long‐term (1 week post‐tDCS) reacquisition effects.</content:encoded>

Abstract
We examined the number, distribution and immunoreactivity of the infracortical white matter neuronal population, also termed white matter interstitial cells (WMICs), throughout the telencephalic white matter of an adult female chimpanzee. Staining for neuronal nuclear marker (NeuN) revealed WMICs throughout the infracortical white matter, these cells being most numerous and dense close to the inner border of cortical layer VI, decreasing significantly in density with depth in the white matter. Stereological analysis of NeuN‐immunopositive cells revealed an estimate of approximately 137.2 million WMICs within the infracortical white matter of the chimpanzee brain studied. Immunostaining revealed subpopulations of WMICs containing neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS, approximately 14.4 million in number), calretinin (approximately 16.7 million), very few WMICs containing parvalbumin, and no calbindin‐immunopositive neurons. The nNOS, calretinin and parvalbumin immunopositive WMICs, possibly all inhibitory neurons, represent approximately 22.6% of the total WMIC population. As the white matter is affected in many cognitive conditions, such as schizophrenia, autism, epilepsy and also in neurodegenerative diseases, understanding these neurons across species is important for the translation of findings of neural dysfunction in animal models to humans. Furthermore, studies of WMICs in species such as apes provides a crucial phylogenetic context for understanding the evolution of these cell types in the human brain.

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Previous History of Migraine is associated with Fatigue, but not Headache, as Long-Term Post-COVID Symptom after SARS-CoV-2 Infection: A Case- Control Study</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.678472</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Objective: To investigate the association of pre-existing migraine in patients hospitalised and who recovered from SARS-CoV-2 infection with the presence of post-COVID symptoms. Background: No study has investigated the role of migraine as a risk factor for development of post-COVID symptoms. Methods: A case-control study including individuals hospitalised during the first wave of the pandemic (from February 20 to May 31, 2020) was conducted. Patients with confirmed previous diagnosis of migraine were considered cases. Two age- and sex-matched individuals without a history of headache per case were also recruited as controls. Hospitalisation/clinical data were collected from hospital medical records. Patients were scheduled for a telephone interview. A list of post-COVID symptoms was systematically evaluated, but participants were invited to freely report any symptom. The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index were used to assess anxiety/depressive symptoms and sleep quality. Multivariable conditional logistic regression models were constructed. Results: Overall, 57 patients with confirmed diagnosis of migraine and 144 non-migraine controls who had recovered from COVID-19 were assessed at 7.3 months (SD 0.6) after hospital discharge. The number of post-COVID symptoms in the migraine group was significantly greater (OR 1.70 95%CI 1.29-2.25, P&amp;lt;0.001) than in the non-migraine group. Fatigue was significantly more prevalent (OR 2.89 95%CI 1.32-6.32, P=0.008) in the migraine group. However, no between-groups difference in the prevalence of headache as a post-COVID symptom was detected. Conclusions: Patients with a history of migraine who recovered from COVID-19 exhibited more long-term fatigue as post-COVID sequelae than those without migraine. Some of the pathophysiological changes associated with migraine could predispose to the occurrence of post-COVID symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cne.25205?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>This study analyzed the spatiotemporal expression of ten microRNAs (miRNAs) in the chicken auditory hindbrain. All miRNAs were broadly expressed in all four auditory nuclei.  In the nucleus magnocelluaris (NM), nine miRNAs showed a spatially differential expression along the cochleotopic axis at embryonic day 13, a pre‐hearing stage. Quantification resulted in four distinct miRNA expression patterns, namely, homogenous, gradient, selective, and highly selective. The latter two expression patterns matched rhombomeric boundaries of this plurisegmental nucleus. Bioinformatics identified several functional groups of target mRNAs that might play an important role during ontogeny of this nucleus. This study adds miRNAs to the list of developmental gradients in the auditory system.







Abstract
The avian auditory hindbrain is a longstanding model for studying neural circuit development. Information on gene regulatory network (GRN) components underlying this process, however, is scarce. Recently, the spatiotemporal expression of 12 miRNAs was investigated in the mammalian auditory hindbrain. As a comparative study, we here investigated the spatiotemporal expression of the orthologous miRNAs during development of the chicken auditory hindbrain. All miRNAs were expressed both at E13, an immature stage, and P14, a mature stage of the auditory system. In most auditory nuclei, a homogeneous expression pattern was observed at both stages, like the mammalian system. An exception was the nucleus magnocellularis (NM). There, at E13, nine miRNAs showed a differential expression pattern along the cochleotopic axis with high expression at the rostromedial pole. One of them showed a gradient expression whereas eight showed a spatially selective expression at the rostral pole that reflected the different rhombomeric origins of this composite nucleus. The miRNA differential expression persisted in the NM to the mature stage, with the selective expression changed to linear gradients. Bioinformatics analysis predicted mRNA targets that are associated with neuronal developmental processes such as neurite and synapse organization, calcium and ephrin‐Eph signaling, and neurotransmission. Overall, this first analysis of miRNAs in the chicken central auditory system reveals shared and strikingly distinct features between chicken and murine orthologues. The embryonic gradient expression of these GRN elements in the NM adds miRNA patterns to the list of cochleotopic and developmental gradients in the central auditory system.

	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.26146?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Objective
Identifying common genetic variants that confer genetic risk for cluster headache.


Methods
We conducted a case–control study in the Dutch Leiden University Cluster headache neuro‐Analysis program (LUCA) study population (n = 840) and controls from the Netherlands Epidemiology of Obesity Study (NEO) (n = 1,457), representing the general population. Replication was performed in a Norwegian sample of 144 cases from the Trondheim Cluster headache sample and 1,800 controls from the Nord‐Trøndelag Health Survey (HUNT). Gene set and tissue enrichment analyses, blood cell‐derived RNA‐sequencing of genes around the risk loci and linkage disequilibrium score regression were part of the downstream analyses.


Results
An association was found with cluster headache for four independent loci (r2 &amp;lt; 0.1) with genome‐wide significance (p &amp;lt; 5 x 10−8), rs11579212 (odds ratio (OR) = 1.51, 95% CI 1.33–1.72 near RP11‐815 M8.1), rs6541998 (OR = 1.53, 95% CI 1.37–1.74 near MERTK), rs10184573 (OR = 1.43, 95% CI 1.26–1.61 near AC093590.1), and rs2499799 (OR = 0.62, 95% CI 0.54–0.73 near UFL1/FHL5), collectively explaining 7.2% of the variance of the phenotype. SNPs rs11579212, rs10184573 and rs976357, as proxy SNP for rs2499799 (r2 = 1.0), replicated in the Norwegian sample (p &amp;lt; 0.05). Gene‐based mapping yielded ASZ1 as possible fifth locus. RNA‐sequencing indicated differential expression of POLR1B and TMEM87B in cluster headache.


Interpretation
This GWAS identified and replicated genetic risk loci for cluster headache with effect sizes larger than those typically seen in complex genetic disorders.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Non‐cell autonomous epileptogenesis in focal cortical dysplasia</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.26149?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Objective
Low‐level somatic mosaicism in the brain has been shown to be a major genetic cause of intractable focal epilepsy. However, how a relatively few mutation‐carrying neurons are able to induce epileptogenesis at the local network level remains poorly understood.


Methods
To probe the origin of epileptogenesis, we measured the excitability of neurons with MTOR mutation and nearby non‐mutated neurons recorded by whole‐cell patch‐clamp and array‐based electrodes comparing the topographic distribution of mutation. Computational simulation is used to understand neural network‐level changes based on electrophysiological properties. To examine the underlying mechanism, we measured inhibitory and excitatory synaptic inputs in mutated neurons and nearby neurons by electrophysiological and histological methods using the mouse model and postoperative human brain tissue for cortical dysplasia. To explain non‐cell autonomous hyperexcitability, an inhibitor of adenosine kinase was injected into mice to enhance adenosine signaling and to mitigate hyperactivity of nearby non‐mutated neurons.


Results
We generated mice having a low‐level somatic mutation in MTOR presenting spontaneous seizures. The seizure‐triggering hyperexcitability was originated from non‐mutated neurons near mutation‐carrying neurons which proved to be less excitable than non‐mutated neurons. Interestingly, the net balance between excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs onto mutated neurons remained unchanged. Additionally, we found that inhibition of adenosine kinase, which affects adenosine metabolism and neuronal excitability, reduced the hyperexcitability of non‐mutated neurons.


Interpretation
This study showed that neurons carrying somatic mutations in MTOR lead to focal epileptogenesis via non‐cell autonomous hyperexcitability of nearby non‐mutated neurons.

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: Anatomy and function of retinorecipient arborization fields in zebrafish</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cne.25204?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
Burrill and Easter (1994) described the retinal projections in embryonic and larval zebrafish, introducing the term &quot;arborization fields&quot; (AFs) for the retinorecipient areas. AFs were numbered from 1 to 10 according to their positions along the optic tract. With the exception of AF10 (neuropil of the optic tectum), annotations of AFs remained tentative. Here we offer an update on the likely identities and functions of zebrafish AFs after successfully matching classical neuroanatomy to the digital Max Plack Zebrafish Brain atlas. In our system, individual AFs are neuropil areas associated with the following nuclei: AF1 with the suprachiasmatic nucleus; AF2 with the posterior parvocellular preoptic nucleus; AF3 and AF4 with the ventrolateral thalamic nucleus; AF4 with the anterior and intermediate thalamic nuclei; AF5 with the dorsal accessory optic nucleus; AF7 with the parvocellular superficial pretectal nucleus; AF8 with the central pretectal nucleus; and AF9d and AF9v with the dorsal and ventral periventricular pretectal nuclei. AF6 is probably part of the accessory optic system. Imaging, ablation and activation experiments showed contributions of AF5 and potentially AF6 to optokinetic and optomotor reflexes, AF4 to phototaxis, and AF7 to prey detection. AF6, AF8 and AF9v respond to dimming, and AF4 and AF9d to brightening. While few annotations remain tentative, it is apparent that the larval zebrafish visual system is anatomically and functionally continuous with its adult successor and fits the general cyprinid pattern. This study illustrates the synergy created by merging classical neuroanatomy with a cellular‐resolution digital brain atlas resource and functional imaging in larval zebrafish.

Much of this work, especially in primates, has explicated the role of various cortical areas in forming decisions. In new research, perturbations of the superior colliculus by Jun et al. reveal a large and causal role in accumulating evidence for this midbrain structure classically thought of as being involved in simpler functions related to eye movement control.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/neuro/rss/current/~4/h5bnCbjxVzw&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Sucrose Consumption Alters Serotonin/Glutamate Co-localisation Within the Prefrontal Cortex and Hippocampus of Mice</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2021.678267</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The overconsumption of sugar-sweetened food and beverages underpins the current rise in obesity rates. Sugar overconsumption induces maladaptive neuroplasticity to decrease dietary control. Although serotonin and glutamate co-localisation has been implicated in reward processing, it is still unknown how chronic sucrose consumption changes this transmission in regions associated with executive control over feeding—such as the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and dentate gyrus (DG) of the hippocampus. To address this, a total of 16 C57Bl6 mice received either 5% w/v sucrose or water as a control for 12 weeks using the Drinking-In-The-Dark paradigm (n = 8 mice per group). We then examined the effects of chronic sucrose consumption on the immunological distribution of serotonin (5-HT), vesicular glutamate transporter 3 (VGLUT3) and 5-HT&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/VGLUT3&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; co-localised axonal varicosities. Sucrose consumption over 12 weeks decreased the number of 5-HT&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt;/VGLUT3&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and 5-HT&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/VGLUT3&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; varicosities within the PFC and DG. The number of 5-HT&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/VGLUT3&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt; varicosities remained unchanged within the PFC but decreased in the DG following sucrose consumption. Given that serotonin mediates DG neurogenesis through microglial migration, the number of microglia within the DG was also assessed in both experimental groups. Sucrose consumption decreased the number of DG microglia. Although the DG and PFC are associated with executive control over rewarding activities and emotional memory formation, we did not detect a subsequent change in DG neurogenesis or anxiety-like behaviour or depressive-like behaviour. Overall, these findings suggest that the chronic consumption of sugar alters serotonergic neuroplasticity within neural circuits responsible for feeding control. Although these alterations alone were not sufficient to induce changes in neurogenesis or behaviour, it is proposed that the sucrose consumption may predispose individuals to these cognitive deficits which ultimately promote further sugar intake.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: The tweety Gene Family: From Embryo to Disease</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2021.672511</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The tweety genes encode gated chloride channels that are found in animals, plants, and even simple eukaryotes, signifying their deep evolutionary origin. In vertebrates, the tweety gene family is highly conserved and consists of three members—ttyh1, ttyh2, and ttyh3—that are important for the regulation of cell volume. While research has elucidated potential physiological functions of ttyh1 in neural stem cell maintenance, proliferation, and filopodia formation during neural development, the roles of ttyh2 and ttyh3 are less characterized, though their expression patterns during embryonic and fetal development suggest potential roles in the development of a wide range of tissues including a role in the immune system in response to pathogen-associated molecules. Additionally, members of the tweety gene family have been implicated in various pathologies including cancers, particularly pediatric brain tumors, and neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease. Here, we review the current state of research using information from published articles and open-source databases on the tweety gene family with regard to its structure, evolution, expression during development and adulthood, biochemical and cellular functions, and role in human disease. We also identify promising areas for further research to advance our understanding of this important, yet still understudied, family of genes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neural Technology: High-Resolution EEG Source Localization in Segmentation-Free Head Models Based on Finite-Difference Method and Matching Pursuit Algorithm</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.695668</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Electroencephalogram (EEG) is a method to monitor electrophysiological activity on the scalp, which represents the macroscopic activity of the brain. However, it is challenging to identify EEG source regions inside the brain based on data measured by a scalp-attached network of electrodes. The accuracy of EEG source localization significantly depends on the type of head modeling and inverse problem solver. In this study, we adopted different models with a resolution of 0.5 mm to account for thin tissues/fluids, such as the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and dura. In particular, a spatially dependent conductivity (segmentation-free) model created using deep learning was developed and used for more realist representation of electrical conductivity. We then adopted a multi-grid-based finite-difference method (FDM) for forward problem analysis and a sparse-based algorithm to solve the inverse problem. This enabled us to perform efficient source localization using high-resolution model with a reasonable computational cost. Results indicated that the abrupt spatial change in conductivity, inherent in conventional segmentation-based head models, may trigger source localization error accumulation. The accurate modeling of the CSF, whose conductivity is the highest in the head, was an important factor affecting localization accuracy. Moreover, computational experiments with different noise levels and electrode setups demonstrate the robustness of the proposed method with segmentation-free head model.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Identification of Electroencephalogram Signals in Alzheimer's Disease by Multifractal and Multiscale Entropy Analysis</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.667614</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia and is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that primarily develops in old age. In recent years, it has been reported that early diagnosis of AD and early intervention significantly delays disease progression. Hence, early diagnosis and intervention are emphasized. As a diagnostic index for AD patients, evaluating the complexity of the dependence of the electroencephalography (EEG) signal on the temporal scale of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients is effective. Multiscale entropy analysis and multifractal analysis have been performed individually, and their usefulness as diagnostic indicators has been confirmed, but the complemental relationship between these analyses, which may enhance diagnostic accuracy, has not been investigated. We hypothesize that combining multiscale entropy and fractal analyses may add another dimension to understanding the alteration of EEG dynamics in AD. In this study, we performed both multiscale entropy and multifractal analyses on EEGs from AD patients and healthy subjects. We found that the classification accuracy was improved using both techniques. These findings suggest that the use of multiscale entropy analysis and multifractal analysis may lead to the development of AD diagnostic tools.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neural Technology: A High Accuracy Electrographic Seizure Classifier Trained Using Semi-Supervised Labeling Applied to a Large Spectrogram Dataset</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.667373</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The objective of this study was to explore using ECoG spectrogram images for training reliable cross-patient electrographic seizure classifiers, and to characterize the classifiers’ test accuracy as a function of amount of training data. ECoG channels in ∼138,000 time-series ECoG records from 113 patients were converted to RGB spectrogram images. Using an unsupervised spectrogram image clustering technique, manual labeling of 138,000 ECoG records (each with up to 4 ECoG channels) was completed in 320 h, which is an estimated 5 times faster than manual labeling without ECoG clustering. For training supervised classifier models, five random folds of data were created; with each fold containing 72, 18, and 23 patients’ data for model training, validation and testing respectively. Five convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures, including two with residual connections, were trained. Cross-patient classification accuracies and F&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; scores improved with model complexity, with the shallowest 6-layer model (with ∼1.5 million trainable parameters) producing a class-balanced seizure/non-seizure classification accuracy of 87.9% on ECoG channels and the deepest ResNet50-based model (with ∼23.5 million trainable parameters) producing a classification accuracy of 95.7%. The trained ResNet50-based model additionally had 93.5% agreement in scores with an independent expert labeller. Visual inspection of gradient-based saliency maps confirmed that the models’ classifications were based on relevant portions of the spectrogram images. Further, by repeating training experiments with data from varying number of patients, it was found that ECoG spectrogram images from just 10 patients were sufficient to train ResNet50-based models with 88% cross-patient accuracy, while at least 30 patients’ data was required to produce cross-patient classification accuracies of &amp;gt;90%.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Norms for Automatic Estimation of Hippocampal Atrophy and a Step Forward for Applicability to the Italian Population</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.656808</link>
	<content:encoded>Introduction&lt;p&gt;Hippocampal volume is one of the main biomarkers of Alzheimer’s Dementia (AD). Over the years, advanced tools that performed automatic segmentation of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) T13D scans have been developed, such as FreeSurfer (FS) and ACM-Adaboost (AA). Hippocampal volume is considered abnormal when it is below the 5th percentile of the normative population. The aim of this study was to set norms, established from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) population, for hippocampal volume measured with FS v.6.0 and AA tools in the neuGRID platform (www.neugrid2.eu) and demonstrate their applicability for the Italian population.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;Norms were set from a large group of 545 healthy controls belonging to ADNI. For each pipeline, subjects with segmentation errors were discarded, resulting in 532 valid segmentations for FS and 421 for AA (age range 56–90 years). The comparability of ADNI and the Italian Brain Normative Archive (IBNA), representative of the Italian general population, was assessed testing clinical variables, neuropsychological scores and normalized hippocampal volumes. Finally, percentiles were validated using the Italian Alzheimer’s disease Repository Without Borders (ARWiBo) as external independent data set to evaluate FS and AA generalizability.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Hippocampal percentiles were checked with the chi-square goodness of fit test. P-values were not significant, showing that FS and AA algorithm distributions fitted the data well. Clinical, neuropsychological and volumetric features were similar in ADNI and IBNA (p &amp;gt; 0.01). Hippocampal volumes measured with both FS and AA were associated with age (p &amp;lt; 0.001). The 5th percentile thresholds, indicating left/right hippocampal atrophy were respectively: (i) below 3,223/3,456 mm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; at 56 years and 2,506/2,415 mm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; at 90 years for FS; (ii) below 4,583/4,873 mm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; at 56 years and 3,831/3,870 mm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; at 90 years for AA. The average volumes computed on 100 cognitively intact healthy controls (CN) selected from ARWiBo were close to the 50th percentiles, while those for 100 AD patients were close to the abnormal percentiles.&lt;/p&gt;Discussion&lt;p&gt;Norms generated from ADNI through the automatic FS and AA segmentation tools may be used as normative references for Italian patients with suspected AD.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neural Technology: Effective Stimulation Type and Waveform for Force Control of the Motor Unit System: Implications for Intraspinal Microstimulation</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.645984</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The input–output properties of spinal motoneurons and muscle fibers comprising motor units are highly non-linear. The goal of this study was to investigate the stimulation type (continuous versus discrete) and waveform (linear versus non-linear) controlling force production at the motor unit level under intraspinal microstimulation. We constructed a physiological model of the motor unit with computer software enabling virtual experiments on single motor units under a wide range of input conditions, including intracellular and synaptic stimulation of the motoneuron and variation in the muscle length under neuromodulatory inputs originating from the brainstem. Continuous current intensity and impulse current frequency waveforms were inversely estimated such that the motor unit could linearly develop and relax the muscle force within a broad range of contraction speeds and levels during isometric contraction at various muscle lengths. Under both continuous and discrete stimulation, the stimulation waveform non-linearity increased with increasing speed and level of force production and with decreasing muscle length. Only discrete stimulation could control force relaxation at all muscle lengths. In contrast, continuous stimulation could not control force relaxation at high contraction levels in shorter-than-optimal muscles due to persistent inward current saturation on the motoneuron dendrites. These results indicate that non-linear adjustment of the stimulation waveform is more effective in regard to varying the force profile and muscle length and that the discrete stimulation protocol is a more robust approach for designing stimulation patterns aimed at neural interfaces for precise movement control under pathological conditions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.686433</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Introduction: Various functional neuroimaging studies help to better understand the changes in brain activity during meditation. The purpose of this study was to investigate how brain energy metabolism changes during focused attention meditation (FAM) state, measured by phosphorous magnetic resonance spectroscopy (&lt;sup&gt;31&lt;/sup&gt;P-MRS).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods:&lt;sup&gt;31&lt;/sup&gt;P-MRS imaging was carried out in 27 participants after 7 weeks of FAM training. Metabolite ratios and the absolute values of metabolites were assessed after meditation training in two MRI measurements, by comparing effects in a FAM state with those in a distinct focused attention awake state during a backwards counting task.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: The results showed decreased phosphocreatine/ATP (PCr/ATP), PCr/ inorganic phosphate (Pi), and intracellular pH values in the entire brain, but especially in basal ganglia, frontal lobes, and occipital lobes, and increased Pi/ATP ratio, cerebral Mg, and Pi absolute values were found in the same areas during FAM compared to the control focused attention awake state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: Changes in the temporal areas and basal ganglia may be interpreted as a higher energetic state induced by meditation, whereas the frontal and occipital areas showed changes that may be related to a down-regulation in ATP turnover, energy state, and oxidative capacity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: The Role of White Matter in the Neural Control of Swallowing: A Systematic Review</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.628424</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Background: Swallowing disorders (dysphagia) can negatively impact quality of life and health. For clinicians and researchers seeking to improve outcomes for patients with dysphagia, understanding the neural control of swallowing is critical. The role of gray matter in swallowing control has been extensively documented, but knowledge is limited regarding the contributions of white matter. Our aim was to identify, evaluate, and summarize the populations, methods, and results of published articles describing the role of white matter in neural control of swallowing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: We completed a systematic review with a multi-engine search following PRISMA-P 2015 standards. Two authors screened articles and completed blind full-text review and quality assessments using an adapted U.S. National Institute of Health's Quality Assessment. The senior author resolved any disagreements. Qualitative synthesis of evidence was completed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: The search yielded 105 non-duplicate articles, twenty-two of which met inclusion criteria. Twenty were rated as Good (5/22; 23%) or Fair (15/22; 68%) quality. Stroke was the most represented diagnosis (n = 20; 91%). All studies were observational, and half were retrospective cohort design. The majority of studies (13/22; 59%) quantified white matter damage with lesion-based methods, whereas 7/22 (32%) described intrinsic characteristics of white matter using methods like fractional anisotropy. Fifteen studies (68%) used instrumental methods for swallowing evaluations. White matter areas commonly implicated in swallowing control included the pyramidal tract, internal capsule, corona radiata, superior longitudinal fasciculus, external capsule, and corpus callosum. Additional noteworthy themes included: severity of white matter damage is related to dysphagia severity; bilateral white matter lesions appear particularly disruptive to swallowing; and white matter adaptation can facilitate dysphagia recovery. Gaps in the literature included limited sample size and populations, lack of in-depth evaluations, and issues with research design.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: Although traditionally understudied, there is sufficient evidence to conclude that white matter is critical in the neural control of swallowing. The reviewed studies indicated that white matter damage can be directly tied to swallowing deficits, and several white matter structures were implicated across studies. Further well-designed interdisciplinary research is needed to understand white matter's role in neural control of normal swallowing and in dysphagia recovery and rehabilitation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: The Resting-State Electroencephalogram Microstate Correlations With Empathy and Their Moderating Effect on the Relationship Between Empathy and Disgust</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.626507</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Humans have a natural ability to understand the emotions and feelings of others, whether one actually witnesses the situation of another, perceives it from a photograph, reads about it in a fiction book, or merely imagines it. This is the phenomenon of empathy, which requires us to mentally represent external information to experience the emotions of others. Studies have shown that individuals with high empathy have high anterior insula and adjacent frontal operculum activation when they are aware of negative emotions in others. As a negative emotion, disgust processing involves insula coupling. What are the neurophysiological characteristics for regulating the levels of empathy and disgust? To answer this question, we collected electroencephalogram microstates (EEG-ms) of 196 college students at rest and used the Disgust Scale and Interpersonal Reactivity Index. The results showed that: (1) there was a significant positive correlation between empathy and disgust sensitivity; (2) the empathy score and the intensity of transition possibility between EEG-ms C and D were significantly positively correlated; and (3) the connection strength between the transition possibility of EEG-ms C and D could adjust the relationship between the disgust sensitivity score and the empathy score. This study provides new neurophysiological characteristics for an understanding of the regulate relationship between empathy and disgust and provides a new perspective on emotion and attention.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neural Circuits: An Autism-Associated Neuroligin-3 Mutation Affects Developmental Synapse Elimination in the Cerebellum</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncir.2021.676891</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Neuroligin is a postsynaptic cell-adhesion molecule that is involved in synapse formation and maturation by interacting with presynaptic neurexin. Mutations in neuroligin genes, including the arginine to cystein substitution at the 451st amino acid residue (R451C) of neuroligin-3 (NLGN3), have been identified in patients with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Functional magnetic resonance imaging and examination of post-mortem brain in ASD patients implicate alteration of cerebellar morphology and Purkinje cell (PC) loss. In the present study, we examined possible association between the R451C mutation in NLGN3 and synaptic development and function in the mouse cerebellum. In NLGN3-R451C mutant mice, the expression of NLGN3 protein in the cerebellum was reduced to about 10% of the level of wild-type mice. Elimination of redundant climbing fiber (CF) to PC synapses was impaired from postnatal day 10–15 (P10–15) in NLGN3-R451C mutant mice, but majority of PCs became mono-innervated as in wild-type mice after P16. In NLGN3-R451C mutant mice, selective strengthening of a single CF relative to the other CFs in each PC was impaired from P16, which persisted into juvenile stage. Furthermore, the inhibition to excitation (I/E) balance of synaptic inputs to PCs was elevated, and calcium transients in the soma induced by strong and weak CF inputs were reduced in NLGN3-R451C mutant mice. These results suggest that a single point mutation in NLGN3 significantly influences the synapse development and refinement in cerebellar circuitry, which might be related to the pathogenesis of ASD.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: The Cannabinoid Receptor 1 Reverse Agonist AM251 Ameliorates Radiation-Induced Cognitive Decrements</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.668286</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Despite advancements in the radiotherapeutic management of brain malignancies, resultant sequelae include persistent cognitive dysfunction in the majority of survivors. Defining the precise causes of normal tissue toxicity has proven challenging, but the use of preclinical rodent models has suggested that reductions in neurogenesis and microvascular integrity, impaired synaptic plasticity, increased inflammation, and alterations in neuronal structure are contributory if not causal. As such, strategies to reverse these persistent radiotherapy-induced neurological disorders represent an unmet medical need. AM251, a cannabinoid receptor 1 reverse agonist known to facilitate adult neurogenesis and synaptic plasticity, may help to ameliorate radiation-induced CNS impairments. To test this hypothesis, three treatment paradigms were used to evaluate the efficacy of AM251 to ameliorate radiation-induced learning and memory deficits along with disruptions in mood at 4 and 12 weeks postirradiation. Results demonstrated that acute (four weekly injections) and chronic (16 weekly injections) AM251 treatments (1 mg/kg) effectively alleviated cognitive and mood dysfunction in cranially irradiated mice. The beneficial effects of AM251 were exemplified by improved hippocampal- and cortical-dependent memory function on the novel object recognition and object in place tasks, while similar benefits on mood were shown by reductions in depressive- and anxiety-like behaviors on the forced swim test and elevated plus maze. The foregoing neurocognitive benefits were associated with significant increases in newly born (doublecortin+) neurons (1.7-fold), hippocampal neurogenesis (BrdU+/NeuN+mature neurons, 2.5-fold), and reduced expression of the inflammatory mediator HMGB (1.2-fold) in the hippocampus of irradiated mice. Collectively, these findings indicate that AM251 ameliorates the effects of clinically relevant cranial irradiation where overall neurological benefits in memory and mood coincided with increased hippocampal cell proliferation, neurogenesis, and reduced expression of proinflammatory markers.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Inhibition of Perforin-Mediated Neurotoxicity Attenuates Neurological Deficits After Ischemic Stroke</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.664312</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Perforin-mediated cytotoxicity plays a crucial role in microbial defense, tumor surveillance, and primary autoimmune disorders. However, the contribution of the cytolytic protein perforin to ischemia-induced secondary tissue damage in the brain has not been fully investigated. Here, we examined the kinetics and subpopulations of perforin-positive cells and then evaluated the direct effects of perforin-mediated cytotoxicity on outcomes after ischemic stroke. Using flow cytometry, we showed that perforin&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;CD45&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; immune cells could be detected at 12 h and that the percentage of these cells increased largely until on day 3 and then significantly declined on day 7. Surprisingly, the percentage of Perforin&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;CD45&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cells also unexpectedly increased from day 7 to day 14 after ischemic stroke in Perforin1-EGFP transgenic mice. Our results suggested that Perforin&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;CD45&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cells play vital roles in the ischemic brain at early and late stages and further suggested that Perforin&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;CD45&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cells are a heterogeneous population. Surprisingly, in addition to CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells, NK cells, and NKT cells, central nervous system (CNS)-resident immune microglia, which are first triggered and activated within minutes after ischemic stroke in mice, also secreted perforin during ischemic brain injury. In our study, the percentage of perforin&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; microglia increased from 12 h after ischemic stroke, increased largely until on day 3 after ischemic stroke, and then moderately declined from days 3 to 7. Intriguingly, the percentage of perforin&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; microglia also dramatically increased from days 7 to 14 after ischemic stroke. Furthermore, compared with wild-type littermates, Perforin 1&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt; mice exhibited significant increases in the cerebral infarct volume, neurological deficits, and neurogenesis and inhibition of neurotoxic astrogliosis. Interestingly, the number of CD45&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;CD3&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells was significantly decreased in Perforin 1&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt; mice compared with their wild-type littermates, especially the number of γδ T cells. In addition, Perforin 1&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt; mice had lower levels of IL-17 than their wild-type littermates. Our results identified a critical function of perforin-mediated neurotoxicity in the ischemic brain, suggesting that targeting perforin-mediated neurotoxicity in brain-resident microglia and invading perforin&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;CD45&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; immune cells may be a potential strategy for the treatment of ischemic stroke.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Retinal organoids (ROs), which are derived from stem cells, can automatically form three-dimensional laminar structures that include all cell types and the ultrastructure of the retina. Therefore, they are highly similar to the retinal structure in the human body. The development of organoids has been a great technological breakthrough in the fields of transplantation therapy and disease modeling. However, the translation of RO applications into medical practice still has various deficiencies at the current stage, including the long culture process, insufficient yield, and great heterogeneity among ROs produced under different conditions. Nevertheless, many technological breakthroughs have been made in transplanting ROs for treatment of diseases such as retinal degeneration. This review discusses recent advances in the development of ROs, improvements of the culture protocol, and the latest developments in RO replacement therapy techniques.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Normal and Abnormal Sharp Wave Ripples in the Hippocampal-Entorhinal Cortex System: Implications for Memory Consolidation, Alzheimer's Disease, and Temporal Lobe Epilepsy</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.683483</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The appearance of hippocampal sharp wave ripples (SWRs) is an electrophysiological biomarker for episodic memory encoding and behavioral planning. Disturbed SWRs are considered a sign of neural network dysfunction that may provide insights into the structural connectivity changes associated with cognitive impairment in early-stage Alzheimer's disease (AD) and temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). SWRs originating from hippocampus have been extensively studied during spatial navigation in rodents, and more recent studies have investigated SWRs in the hippocampal-entorhinal cortex (HPC-EC) system during a variety of other memory-guided behaviors. Understanding how SWR disruption impairs memory function, especially episodic memory, could aid in the development of more efficacious therapeutics for AD and TLE. In this review, we first provide an overview of the reciprocal association between AD and TLE, and then focus on the functions of HPC-EC system SWRs in episodic memory consolidation. It is posited that these waveforms reflect rapid network interactions among excitatory projection neurons and local interneurons and that these waves may contribute to synaptic plasticity underlying memory consolidation. Further, SWRs appear altered or ectopic in AD and TLE. These waveforms may thus provide clues to understanding disease pathogenesis and may even serve as biomarkers for early-stage disease progression and treatment response.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Frontal White Matter Hyperintensities and Executive Functioning Performance in Older Adults</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.672535</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Frontal lobe structures decline faster than most other brain regions in older adults. Age-related change in the frontal lobe is associated with poorer executive function (e.g., working memory, switching/set-shifting, and inhibitory control). The effects and presence of frontal lobe white matter hyperintensities (WMH) on executive function in normal aging is relatively unknown. The current study assessed relationships between region-specific frontal WMH load and cognitive performance in healthy older adults using three executive function tasks from the NIH Toolbox (NIHTB) Cognition Battery. A cohort of 279 healthy older adults ages 65–88 completed NIHTB and 3T T1-weighted and FLAIR MRI. Lesion Segmentation Toolbox quantified WMH volume and generated lesion probability maps. Individual lesion maps were registered to the Desikan-Killiany atlas in FreeSurfer 6.0 to define regions of interest (ROI). Independent linear regressions assessed relationships between executive function performance and region-specific WMH in frontal lobe ROIs. All models included age, sex, education, estimated total intracranial volume, multi-site scanner differences, and cardiovascular disease risk using Framingham criteria as covariates. Poorer set-shifting performance was associated with greater WMH load in three frontal ROIs including bilateral superior frontal (left β = −0.18, FDR-p = 0.02; right β = −0.20, FDR-p = 0.01) and right medial orbitofrontal (β = −0.17, FDR-p = 0.02). Poorer inhibitory performance associated with higher WMH load in one frontal ROI, the right superior frontal (right β = −0.21, FDR-p = 0.01). There were no significant associations between working memory and WMH in frontal ROIs. Our study demonstrates that location and pattern of frontal WMH may be important to assess when examining age-related differences in cognitive functions involving switching/set-shifting and inhibition. On the other hand, working memory performance was not related to presence of frontal WMH in this sample. These data suggest that WMH may contribute selectively to age-related declines in executive function. Findings emerged beyond predictors known to be associated with WMH presence, including age and cardiovascular disease risk. The spread of WMH within the frontal lobes may play a key role in the neuropsychological profile of cognitive aging. Further research should explore whether early intervention on modifiable vascular factors or cognitive interventions targeted for executive abilities may help mitigate the effect of frontal WMH on executive function.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Analysis of Age-Related White Matter Microstructures Based on Diffusion Tensor Imaging</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.664911</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Population aging has become a serious social problem. Accordingly, many researches are focusing on changes in brains of the elderly. In this study, we used multiple parameters to analyze age-related changes in white matter fibers. A sample cohort of 58 individuals was divided into young and middle-age groups and tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) were used to analyze the differences in fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusion (MD), axial diffusion (AD), and radial diffusion (RD) between the two groups. Deterministic fiber tracking was used to investigate the correlation between fiber number and fiber length with age. The TBSS analysis revealed significant differences in FA, MD, AD, and RD in multiple white matter fibers between the two groups. In the middle-age group FA and AD were lower than in young people, whereas the MD and RD values were higher. Deterministic fiber tracking showed that the fiber length of some fibers correlated positively with age. These fibers were observed in the splenium of corpus callosum (SCC), the posterior limb of internal capsule (PLIC), the right posterior corona radiata (PCR_R), the anterior corona radiata (ACR), the left posterior thalamic radiation (include optic radiation; PTR_L), and the left superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF_L), among others. The results showed that the SCC, PLIC, PCR_R, ACR, PTR_L, and SLF_L significantly differed between young and middle-age people. Therefore, we believe that these fibers could be used as image markers of age-related white matter changes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Aim: To examine the feasibility of using large scale spatial, self-mobile, virtual reality, and eye tracking in older adults with and without Alzheimer's disease (AD).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Older adults with early stage AD (n = 38) and a control group without AD (n = 50) were asked to find their way in a large, projected VR simulation of a retirement community repeatedly over 10 trials for each of 2 days, while wearing eye tracking glasses. Feasibility measures, including tolerance, side effects, and ability to complete the VR and eye tracking were collected. This study reports the analysis of the feasibility data for the VR and eye tracking and comparison of findings between the groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Over 80% of the subjects were able to complete the VR portion of the study. Only four subjects, all in the AD group, could not use the joystick and were excluded. Withdrawal rate (18%) was similar between the groups [X&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;(2)&lt;/sub&gt; = 2.82, N = 88, p = 0.245] with most withdrawals occurring after the fourth trial. Simulation sickness was not significantly different between the groups. Only 60% of the subjects had completed eye tracking videos; more subjects in the AD group had complete eye tracking videos than the control group; X&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;(1)&lt;/sub&gt; = 7.411, N = 88, p = 0.006. Eye tracking incompletion was primarily due to inability to calibration issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: Virtual reality testing and eye tracking can be used in older adults with and without AD in a large-scale way-finding task, but that there are some limitations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>The avian dorsal telencephalon contains discrete areas receiving visual, auditory, and trigeminal ascending projections. Recent studies have shown that the auditory and the visual regions embodied “columnar and layered” cytoarchitectural motifs, which bears a striking resemblance to that of the mammalian sensory cortices.  At present, it is not known to what extent this type of organization also extends to the trigemino‐recipient area. The question is of interest, since afferents forming this sensory pathway are exceptionally not thalamic but rhombencephalic in origin. We investigated this question by placing minute injections of neural tracers into selected locations of vital slices of the chicken telencephalon. We conclude that the trigeminal area share, to a detailed level, a common columnar‐layered neuroarchitectectonic motif with other sensory areas.







ABSTRACT
The dorsal ventricular ridge (DVR), which is the largest component of the avian pallium, contains discrete partitions receiving tectovisual, auditory, and trigeminal ascending projections. Recent studies have shown that the auditory and the tectovisual regions can be regarded as complexes composed of three highly interconnected layers: an internal senso‐recipient one, an intermediate afferent/efferent one, and a more external re‐entrant one. Cells located in homotopic positions in each of these layers are reciprocally linked by an interlaminar loop of axonal processes, forming columnar‐like local circuits. Whether this type of organization also extends to the trigemino‐recipient DVR is, at present, not known. This question is of interest, since afferents forming this sensory pathway, exceptional among amniotes, are not thalamic but rhombencephalic in origin. We investigated this question by placing minute injections of neural tracers into selected locations of vital slices of the chicken telencephalon. We found that neurons of the trigemino‐recipient nucleus basorostralis pallii (Bas) establish reciprocal, columnar and homotopical projections with cells located in the overlying ventral mesopallium (MV). &quot;Column‐forming&quot; axons originated in B and MV terminate also in the intermediate strip, the fronto‐trigeminal nidopallium (NFT), in a restricted manner. We also found that the NFT and an internal partition of B originate substantial, coarse‐topographic projections to the underlying portion of the lateral striatum. We conclude that all sensory areas of the DVR are organized according to a common neuroarchitectonic motif, which bears a striking resemblance to that of the radial/laminar intrinsic circuits of the sensory cortices of mammals.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Cognitive Functions in Adult‐Onset Phenotypes of X‐Linked Adrenoleukodystrophy</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.26141?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Objective
X‐linked adrenoleukodystrophy (X‐ALD) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by progressive demyelination ranging from mild myelopathic forms (adrenomyeloneuropathy [AMN]) to severe cerebral variants (adult cerebral adrenoleukodystrophy [ACALD]). The aim of this study was to compare cognitive function in adult‐onset X‐ALD phenotypes.


Methods
Cognitive function in various domains (intelligence, attention, memory, executive function, and processing speed) was assessed in 172 adults (117 with AMN, 30 with arrested ACALD, and 25 with acute ACALD) using comprehensive neuropsychological batteries. Phenotype differences were examined by analyses of variance.


Results
X‐ALD phenotypes significantly differed in nonverbal intelligence, sustained attention, verbal encoding, nonverbal recognition, and processing speed (ps &amp;lt; 0.050). No group differences emerged regarding verbal intelligence, verbal retrieval and recognition, and executive function (ps &amp;gt; 0.050). Specifically, patients with acute ACALD showed severe cognitive deficits compared to AMN and normal data, with largest effects on processing speed. Contrary, cognition was overall intact in patients with AMN, independent of sex and corticospinal tract involvement, and those with arrested ACALD showed mild cognitive dysfunction, particularly in verbal encoding and processing speed.


Interpretation
Cerebral demyelination in patients with X‐ALD causes white matter dementia, mainly characterized by an extreme slowdown in processing speed associated with deficits in attention and learning. Most patients with AMN show intact cognitive function. Future prospective, longitudinal studies with more sensitive imaging techniques are required to clarify whether early mild cognitive dysfunction found in some patients with AMN may be associated with subtle myelin abnormalities that do not yet appear as white matter lesions on cerebral MRI (cMRI) but have the potential to serve as early predictors of later cerebral progression.

	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hipo.23373?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
Adult neurogenesis in the hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG) is an extraordinary form of plasticity fundamental for cognitive flexibility. Recent evidence showed that newborn neurons differentially modulate input to the infra‐ and supra‐pyramidal blades of the DG during the processing of spatial and contextual information, respectively. However, how this differential regulation by neurogenesis is translated into different aspects contributing cognitive flexibility is unclear. Here, we increased adult‐born neurons by a genetic expansion of neural stem cells and studied their influence during navigational learning. We found that increased neurogenesis improved both memory precision and flexibility. Interestingly, each of these gains was associated with distinct subregional patterns of activity and better separation of memory representations in the DG‐CA3 network. Our results highlight the role of adult‐born neurons in promoting memory precision and indexing and suggests their anatomical allocation within specific DG‐CA3 compartments, together contributing to cognitive flexibility.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>In this study, we used source‐space EEG and graph theory to examine the association between network small worldness and cognitive test performance in focal epilepsy patients and healthy controls.

Abstract
Understanding and diagnosing cognitive impairment in epilepsy remains a prominent challenge. New etiological models suggest that cognitive difficulties might not be directly linked to seizure activity, but are rather a manifestation of a broader brain pathology. Consequently, treating seizures is not sufficient to alleviate cognitive symptoms, highlighting the need for novel diagnostic tools. Here, we investigated whether the organization of three intrinsic, resting‐state functional connectivity networks was correlated with domain‐specific cognitive test performance. Using individualized EEG source reconstruction and graph theory, we examined the association between network small worldness and cognitive test performance in 23 patients with focal epilepsy and 17 healthy controls, who underwent a series of standardized pencil‐and‐paper and digital cognitive tests. We observed that the specific networks robustly correlated with test performance in distinct cognitive domains. Specifically, correlations were evident between the default mode network and memory in patients, the central‐executive network and executive functioning in controls, and the salience network and social cognition in both groups. Interestingly, the correlations were evident in both groups, but in different domains, suggesting an alteration in these functional neurocognitive networks in focal epilepsy. The present findings highlight the potential clinical relevance of functional brain network dysfunction in cognitive impairment.</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience Research: Mimicking partial to total placental insufficiency in a rabbit model of cerebral palsy</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jnr.24901?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>A new model of Partial+Full uterine ischemia mimicking the transition from partial to total placental abruption in humans was developed in rabbits. Similar neurobehavioral deficits but worse cell viability ex vivo were found in the new Partial+Full uterine ischemia model compared to the previous Full uterine ischemia model.

Abstract
All placental abruptions begin as partial abruptions, which sometimes manifest as fetal bradycardia. The progression from partial to total abruption was mimicked by a new rabbit model of placental insufficiency, and we compared it, with sufficient statistical power, with the previous model mimicking total placental abruption. The previous model uses total uterine ischemia at E22 or E25 (70% or 79% term, respectively), in pregnant New Zealand white rabbits for 40 min (Full H‐I). The new model, Partial+Full H‐I, added a 30‐min partial ischemia before the 40‐min total ischemia. Fetuses were delivered either at E31.5 (full term) vaginally for neurobehavior testing, or by C‐section at E25 for ex vivo brain cell viability evaluation. The onset of fetal bradycardia was within the first 2 min of either H‐I protocol. There was no difference between Full H‐I (n = 442 for E22, 312 for E25) and Partial+Full H‐I (n = 154 and 80) groups in death or severely affected kits at E22 (76% vs. 79%) or at E25 (66% vs. 64%), or normal kits at E22 or E25, or any of the individual newborn neurobehavioral tests at any age. No sex differences were found. Partial+Full H‐I (n = 6) showed less cell viability than Full H‐I (n = 8) at 72‐hr ex vivo in the brain regions studied. Partial+Full H‐I insult produced similar cerebral palsy phenotype as our previous Full H‐I model in a sufficiently powered study and may be more suitable for testing of potential neuroprotectants.</content:encoded>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Longitudinal CSF Iron Pathway Proteins in Posthemorrhagic Hydrocephalus: Associations with Ventricle Size and Neurodevelopmental Outcomes</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.26133?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Objective
Iron has been implicated in the pathogenesis of brain injury and hydrocephalus after preterm germinal matrix hemorrhage‐intraventricular hemorrhage, however, it is unknown how external or endogenous intraventricular clearance of iron pathway proteins affect the outcome in this group.


Methods
This prospective multicenter cohort included patients with posthemorrhagic hydrocephalus (PHH) who underwent (1) temporary and permanent cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) diversion and (2) Bayley Scales of Infant Development‐III testing around 2 years of age. CSF proteins in the iron handling pathway were analyzed longitudinally and compared to ventricle size and neurodevelopmental outcomes.


Results
Thirty‐seven patients met inclusion criteria with a median estimated gestational age at birth of 25 weeks; 65% were boys. Ventricular CSF levels of hemoglobin, iron, total bilirubin, and ferritin decreased between temporary and permanent CSF diversion with no change in CSF levels of ceruloplasmin, transferrin, haptoglobin, and hepcidin. There was an increase in CSF hemopexin during this interval. Larger ventricle size at permanent CSF diversion was associated with elevated CSF ferritin (p = 0.015) and decreased CSF hemopexin (p = 0.007). CSF levels of proteins at temporary CSF diversion were not associated with outcome, however, higher CSF transferrin at permanent CSF diversion was associated with improved cognitive outcome (p = 0.015). Importantly, longitudinal change in CSF iron pathway proteins, ferritin (decrease), and transferrin (increase) were associated with improved cognitive (p = 0.04) and motor (p = 0.03) scores and improved cognitive (p = 0.04), language (p = 0.035), and motor (p = 0.008) scores, respectively.


Interpretation
Longitudinal changes in CSF transferrin (increase) and ferritin (decrease) are associated with improved neurodevelopmental outcomes in neonatal PHH, with implications for understanding the pathogenesis of poor outcomes in PHH. ANN NEUROL 2021</content:encoded>

The vasculature is a dynamic structure, growing and regressing in response to embryonic development, growth, changing physiological demands, wound healing, tumor growth and other stimuli. At the microvascular level, network geometry is not predetermined, but emerges as a result of biological responses of each vessel to the stimuli that it receives. These responses may be summarized as angiogenesis, remodeling and pruning. Previous theoretical simulations have shown how two-dimensional vascular patterns generated by these processes in the mesentery are consistent with experimental observations. During early development of the brain, a mesh-like network of vessels is formed on the surface of the cerebral cortex. This network then forms branches into the cortex, forming a three-dimensional network throughout its thickness. Here, a theoretical model is presented for this process, based on known or hypothesized vascular response mechanisms together with experimentally obtained information on the structure and hemodynamics of the mouse cerebral cortex. According to this model, essential components of the system include sensing of oxygen levels in the midrange of partial pressures and conducted responses in vessel walls that propagate information about metabolic needs of the tissue to upstream segments of the network. The model provides insights into the effects of deficits in vascular response mechanisms, and can be used to generate physiologically realistic microvascular network structures.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/VPEXfJ89jhk&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Multi-host pathogens are particularly difficult to control, especially when at least one of the hosts acts as a hidden reservoir. Deep sequencing of densely sampled pathogens has the potential to transform this understanding, but requires analytical approaches that jointly consider epidemiological and genetic data to best address this problem. While there has been considerable success in analyses of single species systems, the hidden reservoir problem is relatively under-studied. A well-known exemplar of this problem is bovine Tuberculosis, a disease found in British and Irish cattle caused by &lt;i&gt;Mycobacterium bovis&lt;/i&gt;, where the Eurasian badger has long been believed to act as a reservoir but remains of poorly quantified importance except in very specific locations. As a result, the effort that should be directed at controlling disease in badgers is unclear. Here, we analyse densely collected epidemiological and genetic data from a cattle population but do not explicitly consider any data from badgers. We use a simulation modelling approach to show that, in our system, a model that exploits available cattle demographic and herd-to-herd movement data, but only considers the ability of a hidden reservoir to generate pathogen diversity, can be used to choose between different epidemiological scenarios. In our analysis, a model where the reservoir does not generate any diversity but contributes to new infections at a local farm scale are significantly preferred over models which generate diversity and/or spread disease at broader spatial scales. While we cannot directly attribute the role of the reservoir to badgers based on this analysis alone, the result supports the hypothesis that under current cattle control regimes, infected cattle alone cannot sustain &lt;i&gt;M. bovis&lt;/i&gt; circulation. Given the observed close phylogenetic relationship for the bacteria taken from cattle and badgers sampled near to each other, the most parsimonious hypothesis is that the reservoir is the infected badger population. More broadly, our approach demonstrates that carefully constructed bespoke models can exploit the combination of genetic and epidemiological data to overcome issues of extreme data bias, and uncover important general characteristics of transmission in multi-host pathogen systems.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Pa194nrlbRQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Similar sensorimotor transformations control balance during standing and walking</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/VcMU5775s_I/article</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Maarten Afschrift, Friedl De Groote, Ilse Jonkers&lt;/p&gt;

Standing and walking balance control in humans relies on the transformation of sensory information to motor commands that drive muscles. Here, we evaluated whether sensorimotor transformations underlying walking balance control can be described by task-level center of mass kinematics feedback similar to standing balance control. We found that delayed linear feedback of center of mass position and velocity, but not delayed linear feedback from ankle angles and angular velocities, can explain reactive ankle muscle activity and joint moments in response to perturbations of walking across protocols (discrete and continuous platform translations and discrete pelvis pushes). Feedback gains were modulated during the gait cycle and decreased with walking speed. Our results thus suggest that similar task-level variables, i.e. center of mass position and velocity, are controlled across standing and walking but that feedback gains are modulated during gait to accommodate changes in body configuration during the gait cycle and in stability with walking speed. These findings have important implications for modelling the neuromechanics of human balance control and for biomimetic control of wearable robotic devices. The feedback mechanisms we identified can be used to extend the current neuromechanical models that lack balance control mechanisms for the ankle joint. When using these models in the control of wearable robotic devices, we believe that this will facilitate shared control of balance between the user and the robotic device.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/VcMU5775s_I&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Free-living bacteria adapt to environmental change by reprogramming gene expression through precise interactions of hundreds of DNA-binding proteins. A predictive understanding of bacterial physiology requires us to globally monitor all such protein–DNA interactions across a range of environmental and genetic perturbations. Here, we show that such global observations are possible using an optimized version of in vivo protein occupancy display technology (in vivo protein occupancy display—high resolution, IPOD-HR) and present a pilot application to &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt;. We observe that the &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; protein–DNA interactome organizes into 2 distinct prototypic features: (1) highly dynamic condition-dependent transcription factor (TF) occupancy; and (2) robust kilobase scale occupancy by nucleoid factors, forming silencing domains analogous to eukaryotic heterochromatin. We show that occupancy dynamics across a range of conditions can rapidly reveal the global transcriptional regulatory organization of a bacterium. Beyond discovery of previously hidden regulatory logic, we show that these observations can be utilized to computationally determine sequence specificity models for the majority of active TFs. Our study demonstrates that global observations of protein occupancy combined with statistical inference can rapidly and systematically reveal the transcriptional regulatory and structural features of a bacterial genome. This capacity is particularly crucial for non-model bacteria that are not amenable to routine genetic manipulation.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/1yPs-rhAA7U&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Moderate Ethanol Pre-treatment Mitigates ICH-Induced Injury via ER Stress Modulation in Rats</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2021.682775</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is a life-threatening type of stroke that disrupts the normal neurological function of the brain. Clinical studies have reported a non-linear J-shaped association between alcohol consumption levels and the occurrence of cerebral stroke. Specifically, alcohol intoxication increases stroke incidence, while moderate alcohol pre-conditioning decreases stroke frequency and improves outcomes. Although alcohol pre-consumption is likely a crucial player in ICH, the underlying mechanism remains unclear. We performed 1-h alcohol pre-conditioning followed by ICH induction in Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats to investigate the role of alcohol pre-conditioning in ICH. Interestingly, behavioral test analysis found that ethanol intoxication (3 g/kg) aggravated ICH-induced neurological deficits, but moderate ethanol pre-conditioning (0.75 g/kg) ameliorated ICH-induced neurological deficits by reducing the oxidative stress and proinflammatory cytokines release. Moreover, we found that moderate ethanol pretreatment improved the striatal endoplasmic reticulum (ER) homeostasis by increasing the chaperone protein expression and reducing oxidative stress and apoptosis caused by ICH. Our findings show that the mechanism regulated by moderate ethanol pre-conditioning might be beneficial for ICH, indicating the importance of ER homeostasis, oxidative stress, and differential cytokines release in ICH.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Microtubule-associated protein tau forms insoluble neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), which is one of the major histopathological hallmarks of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Many studies have demonstrated that tau causes early functional deficits prior to the formation of neurofibrillary aggregates. The redistribution of tau from axons to the somatodendritic compartment of neurons and dendritic spines causes synaptic impairment, and then leads to the loss of synaptic contacts that correlates better with cognitive deficits than amyloid-β (Aβ) aggregates do in AD patients. In this review, we discuss the underlying mechanisms by which tau is mislocalized to dendritic spines and contributes to synaptic dysfunction in AD. We also discuss the synergistic effects of tau and oligomeric forms of Aβ on promoting synaptic dysfunction in AD.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: T2-Weighted Whole-Brain Intracranial Vessel Wall Imaging at 3 Tesla With Cerebrospinal Fluid Suppression</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.665076</link>
	<content:encoded>Background&lt;p&gt;T&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-weighted (T&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;w) intracranial vessel wall imaging (IVWI) provides good contrast to differentiate intracranial vasculopathies and discriminate various important plaque components. However, the strong cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) signal in T&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;w images interferes with depicting the intracranial vessel wall. In this study, we propose a T&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-prepared sequence for whole-brain IVWI at 3T with CSF suppression.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;A preparation module that combines T&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; preparation and inversion recovery (T&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;IR) was used to suppress the CSF signal and was incorporated into the commercial three-dimensional (3D) turbo spin echo sequence-Sampling Perfection with Application optimized Contrast using different flip angle Evolution (SPACE). This new technique (hereafter called T&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;IR-SPACE) was evaluated on nine healthy volunteers and compared with two other commonly used 3D T&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-weighted sequences: T&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;w-SPACE and FLAIR-SPACE (FLAIR: fluid-attenuated inversion recovery). The signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) of the vessel wall (VW) and CSF and contrast-to-noise ratios (CNRs) between them were measured and compared among these three T&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-weighted sequences. Subjective wall visualization of the three T&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-weighted sequences was scored blindly and independently by two radiologists using a four-point scale followed by inter-rater reproducibility analysis. A pilot study of four stroke patients was performed to preliminarily evaluate the diagnostic value of this new sequence, which was compared with two conventional T&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-weighted sequences.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;T&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;IR-SPACE had the highest CNR (11.01 ± 6.75) compared with FLAIR-SPACE (4.49 ± 3.15; p &amp;lt; 0.001) and T&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;w-SPACE (−56.16 ± 18.58; p &amp;lt; 0.001). The subjective wall visualization score of T&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;IR-SPACE was higher than those of FLAIR-SPACE and T&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;w-SPACE (T&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;IR-SPACE: 2.35 ± 0.59; FLAIR-SPACE: 0.52 ± 0.54; T&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;w-SPACE: 1.67 ± 0.58); the two radiologists’ scores showed excellent agreement (ICC = 0.883).&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;The T&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;IR preparation module markedly suppressed the CSF signal without much SNR loss of the other tissues (i.e., vessel wall, white matter, and gray matter) compared with the IR pulse. Our results suggest that T&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;IR-SPACE is a potential alternative T&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-weighted sequence for assessing intracranial vascular diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fninf.2021.632729</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Motivated by the challenge of investigating the reproducibility of spiking neural network simulations, we have developed the Arpra library: an open source C library for arbitrary precision range analysis based on the mixed Interval Arithmetic (IA)/Affine Arithmetic (AA) method. Arpra builds on this method by implementing a novel mixed trimmed IA/AA, in which the error terms of AA ranges are minimised using information from IA ranges. Overhead rounding error is minimised by computing intermediate values as extended precision variables using the MPFR library. This optimisation is most useful in cases where the ratio of overhead error to range width is high. Three novel affine term reduction strategies improve memory efficiency by merging affine terms of lesser significance. We also investigate the viability of using mixed trimmed IA/AA and other AA methods for studying reproducibility in unstable spiking neural network simulations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Sensory-Induced Human LTP-Like Synaptic Plasticity – Using Visual Evoked Potentials to Explore the Relation Between LTP-Like Synaptic Plasticity and Visual Perceptual Learning</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.684573</link>
	<content:encoded>Objective&lt;p&gt;Stimulus-selective response modulation (SRM) of sensory evoked potentials represents a well-established non-invasive index of long-term potentiation-like (LTP-like) synaptic plasticity in the human sensory cortices. Although our understanding of the mechanisms underlying stimulus-SRM has increased over the past two decades, it remains unclear how this form of LTP-like synaptic plasticity is related to other basic learning mechanisms, such as perceptual learning. The aim of the current study was twofold; firstly, we aimed to corroborate former stimulus-SRM studies, demonstrating modulation of visual evoked potential (VEP) components following high-frequency visual stimulation. Secondly, we aimed to investigate the association between the magnitudes of LTP-like plasticity and visual perceptual learning (VPL).&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;42 healthy adults participated in the study. EEG data was recorded during a standard high-frequency stimulus-SRM paradigm. Amplitude values were measured from the peaks of visual components C1, P1, and N1. Embedded in the same experimental session, the VPL task required the participants to discriminate between a masked checkerboard pattern and a visual “noise” stimulus before, during and after the stimulus-SRM probes.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;We demonstrated significant amplitude modulations of VEPs components C1 and N1 from baseline to both post-stimulation probes. In the VPL task, we observed a significant change in the average threshold levels from the first to the second round. No significant association between the magnitudes of LTP-like plasticity and performance on the VPL task was evident.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;To the extent of our knowledge, this study is the first to examine the relationship between the visual stimulus-RM phenomenon and VPL in humans. In accordance with previous studies, we demonstrated robust amplitude modulations of the C1 and N1 components of the VEP waveform. However, we did not observe any significant correlations between modulation magnitude of VEP components and VPL task performance, suggesting that these phenomena rely on separate learning mechanisms implemented by different neural mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Functional Contributions of the Arcuate Fasciculus to Language Processing</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.672665</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Current evidence strongly suggests that the arcuate fasciculus (AF) is critical for language, from spontaneous speech and word retrieval to repetition and comprehension abilities. However, to further pinpoint its unique and differential role in language, its anatomy needs to be explored in greater detail and its contribution to language processing beyond that of known cortical language areas must be established. We address this in a comprehensive evaluation of the specific functional role of the AF in a well-characterized cohort of individuals with chronic aphasia (n = 33) following left hemisphere stroke. To evaluate macro- and microstructural integrity of the AF, tractography based on the constrained spherical deconvolution model was performed. The AF in the left and right hemispheres were then manually reconstructed using a modified 3-segment model (Catani et al., 2005), and a modified 2-segment model (Glasser and Rilling, 2008). The normalized volume and a measure of microstructural integrity of the long and the posterior segments of the AF were significantly correlated with language indices while controlling for gender and lesion volume. Specific contributions of AF segments to language while accounting for the role of specific cortical language areas – inferior frontal, inferior parietal, and posterior temporal – were tested using multiple regression analyses. Involvement of the following tract segments in the left hemisphere in language processing beyond the contribution of cortical areas was demonstrated: the long segment of the AF contributed to naming abilities; anterior segment – to fluency and naming; the posterior segment – to comprehension. The results highlight the important contributions of the AF fiber pathways to language impairments beyond that of known cortical language areas. At the same time, no clear role of the right hemisphere AF tracts in language processing could be ascertained. In sum, our findings lend support to the broader role of the left AF in language processing, with particular emphasis on comprehension and naming, and point to the posterior segment of this tract as being most crucial for supporting residual language abilities.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: A Systematic Review of Neuromodulation Treatment Effects on Suicidality</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.660926</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Introduction: Neuromodulation is an important group of therapeutic modalities for neuropsychiatric disorders. Prior studies have focused on efficacy and adverse events associated with neuromodulation. Less is known regarding the influence of neuromodulation treatments on suicidality. This systematic review sought to examine the effects of various neuromodulation techniques on suicidality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: A systematic review of the literature from 1940 to 2020 following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guideline was conducted. Any reported suicide-related outcome, including suicidal ideation, suicide intent, suicide attempt, completed suicide in reports were considered as a putative measure of treatment effect on suicidality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: The review identified 129 relevant studies. An exploratory analysis of a randomized controlled trial comparing the effects of sertraline and transcranial direct-current stimulation (tDCS) for treating depression reported a decrease in suicidal ideation favoring tDCS vs. placebo and tDCS combined with sertraline vs. placebo. Several studies reported an association between repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation and improvements in suicidal ideation. In 12 of the studies, suicidality was the primary outcome, ten of which showed a significant improvement in suicidal ideation. Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) and magnetic seizure therapy was also shown to be associated with lower suicidal ideation and completed suicide rates. There were 11 studies which suicidality was the primary outcome and seven of these showed an improvement in suicidal ideation or suicide intent and fewer suicide attempts or completed suicides in patients treated with ECT. There was limited literature focused on the potential protective effect of vagal nerve stimulation with respect to suicidal ideation. Data were mixed regarding the potential effects of deep brain stimulation on suicidality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: Future prospective studies of neuromodulation that focus on the primary outcome of suicidality are urgently needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Systematic Review Registration:https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/display_record.php?RecordID=125599, identifier: CRD42019125599.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Functional Genomics of Axons and Synapses to Understand Neurodegenerative Diseases</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.686722</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Functional genomics studies through transcriptomics, translatomics and proteomics have become increasingly important tools to understand the molecular basis of biological systems in the last decade. In most cases, when these approaches are applied to the nervous system, they are centered in cell bodies or somatodendritic compartments, as these are easier to isolate and, at least in vitro, contain most of the mRNA and proteins present in all neuronal compartments. However, key functional processes and many neuronal disorders are initiated by changes occurring far away from cell bodies, particularly in axons (axopathologies) and synapses (synaptopathies). Both neuronal compartments contain specific RNAs and proteins, which are known to vary depending on their anatomical distribution, developmental stage and function, and thus form the complex network of molecular pathways required for neuron connectivity. Modifications in these components due to metabolic, environmental, and/or genetic issues could trigger or exacerbate a neuronal disease. For this reason, detailed profiling and functional understanding of the precise changes in these compartments may thus yield new insights into the still intractable molecular basis of most neuronal disorders. In the case of synaptic dysfunctions or synaptopathies, they contribute to dozens of diseases in the human brain including neurodevelopmental (i.e., autism, Down syndrome, and epilepsy) as well as neurodegenerative disorders (i.e., Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases). Histological, biochemical, cellular, and general molecular biology techniques have been key in understanding these pathologies. Now, the growing number of omics approaches can add significant extra information at a high and wide resolution level and, used effectively, can lead to novel and insightful interpretations of the biological processes at play. This review describes current approaches that use transcriptomics, translatomics and proteomic related methods to analyze the axon and presynaptic elements, focusing on the relationship that axon and synapses have with neurodegenerative diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Altered Expression of Ion Channels in White Matter Lesions of Progressive Multiple Sclerosis: What Do We Know About Their Function?</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.685703</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Despite significant advances in our understanding of the pathophysiology of multiple sclerosis (MS), knowledge about contribution of individual ion channels to axonal impairment and remyelination failure in progressive MS remains incomplete. Ion channel families play a fundamental role in maintaining white matter (WM) integrity and in regulating WM activities in axons, interstitial neurons, glia, and vascular cells. Recently, transcriptomic studies have considerably increased insight into the gene expression changes that occur in diverse WM lesions and the gene expression fingerprint of specific WM cells associated with secondary progressive MS. Here, we review the ion channel genes encoding K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, and Cl&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; channels; ryanodine receptors; TRP channels; and others that are significantly and uniquely dysregulated in active, chronic active, inactive, remyelinating WM lesions, and normal-appearing WM of secondary progressive MS brain, based on recently published bulk and single-nuclei RNA-sequencing datasets. We discuss the current state of knowledge about the corresponding ion channels and their implication in the MS brain or in experimental models of MS. This comprehensive review suggests that the intense upregulation of voltage-gated Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channel genes in WM lesions with ongoing tissue damage may reflect the imbalance of Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; homeostasis that is observed in progressive MS brain, while the upregulation of a large number of voltage-gated K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channel genes may be linked to a protective response to limit neuronal excitability. In addition, the altered chloride homeostasis, revealed by the significant downregulation of voltage-gated Cl&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; channels in MS lesions, may contribute to an altered inhibitory neurotransmission and increased excitability.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.673217</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome is a serious illness of unknown etiology, characterized by debilitating exhaustion, memory impairment, pain and sleep abnormalities. Viral infections are believed to initiate the pathogenesis of this syndrome although the definite proof remains elusive. With the unfolding of COVID-19 pandemic, the interest in this condition has resurfaced as excessive tiredness, a major complaint of patients infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus, often lingers for a long time, resulting in disability, and poor life quality. In a previous article, we hypothesized that COVID-19-upregulated angiotensin II triggered premature endothelial cell senescence, disrupting the intestinal and blood brain barriers. Here, we hypothesize further that post-viral sequelae, including myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome, are promoted by the gut microbes or toxin translocation from the gastrointestinal tract into other tissues, including the brain. This model is supported by the SARS-CoV-2 interaction with host proteins and bacterial lipopolysaccharide. Conversely, targeting microbial translocation and cellular senescence may ameliorate the symptoms of this disabling illness.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroanatomy: Selective Regional Loss of Cortical Synapses Lacking Presynaptic Mitochondria in the 5xFAD Mouse Model</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnana.2021.690168</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Synaptic loss in Alzheimer's disease (AD) is strongly correlated with cognitive impairment. Accumulating evidence indicates that amyloid pathology leads to synaptic degeneration and mitochondrial damage in AD. However, it remains unclear whether synapses and presynaptic mitochondria are differentially affected in various cortical regions of the AD brain at the ultrastructural level. Using serial block-face scanning electron microscopy, we assessed synaptic structures in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and primary visual cortex (V1) of the 5xFAD mouse model of AD. At 6 months of age, 5xFAD mice exhibited significantly elevated levels of amyloid deposition in layer 2/3 of the mPFC but not V1. Accordingly, three-dimensional reconstruction of synaptic connectivity revealed a significant reduction in excitatory synaptic density in layer 2 of the mPFC, but not V1, of male transgenic mice. Notably, the density of synapses lacking presynaptic mitochondria was selectively decreased in the mPFC of 5xFAD mice, with no change in the density of mitochondria-containing synapses. Further classification of spines into shape categories confirmed a preferential loss of thin spines whose presynaptic boutons were largely devoid of mitochondria in the 5xFAD mPFC. Furthermore, the number of mitochondria per bouton in spared mitochondria-containing boutons was reduced in the mPFC, but not V1, of 5xFAD mice. Collectively, these results highlight region-specific vulnerability of cortical synapses to amyloid deposition and suggest that the presence of presynaptic mitochondria may affect synaptic degeneration in AD.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroanatomy: Cellular Diversity and Differential Subcellular Localization of the G-Protein Gαo Subunit in the Mouse Cerebellum</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnana.2021.686279</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding proteins (G proteins) transduce signals from G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) to effector ion channels and enzymes G&lt;sub&gt;αo&lt;/sub&gt;, a member of the pertussis toxin-sensitive G&lt;sub&gt;i/o&lt;/sub&gt; family, is widely expressed in the brain, although its role within a neuronal context remains largely unknown. Using immunohistochemical and quantitative immunoelectron microscopy techniques, we have investigated the expression, cellular and subcellular localization of G&lt;sub&gt;αo&lt;/sub&gt; in the cerebellar cortex. Histoblot revealed that G&lt;sub&gt;αo&lt;/sub&gt; is expressed in many brain regions, including the cerebellum. At the cellular level, G&lt;sub&gt;αo&lt;/sub&gt; protein was distributed in Purkinje cells, basket cells, stellate cells, granule cells and Golgi cells. At the subcellular level, pre-embedding immunoelectron microscopy revealed mainly a postsynaptic localization of G&lt;sub&gt;αo&lt;/sub&gt; along the extrasynaptic plasma membrane of Purkinje cell dendritic shafts and spines, and dendrites of basket, stellate and granule cells. To a lesser extent, immunolabeling for G&lt;sub&gt;αo&lt;/sub&gt; was localized in different types of axon terminals establishing excitatory synapses. Moreover, post-embedding immunoelectron microscopy revealed the synaptic localization of G&lt;sub&gt;αo&lt;/sub&gt; on PSDs of glutamatergic synapses between Purkinje cell spines and parallel fiber terminals and its co-localization with GABA&lt;sub&gt;B1&lt;/sub&gt; in the same spines. Quantitative analysis of G&lt;sub&gt;αo&lt;/sub&gt; immunoparticles revealed they preferentially localized on the cytoplasmic face of the plasma membrane. Furthermore, the analysis revealed a high concentration of G&lt;sub&gt;αo&lt;/sub&gt; around excitatory synapses on Purkinje cell dendritic spines, but a uniform distribution in granule cell dendrites. These molecular-anatomical findings suggest that G&lt;sub&gt;αo&lt;/sub&gt; is a major signal transducer of specific GPCRs in different neuronal populations in the cerebellum.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroanatomy: High-Resolution Insights Into the in vitro Developing Blood-Brain Barrier: Novel Morphological Features of Endothelial Nanotube Function</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnana.2021.661065</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;High-resolution electron microscopy (HREM) imaging of the in vitro blood-brain barrier (BBB), is a promising modality for investigating the dynamic morphological interplay underpinning BBB development. The successful establishment of BBB integrity is grounded in the brain endothelial cells (BEC’s) ability to occlude its paracellular spaces of brain capillaries through the expression of the intercellular tight junction (TJ) proteins. The impermeability of these paracellular spaces are crucial in the regulation of transcellular transport systems to achieve homeostasis of the central nervous system. To-date research describing morphologically, the dynamics by which TJ interaction is orchestrated to successfully construct a specialized barrier remains undescribed. In this study, the application of HREM illuminates the novel, dynamic and highly restrictive BEC paracellular pathway which is founded based on lateral membrane alignment which is the functional imperative for the mechanical juxtapositioning of TJ zones that underpin molecular bonding and sealing of the paracellular space. For the first time, we report on the secretion of a basement membrane in vitro, which allow BECs to orientate themselves into distinct basolateral and apicolateral domains and establish a 3-dimensional BEC construct. We report for the first time, on the expression of nanovesicles bound to the plasma membrane surfaces of the BECs. These membrane-bound vesicles are reported to possess an array of DNA/RNA constituents and chemotaxic properties affecting the formation of nanotubes that span the paracellular space between BECs, facilitating BBB construction, alluding to a functional role in mediating cell-to-cell communication. This study suggests that novel, ultrathin nanotubular (NT) structures are involved in functional roles in bringing into alignment the paracellular space of BECs. Immortalized mouse BECs (b.End3, b.End5) and primary rat cardiac microvascular ECs were used to further validate the in vitro BBB model by profiling variances in peripheral EC monolayer development. These cardiac capillary ECs presented with an opposite topographical profile: large fenestra and intercellular spaces, devoid of morphological ultrastructures. This comparative study alludes to the role of NT facilitation in TJ-induced hemifusion of apicolateral BEC membranes, as a structural event forming the basis for establishing a polarized BBB.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Ultrarapid Inflammation of the Olfactory Bulb After Spinal Cord Injury: Protective Effects of the Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor on Early Neurodegeneration in the Brain</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.701702</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The correlation among olfactory dysfunction, spinal cord injury (SCI), subjective cognitive decline, and neurodegenerative dementia has been established. Impaired olfaction is considered a marker for neurodegeneration. Hence, there is a need to examine if SCI leads to olfactory dysfunction. In this study, the brain tissue of mice with spinal cord hemisection injury was subjected to microarray analysis. The mRNA expression levels of olfactory receptors in the brain began to decline at 8 h post-SCI. SCI promoted neuroinflammation, downregulated the expression of olfactory receptors, decreased the number of neural stem cells (NSCs), and inhibited the production of neurotrophic factors in the olfactory bulbs at 8 h post-SCI. In particular, the SCI group had upregulated mRNA and protein expression levels of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP; a marker of astrocyte reactivation) and pro-inflammatory mediators [IL-1β, IL-6, and Nestin (marker of NSCs)] in the olfactory bulb compared to levels in the sham control group. The mRNA expression levels of olfactory receptors (Olfr1494, Olfr1324, Olfr1241, and Olfr979) and neurotrophic factors [brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), and nerve growth factor (NGF)] were downregulated in the olfactory bulb of the SCI group mice at 8 h post-SCI. The administration of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) mitigated these SCI-induced pathological changes in the olfactory bulb at 8 h post-SCI. These results indicate that the olfactory bulb is vulnerable to environmental damage even if the lesion is located at sites distant from the brain, such as the spinal cord. Additionally, SCI initiated pathological processes, including inflammatory response, and impaired neurogenesis, at an early stage. The findings of this study will provide a basis for future studies on pathological mechanisms of early neurodegenerative diseases involving the olfactory bulb and enable early clinical drug intervention.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Resting-State Functional Connectivity Signatures of Apathy in Community-Living Older Adults</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.691710</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Apathy predicts poor outcomes in older adults, and its underlying neural mechanism needs further investigation. We examined the association between symptoms of apathy and functional connectivity (FC) in older adults without stroke or dementia. Participants included 48 individuals (mean age = 70.90) living independently in the community, who underwent resting-state fMRI and completed the Apathy Evaluation Scale (AES). Seed-to-voxel analysis (cluster-level p-FDR &amp;lt;0.05, voxel threshold p &amp;lt; 0.001) tested the association between AES scores and the whole-brain FC of brain regions involved in reward- and salience-related processing. We found that AES scores were negatively associated with FC of the right insula cortex and right anterior temporal regions (124 voxels, t = −5.10) and FC of the left orbitofrontal cortex and anterior cingulate regions (160 voxels, t = −5.45), and were positively associated with FC of the left orbitofrontal cortex and left lateral prefrontal (282 voxels, t = 4.99) and anterior prefrontal (123 voxels, t = 4.52) regions. These findings suggest that apathy in older adults may reflect disruptions in neural connectivity involved in reward- and salience-related processing.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

The effectiveness of immune responses depends on the precision of stimulus-responsive gene expression programs. Cells specify which genes to express by activating stimulus-specific combinations of stimulus-induced transcription factors (TFs). Their activities are decoded by a gene regulatory strategy (GRS) associated with each response gene. Here, we examined whether the GRSs of target genes may be inferred from stimulus-response (input-output) datasets, which remains an unresolved model-identifiability challenge. We developed a mechanistic modeling framework and computational workflow to determine the identifiability of all possible combinations of synergistic (AND) or non-synergistic (OR) GRSs involving three transcription factors. Considering different sets of perturbations for stimulus-response studies, we found that two thirds of GRSs are easily distinguishable but that substantially more quantitative data is required to distinguish the remaining third. To enhance the accuracy of the inference with timecourse experimental data, we developed an advanced error model that avoids error overestimates by distinguishing between value and temporal error. Incorporating this error model into a Bayesian framework, we show that GRS models can be identified for individual genes by considering multiple datasets. Our analysis rationalizes the allocation of experimental resources by identifying most informative TF stimulation conditions. Applying this computational workflow to experimental data of immune response genes in macrophages, we found that a much greater fraction of genes are combinatorially controlled than previously reported by considering compensation among transcription factors. Specifically, we revealed that a group of known NFκB target genes may also be regulated by IRF3, which is supported by chromatin immuno-precipitation analysis. Our study provides a computational workflow for designing and interpreting stimulus-response gene expression studies to identify underlying gene regulatory strategies and further a mechanistic understanding.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/12RL_IX6X-Y&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Despite the unprecedented growth in our understanding of cell biology, it still remains challenging to connect it to experimental data obtained with cells and tissues’ physiopathological status under precise circumstances. This knowledge gap often results in difficulties in designing validation experiments, which are usually labor-intensive, expensive to perform, and hard to interpret. Here we propose PHENSIM, a computational tool using a systems biology approach to simulate how cell phenotypes are affected by the activation/inhibition of one or multiple biomolecules, and it does so by exploiting signaling pathways. Our tool’s applications include predicting the outcome of drug administration, knockdown experiments, gene transduction, and exposure to exosomal cargo. Importantly, PHENSIM enables the user to make inferences on well-defined cell lines and includes pathway maps from three different model organisms. To assess our approach’s reliability, we built a benchmark from transcriptomics data gathered from NCBI GEO and performed four case studies on known biological experiments. Our results show high prediction accuracy, thus highlighting the capabilities of this methodology. PHENSIM standalone Java application is available at https://github.com/alaimos/phensim, along with all data and source codes for benchmarking. A web-based user interface is accessible at https://phensim.tech/.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/3FcE-ZITjls&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

In October of 2020, in response to the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, our team hosted our first fully online workshop teaching the QIIME 2 microbiome bioinformatics platform. We had 75 enrolled participants who joined from at least 25 different countries on 6 continents, and we had 22 instructors on 4 continents. In the 5-day workshop, participants worked hands-on with a cloud-based shared compute cluster that we deployed for this course. The event was well received, and participants provided feedback and suggestions in a postworkshop questionnaire. In January of 2021, we followed this workshop with a second fully online workshop, incorporating lessons from the first. Here, we present details on the technology and protocols that we used to run these workshops, focusing on the first workshop and then introducing changes made for the second workshop. We discuss what worked well, what didn’t work well, and what we plan to do differently in future workshops.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/57YiPJNjZ8U&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience: Cortical Activation to Social and Mechanical Stimuli in the Infant Brain</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2021.510030</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;From the early days of life infants distinguish between social and non-social physical entities and have different expectations for the way these two entities should move and interact. At the same time, we know very little about the cortical systems that support this early emerging ability. The goal of the current research was to assess the extent to which infant’s processing of social and non-social physical entities is mediated by distinct information processing systems in the temporal cortex. Using a cross-sectional design, infants aged 6–9 months (Experiment 1) and 11–18 months (Experiment 2) were presented with two types of events: social interaction and mechanical interaction. In the social interaction event (patterned after Hamlin et al., 2007), an entity with googly eyes, hair tufts, and an implied goal of moving up the hill was either helped up, or pushed down, a hill through the actions of another social entity. In the mechanical interaction event, the googly eyes and hair tufts were replaced with vertical black dots and a hook and clasp, and the objects moved up or down the hill via mechanical interactions. FNIRS was used to measure activation from temporal cortex while infants viewed the test events. In both age groups, viewing social and mechanical interaction events elicited different patterns of activation in the right temporal cortex, although responses were more specialized in the older age group. Activation was not obtained in these areas when the objects moved in synchrony without interacting, suggesting that the causal nature of the interaction events may be responsible, in part, to the results obtained. This is one of the few fNIRS studies that has investigated age-related patterns of cortical activation and the first to provide insight into the functional development of networks specialized for processing of social and non-social physical entities engaged in interaction events.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Evaluation of Neuropathological Features in the SOD1-G93A Low Copy Number Transgenic Mouse Model of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2021.681868</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) still depicts an incurable and devastating disease. Drug development efforts are mostly based on superoxide dismutase 1 gene (SOD1)-G93A mice that present a very strong and early phenotype, allowing only a short time window for intervention. An alternative mouse model is available, that is based on the same founder line but has a reduced SOD1-G93A copy number, resulting in a weaker and delayed phenotype. To be able to use these SOD1-G93A/low mice for drug testing, we performed a characterization of ALS-typical pathologies. All analyses were performed compared to non-transgenic (ntg) littermates of the same sex and age. In vivo analysis of SOD1-G93A/low mice was performed by weekly body weight measurements, analysis of the survival rate, and measurement of the muscle strength of 24–30 weeks old female and male SOD1-G93A/low mice. Immunofluorescent labeling of SOD1, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), and ionized calcium-binding adaptor molecule 1 (Iba1) protein was performed in the cervical, thoracic, and lumbar ventral horn of the spinal cord of 24–30 weeks old male and female SOD1-G93A/low mice. The musculus gastrocnemius of male SOD1-G93A/low mice was labeled with fluorophore-conjugated α-bungarotoxin and antibodies against phosphorylated neurofilaments. Fluorescent labeling was detected and quantified by macro-based image analysis. Although SOD1 protein levels were highly increased in both sexes and all age groups, levels strongly peaked in 30 weeks old male SOD1-G93A/low mice. Astrocytosis and activated microglia in the spinal cord ventral horn and phosphorylated neurofilaments in the motor unit of the musculus gastrocnemius progressively increased, while muscle strength progressively decreased in male SOD1-G93A/low mice. In female SOD1-G93A/low mice, only activated microglia increased progressively, while muscle strength was constantly reduced starting at 26 weeks. These differences result in a shorter survival time of male SOD1-G93A/low mice of about 3 weeks compared to female animals. The results suggest that male SOD1-G93A/low mice present a stronger pathology and are, therefore, better suitable to evaluate the efficacy of new drugs against ALS as most pathological features are developing progressively paralleled by a survival time that allows treatment to start before symptom onset.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Hierarchical Encoder-Decoder With Soft Label-Decomposition for Mitochondria Segmentation in EM Images</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.687832</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Semantic segmentation of mitochondria from electron microscopy (EM) images is an essential step to obtain reliable morphological statistics about mitochondria. However, automatically delineating plenty of mitochondria of varied shapes from complex backgrounds with sufficient accuracy is challenging. To address these challenges, we develop a hierarchical encoder-decoder network (HED-Net), which has a three-level nested U-shape architecture to capture rich contextual information. Given the irregular shape of mitochondria, we introduce a novel soft label-decomposition strategy to exploit shape knowledge in manual labels. Rather than simply using the ground truth label maps as the unique supervision in the model training, we introduce additional subcategory-aware supervision by softly decomposing each manual label map into two complementary label maps according to mitochondria's ovality. The three label maps are integrated with our HED-Net to supervise the model training. While the original label map guides the network to segment all the mitochondria of varied shapes, the auxiliary label maps guide the network to segment subcategories of mitochondria of circular shape and elliptic shape, respectively, which are much more manageable tasks. Extensive experiments on two public benchmarks show that our HED-Net performs favorably against state-of-the-art methods.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroinformatics: DarkASDNet: Classification of ASD on Functional MRI Using Deep Neural Network</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fninf.2021.635657</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Non-invasive whole-brain scans aid the diagnosis of neuropsychiatric disorder diseases such as autism, dementia, and brain cancer. The assessable analysis for autism spectrum disorders (ASD) is rationally challenging due to the limitations of publicly available datasets. For diagnostic or prognostic tools, functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) exposed affirmation to the biomarkers in neuroimaging research because of fMRI pickup inherent connectivity between the brain and regions. There are profound studies in ASD with introducing machine learning or deep learning methods that have manifested advanced steps for ASD predictions based on fMRI data. However, utmost antecedent models have an inadequacy in their capacity to manipulate performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. To overcome these problems, we proposed an avant-garde DarkASDNet, which has the competence to extract features from a lower level to a higher level and bring out promising results. In this work, we considered 3D fMRI data to predict binary classification between ASD and typical control (TC). Firstly, we pre-processed the 3D fMRI data by adopting proper slice time correction and normalization. Then, we introduced a novel DarkASDNet which surpassed the benchmark accuracy for the classification of ASD. Our model's outcomes unveil that our proposed method established state-of-the-art accuracy of 94.70% to classify ASD vs. TC in ABIDE-I, NYU dataset. Finally, we contemplated our model by performing evaluation metrics including precision, recall, F1-score, ROC curve, and AUC score, and legitimize by distinguishing with recent literature descriptions to vindicate our outcomes. The proposed DarkASDNet architecture provides a novel benchmark approach for ASD classification using fMRI processed data.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroinformatics: The Stroke Neuro-Imaging Phenotype Repository: An Open Data Science Platform for Stroke Research</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fninf.2021.597708</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Stroke is one of the leading causes of death and disability worldwide. Reducing this disease burden through drug discovery and evaluation of stroke patient outcomes requires broader characterization of stroke pathophysiology, yet the underlying biologic and genetic factors contributing to outcomes are largely unknown. Remedying this critical knowledge gap requires deeper phenotyping, including large-scale integration of demographic, clinical, genomic, and imaging features. Such big data approaches will be facilitated by developing and running processing pipelines to extract stroke-related phenotypes at large scale. Millions of stroke patients undergo routine brain imaging each year, capturing a rich set of data on stroke-related injury and outcomes. The Stroke Neuroimaging Phenotype Repository (SNIPR) was developed as a multi-center centralized imaging repository of clinical computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans from stroke patients worldwide, based on the open source XNAT imaging informatics platform. The aims of this repository are to: (i) store, manage, process, and facilitate sharing of high-value stroke imaging data sets, (ii) implement containerized automated computational methods to extract image characteristics and disease-specific features from contributed images, (iii) facilitate integration of imaging, genomic, and clinical data to perform large-scale analysis of complications after stroke; and (iv) develop SNIPR as a collaborative platform aimed at both data scientists and clinical investigators. Currently, SNIPR hosts research projects encompassing ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke, with data from 2,246 subjects, and 6,149 imaging sessions from Washington University’s clinical image archive as well as contributions from collaborators in different countries, including Finland, Poland, and Spain. Moreover, we have extended the XNAT data model to include relevant clinical features, including subject demographics, stroke severity (NIH Stroke Scale), stroke subtype (using TOAST classification), and outcome [modified Rankin Scale (mRS)]. Image processing pipelines are deployed on SNIPR using containerized modules, which facilitate replicability at a large scale. The first such pipeline identifies axial brain CT scans from DICOM header data and image data using a meta deep learning scan classifier, registers serial scans to an atlas, segments tissue compartments, and calculates CSF volume. The resulting volume can be used to quantify the progression of cerebral edema after ischemic stroke. SNIPR thus enables the development and validation of pipelines to automatically extract imaging phenotypes and couple them with clinical data with the overarching aim of enabling a broad understanding of stroke progression and outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: An Investigation of a Frontal Negative Slow Wave in a Virtual Hedonic Purchase Task</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.674312</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;There is a connection between the frontal negative slow wave (FNSW) and the arousal inhibition in the hedonic purchase context. To calculate the FNSW (400–800 ms), event-related potentials (ERPs) method was applied to depict the neural substrates on prudent and impulsive consumers’ behaviors within various states of promotion. Promotion types include the pure price promotion and the mixed promotion (a mixture of a charitable donation and a discount). Behaviorally, consumers response more quickly in the pure price promotion condition and they express a preference for the mixed promotion. More importantly, a larger FNSW emerged in the impulsive consumers than the prudent, suggesting that the former might tend to control their eagerness to consume hedonic items. Compared with the price promotion as the worse option, the mixed promotion as the better option caused more perceptual conflict, leading to an increase in N2 amplitude. It suggests that consumers incline to reject the worse offers. These results also reveal that people primarily have to search negative promotion information by their insight and subsequently impulsive consumers inhibit the responses to the promotion information. The method of ERPs and FNSW should be helpful for marketing researchers and professionals on hedonic consumption and sales promotion.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Power of Hypoperfusion in Predicting Recurrent Transient Ischemic Attacks: Protocol of a Prospective Cohort Study</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.654383</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Background: Transient ischemic attack (TIA) has a high incidence of recurrent vascular events. Hypoperfusion is one of the factors that are closely correlated with 7-day recurrence of TIA. This study aimed to evaluate the power of hypoperfusion shown on magnetic resonance (MR) perfusion imaging in predicting the incidence of 7-day recurrence of ischemic events after TIA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods/Design: REATTACK is a prospective multi-centered cohort study on the correlation between MR perfusion and TIA recurrence. Ninety patients aged ≥18 years with recent (&amp;lt;7 days after onset) clinical TIA will be continuously included. All the patients will undergo diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and perfusion-weighted imaging (PWI) assessments within 24 h after the onset of TIA. The subjects will then be divided into a PWI positive group and a PWI negative group according to the time-to-maximum of the residue function (T&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;). PWI will be repeated after 7 days and in 3 months. The primary clinical outcome will be the recurrence of TIA within 7 days after the onset of TIA. Secondary outcomes will be the recurrence of TIA in 3 months and modified Rankin scale (mRS) score. A chi-square test will be performed to compare the difference in the incidence of recurrent TIA between the two groups, and rank sum test in the mRS score. Multivariate logistic regression will be simultaneously performed to analyze the risk factors for the recurrence of TIA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Discussion: The results of this study will confirm whether abnormal T&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; helps to identify the patients with TIA who have high risks of recurrent ischemic events. This would largely improve the prognosis of patients with TIA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trial Registration:www.chictr.org.cn, registration number: ChiCTR2000031863, registered on 12 April 2020.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Changes in EEG Brain Connectivity Caused by Short-Term BCI Neurofeedback-Rehabilitation Training: A Case Study</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.627100</link>
	<content:encoded>Background&lt;p&gt;In combined with neurofeedback, Motor Imagery (MI) based Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) has been an effective long-term treatment therapy for motor dysfunction caused by neurological injury in the brain (e.g., post-stroke hemiplegia). However, individual neurological differences have led to variability in the single sessions of rehabilitation training. Research on the impact of short training sessions on brain functioning patterns can help evaluate and standardize the short duration of rehabilitation training. In this paper, we use the electroencephalogram (EEG) signals to explore the brain patterns’ changes after a short-term rehabilitation training.&lt;/p&gt;Materials and Methods&lt;p&gt;Using an EEG-BCI system, we analyzed the changes in short-term (about 1-h) MI training data with and without visual feedback, respectively. We first examined the EEG signal’s Mu band power’s attenuation caused by Event-Related Desynchronization (ERD). Then we use the EEG’s Event-Related Potentials (ERP) features to construct brain networks and evaluate the training from multiple perspectives: small-scale based on single nodes, medium-scale based on hemispheres, and large-scale based on all-brain.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Results showed no significant difference in the ERD power attenuation estimation in both groups. But the neurofeedback group’s ERP brain network parameters had substantial changes and trend properties compared to the group without feedback. The neurofeedback group’s Mu band power’s attenuation increased but not significantly (fitting line slope = 0.2, t-test value p &amp;gt; 0.05) after the short-term MI training, while the non-feedback group occurred an insignificant decrease (fitting line slope = −0.4, t-test value p &amp;gt; 0.05). In the ERP-based brain network analysis, the neurofeedback group’s network parameters were attenuated in all scales significantly (t-test value: p &amp;lt; 0.01); while the non-feedback group’s most network parameters didn’t change significantly (t-test value: p &amp;gt; 0.05).&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;The MI-BCI training’s short-term effects does not show up in the ERD analysis significantly but can be detected by ERP-based network analysis significantly. Results inspire the efficient evaluation of short-term rehabilitation training and provide a useful reference for subsequent studies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neural Circuits: Defective Neuronal Positioning Correlates With Aberrant Motor Circuit Function in Zebrafish</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncir.2021.690475</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Precise positioning of neurons resulting from cell division and migration during development is critical for normal brain function. Disruption of neuronal migration can cause a myriad of neurological disorders. To investigate the functional consequences of defective neuronal positioning on circuit function, we studied a zebrafish frizzled3a (fzd3a) loss-of-function mutant off-limits (olt) where the facial branchiomotor (FBM) neurons fail to migrate out of their birthplace. A jaw movement assay, which measures the opening of the zebrafish jaw (gape), showed that the frequency of gape events, but not their amplitude, was decreased in olt mutants. Consistent with this, a larval feeding assay revealed decreased food intake in olt mutants, indicating that the FBM circuit in mutants generates defective functional outputs. We tested various mechanisms that could generate defective functional outputs in mutants. While fzd3a is ubiquitously expressed in neural and non-neural tissues, jaw cartilage and muscle developed normally in olt mutants, and muscle function also appeared to be unaffected. Although FBM neurons were mispositioned in olt mutants, axon pathfinding to jaw muscles was unaffected. Moreover, neuromuscular junctions established by FBM neurons on jaw muscles were similar between wildtype siblings and olt mutants. Interestingly, motor axons innervating the interhyoideus jaw muscle were frequently defasciculated in olt mutants. Furthermore, GCaMP imaging revealed that mutant FBM neurons were less active than their wildtype counterparts. These data show that aberrant positioning of FBM neurons in olt mutants is correlated with subtle defects in fasciculation and neuronal activity, potentially generating defective functional outputs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: The Air We Breathe: Air Pollution as a Prevalent Proinflammatory Stimulus Contributing to Neurodegeneration</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.647643</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Air pollution is regarded as an important risk factor for many diseases that affect a large proportion of the human population. To date, accumulating reports have noted that particulate matter (PM) is closely associated with the course of cardiopulmonary disorders. As the incidence of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Parkinson’s disease (PD), and autoimmune disorders have risen and as the world’s population is aging, there is an increasing interest in environmental health hazards, mainly air pollution, which has been slightly overlooked as one of many plausible detrimental stimuli contributing to neurodegenerative disease onset and progression. Epidemiological studies have indicated a noticeable association between exposure to PM and neurotoxicity, which has been gradually confirmed by in vivo and in vitro studies. After entering the body directly through the olfactory epithelium or indirectly by passing through the respiratory system into the circulatory system, air pollutants are subsequently able to reach the brain. Among the potential mechanisms underlying particle-induced detrimental effects in the periphery and the central nervous system (CNS), increased oxidative stress, inflammation, mitochondrial dysfunction, microglial activation, disturbance of protein homeostasis, and ultimately, neuronal death are often postulated and concomitantly coincide with the main pathomechanisms of neurodegenerative processes. Other complementary mechanisms by which PM could mediate neurotoxicity and contribute to neurodegeneration remain unconfirmed. Furthermore, the question of how strong and proven air pollutants are as substantial adverse factors for neurodegenerative disease etiologies remains unsolved. This review highlights research advances regarding the issue of PM with an emphasis on neurodegeneration markers, symptoms, and mechanisms by which air pollutants could mediate damage in the CNS. Poor air quality and insufficient knowledge regarding its toxicity justify conducting scientific investigations to understand the biological impact of PM in the context of various types of neurodegeneration.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Adaptation of metabolite leakiness leads to symbiotic chemical exchange and to a resilient microbial ecosystem</title>

Microbial communities display remarkable diversity, facilitated by the secretion of chemicals that can create new niches. However, it is unclear why cells often secrete even essential metabolites after evolution. Based on theoretical results indicating that cells can enhance their own growth rate by leaking even essential metabolites, we show that such “leaker” cells can establish an asymmetric form of mutualism with “consumer” cells that consume the leaked chemicals: the consumer cells benefit from the uptake of the secreted metabolites, while the leaker cells also benefit from such consumption, as it reduces the metabolite accumulation in the environment and thereby enables further secretion, resulting in frequency-dependent coexistence of multiple microbial species. As supported by extensive simulations, such symbiotic relationships generally evolve when each species has a complex reaction network and adapts its leakiness to optimize its own growth rate under crowded conditions and nutrient limitations. Accordingly, symbiotic ecosystems with diverse cell species that leak and exchange many metabolites with each other are shaped by cell-level adaptation of leakiness of metabolites. Moreover, the resultant ecosystems with entangled metabolite exchange are resilient against structural and environmental perturbations. Thus, we present a theory for the origin of resilient ecosystems with diverse microbes mediated by secretion and exchange of essential chemicals.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/wmo7WSQdy_M&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Behavioral correlates of cortical semantic representations modeled by word vectors</title>

The quantitative modeling of semantic representations in the brain plays a key role in understanding the neural basis of semantic processing. Previous studies have demonstrated that word vectors, which were originally developed for use in the field of natural language processing, provide a powerful tool for such quantitative modeling. However, whether semantic representations in the brain revealed by the word vector-based models actually capture our perception of semantic information remains unclear, as there has been no study explicitly examining the behavioral correlates of the modeled brain semantic representations. To address this issue, we compared the semantic structure of nouns and adjectives in the brain estimated from word vector-based brain models with that evaluated from human behavior. The brain models were constructed using voxelwise modeling to predict the functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) response to natural movies from semantic contents in each movie scene through a word vector space. The semantic dissimilarity of brain word representations was then evaluated using the brain models. Meanwhile, data on human behavior reflecting the perception of semantic dissimilarity between words were collected in psychological experiments. We found a significant correlation between brain model- and behavior-derived semantic dissimilarities of words. This finding suggests that semantic representations in the brain modeled via word vectors appropriately capture our perception of word meanings.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/ohcN714oyF4&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Identification of those at greatest risk of death due to the substantial threat of COVID-19 can benefit from novel approaches to epidemiology that leverage large datasets and complex machine-learning models, provide data-driven intelligence, and guide decisions such as intensive-care unit admission (ICUA). The objective of this study is two-fold, one substantive and one methodological: substantively to evaluate the association of demographic and health records with two related, yet different, outcomes of severe COVID-19 (viz., death and ICUA); methodologically to compare interpretations based on logistic regression and on gradient-boosted decision tree (GBDT) predictions interpreted by means of the Shapley impacts of covariates. Very different association of some factors, e.g., obesity and chronic respiratory diseases, with death and ICUA may guide review of practice. Shapley explanation of GBDTs identified varying effects of some factors among patients, thus emphasising the importance of individual patient assessment. The results of this study are also relevant for the evaluation of complex automated clinical decision systems, which should optimise prediction scores whilst remaining interpretable to clinicians and mitigating potential biases.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/WaEcwTZNArA&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

The dynamics of tumors growth and associated events cover multiple time and spatial scales, generally including extracellular, cellular and intracellular modifications. The main goal of this study is to model the biological and physical behavior of tumor evolution in presence of normal healthy tissue, taking in consideration a variety of events involved in the process. These include hyper and hypoactivation of signaling pathways during tumor growth, vessels growth, intratumoral vascularization and competition of cancer cells with healthy host tissue. The work addresses two distinctive phases in tumor development—the avascular and vascular phases—and in each stage two cases are considered—with and without normal healthy cells. The tumor growth rate increases considerably as closed vessel loops (anastomoses) form around the tumor cells resulting from tumor induced vascularization. When taking into account the host tissue around the tumor, the results show that competition between normal cells and cancer cells leads to the formation of a hypoxic tumor core within a relatively short period of time. Moreover, a dense intratumoral vascular network is formed throughout the entire lesion as a sign of a high malignancy grade, which is consistent with reported experimental data for several types of solid carcinomas. In comparison with other mathematical models of tumor development, in this work we introduce a multiscale simulation that models the cellular interactions and cell behavior as a consequence of the activation of oncogenes and deactivation of gene signaling pathways within each cell. Simulating a therapy that blocks relevant signaling pathways results in the prevention of further tumor growth and leads to an expressive decrease in its size (82% in the simulation).&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/8I63kf_WyQs&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

The vertebrate hindbrain is segmented into rhombomeres (r) initially defined by distinct domains of gene expression. Previous studies have shown that noise-induced gene regulation and cell sorting are critical for the sharpening of rhombomere boundaries, which start out rough in the forming neural plate (NP) and sharpen over time. However, the mechanisms controlling simultaneous formation of multiple rhombomeres and accuracy in their sizes are unclear. We have developed a stochastic multiscale cell-based model that explicitly incorporates dynamic morphogenetic changes (i.e. convergent-extension of the NP), multiple morphogens, and gene regulatory networks to investigate the formation of rhombomeres and their corresponding boundaries in the zebrafish hindbrain. During pattern initiation, the short-range signal, fibroblast growth factor (FGF), works together with the longer-range morphogen, retinoic acid (RA), to specify all of these boundaries and maintain accurately sized segments with sharp boundaries. At later stages of patterning, we show a nonlinear change in the shape of rhombomeres with rapid left-right narrowing of the NP followed by slower dynamics. Rapid initial convergence improves boundary sharpness and segment size by regulating cell sorting and cell fate both independently and coordinately. Overall, multiple morphogens and tissue dynamics synergize to regulate the sizes and boundaries of multiple segments during development.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/4z1N25Nh-Ro&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Sustaining a robust metabolic network requires a balanced and fully functioning proteome. In addition to amino acids, many enzymes require cofactors (coenzymes and engrafted prosthetic groups) to function properly. Extensively validated resource allocation models, such as genome-scale models of metabolism and gene expression (ME-models), have the ability to compute an optimal proteome composition underlying a metabolic phenotype, including the provision of all required cofactors. Here we apply the ME-model for &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; K-12 MG1655 to computationally examine how environmental conditions change the proteome and its accompanying cofactor usage. We found that: (1) The cofactor requirements computed by the ME-model mostly agree with the standard biomass objective function used in models of metabolism alone (M-models); (2) ME-model computations reveal non-intuitive variability in cofactor use under different growth conditions; (3) An analysis of ME-model predicted protein use in aerobic and anaerobic conditions suggests an enrichment in the use of peroxyl scavenging acids in the proteins used to sustain aerobic growth; (4) The ME-model could describe how limitation in key protein components affect the metabolic state of &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt;. Genome-scale models have thus reached a level of sophistication where they reveal intricate properties of functional proteomes and how they support different &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; lifestyles.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/joVILwdy1gQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Synaptic Neuroscience: Fetal Neuroprotective Strategies: Therapeutic Agents and Their Underlying Synaptic Pathways</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsyn.2021.680899</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Synaptic signaling is integral for proper brain function. During fetal development, exposure to inflammation or mild hypoxic-ischemic insult may lead to synaptic changes and neurological damage that impairs future brain function. Preterm neonates are most susceptible to these deleterious outcomes. Evaluating clinically used and novel fetal neuroprotective measures is essential for expanding treatment options to mitigate the short and long-term consequences of fetal brain injury. Magnesium sulfate is a clinical fetal neuroprotective agent utilized in cases of imminent preterm birth. By blocking N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors, magnesium sulfate reduces glutamatergic signaling, which alters calcium influx, leading to a decrease in excitotoxicity. Emerging evidence suggests that melatonin and N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) may also serve as novel putative fetal neuroprotective candidates. Melatonin has important anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties and is a known mediator of synaptic plasticity and neuronal generation. While NAC acts as an antioxidant and a precursor to glutathione, it also modulates the glutamate system. Glutamate excitotoxicity and dysregulation can induce perinatal preterm brain injury through damage to maturing oligodendrocytes and neurons. The improved drug efficacy and delivery of the dendrimer-bound NAC conjugate provides an opportunity for enhanced pharmacological intervention. Here, we review recent literature on the synaptic pathways underlying these therapeutic strategies, discuss the current gaps in knowledge, and propose future directions for the field of fetal neuroprotective agents.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Integrative Neuroscience: Duration Comparisons for Vision and Touch Are Dependent on Presentation Order and Temporal Context</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnint.2021.664264</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Integrating visual and tactile information in the temporal domain is critical for active perception. To accomplish this, coordinated timing is required. Here, we study perceived duration within and across these two modalities. Specifically, we examined how duration comparisons within and across vision and touch were influenced by temporal context and presentation order using a two-interval forced choice task. We asked participants to compare the duration of two temporal intervals defined by tactile or visual events. Two constant standard durations (700 ms and 1,000 ms in ‘shorter’ sessions; 1,000 ms and 1,500 ms in ‘longer’ sessions) were compared to variable comparison durations in different sessions. In crossmodal trials, standard and comparison durations were presented in different modalities, whereas in the intramodal trials, the two durations were presented in the same modality. The standard duration was either presented first (&amp;lt;sc&amp;gt;) or followed the comparison duration (&amp;lt;cs&amp;gt;). In both crossmodal and intramodal conditions, we found that the longer standard duration was overestimated in &amp;lt;cs&amp;gt; trials and underestimated in &amp;lt;sc&amp;gt; trials whereas the estimation of shorter standard duration was unbiased. Importantly, the estimation of 1,000ms was biased when it was the longer standard duration within the shorter sessions but not when it was the shorter standard duration within the longer sessions, indicating an effect of temporal context. The effects of presentation order can be explained by a central tendency effect applied in different ways to different presentation orders. Both crossmodal and intramodal conditions showed better discrimination performance for &amp;lt;sc&amp;gt; trials than &amp;lt;cs&amp;gt; trials, supporting the Type B effect for both crossmodal and intramodal duration comparison. Moreover, these results were not dependent on whether the standard duration was defined using tactile or visual stimuli. Overall, our results indicate that duration comparison between vision and touch is dependent on presentation order and temporal context, but not modality.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.690044</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The purpose of the latest brain computer interface is to perform accurate emotion recognition through the customization of their recognizers to each subject. In the field of machine learning, graph-based semi-supervised learning (GSSL) has attracted more and more attention due to its intuitive and good learning performance for emotion recognition. However, the existing GSSL methods are sensitive or not robust enough to noise or outlier electroencephalogram (EEG)-based data since each individual subject may present noise or outlier EEG patterns in the same scenario. To address the problem, in this paper, we invent a Possibilistic Clustering-Promoting semi-supervised learning method for EEG-based Emotion Recognition. Specifically, it constrains each instance to have the same label membership value with its local weighted mean to improve the reliability of the recognition method. In addition, a regularization term about fuzzy entropy is introduced into the objective function, and the generalization ability of membership function is enhanced by increasing the amount of sample discrimination information, which improves the robustness of the method to noise and the outlier. A large number of experimental results on the three real datasets (i.e., DEAP, SEED, and SEED-IV) show that the proposed method improves the reliability and robustness of the EEG-based emotion recognition.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Background&lt;p&gt;Half of all amyotrophic lateral sclerosis-frontotemporal spectrum disorder (ALS-FTSD) patients are classified as cognitively impaired, of which 10% have frontotemporal dementia (FTD), and an additional 40% suffer from a frontotemporal syndrome not severe enough to be described as dementia (cognitively impaired/ALSci). As changes in cerebral function measured by resting-state magnet resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) are known in ALS, we investigated whether group differences in resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) networks could be observed between ALS patients with different cognitive profiles against healthy controls (HC). Furthermore, we correlated cognition and motor functioning with network connectivity.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;Healthy controls, 69, and 97 ALS patients underwent functional MRI scanning and cognitive assessment. The ALS patients were categorized as non-impaired (ALSni; n = 68), cognitively impaired (ALSci; n = 21), and ALS-FTD (n = 8). Group differences in connectivity of the default mode network (DMN), motor network (MN), and ventral attention network (VAN) were investigated using a full-factorial model; correlations between global cognitive performance, shifting, and motor symptom severity were established using Pearson’s correlation.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;At a liberal alpha level of uncorrected p &amp;lt; 0.005 and a cluster size exceeding 20 voxels, we found widespread decreases in functional connectivity in all three networks when comparing ALS patients to HC. Similar patterns of hypoconnectivity in the bilateral motor cortices and frontotemporal emerged when comparing the ALSci and ALS-FTD patients to those not cognitively impaired. Hyperconnectivity in the DMN temporal gyrus correlated with worse global cognition; moreover, hyperconnectivity in the VAN thalamus, insula, and putamen correlated with worse shifting ability. Better-preserved motor function correlated with higher MN connectivity. Only the motor-related effects prevailed at a more conservative significance level of p&lt;sub&gt;FDR&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;lt; 0.001.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;Resting-state functional connectivity differs between cognitive profiles of ALS and is directly associated with clinical presentation, specifically with motor function, and cognitive shifting.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Light-activated biointerfaces provide a non-genetic route for effective control of neural activity. InP quantum dots (QDs) have a high potential for such biomedical applications due to their uniquely tunable electronic properties, photostability, toxic-heavy-metal-free content, heterostructuring, and solution-processing ability. However, the effect of QD nanostructure and biointerface architecture on the photoelectrical cellular interfacing remained unexplored. Here, we unravel the control of the photoelectrical response of InP QD-based biointerfaces via nanoengineering from QD to device-level. At QD level, thin ZnS shell growth (∼0.65 nm) enhances the current level of biointerfaces over an order of magnitude with respect to only InP core QDs. At device-level, band alignment engineering allows for the bidirectional photoelectrochemical current generation, which enables light-induced temporally precise and rapidly reversible action potential generation and hyperpolarization on primary hippocampal neurons. Our findings show that nanoengineering QD-based biointerfaces hold great promise for next-generation neurostimulation devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.666179</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In discourse comprehension, we need to draw inferences to make sense of discourse. Previous neuroimaging studies have investigated the neural correlates of causal inferences in discourse understanding. However, these findings have been divergent, and how these types of inferences are related to causal inferences in logical problem-solving remains unclear. Using the activation likelihood estimation (ALE) approach, the current meta-analysis analyzed 19 experiments on causal inferences in discourse understanding and 20 experiments on those in logical problem-solving to identify the neural correlates of these two cognitive processes and their shared and distinct neural correlates. We found that causal inferences in discourse comprehension recruited a left-lateralized frontotemporal brain system, including the left inferior frontal gyrus, the left middle temporal gyrus (MTG), and the bilateral medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC), while causal inferences in logical problem-solving engaged a nonoverlapping brain system in the frontal and parietal cortex, including the left inferior frontal gyrus, the bilateral middle frontal gyri, the dorsal MPFC, and the left inferior parietal lobule (IPL). Furthermore, the pattern similarity analyses showed that causal inferences in discourse understanding were primarily related to the terms about language processing and theory-of-mind processing. Both types of inferences were found to be related to the terms about memory and executive function. These findings suggest that causal inferences in discourse understanding recruit distinct neural bases from those in logical problem-solving and rely more on semantic knowledge and social interaction experiences.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: A Comparison of Closed Loop vs. Fixed Frequency tACS on Modulating Brain Oscillations and Visual Detection</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.661432</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Transcranial alternating current stimulation has emerged as an effective tool for the exploration of brain oscillations. By applying a weak alternating current between electrodes placed on the scalp matched to the endogenous frequency, tACS enables the specific modulation of targeted brain oscillations This results in alterations in cognitive functions or persistent physiological changes. Most studies that utilize tACS determine a fixed stimulation frequency prior to the stimulation that is kept constant throughout the experiment. Yet it is known that brain rhythms can encounter shifts in their endogenous frequency. This could potentially move the ongoing brain oscillations into a frequency region where it is no longer affected by the stimulation, thereby decreasing or negating the effect of tACS. Such an effect of a mismatch between stimulation frequency and endogenous frequency on the outcome of stimulation has been shown before for the parietal alpha-activity. In this study, we employed an intermittent closed loop stimulation protocol, where the stimulation is divided into short epochs, between which an EEG is recorded and rapidly analyzed to determine a new stimulation frequency for the next stimulation epoch. This stimulation protocol was tested in a three-group study against a classical fixed stimulation protocol and a sham-treatment. We targeted the parietal alpha rhythm and hypothesized that this setup will ensure a constant close match between the frequencies of tACS and alpha activity. This closer match should lead to an increased modulation of detection of visual luminance changes depending on the phase of the tACS and an increased rise in alpha peak power post stimulation when compared to a protocol with fixed pre-determined stimulation frequency. Contrary to our hypothesis, our results show that only a fixed stimulation protocol leads to a persistent increase in post-stimulation alpha power as compared to sham. Furthermore, in none of the stimulated groups significant modulation of detection performance occurred. While the lack of behavioral effects is inconclusive due to the short selection of different phase bins and trials, the physiological results suggest that a constant stimulation with a fixed frequency is actually beneficial, when the goal is to produce persistent synaptic changes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.653659</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Deep neural networks (DNNs) used for brain–computer interface (BCI) classification are commonly expected to learn general features when trained across a variety of contexts, such that these features could be fine-tuned to specific contexts. While some success is found in such an approach, we suggest that this interpretation is limited and an alternative would better leverage the newly (publicly) available massive electroencephalography (EEG) datasets. We consider how to adapt techniques and architectures used for language modeling (LM) that appear capable of ingesting awesome amounts of data toward the development of encephalography modeling with DNNs in the same vein. We specifically adapt an approach effectively used for automatic speech recognition, which similarly (to LMs) uses a self-supervised training objective to learn compressed representations of raw data signals. After adaptation to EEG, we find that a single pre-trained model is capable of modeling completely novel raw EEG sequences recorded with differing hardware, and different subjects performing different tasks. Furthermore, both the internal representations of this model and the entire architecture can be fine-tuned to a variety of downstream BCI and EEG classification tasks, outperforming prior work in more task-specific (sleep stage classification) self-supervision.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Enhanced Information Flow From Cerebellum to Secondary Visual Cortices Leads to Better Surgery Outcome in Degenerative Cervical Myelopathy Patients: A Stochastic Dynamic Causal Modeling Study With Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.632829</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Degenerative cervical myelopathy (DCM) damages the spinal cord, resulting in long-term neurological impairment including motor and visual deficits. Given that visual feedback is crucial in guiding movements, the visual disorder may be a cause of motor deficits in patients with DCM. It has been shown that increased functional connectivity between secondary visual cortices and cerebellum, which are functionally related to the visually guided movements, was correlated with motor function in patients with DCM. One possible explanation is that the information integration between these regions was increased to compensate for impaired visual acuity in patients with DCM and resulted in better visual feedback during motor function. However, direct evidence supporting this hypothesis is lacking. To test this hypothesis and explore in more detail the information flow within the “visual-cerebellum” system, we measured the effective connectivity (EC) among the “visual-cerebellum” system via dynamic causal modeling and then tested the relationship between the EC and visual ability in patients with DCM. Furthermore, the multivariate pattern analysis was performed to detect the relationship between the pattern of EC and motor function in patients with DCM. We found (1) significant increases of the bidirectional connections between bilateral secondary visual cortices and cerebellum were observed in patients with DCM; (2) the increased self-connection of the cerebellum was positively correlated with the impaired visual acuity in patients; (3) the amplitude of effectivity from the cerebellum to secondary visual cortices was positively correlated with better visual recovery following spinal cord decompression surgery; and (4) the pattern of EC among the visual-cerebellum system could be used to predict the pre-operative motor function. In conclusion, this study provided direct evidence that the increased information integration within the “visual-cerebellum” system compensated for visual impairments, which might have importance for sustaining better motor function in patients with DCM.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Neuroinflammation-Driven Lymphangiogenesis in CNS Diseases</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.683676</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The central nervous system (CNS) undergoes immunosurveillance despite the lack of conventional antigen presenting cells and lymphatic vessels in the CNS parenchyma. Additionally, the CNS is bathed in a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). CSF is continuously produced, and consequently must continuously clear to maintain fluid homeostasis despite the lack of conventional lymphatics. During neuroinflammation, there is often an accumulation of fluid, antigens, and immune cells to affected areas of the brain parenchyma. Failure to effectively drain these factors may result in edema, prolonged immune response, and adverse clinical outcome as observed in conditions including traumatic brain injury, ischemic and hypoxic brain injury, CNS infection, multiple sclerosis (MS), and brain cancer. Consequently, there has been renewed interest surrounding the expansion of lymphatic vessels adjacent to the CNS which are now thought to be central in regulating the drainage of fluid, cells, and waste out of the CNS. These lymphatic vessels, found at the cribriform plate, dorsal dural meninges, base of the brain, and around the spinal cord have each been implicated to have important roles in various CNS diseases. In this review, we discuss the contribution of meningeal lymphatics to these processes during both steady-state conditions and neuroinflammation, as well as discuss some of the many still unknown aspects regarding the role of meningeal lymphatics in neuroinflammation. Specifically, we focus on the observed phenomenon of lymphangiogenesis by a subset of meningeal lymphatics near the cribriform plate during neuroinflammation, and discuss their potential roles in immunosurveillance, fluid clearance, and access to the CSF and CNS compartments. We propose that manipulating CNS lymphatics may be a new therapeutic way to treat CNS infections, stroke, and autoimmunity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Reissner’s fiber (RF) is a secreted filament that floats in the neural canal of chordates. Since its discovery in 1860, there has been no agreement on its primary function, and its strong conservation across chordate species has remained a mystery for comparative neuroanatomists. Several findings, including the chemical composition and the phylogenetic history of RF, clinical observations associating RF with the development of the neural canal, and more recent studies suggesting that RF is needed to develop a straight vertebral column, may shed light on the functions of this structure across chordates. In this article, we will briefly review the evidence mentioned above to suggest a role of RF in the origin of fundamental innovations of the chordate body plan, especially the elongation of the neural tube and maintenance of the body axis. We will also mention the relevance of RF for medical conditions like hydrocephalus, scoliosis of the vertebral spine and possibly regeneration of the spinal cord.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnana.2021.696376</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Oligodendrocytes are the myelinating cells of the central nervous system. They provide trophic, metabolic, and structural support to neurons. In several pathologies such as multiple sclerosis (MS), these cells are severely affected and fail to remyelinate, thereby leading to neuronal death. The gold standard for studying remyelination is the g-ratio, which is measured by means of transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Therefore, studying the fine structure of the oligodendrocyte population in the human brain at different stages through TEM is a key feature in this field of study. Here we study the ultrastructure of oligodendrocytes, its progenitors, and myelin in 10 samples of human white matter using nine different markers of the oligodendrocyte lineage (NG2, PDGFRα, A2B5, Sox10, Olig2, BCAS1, APC-(CC1), MAG, and MBP). Our findings show that human oligodendrocytes constitute a very heterogeneous population within the human white matter and that its stages of differentiation present characteristic features that can be used to identify them by TEM. This study sheds light on how these cells interact with other cells within the human brain and clarify their fine characteristics from other glial cell types.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Abstract
The hippocampus and posterior parietal cortex are implicated in both episodic memory and encoding of position in an environment. In the present study, we examine the impact of locomotor behaviors associated with movement in both the horizontal and vertical dimensions on population activity patterns in these two brain structures. We utilized a five‐looped, squared spiral track containing stair segments, ramp segments, and flat segments. In addition to encoding locations along the full route, posterior parietal cortex population activity demonstrates strong pattern recurrence for similar action types at different locations in the environment. Additionally, posterior parietal and hippocampal neurons exhibit parallel modulation in the scale of representation that follows behavioral dynamics required for track traversal. These findings build on prior work examining spatial mapping in the vertical dimension and provide a better understanding of how a series of actions and visited locations can be coordinated in the generation of episodic memory.</content:encoded>

	<title>Hippocampus: Sex differences in hippocampal connectivity during spatial long‐term memory</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hipo.23319?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
Sex differences in brain activity have been reported across various types of long‐term memory. To our knowledge, sex differences in functional connectivity during long‐term memory have not been investigated. A previous study on the structural connectome identified that female brains have a greater degree of interhemispheric connectivity than males, whereas males have a greater degree of intrahemispheric connectivity than females. The aim of the current investigation was twofold: (a) identify which brain regions were functionally connected to the hippocampus during spatial long‐term memory, and (b) determine if there were sex differences in the functionally connected regions. During the study phase, abstract shapes were presented to the left or right of fixation. During the test phase, abstract shapes were presented at fixation and participants classified each item as previously on the “left” or “right”. A hippocampal region of interest (ROI) was identified by contrasting spatial memory hits and misses. The peak coordinate from this ROI was used to define the center of a sphere that was used as the seed for the functional connectivity analysis. The connectivity analysis produced many connected activations including the medial posterior frontal cortex, lateral posterior frontal cortex, left inferior frontal gyrus, posterior cingulate cortex, and caudate/putamen. Although there were no regions with greater connectivity in females than males, the male versus female comparison produced connected activations in the medial posterior frontal cortex, anterior prefrontal cortex, precuneus, and cingulate sulcus. Females also had greater interhemispheric connectivity than males. The current findings suggest collapsing across sex in cognitive neuroscience studies may not be warranted.</content:encoded>

	<title>Hippocampus: Rodent mnemonic similarity task performance requires the prefrontal cortex</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hipo.23316?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
Mnemonic similarity task performance, in which a known target stimulus must be distinguished from similar lures, is supported by the hippocampus and perirhinal cortex. Impairments on this task are known to manifest with advancing age. Interestingly, disrupting hippocampal activity leads to mnemonic discrimination impairments when lures are novel, but not when they are familiar. This observation suggests that other brain structures support discrimination abilities as stimuli are learned. The prefrontal cortex (PFC) is critical for retrieval of remote events and executive functions, such as working memory, and is also particularly vulnerable to dysfunction in aging. Importantly, the medial PFC is reciprocally connected to the perirhinal cortex and neuron firing in this region coordinates communication between lateral entorhinal and perirhinal cortices to presumably modulate hippocampal activity. This anatomical organization and function of the medial PFC suggests that it contributes to mnemonic discrimination; however, this notion has not been empirically tested. In the current study, rats were trained on a LEGO object‐based mnemonic similarity task adapted for rodents, and surgically implanted with guide cannulae targeting prelimbic and infralimbic regions of the medial PFC. Prior to mnemonic discrimination tests, rats received PFC infusions of the GABAA agonist muscimol. Analyses of expression of the neuronal activity‐dependent immediate‐early gene Arc in medial PFC and adjacent cortical regions confirmed muscimol infusions led to neuronal inactivation in the infralimbic and prelimbic cortices. Moreover, muscimol infusions in PFC impaired mnemonic discrimination performance relative to the vehicle control across all testing blocks when lures shared 50–90% feature overlap with the target. Thus, in contrast hippocampal infusions, PFC inactivation impaired target‐lure discrimination regardless of the novelty or familiarity of the lures. These findings indicate the PFC plays a critical role in mnemonic similarity task performance, but the time course of PFC involvement is dissociable from that of the hippocampus.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Abstract
Spatial navigation is a crucial everyday skill, which when impaired leads to a significant decrease in quality of life. In humans, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has provided extensive insights into the neural underpinnings of navigation skills. Whereas the hippocampus has been recognized as the prime region underpinning navigation abilities, by providing a cognitive map of the environment, imaging studies have also implicated a range of other brain regions. In this review, we provide an overview of the fMRI evidence for extrahippocampal contributions to spatial navigation. We show that the parahippocampal cortex, retrosplenial cortex, dorsal striatum, and the posterior parietal cortex provide important complementary functions, and ultimately form part of a functional network that regulates successful way‐finding behavior.</content:encoded>

	<title>Hippocampus: A selective role for the mPFC during choice and deliberation, but not spatial memory retention over short delays</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hipo.23306?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
Important interactions between memory and decision‐making processes are required to maintain high‐levels of spatial working memory task performance. Past research reveals that the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and hippocampus (HPC) are both vital structures involved in these processes. Recent evidence suggests that interactions between these two structures are dynamic and task dependent. However, there exists uncertainty surrounding the specific conditions that recruit mPFC contributions to these tasks, specifically regarding its role in retaining information online during delay periods. To address this issue, we tested rats on a spatial‐delayed alternation task in which we utilized a closed‐loop optogenetic system to transiently disrupt mPFC activity during different task epochs (delay, choice, return). By analyzing the effects of mPFC disruption on choice accuracy and a deliberative behavior known as vicarious‐trial‐and‐error (VTE), our study revealed several interesting findings regarding the role of the mPFC in spatial‐working memory tasks. The main findings include: (a) choice accuracy in the spatial‐delayed alternation (SDA) task was impaired when the mPFC was disrupted during the choice epoch and not delay or return epochs, (b) mPFC disruption resulted in a non‐epoch specific reduction in VTE occurrence which correlated with impairments in task performance. Taken together, findings from this study suggest that, during spatial decision‐making, contributions made by the mPFC are specific to points of deliberation and choice (not delay), and that VTEs are a deliberative behavior which relies on intact mPFC function.</content:encoded>

	<title>Hippocampus: Reconciling the object and spatial processing views of the perirhinal cortex through task‐relevant unitization</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hipo.23304?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
The perirhinal cortex is situated on the border between sensory association cortex and the hippocampal formation. It serves an important function as a transition area between the sensory neocortex and the medial temporal lobe. While the perirhinal cortex has traditionally been associated with object coding and the “what” pathway of the temporal lobe, current evidence suggests a broader function of the perirhinal cortex in solving feature ambiguity and processing complex stimuli. Besides fulfilling functions in object coding, recent neurophysiological findings in freely moving rodents indicate that the perirhinal cortex also contributes to spatial and contextual processing beyond individual sensory modalities. Here, we address how these two opposing views on perirhinal cortex—the object‐centered and spatial‐contextual processing hypotheses—may be reconciled. The perirhinal cortex is consistently recruited when different features can be merged perceptually or conceptually into a single entity. Features that are unitized in these entities include object information from multiple sensory domains, reward associations, semantic features and spatial/contextual associations. We propose that the same perirhinal network circuits can be flexibly deployed for multiple cognitive functions, such that the perirhinal cortex performs similar unitization operations on different types of information, depending on behavioral demands and ranging from the object‐related domain to spatial, contextual and semantic information.</content:encoded>

	<title>Hippocampus: Role of the reuniens and rhomboid thalamic nuclei in anxiety‐like avoidance behavior in the rat</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hipo.23302?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
The nucleus reuniens (RE) and rhomboid (RH) nuclei of the ventral midline thalamus are reciprocally connected with the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and the hippocampus (HF) and serve as key intermediaries between these structures, regulating cognitive and emotional behaviors. Regarding affective behavior, several recent reports have described the involvement of RE/RH in the acquisition and retention of conditioned fear, but little is known regarding their role (RE/RH) in anxiety‐like behaviors. We examined the role of RH/RE on avoidance and defensive behaviors in male Long Evans rats using the elevated plus maze (EPM). We found that the reversible suppression of RE/RH with muscimol increased avoidance behavior to the open arms of the plus maze as shown by: (a) significant reductions in open arm entries; (b) reductions in the mean duration of time spent in the open arms; and (c) significant increases in retreats during open arm exploration. This was coupled with decreases in the number of head dips in the maze. Consistent with these behavioral effects, a single exposure of naïve rats to the plus maze produced significant increases in c‐fos expression selectively in RE and RH of midline thalamic nuclei. We posit that RE/RH normally acts to optimize adaptive responses to anxiety‐eliciting situations, and disruptions of RE/RH produce severe deficits in coping behaviors—or as shown here increases in avoidance/defensive behaviors. In sum, the present results establish a novel role for RE/RH in anxiety‐like avoidance behavior. In addition to its role in attention, working memory, and executive control, RE/RH also regulates adaptative responses to not only fear but also to anxiogenic stimuli. As such, dysfunction of RE/RH may contribute to the amalgamation of symptoms common to many mental health disorders including anxiety, depression, schizophrenia, and PTSD.</content:encoded>

The extinction of contextual fear is commonly an essential requirement for successful exposure therapy for fear disorders. However, experimental work on extinction of contextual fear is limited, and there little or no directly relevant theoretical work. Here, we extend BACON, a neurocomputational model of context fear conditioning that provides plausible explanations for a number of aspects of context fear conditioning, to deal with extinction (calling the model BaconX). In this model, contextual representations are formed in the hippocampus and association of fear to them occurs in the amygdala. Representation creation, conditionability, and development of between‐session extinction are controlled by degree of confidence (assessed by the Bayesian weight of evidence) that an active contextual representation is in fact that of the current context (i.e., is “valid”). The model predicts that: (1) extinction which persists between sessions will occur only if at a sessions end there is high confidence that the active representation is valid. It follows that the shorter the context placement‐to‐US (shock) interval (“PSI”) and the less is therefore learned about context, the longer extinction sessions must be for enduring extinction to occur, while too short PSIs will preclude successful extinction. (2) Short‐PSI deficits can be rescued by contextual exposure even after conditioning has occurred. (3) Learning to discriminate well between a conditioned and similar safe context requires representations of each to form, which may not occur if PSI was too short. (4) Extinction‐causing inhibition must be applied downstream of the conditioning locus for reasonable generalization properties to be generated. (5) Context change tends to cause return of extinguished contextual fear. (6). Extinction carried out in the conditioning context generalizes better than extinction executed in contexts to which fear has generalized (as done in exposure therapy). (7) BaconX suggests novel approaches to exposure therapy.</content:encoded>

	<title>Hippocampus: Goal‐directed interaction of stimulus and task demand in the parahippocampal region</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hipo.23295?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
The hippocampus and parahippocampal region are essential for representing episodic memories involving various spatial locations and objects, and for using those memories for future adaptive behavior. The “dual‐stream model” was initially formulated based on anatomical characteristics of the medial temporal lobe, dividing the parahippocampal region into two streams that separately process and relay spatial and nonspatial information to the hippocampus. Despite its significance, the dual‐stream model in its original form cannot explain recent experimental results, and many researchers have recognized the need for a modification of the model. Here, we argue that dividing the parahippocampal region into spatial and nonspatial streams a priori may be too simplistic, particularly in light of ambiguous situations in which a sensory cue alone (e.g., visual scene) may not allow such a definitive categorization. Upon reviewing evidence, including our own, that reveals the importance of goal‐directed behavioral responses in determining the relative involvement of the parahippocampal processing streams, we propose the Goal‐directed Interaction of Stimulus and Task‐demand (GIST) model. In the GIST model, input stimuli such as visual scenes and objects are first processed by both the postrhinal and perirhinal cortices—the postrhinal cortex more heavily involved with visual scenes and perirhinal cortex with objects—with relatively little dependence on behavioral task demand. However, once perceptual ambiguities are resolved and the scenes and objects are identified and recognized, the information is then processed through the medial or lateral entorhinal cortex, depending on whether it is used to fulfill navigational or non‐navigational goals, respectively. As complex sensory stimuli are utilized for both navigational and non‐navigational purposes in an intermixed fashion in naturalistic settings, the hippocampus may be required to then put together these experiences into a coherent map to allow flexible cognitive operations for adaptive behavior to occur.</content:encoded>

	<title>Hippocampus: Functional connectivity with the anterior and posterior hippocampus during spatial memory</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hipo.23283?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
Evidence of differential connectivity and activity patterns across the long‐axis of the hippocampus has led to many hypotheses about functional specialization of the anterior and posterior hippocampus, including a hypothesis linking the anterior hippocampus to memory encoding and the posterior hippocampus to memory retrieval. The hippocampal encoding/retrieval and network (HERNET) model of memory predicts that encoding should engage the anterior hippocampus and the attention network, whereas retrieval should engage the posterior hippocampus and the default network. In a previous fMRI study that employed multivoxel pattern analysis, we found that the patterns of activity in the anterior hippocampus predicted the quadrant of spatial memory encoding. In the current fMRI study, we investigated whether the spatial memory encoding activity in the anterior hippocampus and retrieval activity in the posterior hippocampus had a higher degree of connectivity to the attention network or the default network. During the study phase, abstract shapes were presented in each quadrant of the visual field and participants were instructed to remember each shape's location while maintaining central fixation. During the test phase, the same shapes were presented in the center of the screen and participants identified the previous location of each shape. Generalized psychophysiological interaction analyses were conducted between the anatomically defined anterior and posterior hippocampus and the rest of the brain. This revealed preferential connectivity between the anterior hippocampus and regions of the attention network during encoding and between the posterior hippocampus and regions of the default network during retrieval. In addition, there were location‐specific patterns of connectivity with the anterior hippocampus and posterior hippocampus during encoding and retrieval of right visual field items. These results suggest that the anterior and posterior hippocampus interact with regions of the attention network and default network during spatial memory encoding and retrieval, respectively, and support the HERNET model of memory.</content:encoded>

	<title>Hippocampus: Calretinin and calbindin architecture of the midline thalamus associated with prefrontal–hippocampal circuitry</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hipo.23271?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
The midline thalamus bidirectionally connects the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and hippocampus (HC) creating a unique cortico‐thalamo‐cortical circuit fundamental to memory and executive function. While the anatomical connectivity of midline thalamus has been thoroughly investigated, little is known about its cellular organization within each nucleus. Here we used immunohistological techniques to examine cellular distributions in the midline thalamus based on the calcium binding proteins parvalbumin (PV), calretinin (CR), and calbindin (CB). We also examined these calcium binding proteins in a population of reuniens cells known to project to both mPFC and HC using a dual fluorescence retrograde adenoassociated virus‐based tracing approach. These dual reuniens mPFC‐HC projecting cells, in particular, are thought to be important for synchronizing mPFC and HC activity. First, we confirmed the absence of PV+ neurons in the midline thalamus. Second, we found a common pattern of CR+ and CB+ cells throughout midline thalamus with CR+ cells running along the nearby third ventricle (3V) and penetrating the midline. CB+ cells were consistently more lateral and toward the middle of the dorsal‐ventral extent of the midline thalamus. Notably, single‐labeled CR+ and CB+ zones were partially overlapping and included dual‐labeled CR+/CB+ cells. Within RE, we also observed a CR and CB subzone specific diversity. Interestingly, dual mPFC‐HC projecting neurons in RE expressed none of the calcium binding proteins examined, but were contained in nests of CR+ and CB+ cells. Overall, the midline thalamus was well organized into CR+ and CB+ rich zones distributed throughout the region, with dual mPFC‐HC projecting cells in reuniens representing a unique cell population. These results provide a cytoarchitectural organization in the midline thalamus based on calcium binding protein expression, and set the stage for future cell‐type specific interrogations of the functional role of these different cell populations in mPFC‐HC interactions.</content:encoded>

Lung cancer is still a leading cause of death worldwide. In recent years, knowledge has been obtained of the mechanisms modulating ion channel kinetics and thus of cell bioelectric properties, which is promising for oncological biomarkers and targets. The complex interplay of channel expression and its consequences on malignant processes, however, is still insufficiently understood. We here introduce the first approach of an in-silico whole-cell ion current model of a cancer cell, in particular of the A549 human lung adenocarcinoma, including the main functionally expressed ion channels in the plasma membrane as so far known. This hidden Markov-based model represents the electrophysiology behind proliferation of the A549 cell, describing its rhythmic oscillation of the membrane potential able to trigger the transition between cell cycle phases, and it predicts membrane potential changes over the cell cycle provoked by targeted ion channel modulation. This first A549 in-silico cell model opens up a deeper insight and understanding of possible ion channel interactions in tumor development and progression, and is a valuable tool for simulating altered ion channel function in lung cancer electrophysiology.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/QAN6p9QfX0M&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Intrathecal Immunoglobulin M Synthesis is an Independent Biomarker for Higher Disease Activity and Severity in Multiple Sclerosis</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.26137?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Objective
We aimed to determine in relapsing multiple sclerosis (MS) whether intrathecal synthesis of immunoglobulin (Ig) M and IgG is associated with outcomes reflecting inflammatory activity and chronic worsening.


Methods
We compared cerebrospinal fluid analysis, clinical and magnetic resonance imaging data, and serum neurofilament light chain (sNfL) levels at baseline and follow‐up in 530 patients with relapsing MS. Patients were categorized by the presence of oligoclonal IgG bands (OCGB) and intrathecal synthesis of IgG and IgM (intrathecal fraction [IF]: IgGIF and IgMIF). Relationships with the time to first relapse, sNfL concentrations, T2‐weighted (T2w) lesions, MS Severity Score (MSSS), and time to initiation of high‐efficacy therapy were analyzed in covariate‐adjusted statistical models.


Results
By categorical analysis, in patients with IgMIF the median time to first relapse was 28 months shorter and MSSS on average higher by 1.11 steps compared with patients without intrathecal immunoglobulin synthesis. Moreover, patients with IgMIF had higher sNfL concentrations, more new/enlarging T2w lesions, and higher total T2w lesion counts (all p ≤ 0.01). These associations were absent or equally smaller in patients who were positive for only OCGB or OCGB/IgGIF. Furthermore, quantitative analyses revealed that in patients with IgMIF ≥ median, the time to first relapse and to initiation of high‐efficacy therapy was shorter by 32 and by 203 months, respectively (both p &amp;lt; 0.01), in comparison to patients with IgMIF &amp;lt; median. Dose‐dependent associations were also found for IgMIF but not for IgGIF with magnetic resonance imaging‐defined disease activity and sNfL.


Interpretation
This large study supports the value of intrathecal IgM synthesis as an independent biomarker of disease activity and severity in relapsing MS. ANN NEUROL 2021</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>As of April 22, 2021, around 1.5 million individuals in three districts of Kerala, India had been vaccinated with COVID‐19 vaccines. Over 80% of these individuals (1.2 million) received the ChAdOx1‐S/nCoV‐19 vaccine. In this population, during this period of 4 weeks (mid‐March to mid‐April 2021), we observed seven cases of Guillain‐Barre syndrome (GBS) that occurred within 2 weeks of the first dose of vaccination. All seven patients developed severe GBS. The frequency of GBS was 1.4‐ to 10‐fold higher than that expected in this period for a population of this magnitude. In addition, the frequency of bilateral facial weakness, which typically occurs in &amp;lt;20% of GBS cases, suggests a pattern associated with the vaccination. While the benefits of vaccination substantially outweigh the risk of this relatively rare outcome (5.8 per million), clinicians should be alert to this possible adverse event, as six out of seven patients progressed to areflexic quadriplegia and required mechanical ventilatory support.

	<title>Frontiers in Synaptic Neuroscience: Effect of Unilateral Acoustic Trauma on Neuronal Firing Activity in the Inferior Colliculus of Mice</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsyn.2021.684141</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Neural hyperactivity induced by sound exposure often correlates with the development of hyperacusis and/or tinnitus. In laboratory animals, hyperactivity is typically induced by unilateral sound exposure to preserve one ear for further testing of hearing performance. Most ascending fibers in the auditory system cross into the superior olivary complex and then ascend contralaterally. Therefore, unilateral exposure should be expected to mostly affect the contralateral side above the auditory brain stem. On the other hand, it is well known that a significant number of neurons have crossing fibers at every level of the auditory pathway, which may spread the effect of unilateral exposure onto the ipsilateral side. Here we demonstrate that unilateral sound exposure causes development of hyperactivity in both the contra and ipsilateral inferior colliculus in mice. We found that both the spontaneous firing rate and bursting activity were increased significantly compared to unexposed mice. The neurons with characteristic frequencies at or above the center frequency of exposure showed the greatest increase. Surprisingly, this increase was more pronounced in the ipsilateral inferior colliculus. This study highlights the importance of considering both ipsi- and contralateral effects in future studies utilizing unilateral sound exposure.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.684825</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Epilepsy is a common neurological disorder characterized by recurrent and disabling seizures. An increasing number of clinical and experimental applications of machine learning (ML) methods for epilepsy and other neurological and psychiatric disorders are available. ML methods have the potential to provide a reliable and optimal performance for clinical diagnoses, prediction, and personalized medicine by using mathematical algorithms and computational approaches. There are now several applications of ML for epilepsy, including neuroimaging analyses. For precise and reliable clinical applications in epilepsy and neuroimaging, the diverse ML methodologies should be examined and validated. We review the clinical applications of ML models for brain imaging in epilepsy obtained from a PubMed database search in February 2021. We first present an overview of typical neuroimaging modalities and ML models used in the epilepsy studies and then focus on the existing applications of ML models for brain imaging in epilepsy based on the following clinical aspects: (i) distinguishing individuals with epilepsy from healthy controls, (ii) lateralization of the temporal lobe epilepsy focus, (iii) the identification of epileptogenic foci, (iv) the prediction of clinical outcomes, and (v) brain-age prediction. We address the practical problems and challenges described in the literature and suggest some future research directions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Small, Seeding-Competent Huntingtin Fibrils Are Prominent Aggregate Species in Brains of zQ175 Huntington’s Disease Knock-in Mice</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.682172</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The deposition of mutant huntingtin (mHTT) protein aggregates in neurons of patients is a pathological hallmark of Huntington’s disease (HD). Previous investigations in cell-free and cell-based disease models showed mHTT exon-1 (mHTTex1) fragments with pathogenic polyglutamine (polyQ) tracts (&amp;gt;40 glutamines) to self-assemble into highly stable, β-sheet-rich protein aggregates with a fibrillar morphology. HD knock-in mouse models have not been extensively studied with regard to mHTT aggregation. They endogenously produce full-length mHTT with a pathogenic polyQ tract as well as mHTTex1 fragments. Here, we demonstrate that seeding-competent, fibrillar mHTT aggregates can be readily detected in brains of zQ175 knock-in HD mice. To do this, we applied a highly sensitive FRET-based protein amplification assay that is capable of detecting seeding-competent mHTT aggregate species down to the femtomolar range. Furthermore, we show that fibrillar structures with an average length of ∼200 nm can be enriched with aggregate-specific mouse and human antibodies from zQ175 mouse brain extracts through immunoprecipitations, confirming that such structures are formed in vivo. Together these studies indicate that small, fibrillar, seeding-competent mHTT structures are prominent aggregate species in brains of zQ175 mice.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The recent and growing focus on reproducibility in neuroimaging studies has led many major academic centers to use cloud-based imaging databases for storing, analyzing, and sharing complex imaging data. Flywheel is one such database platform that offers easily accessible, large-scale data management, along with a framework for reproducible analyses through containerized pipelines. The Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS) is the de facto standard for neuroimaging data, but curating neuroimaging data into BIDS can be a challenging and time-consuming task. In particular, standard solutions for BIDS curation are limited on Flywheel. To address these challenges, we developed “FlywheelTools,” a software toolbox for reproducible data curation and manipulation on Flywheel. FlywheelTools includes two elements: fw-heudiconv, for heuristic-driven curation of data into BIDS, and flaudit, which audits and inventories projects on Flywheel. Together, these tools accelerate reproducible neuroscience research on the widely used Flywheel platform.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Degree and Complexity of Non-conscious Emotional Information Processing – A Review of Masked Priming Studies</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.689369</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Whether and to what degree information can be processed non-consciously has been a matter of debate since the emergence of psychology as a science. Emotional information, in particular, has often been assumed to have a privileged status because of its relevance for well-being and survival (e.g., to detect a threat). Indeed, many studies have explored non-conscious processing of evaluative (i.e., “emotional” in a broad sense) or emotional (e.g., facial expressions) features using the “silver bullet” of non-consciousness research – the masked sequential priming paradigm. In its prototypical form, this paradigm involves the categorization of target stimuli according to valence (e.g., is the target positive or negative?). Each target is preceded by a briefly presented prime that is followed by a mask to constrain awareness. Non-conscious processing is inferred from subtle influences of the prime on target processing, that is, whether responses are faster if prime and target are valence-congruent or not. We will review this research with a focus on three questions: first, which methods are used in this area to establish non-conscious processing? Second, is there evidence for non-conscious extraction of evaluative information? Third, is there evidence for non-conscious processing beyond a simple valence (positive/negative) discrimination, for example, processing of emotion-specific information? We will highlight important current debates and potential directions in which the field will move in the future.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.680847</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Background: Post-stroke depression (PSD) is the most common mood disorder following stroke and is also the main factor that limits the recovery and rehabilitation of patients with stroke. The prevalence of PSD is ~30%. Since there is no gold standard for the diagnosis and evaluation of PSD, it is important to raise awareness of PSD and to establish methods for its evaluation, early diagnosis, and treatment. In the field of psychiatry, functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) has been used as a diagnostic tool for the measurement of oxygenated hemoglobin (oxy-Hb). This study aimed to assess whether fNIRS could be applied in the diagnosis and evaluation of PSD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: We recruited 45 patients with stroke, who were admitted to Nagasaki Kita Hospital between May 2015 and April 2019. The 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAMD17), which is considered to be a useful screening and evaluation tool for PSD, was used for the assessment of patients after stroke; moreover, oxy-Hb was measured in the pre-frontal cortex. The subjects were divided into two groups: the depressed group (n = 13) and the non-depressed group (n = 32). We evaluated the correlation between the oxy-Hb integral values and HAMD17 scores.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: We investigated the relationship between the oxy-Hb integral values and HAMD17 total scores, and found a negative correlation between them (ρ = −0.331, P &amp;lt; 0.005). There was a significant difference in the oxy-Hb integral values during the activation task period between the depressed and non-depressed groups (3.16 ± 2.7 and 1.71 ± 2.4, respectively; P = 0.040). The results indicated that the patients of the depressed group showed lower oxy-Hb integral values and lower activation in the frontal lobe in comparison with the patients of the non-depressed group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: The present study highlights that the measurement of oxy-Hb by using fNIRS is a useful methodology for the diagnosis of PSD in patients after stroke.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Neurofeedback Training of Auditory Selective Attention Enhances Speech-In-Noise Perception</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.676992</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Selective attention enhances cortical responses to attended sensory inputs while suppressing others, which can be an effective strategy for speech-in-noise (SiN) understanding. Emerging evidence exhibits a large variance in attentional control during SiN tasks, even among normal-hearing listeners. Yet whether training can enhance the efficacy of attentional control and, if so, whether the training effects can be transferred to performance on a SiN task has not been explicitly studied. Here, we introduce a neurofeedback training paradigm designed to reinforce the attentional modulation of auditory evoked responses. Young normal-hearing adults attended one of two competing speech streams consisting of five repeating words (“up”) in a straight rhythm spoken by a female speaker and four straight words (“down”) spoken by a male speaker. Our electroencephalography-based attention decoder classified every single trial using a template-matching method based on pre-defined patterns of cortical auditory responses elicited by either an “up” or “down” stream. The result of decoding was provided on the screen as online feedback. After four sessions of this neurofeedback training over 4 weeks, the subjects exhibited improved attentional modulation of evoked responses to the training stimuli as well as enhanced cortical responses to target speech and better performance during a post-training SiN task. Such training effects were not found in the Placebo Group that underwent similar attention training except that feedback was given only based on behavioral accuracy. These results indicate that the neurofeedback training may reinforce the strength of attentional modulation, which likely improves SiN understanding. Our finding suggests a potential rehabilitation strategy for SiN deficits.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: IL-17 Inhibits Oligodendrocyte Progenitor Cell Proliferation and Differentiation by Increasing K+ Channel Kv1.3</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.679413</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Interleukin 17 (IL-17) is a signature cytokine of Th17 cells. IL-17 level is significantly increased in inflammatory conditions of the CNS, including but not limited to post-stroke and multiple sclerosis. IL-17 has been detected direct toxicity on oligodendrocyte (Ol) lineage cells and inhibition on oligodendrocyte progenitor cell (OPC) differentiation, and thus promotes myelin damage. The cellular mechanism of IL-17 in CNS inflammatory diseases remains obscure. Voltage-gated K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; (Kv) channel 1.3 is the predominant Kv channel in Ol and potentially involved in Ol function and cell cycle regulation. Kv1.3 of T cells involves in immunomodulation of inflammatory progression, but the role of Ol Kv1.3 in inflammation-related pathogenesis has not been fully investigated. We hypothesized that IL-17 induces myelin injury through Kv1.3 activation. To test the hypothesis, we studied the involvement of OPC/Ol Kv1.3 in IL-17-induced Ol/myelin injury in vitro and in vivo. Kv1.3 currents and channel expression gradually decreased during the OPC development. Application of IL-17 to OPC culture increased Kv1.3 expression, leading to a decrease of AKT activation, inhibition of proliferation and myelin basic protein reduction, which were prevented by a specific Kv1.3 blocker 5-(4-phenoxybutoxy) psoralen. IL-17-caused myelin injury was validated in LPC-induced demyelination mouse model, particularly in corpus callosum, which was also mitigated by aforementioned Kv1.3 antagonist. IL-17 altered Kv1.3 expression and resultant inhibitory effects on OPC proliferation and differentiation may by interrupting AKT phosphorylating activation. Taken together, our results suggested that IL-17 impairs remyelination and promotes myelin damage by Kv1.3-mediated Ol/myelin injury. Thus, blockade of Kv1.3 as a potential therapeutic strategy for inflammatory CNS disease may partially attribute to the direct protection on OPC proliferation and differentiation other than immunomodulation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Pituitary Adenylate Cyclase-Activating Polypeptide in Learning and Memory</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.663418</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP) is a highly conserved neuropeptide that regulates neuronal physiology and transcription through Gs/Gq-coupled receptors. Its actions within hypothalamic, limbic, and mnemonic systems underlie its roles in stress regulation, affective processing, neuroprotection, and cognition. Recently, elevated PACAP levels and genetic disruption of PAC1 receptor signaling in humans has been linked to maladaptive threat learning and pathological stress and fear in post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). PACAP is positioned to integrate stress and memory in PTSD for which memory of the traumatic experience is central to the disorder. However, PACAP’s role in memory has received comparatively less attention than its role in stress. In this review, we consider the evidence for PACAP-PAC1 receptor signaling in learning and plasticity, discuss emerging data on sex differences in PACAP signaling, and raise key questions for further study toward elucidating the contribution of PACAP to adaptive and maladaptive fear learning.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Modulation of Neural Microcircuits That Control Complex Dynamics in Olfactory Networks</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.662184</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Neuromodulation influences neuronal processing, conferring neuronal circuits the flexibility to integrate sensory inputs with behavioral states and the ability to adapt to a continuously changing environment. In this original research report, we broadly discuss the basis of neuromodulation that is known to regulate intrinsic firing activity, synaptic communication, and voltage-dependent channels in the olfactory bulb. Because the olfactory system is positioned to integrate sensory inputs with information regarding the internal chemical and behavioral state of an animal, how olfactory information is modulated provides flexibility in coding and behavioral output. Herein we discuss how neuronal microcircuits control complex dynamics of the olfactory networks by homing in on a special class of local interneurons as an example. While receptors for neuromodulation and metabolic peptides are widely expressed in the olfactory circuitry, centrifugal serotonergic and cholinergic inputs modulate glomerular activity and are involved in odor investigation and odor-dependent learning. Little is known about how metabolic peptides and neuromodulators control specific neuronal subpopulations. There is a microcircuit between mitral cells and interneurons that is comprised of deep-short-axon cells in the granule cell layer. These local interneurons express pre-pro-glucagon (PPG) and regulate mitral cell activity, but it is unknown what initiates this type of regulation. Our study investigates the means by which PPG neurons could be recruited by classical neuromodulators and hormonal peptides. We found that two gut hormones, leptin and cholecystokinin, differentially modulate PPG neurons. Cholecystokinin reduces or increases spike frequency, suggesting a heterogeneous signaling pathway in different PPG neurons, while leptin does not affect PPG neuronal firing. Acetylcholine modulates PPG neurons by increasing the spike frequency and eliciting bursts of action potentials, while serotonin does not affect PPG neuron excitability. The mechanisms behind this diverse modulation are not known, however, these results clearly indicate a complex interplay of metabolic signaling molecules and neuromodulators that may fine-tune neuronal microcircuits.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Central Nervous System (CNS) homeostasis and function rely on intercellular synchronization of metabolic pathways. Developmental and neurochemical imbalances arising from mutations are frequently associated with devastating and often intractable neurological dysfunction. In the absence of pharmacological treatment options, but with knowledge of the genetic cause underlying the pathophysiology, gene therapy holds promise for disease control. Consideration of leukodystrophies provide a case in point; we review cell type – specific expression pattern of the disease – causing genes and reflect on genetic and cellular treatment approaches including ex vivo hematopoietic stem cell gene therapies and in vivo approaches using adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors. We link recent advances in vectorology to glial targeting directed towards gene therapies for specific leukodystrophies and related developmental or neurometabolic disorders affecting the CNS white matter and frame strategies for therapy development in future.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Dysregulation of Systemic Immunity in Aging and Dementia</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.652111</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Neuroinflammation and the tissue-resident innate immune cells, the microglia, respond and contribute to neurodegenerative pathology. Although microglia have been the focus of work linking neuroinflammation and associated dementias like Alzheimer’s Disease, the inflammatory milieu of brain is a conglomerate of cross-talk amongst microglia, systemic immune cells and soluble mediators like cytokines. Age-related changes in the inflammatory profile at the levels of both the brain and periphery are largely orchestrated by immune system cells. Strong evidence indicates that both innate and adaptive immune cells, the latter including T cells and B cells, contribute to chronic neuroinflammation and thus dementia. Neurodegenerative hallmarks coupled with more traditional immune system stimuli like infection or injury likely combine to trigger and maintain persistent microglial and thus brain inflammation. This review summarizes age-related changes in immune cell function, with special emphasis on lymphocytes as a source of inflammation, and discusses how such changes may potentiate both systemic and central nervous system inflammation to culminate in dementia. We recap the understudied area of AD-associated changes in systemic lymphocytes in greater detail to provide a unifying perspective of inflammation-fueled dementia, with an eye toward evidence of two-way communication between the brain parenchyma and blood immune cells. We focused our review on human subjects studies, adding key data from animal models as relevant.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroanatomy: Relaxin-3 Innervation From the Nucleus Incertus to the Parahippocampal Cortex of the Rat</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnana.2021.674649</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Spatial learning and memory processes depend on anatomical and functional interactions between the hippocampus and the entorhinal cortex. A key neurophysiological component of these processes is hippocampal theta rhythm, which can be driven from subcortical areas including the pontine nucleus incertus (NI). The NI contains the largest population of neurons that produce and presumably release the neuropeptide, relaxin-3, which acts via the G&lt;sub&gt;i/o&lt;/sub&gt;-protein-coupled receptor, relaxin-family peptide 3 receptor (RXFP3). NI activation induces general arousal including hippocampal theta, and inactivation induces impairment of spatial memory acquisition or retrieval. The primary aim of this study was to map the NI/relaxin-3 innervation of the parahippocampal cortex (PHC), including the medial and lateral entorhinal cortex, endopiriform cortex, perirhinal, postrhinal, and ectorhinal cortex, the amygdalohippocampal transition area and posteromedial cortical amygdala. Retrograde tracer injections were placed in different parts of the medial and lateral entorhinal cortex, which produced prominent retrograde labeling in the ipsilateral NI and some labeling in the contralateral NI. Anterograde tracer injections into the NI and immunostaining for relaxin-3 produced fiber labeling in deep layers of all parahippocampal areas and some dispersed fibers in superficial layers. Double-labeling studies revealed that both hippocampal projecting and calcium-binding protein-positive (presumed GABAergic) neurons received a relaxin-3 NI innervation. Some of these fibers also displayed synaptophysin (Syn) immunoreactivity, consistent with the presence of the peptide at synapses; and relaxin-3-positive fibers containing Syn bouton-like staining were frequently observed in contact with hippocampal-projecting or calcium-binding protein-positive neuronal somata and more distal elements. Finally, in situ hybridization studies revealed that entorhinal neurons in the superficial layers, and to a lesser extent in deep layers, contain RXFP3 mRNA. Together, our data support functional actions of the NI/relaxin-3-parahippocampal innervation on processes related to memory, spatial navigation and contextual analysis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Microbial populations show striking diversity in cell growth morphology and lifecycle; however, our understanding of how these factors influence the growth rate of cell populations remains limited. We use theory and simulations to predict the impact of asymmetric cell division, cell size regulation and single-cell stochasticity on the population growth rate. Our model predicts that coarse-grained noise in the single-cell growth rate λ decreases the population growth rate, as previously seen for symmetrically dividing cells. However, for a given noise in λ we find that dividing asymmetrically can enhance the population growth rate for cells with strong size control (between a “sizer” and an “adder”). To reconcile this finding with the abundance of symmetrically dividing organisms in nature, we propose that additional constraints on cell growth and division must be present which are not included in our model, and we explore the effects of selected extensions thereof. Further, we find that within our model, epigenetically inherited generation times may arise due to size control in asymmetrically dividing cells, providing a possible explanation for recent experimental observations in budding yeast. Taken together, our findings provide insight into the complex effects generated by non-canonical growth morphologies.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/g1HQjGTKbG8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Synaptic plasticity is a cellular model for learning and memory. However, the expression mechanisms underlying presynaptic forms of plasticity are not well understood. Here, we investigate functional and structural correlates of presynaptic potentiation at large hippocampal mossy fiber boutons induced by the adenylyl cyclase activator forskolin. We performed 2-photon imaging of the genetically encoded glutamate sensor iGlu&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt; that revealed an increase in the surface area used for glutamate release at potentiated terminals. Time-gated stimulated emission depletion microscopy revealed no change in the coupling distance between P/Q-type calcium channels and release sites mapped by Munc13-1 cluster position. Finally, by high-pressure freezing and transmission electron microscopy analysis, we found a fast remodeling of synaptic ultrastructure at potentiated boutons: Synaptic vesicles dispersed in the terminal and accumulated at the active zones, while active zone density and synaptic complexity increased. We suggest that these rapid and early structural rearrangements might enable long-term increase in synaptic strength.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/epQIgyneSMY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>We confirmed the presence of von Economo neurons in the frontoinsular cortex of all animals. Focusing on problem‐solving ability, raccoons exhibiting high levels of cognitive flexibility had increased total cell counts (via isotropic fractionation) and higher numbers of fusiform cells (via thionin histology) in the hippocampus.







Abstract
With rates of psychiatric illnesses such as depression continuing to rise, additional preclinical models are needed to facilitate translational neuroscience research. In the current study, the raccoon (Procyon lotor) was investigated due to its similarities with primate brains, including comparable proportional neuronal densities, cortical magnification of the forepaw area, and cortical gyrification. Specifically, we report on the cytoarchitectural characteristics of raccoons profiled as high, intermediate, or low solvers in a multiaccess problem‐solving task. Isotropic fractionation indicated that high‐solvers had significantly more cells in the hippocampus (HC) than the other solving groups; further, a nonsignificant trend suggested that this increase in cell profile density was due to increased nonneuronal (e.g., glial) cells. Group differences were not observed in the cellular density of the somatosensory cortex. Thionin‐based staining confirmed the presence of von Economo neurons (VENs) in the frontoinsular cortex, although no impact of solving ability on VEN cell profile density levels was observed. Elongated fusiform cells were quantified in the HC dentate gyrus where high‐solvers were observed to have higher levels of this cell type than the other solving groups. In sum, the current findings suggest that varying cytoarchitectural phenotypes contribute to cognitive flexibility. Additional research is necessary to determine the translational value of cytoarchitectural distribution patterns on adaptive behavioral outcomes associated with cognitive performance and mental health.</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience: Convergence Circuit Mapping: Genetic Approaches From Structure to Function</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2021.688673</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Understanding the complex neural circuits that underpin brain function and behavior has been a long-standing goal of neuroscience. Yet this is no small feat considering the interconnectedness of neurons and other cell types, both within and across brain regions. In this review, we describe recent advances in mouse molecular genetic engineering that can be used to integrate information on brain activity and structure at regional, cellular, and subcellular levels. The convergence of structural inputs can be mapped throughout the brain in a cell type-specific manner by antero- and retrograde viral systems expressing various fluorescent proteins and genetic switches. Furthermore, neural activity can be manipulated using opto- and chemo-genetic tools to interrogate the functional significance of this input convergence. Monitoring neuronal activity is obtained with precise spatiotemporal resolution using genetically encoded sensors for calcium changes and specific neurotransmitters. Combining these genetically engineered mapping tools is a compelling approach for unraveling the structural and functional brain architecture of complex behaviors and malfunctioned states of neurological disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Long Non-coding RNA LINC01119 Promotes Neuropathic Pain by Stabilizing BDNF Transcript</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2021.673669</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Neuropathic pain (NP) is caused by primary injury or dysfunction of the peripheral and the central nervous system. Long non-coding RNAs were critical regulators involved in nervous system diseases, however, the precise regulatory mechanism remains unclear. This study aims to uncover the essential role of LINC01119 in NP progression and further clarify the underlying regulatory mechanism at post-transcriptional level. LINC01119 was significantly upregulated in rats of spare nerve injury (SNI) group compared to sham group. Functionally, silencing of LINC01119 significantly alleviated the neuropathic pain-induced hypersensitivity and reduced the increase in IL−6, IL−1β, and TNF−α caused by SNI. Mechanistically, Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) was identified as the functional target of LINC01119. Besides, an RNA binding protein, ELAVL1 could directly interact with LINC01119, and this formed LINC01119- ELAVL1 complex binds to BDNF mRNA, strengthening its RNA stability and increasing the expression level of BDNF at both transcript and protein levels. Clinically, serum LINC01119 was verified as a promising diagnostic biomarker for NP patients. LINC01119 induces NP progression via binding with ELAVL1 and increasing BDNF mRNA stability and expression level. Therefore, LINC01119 may serve as a promising diagnostic marker and therapeutic target for NP treatment.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Introduction&lt;p&gt;This study assessed the association of cerebral ischemia with neurodegeneration in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;Subjects with MCI, dementia and controls underwent assessment of cognitive function, severity of brain ischemia, MRI brain volumetry and corneal confocal microscopy.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Of 63 subjects with MCI (n = 44) and dementia (n = 19), 11 had no ischemia, 32 had subcortical ischemia and 20 had both subcortical and cortical ischemia. Brain volume and corneal nerve measures were comparable between subjects with subcortical ischemia and no ischemia. However, subjects with subcortical and cortical ischemia had a lower hippocampal volume (P &amp;lt; 0.01), corneal nerve fiber length (P &amp;lt; 0.05) and larger ventricular volume (P &amp;lt; 0.05) compared to those with subcortical ischemia and lower corneal nerve fiber density (P &amp;lt; 0.05) compared to those without ischemia.&lt;/p&gt;Discussion&lt;p&gt;Cerebral ischemia was associated with cognitive impairment, brain atrophy and corneal nerve loss in MCI and dementia.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>
