	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: ErbB4 mediates amyloid β‐induced neurotoxicity through JNK/tau pathway activation: Implications for Alzheimer's disease</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cne.25207?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>We investigated the role of ErbB4 in parvalbumin (PV) neurons during Alzheimer's disease. Results revealed that ErbB4 in PV neurons might mediate Aβ‐induced neurotoxicity and reduce c‐Fos by activating the c‐Jun N‐terminal kinase (JNK)/tau pathway, ultimately resulting in cognitive deficits. Moreover, JNK was activated by Aβ treatment rather than NRG1β1 treatment, suggesting that NRG1β1 and Aβ have different effects on ErbB4 downstream signaling pathways, probably providing a mechanism for NRG1 anti‐Aβ‐induced neurotoxicity.







Abstract
Accumulation of amyloid β (Aβ) in the brain is a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD). We previously showed that ErbB4 in parvalbumin (PV)‐positive interneurons was associated with Aβ‐induced cognitive deficits; however, the underlying mechanism remains undetermined. Here we found that specific deletion of ErbB4 in PV neurons significantly attenuated oligomeric Aβ‐induced neuronal toxicity and inhibited Aβ‐induced decreases of PSD95 and synaptophysin. Moreover, specific ablation of ErbB4 in PV neurons altered activity‐related protein c‐Fos and decreased hippocampal PV neurons, especially in the dentate gyrus (DG) of hAPP‐J20 mice. Furthermore, c‐Jun N‐terminal kinase (JNK), a protein downstream of ErbB4, was activated by Aβ but not ErbB4's ligand neuregulin 1 (NRG1) β1, suggesting different downstream pathways for Aβ and NRG1β1. JNK phosphorylation was inhibited by the ErbB4 inhibitor AG1478 and by pretreatment with NRG1β1. More importantly, siRNA knockdown of ErbB4 decreased JNK phosphorylation and expression, tau phosphorylation at Ser396 and Thr 205, and Bax expression. Therefore, ErbB4 might mediate Aβ‐induced neuropathology through the JNK/tau pathway and represent a potential therapeutic target in patients with AD.</content:encoded>

	<title>arXiv: Computer Science: Neural and Evolutionary Computing: A Long Short-Term Memory for AI Applications in Spike-based Neuromorphic Hardware. (arXiv:2107.03992v1 [cs.NE])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.03992</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In spite of intensive efforts it has remained an open problem to what extent
current Artificial Intelligence (AI) methods that employ Deep Neural Networks
(DNNs) can be implemented more energy-efficiently on spike-based neuromorphic
hardware. This holds in particular for AI methods that solve sequence
processing tasks, a primary application target for spike-based neuromorphic
hardware. One difficulty is that DNNs for such tasks typically employ Long
Short-Term Memory (LSTM) units. Yet an efficient emulation of these units in
spike-based hardware has been missing. We present a biologically inspired
solution that solves this problem. This solution enables us to implement a
major class of DNNs for sequence processing tasks such as time series
classification and question answering with substantial energy savings on
neuromorphic hardware. In fact, the Relational Network for reasoning about
relations between objects that we use for question answering is the first
example of a large DNN that carries out a sequence processing task with
substantial energy-saving on neuromorphic hardware.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.03475</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Brain parcellations play a ubiquitous role in the analysis of magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) datasets. Over 100 years of research has been conducted
in pursuit of an ideal brain parcellation. Different methods have been
developed and studied for constructing brain parcellations using different
imaging modalities. More recently, several data-driven parcellation methods
have been adopted from data mining, machine learning, and statistics
communities. With contributions from different scientific fields, there is a
rich body of literature that needs to be examined to appreciate the breadth of
existing research and the gaps that need to be investigated. In this work, we
review the large body of in vivo brain parcellation research spanning different
neuroimaging modalities and methods. A key contribution of this work is a
semantic organization of this large body of work into different taxonomies,
making it easy to understand the breadth and depth of the brain parcellation
literature. Specifically, we categorized the existing parcellations into three
groups: Anatomical parcellations, functional parcellations, and structural
parcellations which are constructed using T1-weighted MRI, functional MRI
(fMRI), and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) datasets, respectively. We provide
a multi-level taxonomy of different methods studied in each of these
categories, compare their relative strengths and weaknesses, and highlight the
challenges currently faced for the development of brain parcellations.

	<title>arXiv: Quantitative Biology: Neurons and Cognition: Sleep syndromes onset detection based on automatic sleep staging algorithm. (arXiv:2107.03387v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.03387</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In this paper, we propose a novel method and a practical approach to
predicting early onsets of sleep syndromes, including restless leg syndrome,
insomnia, based on an algorithm that is comprised of two modules. A Fast
Fourier Transform is applied to 30 seconds long epochs of EEG recordings to
provide localized time-frequency information, and a deep convolutional LSTM
neural network is trained for sleep stage classification. Automating sleep
stages detection from EEG data offers great potential to tackling sleep
irregularities on a daily basis. Thereby, a novel approach for sleep stage
classification is proposed which combines the best of signal processing and
statistics. In this study, we used the PhysioNet Sleep European Data Format
(EDF) Database. The code evaluation showed impressive results, reaching an
accuracy of 86.43, precision of 77.76, recall of 93,32, F1-score of 89.12 with
the final mean false error loss of 0.09.

	<title>arXiv: Computer Science: Neural and Evolutionary Computing: Runtime analysis of the (mu+1)-EA on the Dynamic BinVal function. (arXiv:2010.13428v2 [cs.NE] UPDATED)</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.13428</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;We study evolutionary algorithms in a dynamic setting, where for each
generation a different fitness function is chosen, and selection is performed
with respect to the current fitness function. Specifically, we consider Dynamic
BinVal, in which the fitness functions for each generation is given by the
linear function BinVal, but in each generation the order of bits is randomly
permuted. For the (1+1)-EA it was known that there is an efficiency threshold
$c_0$ for the mutation parameter, at which the runtime switches from
quasilinear to exponential. A previous empirical evidence suggested that for
larger population size $\mu$, the threshold may increase. We prove that this is
at least the case in an $\varepsilon$-neighborhood around the optimum: the
threshold of the (\mu+1)-EA becomes arbitrarily large if the $\mu$ is chosen
large enough.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the most surprising result is obtained by a second order analysis
for $\mu=2$: the threshold INcreases with increasing proximity to the optimum.
In particular, the hardest region for optimization is NOT around the optimum.

	<title>arXiv: Quantitative Biology: Neurons and Cognition: Flexibly Regularized Mixture Models and Application to Image Segmentation. (arXiv:1905.10629v2 [cs.CV] UPDATED)</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1905.10629</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Probabilistic finite mixture models are widely used for unsupervised
clustering. These models can often be improved by adapting them to the topology
of the data. For instance, in order to classify spatially adjacent data points
similarly, it is common to introduce a Laplacian constraint on the posterior
probability that each data point belongs to a class. Alternatively, the mixing
probabilities can be treated as free parameters, while assuming Gauss-Markov or
more complex priors to regularize those mixing probabilities. However, these
approaches are constrained by the shape of the prior and often lead to
complicated or intractable inference. Here, we propose a new parametrization of
the Dirichlet distribution to flexibly regularize the mixing probabilities of
over-parametrized mixture distributions. Using the Expectation-Maximization
algorithm, we show that our approach allows us to define any linear update rule
for the mixing probabilities, including spatial smoothing regularization as a
special case. We then show that this flexible design can be extended to share
class information between multiple mixture models. We apply our algorithm to
artificial and natural image segmentation tasks, and we provide quantitative
and qualitative comparison of the performance of Gaussian and Student-t
mixtures on the Berkeley Segmentation Dataset. We also demonstrate how to
propagate class information across the layers of deep convolutional neural
networks in a probabilistically optimal way, suggesting a new interpretation
for feedback signals in biological visual systems. Our flexible approach can be
easily generalized to adapt probabilistic mixture models to arbitrary data
topologies.

	<content:encoded>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Analysing a visual scene requires the brain to briefly keep in memory potentially relevant items of that scene and then direct attention to their locations for detailed processing. To reveal the neuronal basis of the underlying working memory and top-down attention processes, we trained macaques to match two patterns presented with a delay between them. As the above processes are likely to require communication between brain regions, and the parietal cortex is known to be involved in spatial attention, we simultaneously recorded neuronal activities from the interconnected parietal and middle temporal areas. We found that mnemonic information about features of the first pattern was retained in coherent oscillating activity between the two areas in high-frequency bands, followed by coherent activity in lower frequency bands mediating top-down attention on the relevant spatial location. Oscillations maintaining featural information also modulated activity of the cells of the parietal cortex that mediate attention. This could potentially enable transfer of information to organize top-down signals necessary for selective attention. Our results provide evidence in support of a two-stage model of visual attention where the first stage involves creating a saliency map representing a visual scene and at the second stage attentional feedback is provided to cortical areas involved in detailed analysis of the attended parts of a scene.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience: Inactivation of Prefrontal Cortex Delays Emergence From Sevoflurane Anesthesia</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2021.690717</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Studies aimed at investigating brain regions involved in arousal state control have been traditionally limited to subcortical structures. In the current study, we tested the hypothesis that inactivation of prefrontal cortex, but not two subregions within parietal cortex—somatosensory barrel field and medial/lateral parietal association cortex—would suppress arousal, as measured by an increase in anesthetic sensitivity. Male and female Sprague Dawley rats were surgically prepared for recording electroencephalogram and bilateral infusion into prefrontal cortex (N = 13), somatosensory barrel field (N = 10), or medial/lateral parietal association cortex (N = 9). After at least 10 days of post-surgical recovery, 156 μM tetrodotoxin or saline was microinjected into one of the cortical sites. Ninety minutes after injection, rats were anesthetized with 2.5% sevoflurane and the time to loss of righting reflex, a surrogate for loss of consciousness, was measured. Sevoflurane was stopped after 45 min and the time to return of righting reflex, a surrogate for return of consciousness, was measured. Tetrodotoxin-mediated inactivation of all three cortical sites decreased (p &amp;lt; 0.05) the time to loss of righting reflex. By contrast, only inactivation of prefrontal cortex, but not somatosensory barrel field or medial/lateral parietal association cortex, increased (p &amp;lt; 0.001) the time to return of righting reflex. Burst suppression ratio was not altered following inactivation of any of the cortical sites, suggesting that there was no global effect due to pharmacologic lesion. These findings demonstrate that prefrontal cortex plays a causal role in emergence from anesthesia and behavioral arousal.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2021.660104</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer's disease (AD) induces time-dependent changes in sphingolipid metabolism, which may affect transcription regulation and neuronal phenotype. We, therefore, analyzed the influence of age, amyloid β precursor protein (AβPP), and the clinically approved, bioavailable sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor modulator fingolimod (FTY720) on the expression of synaptic proteins. RNA was isolated, reverse-transcribed, and subjected to real-time PCR. Expression of mutant (V717I) AβPP led to few changes at 3 months of age but reduced multiple mRNA coding for synaptic proteins in a 12-month-old mouse brain. Complexin 1 (Cplx1), SNAP25 (Snap25), syntaxin 1A (Stx1a), neurexin 1 (Nrxn1), neurofilament light (Nefl), and synaptotagmin 1 (Syt1) in the hippocampus, and VAMP1 (Vamp1) and neurexin 1 (Nrxn1) in the cortex were all significantly reduced in 12-month-old mice. Post mortem AD samples from the human hippocampus and cortex displayed lower expression of VAMP, synapsin, neurofilament light (NF-L) and synaptophysin. The potentially neuroprotective FTY720 reversed most AβPP-induced changes in gene expression (Cplx1, Stx1a, Snap25, and Nrxn1) in the 12-month-old hippocampus, which is thought to be most sensitive to early neurotoxic insults, but it only restored Vamp1 in the cortex and had no influence in 3-month-old brains. Further study may reveal the potential usefulness of FTY720 in the modulation of deregulated neuronal phenotype in AD brains.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The purpose is to explore the feature recognition, diagnosis, and forecasting performances of Semi-Supervised Support Vector Machines (S3VMs) for brain image fusion Digital Twins (DTs). Both unlabeled and labeled data are used regarding many unlabeled data in brain images, and semi supervised support vector machine (SVM) is proposed. Meantime, the AlexNet model is improved, and the brain images in real space are mapped to virtual space by using digital twins. Moreover, a diagnosis and prediction model of brain image fusion digital twins based on semi supervised SVM and improved AlexNet is constructed. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) data from the Brain Tumor Department of a Hospital are collected to test the performance of the constructed model through simulation experiments. Some state-of-art models are included for performance comparison: Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), AlexNet, and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP). Results demonstrate that the proposed model can provide a feature recognition and extraction accuracy of 92.52%, at least an improvement of 2.76% compared to other models. Its training lasts for about 100 s, and the test takes about 0.68 s. The Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of the proposed model are 4.91 and 5.59%, respectively. Regarding the assessment indicators of brain image segmentation and fusion, the proposed model can provide a 79.55% Jaccard coefficient, a 90.43% Positive Predictive Value (PPV), a 73.09% Sensitivity, and a 75.58% Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC), remarkably better than other models. Acceleration efficiency analysis suggests that the improved AlexNet model is suitable for processing massive brain image data with a higher speedup indicator. To sum up, the constructed model can provide high accuracy, good acceleration efficiency, and excellent segmentation and recognition performances while ensuring low errors, which can provide an experimental basis for brain image feature recognition and digital diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroinformatics: Bioinformatic Analysis of the Proteome in Exosomes Derived From Plasma: Exosomes Involved in Cholesterol Metabolism Process of Patients With Spinal Cord Injury in the Acute Phase</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fninf.2021.662967</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a common but severe disease caused by traffic accidents. Coronary atherosclerotic heart disease (CHD) caused by dyslipidemia is known as the leading cause of death in patients with SCI. However, the quantitative analysis showed that the cholesterol and lipoprotein concentrations in peripheral blood (PB) did not change significantly within 48 h after SCI. Due to the presence of the Blood spinal cord barrier (BSCB), there are only few studies concerning the plasma cholesterol metabolism in the acute phase of SCI. Exosomes have a smaller particle size, which enables them relatively less limitation of BSCB. This study uses exosomes derived from the plasma of 43 patients in the acute phase of SCI and 71 patients in the control group as samples. MS proteomics and bioinformatics analysis found 590 quantifiable proteins, in which 75 proteins were upregulated and 153 proteins were downregulated, and the top 10 differentially expressed proteins are those including downregulating proteins: HIST1H4A, HIST2H3A, HIST2H2BE, HCLS1, S100A9, HIST1H2BM, S100A8, CALM3, YWHAH, and SFN, and upregulating proteins: SERPIND1, C1QB, SPTLC3, IGHV4-28, C4A, IGHV4-38-2, IGHV4-30-2, SLC15A1, C4B, and ACTG2. Enrichment analysis showed that the largest part of proteins was related to cholesterol metabolism among the downregulated proteins. The main components of cholesterol [ApoB-48 and ApoB-100 increased, ApoA-I, ApoA-II, ApoA-IV, ApoC, ApoE, and Apo(a) decreased] were changed in exosomes derived from plasma of patients. ELISA analysis showed that some components were disordered in the acute phase of SCI. These results suggested that the exosomes might be involved in cholesterol metabolism regulation in the acute phase of SCI.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Rate of Force Development as an Indicator of Neuromuscular Fatigue: A Scoping Review</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.701916</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Because rate of force development (RFD) is an emerging outcome measure for the assessment of neuromuscular function in unfatigued conditions, and it represents a valid alternative/complement to the classical evaluation of pure maximal strength, this scoping review aimed to map the available evidence regarding RFD as an indicator of neuromuscular fatigue. Thus, following a general overview of the main studies published on this topic, we arbitrarily compared the amount of neuromuscular fatigue between the “gold standard” measure (maximal voluntary force, MVF) and peak, early (≤100 ms) and late (&amp;gt;100 ms) RFD. Seventy full-text articles were included in the review. The most-common fatiguing exercises were resistance exercises (37% of the studies), endurance exercises/locomotor activities (23%), isokinetic contractions (17%), and simulated/real sport situations (13%). The most widely tested tasks were knee extension (60%) and plantar flexion (10%). The reason (i.e., rationale) for evaluating RFD was lacking in 36% of the studies. On average, the amount of fatigue for MVF (−19%) was comparable to late RFD (−19%) but lower compared to both peak RFD (−25%) and early RFD (−23%). Even if the rationale for evaluating RFD in the fatigued state was often lacking and the specificity between test task and fatiguing exercise characteristics was not always respected in the included studies, RFD seems to be a valid indicator of neuromuscular fatigue. Based on our arbitrary analyses, peak RFD and early phase RFD appear even to be more sensitive to quantify neuromuscular fatigue than MVF and late phase RFD.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.682820</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The auditory system is able to recognize auditory objects and is thought to form predictive models of them even though the acoustic information arriving at our ears is often imperfect, intermixed, or distorted. We investigated implicit regularity extraction for acoustically intact versus disrupted six-tone sound patterns via event-related potentials (ERPs). In an exact-repetition condition, identical patterns were repeated; in two distorted-repetition conditions, one randomly chosen segment in each sound pattern was replaced either by white noise or by a wrong pitch. In a roving-standard paradigm, sound patterns were repeated 1–12 times (standards) in a row before a new pattern (deviant) occurred. The participants were not informed about the roving rule and had to detect rarely occurring loudness changes. Behavioral detectability of pattern changes was assessed in a subsequent behavioral task. Pattern changes (standard vs. deviant) elicited mismatch negativity (MMN) and P3a, and were behaviorally detected above the chance level in all conditions, suggesting that the auditory system extracts regularities despite distortions in the acoustic input. However, MMN and P3a amplitude were decreased by distortions. At the level of MMN, both types of distortions caused similar impairments, suggesting that auditory regularity extraction is largely determined by the stimulus statistics of matching information. At the level of P3a, wrong-pitch distortions caused larger decreases than white-noise distortions. Wrong-pitch distortions likely prevented the engagement of restoration mechanisms and the segregation of disrupted from true pattern segments, causing stronger informational interference with the relevant pattern information.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Objective&lt;p&gt;To explore the different compensatory mechanisms of brain function between the patients with brain dysfunction after acute ischemic stroke (AIS) in the dominant hemisphere and the non-dominant hemisphere based on Resting-state Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (Rs-fMRI).&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;In this trial, 15 healthy subjects (HS) were used as blank controls. In total, 30 hemiplegic patients with middle cerebral artery acute infarction of different dominant hemispheres were divided into the dominant hemisphere group (DH) and the non-dominant hemisphere group (NDH), scanned by a 3.0 T MRI scanner, to obtain the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFF) and regional homogeneity (ReHo) and compare the differences.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Compared with the HS, increased ALFF values in the brain areas, such as the bilateral midbrain, were observed in DH. Meanwhile decreased ReHo values in the brain areas, such as the right postcentral gyrus (BA3), were also observed. Enhanced ALFF values in the brain areas, such as the left BA6, and enhanced ReHo values in the brain areas, such as the left precuneus, were observed in the NDH. The ALFF and ReHo values of the right BA9 and precentral gyrus were both increased. Compared with DH, the NDH group showed lower ALFF values in the left supplementary motor area and lower ReHo values in the right BA10.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;After acute infarction in the middle cerebral artery of the dominant hemisphere, a compensation mechanism is triggered in brain areas of the ipsilateral cortex regulating motor-related pathways, while some brain areas related to cognition, sensation, and motor in the contralateral cortex are suppressed, and the connection with the peripheral brain regions is weakened. After acute infarction in the middle cerebral artery of the non-dominant hemisphere, compensatory activation appears in motor control-related brain areas of the dominant hemisphere. After acute middle cerebral artery infarction in the dominant hemisphere, compared with the non-dominant hemisphere, functional specificity in the bilateral supplementary motor area weakens. After acute middle cerebral artery infarction in different hemispheres, there are hemispheric differences in the compensatory mechanism of brain function.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: A pH-eQTL Interaction at the RIT2–SYT4 Parkinson’s Disease Risk Locus in the Substantia Nigra</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.690632</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Parkinson’s disease causes severe motor and cognitive disabilities that result from the progressive loss of dopamine neurons in the substantia nigra. The rs12456492 variant in the RIT2 gene has been repeatedly associated with increased risk for Parkinson’s disease. From a transcriptomic perspective, a meta-analysis found that RIT2 gene expression is correlated with pH in the human brain. To assess these pH associations in relation to Parkinson’s disease risk, we examined the two datasets that assayed rs12456492, gene expression, and pH in the postmortem human brain. Using the BrainEAC dataset, we replicate the positive correlation between RIT2 gene expression and pH in the human brain (n = 100). Furthermore, we found that the relationship between expression and pH is influenced by rs12456492. When tested across ten brain regions, this interaction is specifically found in the substantia nigra. A similar association was found for the co-localized SYT4 gene. In addition, SYT4 associations are stronger in a combined model with both genes, and the SYT4 interaction appears to be specific to males. In the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) dataset, the pH associations involving rs12456492 and expression of either SYT4 and RIT2 were not seen. This null finding may be due to the short postmortem intervals of the GTEx tissue samples. In the BrainEAC data, we tested the effect of postmortem interval and only observed the interactions in samples with the longer intervals. These previously unknown associations suggest novel roles for rs12456492, RIT2, and SYT4 in the regulation and response to pH in the substantia nigra.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Morphological, Structural, and Functional Networks Highlight the Role of the Cortical-Subcortical Circuit in Individuals With Subjective Cognitive Decline</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.688113</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Subjective cognitive decline (SCD) is considered the earliest stage of the clinical manifestations of the continuous progression of Alzheimer’s Disease (AD). Previous studies have suggested that multimodal brain networks play an important role in the early diagnosis and mechanisms underlying SCD. However, most of the previous studies focused on a single modality, and lacked correlation analysis between different modal biomarkers and brain regions. In order to further explore the specific characteristic of the multimodal brain networks in the stage of SCD, 22 individuals with SCD and 20 matched healthy controls (HCs) were recruited in the present study. We constructed the individual morphological, structural and functional brain networks based on 3D-T1 structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI), diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI), respectively. A t-test was used to select the connections with significant difference, and a multi-kernel support vector machine (MK-SVM) was applied to combine the selected multimodal connections to distinguish SCD from HCs. Moreover, we further identified the consensus connections of brain networks as the most discriminative features to explore the pathological mechanisms and potential biomarkers associated with SCD. Our results shown that the combination of three modal connections using MK-SVM achieved the best classification performance, with an accuracy of 92.68%, sensitivity of 95.00%, and specificity of 90.48%. Furthermore, the consensus connections and hub nodes based on the morphological, structural, and functional networks identified in our study exhibited abnormal cortical-subcortical connections in individuals with SCD. In addition, the functional networks presented more discriminative connections and hubs in the cortical-subcortical regions, and were found to perform better in distinguishing SCD from HCs. Therefore, our findings highlight the role of the cortical-subcortical circuit in individuals with SCD from the perspective of a multimodal brain network, providing potential biomarkers for the diagnosis and prediction of the preclinical stage of AD.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/69975</link>
	<content:encoded>Signals from the pre-T cell receptor and Notch coordinately instruct b-selection of CD4&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;CD8&lt;sup&gt;- &lt;/sup&gt;double negative (DN) thymocytes to generate ab T cells in the thymus. However, how these signals ensure a high-fidelity proteome and safeguard the clonal diversification of the pre-selection TCR repertoire given the considerable translational activity imposed by b-selection is largely unknown. Here, we identify the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-associated degradation (ERAD) machinery as a critical proteostasis checkpoint during b-selection. Expression of the SEL1L-HRD1 complex, the most conserved branch of ERAD, is directly regulated by the transcriptional activity of the Notch intracellular domain. Deletion of &lt;i&gt;Sel1l&lt;/i&gt; impaired DN3 to DN4 thymocyte transition and severely impaired mouse ab T cell development. Mechanistically, &lt;i&gt;Sel1l &lt;/i&gt;deficiency induced unresolved ER stress that triggered thymocyte apoptosis through the PERK pathway. Accordingly, genetically inactivating PERK rescued T cell development from &lt;i&gt;Sel1l&lt;/i&gt;-deficient thymocytes. In contrast, IRE1a/XBP1 pathway was induced as a compensatory adaptation to alleviate &lt;i&gt;Sel1l&lt;/i&gt;-deficiency induced ER stress. Dual loss of &lt;i&gt;Sel1l&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Xbp1&lt;/i&gt; markedly exacerbated the thymic defect. Our study reveals a critical developmental signal controlled proteostasis mechanism that enforces T cell development to ensure a healthy adaptive immunity.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/68089</link>
	<content:encoded>Voltage-gated sodium channels cluster in macromolecular complexes at nodes of Ranvier to promote rapid nerve impulse conduction in vertebrate nerves. Node assembly in peripheral nerves is thought to be initiated at heminodes at the extremities of myelinating Schwann cells and fusion of heminodes results in the establishment of nodes. Here we show that assembly of 'early clusters' of nodal proteins in the murine axonal membrane precedes heminode formation. The Neurofascin (Nfasc) proteins are essential for node assembly, and the formation of early clusters also requires neuronal Nfasc. Early clusters are mobile and their proteins are dynamically recruited by lateral diffusion. They can undergo fusion not only with each other but also with heminodes thus contributing to the development of nodes in peripheral axons. The formation of early clusters constitutes the earliest stage in peripheral node assembly and expands the repertoire of strategies that have evolved to establish these essential structures.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/67400</link>
	<content:encoded>Brain activity during rest displays complex, rapidly evolving patterns in space and time. Structural connections comprising the human connectome are hypothesized to impose constraints on the dynamics of this activity. Here, we use magnetoencephalography (MEG) to quantify the extent to which fast neural dynamics in the human brain are constrained by structural connections inferred from diffusion MRI tractography. We characterize the spatio-temporal unfolding of whole-brain activity at the millisecond scale from source-reconstructed MEG data, estimating the probability that any two brain regions will significantly deviate from baseline activity in consecutive time epochs. We find that the structural connectome relates to, and likely affects, the rapid spreading of neuronal avalanches, evidenced by a significant association between these transition probabilities and structural connectivity strengths (r=0.37, &amp;lt;0.0001). This finding opens new avenues to study the relationship between brain structure and neural dynamics.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Salivary fluid secretion involves an intricate choreography of membrane transporters to result in the trans-epithelial movement of NaCl and water into the acinus lumen. Current models are largely based on experimental observations in enzymatically isolated cells where the Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; signal invariably propagates globally and thus appears ideally suited to activate spatially separated Cl and K channels, present on the apical and basolateral plasma membrane, respectively. We monitored Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; signals and salivary secretion in live mice expressing GCamp6F, following stimulation of the nerves innervating the submandibular gland. Consistent with &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; studies, Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+ &lt;/sup&gt;signals were initiated in the apical endoplasmic reticulum. In marked contrast to &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; data, highly localized trains of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; transients that failed to fully propagate from the apical region were observed. Following stimuli optimum for secretion, large apical-basal gradients were elicited.

	<content:encoded>Bacteriophages can be trapped in the matrix of bacterial biofilms, such that the cells inside them are protected. It is not known whether these phages are still infectious and whether they pose a threat to newly arriving bacteria. Here we address these questions using &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; and its lytic phage T7. Prior work has demonstrated that T7 phages are bound in the outermost curli polymer layers of the &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; biofilm matrix. We show that these phages do remain viable and can kill colonizing cells that are T7-susceptible. If cells colonize a resident biofilm before phages do, we find that they can still be killed by phage exposure if it occurs soon thereafter. However, if colonizing cells are present on the biofilm long enough before phage exposure, they gain phage protection via envelopment within curli-producing clusters of the resident biofilm cells.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/64320</link>
	<content:encoded>Animal genomes are organized into topologically associated domains (TADs). TADs are thought to contribute to gene regulation by facilitating enhancer-promoter (E-P) contacts within a TAD preventing these contacts across TAD borders. However, the absolute difference in contact frequency across TAD boundaries is usually less than two-fold, even though disruptions of TAD borders can change gene expression by ten-fold. Existing models fail to explain this hypersensitive response. Here, we propose a futile cycle model of enhancer-mediated regulation that can exhibit hypersensitivity through bistability and hysteresis. Consistent with recent experiments, this regulation does not exhibit strong correlation between enhancer-promoter contact and promoter activity, even though regulation occurs through contact. Through mathematical analysis and stochastic simulation, we show that this system can create an illusion of enhancer-promoter biochemical specificity and explain the importance of weak TAD boundaries. It also offers a mechanism to reconcile apparently contradictory results from recent global TAD disruption with local TAD boundary deletion experiments. Together, these analyses advance our understanding of cis-regulatory contacts in controlling gene expression, and suggest new experimental directions.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jnr.24848?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Adult female and male C57BL/6N mice voluntarily consumed either a 10‐day course of antimicrobials or a control (tap water). Results showed that the antimicrobials exerted sex‐specific effects on gut microbiome structure, open field behavior, cued aversive learning, and amygdala dendritic spine density (Figure created in https://biorender.com/).

Abstract
Gut microbiota influence numerous aspects of host biology, including brain structure and function. Growing evidence implicates gut microbiota in aversive conditioning and anxiety‐related behaviors, but research has focused almost exclusively on males. To investigate whether effects of gut dysbiosis on aversive learning and memory differ by sex, adult female and male C57BL/6N mice were orally administered a moderate dose of nonabsorbable antimicrobial medications (ATMs: neomycin, bacitracin, and pimaricin) or a control over 10 days. Changes in gut microbiome composition were analyzed by 16S rRNA sequencing. Open field behavior, cued aversive learning, context recall, and cued recall were assessed. Following behavioral testing, the morphology of basolateral amygdala (BLA) principal neuron dendrites and spines was characterized. Results revealed that ATMs induced gut dysbiosis in both sexes, with stronger effects in females. ATMs also exerted sex‐specific effects on behavior and neuroanatomy. Males were more susceptible than females to microbial modulation of locomotor activity and anxiety‐like behavior. Females were more susceptible than males to ATM‐induced impairments in aversive learning and cued recall. Context recall remained intact, as did dendritic structure of BLA principal neurons. However, ATMs exerted a sex‐specific effect on spine density. A second experiment was conducted to isolate the effects of gut perturbation to cued recall. Extinction was also examined. Results revealed no effect of ATMs on cued recall or extinction, suggesting that gut dysbiosis preferentially impacts aversive learning. These data shed new light on how gut microbiota interact with sex to influence aversive conditioning, open field behavior, and BLA dendritic spine architecture.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Abstract
Neurodegenerative movement disorders, such as Huntington's disease (HD), share a progressive and relentless course with increasing motor disability, linked with neuropsychiatric impairment. These diseases exhibit diverse pathophysiological processes and are a topic of intense experimental and clinical research due to the lack of therapeutic options. Restorative therapies are promising approaches with the potential to restore brain circuits. However, there were less compelling results in the few clinical trials. In this review, we discuss cell replacement therapies applied to animal models and HD patients. We thoroughly describe the initial trials using fetal neural tissue transplantation and recent approaches based on alternative cell sources tested in several animal models. Stem cells were shown to generate the desired neuron phenotype and/or provide growth factors to the degenerating host cells. Besides, genetic approaches such as RNA interference and the CRISPR/Cas9 system have been studied in animal models and human‐derived cells. New genetic manipulations have revealed the capability to control or counteract the effect of human gene mutations as described by the use of antisense oligonucleotides in a clinical trial. In HD, innovative strategies are at forefront of human testing and thus other brain genetic diseases may follow similar therapeutic strategies.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jnr.24843?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Using fast‐scan cyclic voltammetry in rat brain slices in vitro, we showed an attenuation of electrically‐stimulated dopamine release by agonists at both GABA‐A (muscimol) and GABA‐B (baclofen) receptors. The attenuation by the baclofen was abolished in slices from animals pretreated with phencyclidine, modelling schizophrenia. 

Abstract
Dopamine signaling in nucleus accumbens (NAc) is modulated by γ‐aminobutyric acid (GABA), acting through GABA‐A and GABA‐B receptors: dysregulation of GABAergic control of dopamine function may be important in behavioral deficits in schizophrenia. We investigated the effect of GABA‐A (muscimol) and GABA‐B (baclofen) receptor agonists on electrically stimulated dopamine release. Furthermore, we explored whether drug‐induced changes were disrupted by pretreatment with phencyclidine, which provides a well‐validated model of schizophrenia. Using brain slices from female rats, fast‐scan cyclic voltammetry was used to measure electrically stimulated dopamine release in NAc shell. Both muscimol and baclofen caused concentration‐dependent attenuation of evoked dopamine release: neither effect was changed by dihydro‐β‐erythroidine, a nicotinic acetylcholine receptor antagonist, or the α‐amino‐3‐hydroxy‐5‐methyl‐4‐isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA)‐type glutamate receptor antagonist, 6‐cyano‐7‐nitroquinoxaline‐2,3‐dione (CNQX), precluding indirect mechanisms using these transmitter systems in the GABAergic actions. In slices taken from rats pretreated with phencyclidine, the attenuation of evoked dopamine release by baclofen was abolished, but the attenuation by muscimol was unaffected. Since phencyclidine pretreatment was followed by drug‐free washout period of at least a week, the drug was not present during recording. Therefore, disruption of GABA‐B modulation of dopamine is due to long‐term functional changes resulting from the treatment, rather than transient changes due to the drug's presence at test. This enduring dysregulation of GABA‐B modulation of accumbal dopamine release provides a plausible mechanism through which GABA dysfunction influences accumbal dopamine leading to behavioral changes seen in schizophrenia and may provide a route for novel therapeutic strategies to treat the condition.</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience Research: Effects of the combination therapy of electric field stimulation and polyethylene glycol in the ex vivo spinal cord of female rats after compression</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jnr.24839?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>In the present study, the effects of electrical field stimulation (EFS) and polyethylene glycol (PEG) were determined in the compression model of ex vivo spinal cords by using a double sucrose gap recording chamber (DSGRC). The effects of the combination therapy are better than those of the individual treatments of PEG and EFS. The methods of establishing ex vivo spinal cord compression model in the DSGRC can be useful in the fundamental and the clinical applications of the spinal cord injury in future.

Abstract
The application of electric field stimulation (EFS) can reduce the cation influx after spinal cord injury. However, regenerated cation influx and reestablished injury potential are observed after EFS. Polyethylene glycol (PEG) is popular as an effective cell membrane fusion agent. This study aims to determine the effects of the combination therapy of EFS and PEG in the ex vivo spinal cord after compression. The ex vivo spinal cords of female rats with compression injury were incubated in a double sucrose gap recording chamber (DSGRC) and randomly divided into the following four groups: (1) compression group: compression only, (2) EFS group: EFS for 15 min, (3) PEG group: PEG treatment for 4 min, and (4) EFS + PEG group: EFS for 15 min and PEG treatment for 4 min. The hematoxylin–eosin staining was performed to measure the necrotic area of the spinal cords. The gap potential was detected, and the area under the curve of the gap potential was calculated. The intracellular cation concentration, membrane permeability, and compound action potential were measured and quantified. Results revealed no significant difference in the necrotic areas among different groups, and the compression model of the ex vivo spinal cord in the DSGRC had high consistency and stability. The combination therapy could attenuate cation inflow, promote cell membrane restoration, and promote the functional recovery of the spinal cord conduction after compression in ex vivo spinal cords.</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience Research: Rapid eye movement sleep deprivation impairs neuronal plasticity and reduces hippocampal neuronal arborization in male albino rats: Noradrenaline is involved in the process</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jnr.24838?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Rapid eye movement sleep deprivation‐associated elevated noradrenaline reduced neuronal‐branching and ‐spines, while synaptic‐length of active zones and ‐protein expressions showed compensatory increase. These changes offer possible cellular level explanation of behavioral effects. Consolidating these and previous findings suggest that REMS plays a crucial role in modulating brain noradrenaline, which affect neuronal plasticity in health and diseases. 

Abstract
Rapid eye movement sleep (REMS) favors brain development and memory, while it is decreased in neurodegenerative diseases. REMS deprivation (REMSD) affects several physiological processes including memory consolidation; however, its detailed mechanism(s) of action was unknown. REMS reduces, while REMSD elevates noradrenaline (NA) level in the brain; the latter induces several deficiencies and disorders, including changes in neuronal cytomorphology and apoptosis. Therefore, we proposed that REMS‐ and REMSD‐associated modulation of NA level might affect neuronal plasticity and affect brain functions. Male albino rats were REMS deprived by flower‐pot method for 6 days, and its effects were compared with home cage and large platform controls as well as post‐REMSD recovered and REMS‐deprived prazosin (α1‐adrenoceptor antagonist)‐treated rats. We observed that REMSD reduced CA1 and CA3 neuronal dendritic length, branching, arborization, and spine density, while length of active zone and expressions of pre‐ as well as post‐synaptic proteins were increased as compared to controls; interestingly, prazosin prevented most of the effects in vivo. Studies on primary culture of neurons from chick embryo brain confirmed that NA at lower concentration(s) induced neuronal branching and arborization, while higher doses were destructive. The findings support our contention that REMSD adversely affects neuronal plasticity, branching, and synaptic scaffold, which explain the underlying cytoarchitectural basis of REMSD‐associated patho‐physio‐behavioral changes. Consolidation of findings of this study along with that of our previous reports suggest that the neuronal disintegration could be due to either withdrawal of direct protective and proliferative role of low dose of NA or indirect effect of high dose of NA or both.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Summary of the main results of the study.

Abstract
Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a debilitating condition, which leads to a permanent loss of functions below the injury site. The events which take place after SCI are characterized by cellular death, release of inhibitory factors, and inflammation. Many therapies have been studied to cure SCI, among them magnetic stimulation aims to reduce the secondary damages in particular by decreasing apoptosis, while, cellular transplantation promotes neuroregeneration by enhancing axonal regrowth. In the present study, we compared individually primary olfactory ensheathing cell (OEC) transplantation and repetitive trans‐spinal magnetic stimulation (rTSMS) and then, we combined these two therapeutic approaches on tissue repair and functional recovery after SCI. To do so, SCIs were performed at Th10 level on female C57BL/6 mice, which were randomized into four groups: SCI, SCI + primary bOECs, SCI + STM, SCI + primary bulbar olfactory ensheathing cells (bOECs) + stimulation (STM). On these animals bioluminescence, immunohistological, and behavioral experiments were performed after SCI. Our results show that rTSMS has beneficial effect on the modulation of spinal scar by reducing fibrosis, demyelination, and microglial cell activation and by increasing the astroglial component of the scar, while, primary bOEC transplantation decreases microglial reactivity. At the opposite, locotronic experiments show that both treatments induce functional recovery. We did not observed any additional effect by combining the two therapeutic approaches. Taken together, the present study indicates that primary bOEC transplantation and rTSMS treatment act through different mechanisms after SCI to induce functional recovery. In our experimental paradigm, the combination of the two therapies does not induce any additional benefit.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Healthy young adults with affective loss (AL) experience showed larger bilateral amygdalar volumes compared to those without AL experiences. Our data suggest that AL engenders alterations in subcortical structures that likely involve processes of chronic stress and fear conditioning, and resemble those observed in general anxiety disorder, childhood maltreatment, and major depressive disorder.

Abstract
Affective loss (AL) (i.e., bereavement, relationship breakup) is a stressful life event leading to a heightened risk of developing a psychiatric disorder, for example, depression and anxiety disorder. These disorders have been associated with altered subcortical brain volumes. Little is known though, how AL in healthy subjects is linked to subcortical volumes. In a study with 196 healthy young adults, we probed the association between AL across the individual entire life span, assessed via the List of Threatening Experiences Questionnaire, and magnetic resonance imaging brain gray matter volumes (a priori selected: bilateral amygdalae, hippocampi, thalami; exploratory analyses: nuclei accumbens, caudate, putamina), segmented by use of volBrain. AL was defined as death of a first‐degree relative/spouse, close relative/friend, and breakup of a marriage or steady relationship. AL was associated with larger bilateral amygdalar volumes and, after taking into account the total number of ALs, with smaller right hippocampal volumes, both irrespective of sex. Exploratory analyses of striatal volumes yielded an association of AL with larger right nucleus accumbens volumes in men, and increased caudate volumes after the loss of a first‐degree relative irrespective of sex. Our data suggest that AL engenders alterations in limbic structures that likely involve processes of chronic stress and amygdala‐ and hippocampus‐dependent fear conditioning, and resemble those observed in general anxiety disorder, childhood maltreatment, and major depressive disorder. Our exploratory findings of striatal volume alterations hint at a modulation of reward processing by AL.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Electrical stimulation after traumatic brain injury increases population of anti‐inflammatory microglia, neural stem cells, and Nestin+ astrocytes.

Abstract
Traumatic brain injury (TBI) by an external physical impact results in compromised brain function via undesired neuronal death. Following the injury, resident and peripheral immune cells, astrocytes, and neural stem cells (NSCs) cooperatively contribute to the recovery of the neuronal function after TBI. However, excessive pro‐inflammatory responses of immune cells, and the disappearance of endogenous NSCs at the injury site during the acute phase of TBI, can exacerbate TBI progression leading to incomplete healing. Therefore, positive outcomes may depend on early interventions to control the injury‐associated cellular milieu in the early phase of injury. Here, we explore electrical stimulation (ES) of the injury site in a rodent model (male Sprague–Dawley rats) to investigate its overall effect on the constituent brain cell phenotype and composition during the acute phase of TBI. Our data showed that a brief ES for 1 hr on day 2 of TBI promoted anti‐inflammatory phenotypes of microglia as assessed by CD206 expression and increased the population of NSCs and Nestin+ astrocytes at 7 days post‐TBI. Also, ES effectively increased the number of viable neurons when compared to the unstimulated control group. Given the salience of microglia and neural stem cells for healing after TBI, our results strongly support the potential benefit of the therapeutic use of ES during the acute phase of TBI to regulate neuroinflammation and to enhance neuroregeneration.</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience Research: Enhanced synaptic properties of the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus after learning a spatial working memory task in adult male mice</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jnr.24833?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Male mice were trained either in the delayed alternation task (fully‐adapted) or the alternation task without any delays (partially‐adapted) for 9 days. The control group remained in their homecage for the same time. The fully adapted group exhibited improved cognitive flexibility, increased long‐term potentiation and dendritic spine density in the prefrontal cortex and increased mature dendritic spine density in the hippocampus, compared ot the other two groups.

Abstract
Working memory (WM) is the ability to hold on‐line and manipulate information. The prefrontal cortex (PFC) is a key brain region involved in WM, while the hippocampus is also involved, particularly, in spatial WM. Although several studies have investigated the neuronal substrates of WM in trained animals, the effects and the mechanisms underlying learning WM tasks have not been explored. In our study, we investigated the effects of learning WM tasks in mice on the function of PFC and hippocampus, by training mice in the delayed alternation task for 9 days (adaptive group). This group was compared to naïve mice (which stayed in their homecage) and mice trained in the alternation procedure only (non‐adaptive). Following training, a cohort of mice (Experiment A) was tested in the left–right discrimination task and the reversal learning task, while another cohort (Experiment B) was tested in the attention set‐shifting task (AST). The adaptive group performed significantly better in the reversal learning task (Experiment A) and AST (Experiment B), compared to non‐adaptive and naïve groups. At the end of the behavioral experiments in Experiment A, field excitatory post‐synaptic potential (fEPSP) recordings were performed in PFC and hippocampal brain slices. The adaptive group had enhanced the long‐term potentiation (LTP) in the PFC, compared to the other groups. In the hippocampus, both the adaptive and the non‐adaptive groups exhibited increased fEPSP compared to the naïve group, but no differences in LTP. In Experiment B, the dendritic spine density was measured, which, in the PFC, was found increased in the adaptive group, compared to the non‐adaptive and naïve groups. In the hippocampus, there was an increase in mature dendritic spine density in the adaptive group, compared to the other two groups. Our results indicate a role for LTP and dendritic spine density in learning WM tasks.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Abstract
Previous findings on the relationship between prediabetes (the precursor stage of type 2 diabetes) and brain health in humans are inconsistent. Thus, this systematic review of cross‐sectional and longitudinal studies aimed to summarize what is currently known about brain deficits in prediabetic adults. Following the PRISMA reporting standards for systematic reviews, we conducted a comprehensive review of peer‐reviewed journal articles published from 2009 to present, focusing on studies that assessed brain volume, structural connectivity, and cerebrovascular health in prediabetic adults and older adults (i.e., 18 years or older). We systematically searched PsychINFO, Scopus, Web of Science, Ovid MEDLINE, CINAHL, and EMbase databases. Quality assessment was based on the NIH Quality Assessment Tool for Observational and Cross‐sectional Studies. In total, 19 studies were included in our review. Results from these studies show that prediabetes may be associated with deficits in brain structure and pathology, however, several studies also refute these findings. Moreover, we identified clear inconsistencies in study methodologies, including diabetes measures and classification, across studies that may account for these conflicting findings.</content:encoded>

This paper describes a data-driven simulation study that explores the relative impact of several low-cost and practical non-pharmaceutical interventions on the spread of COVID-19 in an outpatient hospital dialysis unit. The interventions considered include: (&lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;) voluntary self-isolation of healthcare personnel (HCPs) with symptoms; (&lt;i&gt;ii&lt;/i&gt;) a program of active syndromic surveillance and compulsory isolation of HCPs; (&lt;i&gt;iii&lt;/i&gt;) the use of masks or respirators by patients and HCPs; (&lt;i&gt;iv&lt;/i&gt;) improved social distancing among HCPs; (&lt;i&gt;v&lt;/i&gt;) increased physical separation of dialysis stations; and (&lt;i&gt;vi&lt;/i&gt;) patient isolation combined with preemptive isolation of exposed HCPs. Our simulations show that under conditions that existed prior to the COVID-19 outbreak, extremely high rates of COVID-19 infection can result in a dialysis unit. In simulations under worst-case modeling assumptions, a combination of relatively inexpensive interventions such as requiring surgical masks for everyone, encouraging social distancing between healthcare professionals (HCPs), slightly increasing the physical distance between dialysis stations, and—once the first symptomatic patient is detected—isolating that patient, replacing the HCP having had the most exposure to that patient, and relatively short-term use of N95 respirators by other HCPs can lead to a substantial reduction in both the attack rate and the likelihood of any spread beyond patient zero. For example, in a scenario with &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = 3.0, 60% presymptomatic viral shedding, and a dialysis patient being the infection source, the attack rate falls from 87.8% at baseline to 34.6% with this intervention bundle. Furthermore, the likelihood of having no additional infections increases from 6.2% at baseline to 32.4% with this intervention bundle.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/TjNKLwlyb8U&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

The unprecedented pace of the sequencing of the SARS-CoV-2 virus genomes provides us with unique information about the genetic changes in a single pathogen during ongoing pandemic. By the analysis of close to 200,000 genomes we show that the patterns of the SARS-CoV-2 virus mutations along its genome are closely correlated with the structural and functional features of the encoded proteins. Requirements of foldability of proteins’ 3D structures and the conservation of their key functional regions, such as protein-protein interaction interfaces, are the dominant factors driving evolutionary selection in protein-coding genes. At the same time, avoidance of the host immunity leads to the abundance of mutations in other regions, resulting in high variability of the missense mutation rate along the genome. “Unexplained” peaks and valleys in the mutation rate provide hints on function for yet uncharacterized genomic regions and specific protein structural and functional features they code for. Some of these observations have immediate practical implications for the selection of target regions for PCR-based COVID-19 tests and for evaluating the risk of mutations in epitopes targeted by specific antibodies and vaccine design strategies.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/FFocCiipx0U&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Millions of people worldwide are affected by peripheral nerve injuries (PNI), involving billions of dollars in healthcare costs. Common outcomes for patients include paralysis and loss of sensation, often leading to lifelong pain and disability. Engineered Neural Tissue (EngNT) is being developed as an alternative to the current treatments for large-gap PNIs that show underwhelming functional recovery in many cases. EngNT repair constructs are composed of a stabilised hydrogel cylinder, surrounded by a sheath of material, to mimic the properties of nerve tissue. The technology also enables the spatial seeding of therapeutic cells in the hydrogel to promote nerve regeneration. The identification of mechanisms leading to maximal nerve regeneration and to functional recovery is a central challenge in the design of EngNT repair constructs. Using &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; experiments in isolation is costly and time-consuming, offering a limited insight on the mechanisms underlying the performance of a given repair construct. To bridge this gap, we derive a cell-solute model and apply it to the case of EngNT repair constructs seeded with therapeutic cells which produce vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) under low oxygen conditions to promote vascularisation in the construct. The model comprises a set of coupled non-linear diffusion-reaction equations describing the evolving cell population along with its interactions with oxygen and VEGF fields during the first 24h after transplant into the nerve injury site. This model allows us to evaluate a wide range of repair construct designs (e.g. cell-seeding strategy, sheath material, culture conditions), the idea being that designs performing well over a short timescale could be shortlisted for &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; trials. In particular, our results suggest that seeding cells beyond a certain density threshold is detrimental regardless of the situation considered, opening new avenues for future nerve tissue engineering.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/GrdMqJF-1_Q&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Why are viral genomes so fragile? The bottleneck hypothesis</title>

If they undergo new mutations at each replication cycle, why are RNA viral genomes so fragile, with most mutations being either strongly deleterious or lethal? Here we provide theoretical and numerical evidence for the hypothesis that genetic fragility is partly an evolutionary response to the multiple population bottlenecks experienced by viral populations at various stages of their life cycles. Modelling within-host viral populations as multi-type branching processes, we show that mutational fragility lowers the rate at which Muller’s ratchet clicks and increases the survival probability through multiple bottlenecks. In the context of a susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered epidemiological model, we find that the attack rate of fragile viral strains can exceed that of more robust strains, particularly at low infectivities and high mutation rates. Our findings highlight the importance of demographic events such as transmission bottlenecks in shaping the genetic architecture of viral pathogens.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/pqkcb5TRaNI&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: COVID-19 in schools: Mitigating classroom clusters in the context of variable transmission</title>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Paul Tupper, Caroline Colijn&lt;/p&gt;

Widespread school closures occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic. Because closures are costly and damaging, many jurisdictions have since reopened schools with control measures in place. Early evidence indicated that schools were low risk and children were unlikely to be very infectious, but it is becoming clear that children and youth can acquire and transmit COVID-19 in school settings and that transmission clusters and outbreaks can be large. We describe the contrasting literature on school transmission, and argue that the apparent discrepancy can be reconciled by heterogeneity, or “overdispersion” in transmission, with many exposures yielding little to no risk of onward transmission, but some unfortunate exposures causing sizeable onward transmission. In addition, respiratory viral loads are as high in children and youth as in adults, pre- and asymptomatic transmission occur, and the possibility of aerosol transmission has been established. We use a stochastic individual-based model to find the implications of these combined observations for cluster sizes and control measures. We consider both individual and environment/activity contributions to the transmission rate, as both are known to contribute to variability in transmission. We find that even small heterogeneities in these contributions result in highly variable transmission cluster sizes in the classroom setting, with clusters ranging from 1 to 20 individuals in a class of 25. None of the mitigation protocols we modeled, initiated by a positive test in a symptomatic individual, are able to prevent large transmission clusters unless the transmission rate is low (in which case large clusters do not occur in any case). Among the measures we modeled, only rapid universal monitoring (for example by regular, onsite, pooled testing) accomplished this prevention. We suggest approaches and the rationale for mitigating these larger clusters, even if they are expected to be rare.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/1IUVGX231no&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Place cells, spatially responsive hippocampal cells, provide the neural substrate supporting navigation and spatial memory. Historically most studies of these neurons have used electrophysiological recordings from implanted electrodes but optical methods, measuring intracellular calcium, are becoming increasingly common. Several methods have been proposed as a means to identify place cells based on their calcium activity but there is no common standard and it is unclear how reliable different approaches are. Here we tested four methods that have previously been applied to two-photon hippocampal imaging or electrophysiological data, using both model datasets and real imaging data. These methods use different parameters to identify place cells, including the peak activity in the place field, compared to other locations (the Peak method); the stability of cells’ activity over repeated traversals of an environment (Stability method); a combination of these parameters with the size of the place field (Combination method); and the spatial information held by the cells (Information method). The methods performed differently from each other on both model and real data. In real datasets, vastly different numbers of place cells were identified using the four methods, with little overlap between the populations identified as place cells. Therefore, choice of place cell detection method dramatically affects the number and properties of identified cells. Ultimately, we recommend the Peak method be used in future studies to identify place cell populations, as this method is robust to moderate variations in place field within a session, and makes no inherent assumptions about the spatial information in place fields, unless there is an explicit theoretical reason for detecting cells with more narrowly defined properties.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/AZ8izrj0WEU&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: Axonal injury alters the extracellular glial environment of the axon initial segment (AIS) and allows substantial mitochondrial influx into AIS</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cne.25212?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>ABSTRACT
The axon initial segment (AIS) is structurally and functionally distinct from other regions of the axon, yet alterations in the milieu of the AIS after brain injury have not been well characterized. In this study, we have examined extracellular and intracellular changes in the AIS after hypoglossal nerve injury. Microglial adhesions to the AIS were rarely observed in healthy controls, whereas microglial adhesions to the AIS became apparent in the axonal injury model. Regarding intra‐AIS morphology, we focused on mitochondria because mitochondrial flow into the injured axon appears critical for axonal regeneration. To visualize mitochondria specifically in injured axons, we used Atf3:BAC transgenic mice whose mitochondria were labelled with GFP in response to nerve injury. These mice clearly showed mitochondrial localization in the AIS after nerve injury. To precisely confirm the light microscopic observations, we performed three‐dimensional ultrastructural analysis using focused ion beam/scanning electron microscopy (FIB/SEM). Although the healthy AIS was not surrounded by microglia, tight microglial adhesions with thick processes adhering to the AIS were observed after injury. FIB/SEM simultaneously allowed the observation of mitochondrial localization in the AIS. In the AIS of non‐injured neurons, few mitochondria were observed, whereas mitochondria were abundantly localized in the cell body, axon hillock, and axon. Intriguingly, in the injured AIS, numerous mitochondria were observed throughout the AIS. Taken together, axonal injury changes the extracellular glial environment surrounding the AIS and intracellular mitochondrial localization in the AIS. These changes would be crucial responses, perhaps for injured neurons to regenerate after axonal injury.

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: Ephrin‐A3 Is Required for Tonotopic Map Precision and Auditory Functions in the Mouse Auditory Brainstem</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cne.25213?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>We investigated the molecular basis of tonotopic map formation in the mouse auditory brainstem. We found that the axon guidance cue ephrin‐A3 is differentially expressed along the tonotopic map in the mouse auditory brainstem. Ephrin‐A3 is sufficient to repel growing auditory nerve fibers in vitro. In mice lacking ephrin‐A3, the tonotopic map is degraded in the anteroventral cochlear nucleus, and auditory activation patterns and the ability to discriminate sound frequency changes are also impaired.







Abstract
Tonotopy is a prominent feature of the vertebrate auditory system and forms the basis for sound discrimination, but the molecular mechanism that underlies its formation remains largely elusive. Ephrin/Eph signaling is known to play important roles in axon guidance during topographic mapping in other sensory systems, so we investigated its possible role in the establishment of tonotopy in the mouse cochlear nucleus. We found that ephrin‐A3 molecules are differentially expressed along the tonotopic axis in the cochlear nucleus during innervation. Ephrin‐A3 forward signaling is sufficient to repel auditory nerve fibers in a developmental stage‐dependent manner. In mice lacking ephrin‐A3, the tonotopic map is degraded and isofrequency bands of neuronal activation upon pure tone exposure become imprecise in the anteroventral cochlear nucleus. Ephrin‐A3 mutant mice also exhibit a delayed second wave in auditory brainstem responses upon sound stimuli and impaired detection of sound frequency changes. Our findings establish an essential role for ephrin‐A3 in forming precise tonotopy in the auditory brainstem to ensure accurate sound discrimination.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Neurology Grand Rounds: Changing gears – DBS for dopaminergic desensitization in Parkinson's disease?</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.26164?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>In Parkinson’s disease, both motor and neuropsychiatric complications unfold as consequence of both incremental striatal dopaminergic denervation and intensifying long‐term dopaminergic treatment. Together, this leads to ‘dopaminergic sensitization’ steadily increasing motor and behavioral responses to dopaminergic medication that result in the detrimental sequalae of long‐term dopaminergic treatment. We review the clinical presentations of ‘dopaminergic sensitization’, including rebound off and dyskinesia in the motor domain, and neuropsychiatric fluctuations and behavioral addictions with impulse control disorders and dopamine dysregulation syndrome in the neuropsychiatric domain. We summarize state‐of‐the‐art deep brain stimulation, and show that STN‐DBS allows dopaminergic medication to be tapered, thus supporting dopaminergic desensitization. In this framework, we develop our integrated debatable viewpoint of “changing gears”, i.e., we suggest rethinking earlier use of subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation, when the first clinical signs of dopaminergic motor or neuropsychiatric complications emerge over the steadily progressive disease course. In this sense, subthalamic deep brain stimulation may help reduce longitudinal motor and neuropsychiatric symptom expression – importantly, not by neuroprotection but by supporting dopaminergic desensitization through postoperative medication reduction. Therefore, we suggest considering STN‐DBS early enough before patients encounter potentially irreversible psychosocial consequences of dopaminergic complications, but importantly not before a patient shows first clinical signs of dopaminergic complications. We propose to consider neuropsychiatric dopaminergic complications as a new inclusion criterion in addition to established motor criteria, but this concept will require validation in future clinical trials.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.03372</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Electropolymerization is a bottom-up materials engineering process of micro
and nano-scale that utilizes electrical signals to deposit conducting
dendrites' morphologies by a redox reaction in the liquid phase. It resembles
synaptogenesis in the brain, in which electrical stimulation in the brain
causes the formation of synapses from the cellular neural composites. The
strategy has been recently explored for neuromorphic engineering by
establishing link between the electrical signals and the dendrites' shapes.
Since the geometry of these structures determines their electrochemical
properties, understanding the mechanisms that regulate the polymer assembly
under electrically programmed conditions is an important aspect. In this
manuscript, we simulate this phenomenon using mesoscale simulations, taking
into account the important features of spatial-temporal potential mapping based
on the time-varying signal, the motion of charged particles in the liquid due
to the electric field, and the attachment of particles on the electrode. The
study helps in visualizing the motion of particles in different electrical
conditions, which is not possible to probe experimentally. Consistent with the
experiments, the higher AC frequency of electrical activities favors linear
wire-like growth, while lower frequency leads to more dense and fractal
dendrites growth, and voltage offset leads to asymmetrical growth. We find that
dendrites' shape and growth process systematically depend on particle
concentration and random scattering. We discover that the different dendrites'
architectures are associated with different Laplace and diffusion fields, which
govern the monomers trajectory and subsequent dendrites' growth. Such
unconventional engineering routes could have a variety of applications from
neuromorphic engineering to bottom-up computing strategies.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.03231</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;When humans infer underlying probabilities from stochastic observations, they
exhibit biases and variability that cannot be explained on the basis of sound,
Bayesian manipulations of probability. This is especially salient when beliefs
are updated as a function of sequential observations. We introduce a
theoretical framework in which biases and variability emerge from a trade-off
between Bayesian inference and a cognitive cost of carrying out probabilistic
computations. We consider two forms of the cost: a precision cost and an
unpredictability cost; these penalize beliefs that are less entropic and less
deterministic, respectively. We apply our framework to the case of a Bernoulli
variable: the bias of a coin is inferred from a sequence of coin flips.
Theoretical predictions are qualitatively different depending on the form of
the cost. A precision cost induces overestimation of small probabilities on
average and a limited memory of past observations, and, consequently, a
fluctuating bias. An unpredictability cost induces underestimation of small
probabilities and a fixed bias that remains appreciable even for nearly
unbiased observations. The case of a fair (equiprobable) coin, however, is
singular, with non-trivial and slow fluctuations of the inferred bias. The
proposed framework of costly Bayesian inference illustrates the richness of a
'resource-rational' (or 'bounded-rational') picture of seemingly irrational
human cognition.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.03220</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Multimodal brain networks characterize complex connectivities among different
brain regions from both structural and functional aspects and provide a new
means for mental disease analysis. Recently, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have
become a de facto model for analyzing graph-structured data. However, how to
employ GNNs to extract effective representations from brain networks in
multiple modalities remains rarely explored. Moreover, as brain networks
provide no initial node features, how to design informative node attributes and
leverage edge weights for GNNs to learn is left unsolved. To this end, we
develop a novel multiview GNN for multimodal brain networks. In particular, we
regard each modality as a view for brain networks and employ contrastive
learning for multimodal fusion. Then, we propose a GNN model which takes
advantage of the message passing scheme by propagating messages based on degree
statistics and brain region connectivities. Extensive experiments on two
real-world disease datasets (HIV and Bipolar) demonstrate the effectiveness of
our proposed method over state-of-the-art baselines.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In modern data science, it is often not enough to obtain only a data-driven
model with a good prediction quality. On the contrary, it is more interesting
to understand the properties of the model, which parts could be replaced to
obtain better results. Such questions are unified under machine learning
interpretability questions, which could be considered one of the area's raising
topics. In the paper, we use multi-objective evolutionary optimization for
composite data-driven model learning to obtain the algorithm's desired
properties. It means that whereas one of the apparent objectives is precision,
the other could be chosen as the complexity of the model, robustness, and many
others. The method application is shown on examples of multi-objective learning
of composite models, differential equations, and closed-form algebraic
expressions are unified and form approach for model-agnostic learning of the
interpretable models.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;This paper presents the first wireless and programmable neural stimulator
leveraging magnetoelectric (ME) effects for power and data transfer. Thanks to
low tissue absorption, low misalignment sensitivity and high power transfer
efficiency, the ME effect enables safe delivery of high power levels (a few
milliwatts) at low resonant frequencies (~250 kHz) to mm-sized implants deep
inside the body (30-mm depth). The presented MagNI (Magnetoelectric Neural
Implant) consists of a 1.5-mm$^2$ 180-nm CMOS chip, an in-house built 4x2 mm ME
film, an energy storage capacitor, and on-board electrodes on a flexible
polyimide substrate with a total volume of 8.2 mm$^3$ . The chip with a power
consumption of 23.7 $\mu$W includes robust system control and data recovery
mechanisms under source amplitude variations (1-V variation tolerance). The
system delivers fully-programmable bi-phasic current-controlled stimulation
with patterns covering 0.05-to-1.5-mA amplitude, 64-to-512-$\mu$s pulse width,
and 0-to-200Hz repetition frequency for neurostimulation.

	<title>arXiv: Quantitative Biology: Neurons and Cognition: Embedding digital chronotherapy into medical devices -- A canine case study in controlling status epilepticus through multi-scale rhythmic brain stimulation. (arXiv:2107.02993v1 [eess.SY])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.02993</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Circadian and other physiological rhythms play a key role in both normal
homeostasis and disease processes. Such is the case of circadian and infradian
seizure patterns observed in epilepsy. However, these rhythms are not fully
exploited in the design of active implantable medical devices. In this paper we
explore a new implantable stimulator that implements chronotherapy as a
feedforward input to supplement both open-loop and closed-loop methods. This
integrated algorithm allows for stimulation to be adjusted to the ultradian,
circadian, and infradian patterns observed in patients through slowly-varying
temporal adjustments of stimulation and algorithm sub-components, while also
enabling adaption of stimulation based on immediate physiological needs such as
a breakthrough seizure or change of posture. Embedded physiological sensors in
the stimulator can be used to refine the baseline stimulation circadian pattern
as a &quot;digital zeitgeber&quot;. This algorithmic approach is tested on a canine with
severe drug-resistant idiopathic generalized epilepsy exhibiting a
characteristic diurnal pattern correlated with sleep-wake cycles. Prior to
implantation, the canine's cluster seizures evolved to status epilepticus (SE)
and required emergency pharmacological intervention. The cranially-mounted
system was fully-implanted bilaterally into the centromedian nucleus of the
thalamus. Using combinations of time-based modulation, thalamocortical
rhythm-specific tuning of frequency parameters, and fast-adaptive modes based
on activity, the canine has experienced no further SE events post-implant at
the time of writing (7 months), and no significant clusters are observed any
longer. The use of digitally-enabled chronotherapy as a feedforward signal to
augment adaptive neurostimulators could prove a useful algorithmic method where
sensitivity to temporal patterns are characteristics of the disease state.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Design - especially of physical objects - can be understood as creative acts
solving practical problems. In this paper we describe a biologically-inspired
developmental model as the basis of a generative form-finding system. Using
local interactions between cells in a two-dimensional environment, then
capturing the state of the system at every time step, complex three-dimensional
(3D) forms can be generated by the system. Unlike previous systems, our method
is capable of directly producing 3D printable objects, eliminating intermediate
transformations and manual manipulation often necessary to ensure the 3D form
is printable. We devise fitness measures for optimising 3D printability and
aesthetic complexity and use a Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolutionary
Strategies algorithm (CMA-ES) to find 3D forms that are both aesthetically
interesting and physically printable using fused deposition modelling printing
techniques. We investigate the system's capabilities by evolving and 3D
printing objects at different levels of structural consistency, and assess the
quality of the fitness measures presented to explore the design space of our
generative system. We find that by evolving first for aesthetic complexity,
then evolving for structural consistency until the form is 'just printable',
gives the best results.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Biomimetics has played a key role in the evolution of artificial neural
networks. Thus far, in silico metaphors have been dominated by concepts from
neuroscience and cognitive psychology. In this paper we introduce a different
type of biomimetic model, one that borrows concepts from the immune system, for
designing robust deep neural networks. This immuno-mimetic model leads to a new
computational biology framework for robustification of deep neural networks
against adversarial attacks. Within this Immuno-Net framework we define a
robust adaptive immune-inspired learning system (Immuno-Net RAILS) that
emulates, in silico, the adaptive biological mechanisms of B-cells that are
used to defend a mammalian host against pathogenic attacks. When applied to
image classification tasks on benchmark datasets, we demonstrate that
Immuno-net RAILS results in improvement of as much as 12.5% in adversarial
accuracy of a baseline method, the DkNN-robustified CNN, without appreciable
loss of accuracy on clean data.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.02840</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Adversarial attacks against deep neural networks (DNNs) are continuously
evolving, requiring increasingly powerful defense strategies. We develop a
novel adversarial defense framework inspired by the adaptive immune system: the
Robust Adversarial Immune-inspired Learning System (RAILS). Initializing a
population of exemplars that is balanced across classes, RAILS starts from a
uniform label distribution that encourages diversity and debiases a potentially
corrupted initial condition. RAILS implements an evolutionary optimization
process to adjust the label distribution and achieve specificity towards ground
truth. RAILS displays a tradeoff between robustness (diversity) and accuracy
(specificity), providing a new immune-inspired perspective on adversarial
learning. We empirically validate the benefits of RAILS through several
adversarial image classification experiments on MNIST, SVHN, and CIFAR-10
datasets. For the PGD attack, RAILS is found to improve the robustness over
existing methods by &amp;gt;= 5.62%, 12.5% and 10.32%, respectively, without
appreciable loss of standard accuracy.

	<title>Journal of Neurology: Cerebral mucormycosis: neuroimaging findings and histopathological correlation</title>
	<link>http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s00415-021-10701-8</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec1&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Mucormycosis are infections caused by molds of the order Mucorales. These opportunistic infections are rare, difficult to diagnose, and have a poor prognosis. We aimed to describe common radiographic patterns that may help to diagnose cerebral mucormycosis and search for histopathological correlations with imaging data.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec2&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Methods&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;We studied the radiological findings (CT and MRI) of 18 patients with cerebral mucormycosis and four patients’ histopathological findings.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec3&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;All patients were immunocompromised and/or diabetic. The type of lesions depended on the infection’s dissemination pathway. Hematogenous dissemination lesions were most frequently abscesses (59 lesions), cortical, cortical–subcortical, or in the basal ganglia, with a halo aspect on DWI for lesions larger than 1.6 cm. Only seven lesions were enhanced after contrast injection, with different presentations depending on patients’ immune status. Ischemia and hemorrhagic areas were also seen. Vascular lesions were represented by stenosis and thrombosis. Direct posterior extension lesions were bi-fronto basal hypodensities on CT and restricted diffusion without enhancement on MRI. A particular extension, perineural spread, was seen along the trigeminal nerve. Histopathological analysis found endovascular lesions with destruction of vessel walls by Mucorales, microbleeds around vessels, as well as acute and chronic inflammation.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec4&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;MRI is the critical exam for cerebral mucormycosis. Weak ring enhancement and reduced halo diffusion suggest the diagnosis of fungal infections. Involvement of the frontal lobes should raise suspicion of mucormycosis (along with aspergillosis). The perineural spread can be considered a more specific extension pathway of mucormycosis.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Journal of Neurology: Prevalence of freezing of gait in Parkinson’s disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis</title>
	<link>http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s00415-021-10685-5</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec1&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Background&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Freezing of gait (FOG) is considered one of the most disturbing and least understood symptoms in Parkinson’s disease (PD). The reported prevalence rates of FOG in PD vary widely, ranging from 5 to 85.9%.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec2&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Objective&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to provide a reliable estimate of the average point prevalence of FOG in PD, and we further investigated the study characteristics that might have influenced the estimate.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec3&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Methods&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;We searched different databases to identify studies that report the prevalence of FOG in PD or include relevant raw data for further calculation. The last inclusion date was February 20, 2020. The modified Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS) tool was used for the quality assessment, and articles that met the predefined criteria were included in the quantitative analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec4&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Sixty-six studies were selected from 3392 references. A weighted prevalence of 50.6% in 9072 PD patients experienced FOG based on the special questionnaires (the FOG-Q and NFOG-Q), which was about twice as high as that assessed by the specific items of the clinical rating scales (UPDRS item2.14 and MDS-UPDRS item3.11) (23.2%) or simple clinical questions (25.4%). The weighted prevalence was 37.9% for early stage (≤ 5 years) and 64.6% for advanced stage (≥ 9 years). Moreover, a higher prevalence was calculated from the population-based studies than that in multicenter and single-center studies (47.3% vs. 33.5% and 37.1%, respectively).&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec5&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;The result from this systematic review confirms that FOG is very common in PD and its prevalence is usually underestimated in hospital settings. Importantly, a more accurate assessment of FOG in future clinical researches would involve the use of special FOG scale rather than a single item on a scale or a general clinical inquiry.&lt;/p&gt;

                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec1&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Background and purpose&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Little is known about the angiographic presentation of Moyamoya angiopathy (MMA) in non-Asian patients.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec2&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Methods&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Conventional cerebral angiograms from 155 Caucasian patients diagnosed as MMA were analyzed with respect to extracranial champagne bottle neck sign, Suzuki stages, collateral status, as well as presence of aneurysms and posterior cerebral artery stenosis.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec3&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;In 84 of 155 angiograms, the extracranial carotid artery was visualized, in 65 of them (77.4%), a champagne bottle neck sign was noted. Of the 278 analyzable hemispheres, 13.7%,11.2%, 37.8%, 27.3%, 8.6%, and 1.4% were classified as Suzuki stage I, stage II, stage III, stage IV, stage V, and stage VI, respectively. Among 280 hemispheres, in 53 hemispheres (18.9%) isolated basal collaterals (pathway I) and in 104 hemispheres (37.1%) choroidal and pericallosal collaterals (including basal collaterals, pathway II) were found. In 74 hemispheres (26.4%) ethmoidal collaterals (pathways III), and in 17 hemispheres (6.1%) vault collaterals were visualized. Patients with higher Suzuki stages IV–VI (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = 0.008) and ethmoidal collaterals (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001) suffered more often from cerebral hemorrhage. Transient ischemic attacks occurred more frequently in patients with Suzuki stage I to III (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001). In 10 of 155 patients (6.5%), the angiogram revealed a cerebral aneurysm. In 13 patients (8.4%), a stenotic P1 segment of the posterior cerebral artery was found.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec4&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;This is so far the largest observational study about angiography in Caucasian European MMA patients. A comparison with Asian data indicates similarity of disease in Caucasian and Asian patients.&lt;/p&gt;

                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;To approach the clinical value of MRI with vessel wall imaging (VWI) in patients with central nervous system vasculitis (CNSV), we analyzed patterns of VWI findings both at the time of initial presentation and during follow-up.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec2&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Methods&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Stenoocclusive lesions, vessel-wall contrast enhancement (VW-CE) and diffusion-restricted lesions were analyzed in patients with a diagnosis of CNSV. On available VWI follow-up, progression, regression or stability of VW-CE were evaluated and correlated with the clinical status.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec3&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Of the 45 patients included, 28 exhibited stenoses visible on MR angiography (MRA-positive) while 17 had no stenosis (MRA-negative). VW-CE was found in 2/17 MRA-negative and all MRA-positive patients (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05). 79.1% (53/67) of stenoses showed VW-CE. VW-CE was concentric in 88.3% and eccentric in 11.7% of cases. Diffusion-restricted lesions were found more frequently in relation to stenoses with VW-CE than without VW-CE (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05). 48 VW-CE lesions in 23 patients were followed over a median time of 239.5 days. 13 VW-CE lesions (27.1%) resolved completely, 14 (29.2%) showed partial regression, 17 (35.4%) remained stable and 4 (8.3%) progressed. 22/23 patients received immunosuppressive therapy for the duration of follow-up. Patients with stable or progressive VW-CE were more likely (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05) to have a relapse (14/30 cases) than patients with partial or complete regression of VW-CE (5/25 cases).&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;

                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Concentric VW-CE is a common finding in medium/large-sized vessel CNSV. VW-CE might represent active inflammation in certain situations. However, follow-up VWI findings proved ambiguous as persisting VW-CE despite immunosuppressive therapy and clinical remission was a frequent finding.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Experimental Brain Research: The relationship of agonist muscle single motor unit firing rates and elbow extension limb movement kinematics</title>
	<link>http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s00221-021-06168-8</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;This study explored the relationship between single motor unit (MU) firing rates (FRs) and limb movement velocity during voluntary shortening contractions when accounting for the effects of time course variability between different kinematic comparisons. Single MU trains recorded by intramuscular electromyography in agonist muscles of the anconeus (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 15 participants) and lateral head of the triceps brachii (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 6) were measured during each voluntary shortening contraction. Elbow extension movements consisted of a targeted velocity occurring along the sagittal plane at 25, 50, 75 and 100% of maximum velocity. To account for the effect of differences in contraction time course between parameters, each MU potential was time locked throughout the shortening muscle contraction and linked with separated kinematic parameters of the elbow joint. Across targeted movement velocities, instantaneous FRs were significantly correlated with elbow extension rate of torque development (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;r&lt;/em&gt; = 0.45) and torque (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;r&lt;/em&gt; = 0.40), but FRs were not correlated with velocity (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;r&lt;/em&gt; = 0.03, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; = n.s.). Instead, FRs had a weak indirect relationship with limb movement velocity and position assessed through multiple correlation of the stepwise kinematic progression. Results show that voluntary descending synaptic inputs correspond to a more direct relationship between agonist muscle FRs and torque during shortening contractions, but not velocity. Instead, FRs were indirectly correlated to preparing the magnitude of imminent movement velocity of the lagging limb through torque.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience: Human EEG and Recurrent Neural Networks Exhibit Common Temporal Dynamics During Speech Recognition</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2021.617605</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Recent deep-learning artificial neural networks have shown remarkable success in recognizing natural human speech, however the reasons for their success are not entirely understood. Success of these methods might be because state-of-the-art networks use recurrent layers or dilated convolutional layers that enable the network to use a time-dependent feature space. The importance of time-dependent features in human cortical mechanisms of speech perception, measured by electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG), have also been of particular recent interest. It is possible that recurrent neural networks (RNNs) achieve their success by emulating aspects of cortical dynamics, albeit through very different computational mechanisms. In that case, we should observe commonalities in the temporal dynamics of deep-learning models, particularly in recurrent layers, and brain electrical activity (EEG) during speech perception. We explored this prediction by presenting the same sentences to both human listeners and the Deep Speech RNN and considered the temporal dynamics of the EEG and RNN units for identical sentences. We tested whether the recently discovered phenomenon of envelope phase tracking in the human EEG is also evident in RNN hidden layers. We furthermore predicted that the clustering of dissimilarity between model representations of pairs of stimuli would be similar in both RNN and EEG dynamics. We found that the dynamics of both the recurrent layer of the network and human EEG signals exhibit envelope phase tracking with similar time lags. We also computed the representational distance matrices (RDMs) of brain and network responses to speech stimuli. The model RDMs became more similar to the brain RDM when going from early network layers to later ones, and eventually peaked at the recurrent layer. These results suggest that the Deep Speech RNN captures a representation of temporal features of speech in a manner similar to human brain.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Harnessing the Activation of RIG-I Like Receptors to Inhibit Glioblastoma Tumorigenesis</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2021.710171</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Glioblastoma (GB) is an incurable form of brain malignancy in an adult with a median survival of less than 15 months. The current standard of care, which consists of surgical resection, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy with temozolomide, has been unsuccessful due to an extensive inter- and intra-tumoral genetic and molecular heterogeneity. This aspect represents a serious obstacle for developing alternative therapeutic options for GB. In the last years, immunotherapy has emerged as an effective treatment for a wide range of cancers and several trials have evaluated its effects in GB patients. Unfortunately, clinical outcomes were disappointing particularly because of the presence of tumor immunosuppressive microenvironment. Recently, anti-cancer approaches aimed to improve the expression and the activity of RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs) have emerged. These innovative therapeutic strategies attempt to stimulate both innate and adaptive immune responses against tumor antigens and to promote the apoptosis of cancer cells. Indeed, RLRs are important mediators of the innate immune system by triggering the type I interferon (IFN) response upon recognition of immunostimulatory RNAs. In this mini-review, we discuss the functions of RLRs family members in the control of immune response and we focus on the potential clinical application of RLRs agonists as a promising strategy for GB therapy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Contacts between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and plasma membrane (PM) contain specialized tethering proteins that bind both ER and PM membranes. In excitable cells, ER–PM contacts play an important role in calcium signaling and transferring lipids. Junctophilins are a conserved family of ER–PM tethering proteins. They are predominantly expressed in muscles and neurons and known to simultaneously bind both ER- and PM-localized ion channels. Since their discovery two decades ago, functional studies using junctophilin-deficient animals have provided a deep understanding of their roles in muscles and neurons, including excitation-contraction coupling, store-operated calcium entry (SOCE), and afterhyperpolarization (AHP). In this review, we highlight key findings from mouse, fly, and worm that support evolutionary conservation of junctophilins.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Spatial RNA Sequencing Identifies Robust Markers of Vulnerable and Resistant Human Midbrain Dopamine Neurons and Their Expression in Parkinson’s Disease</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2021.699562</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Defining transcriptional profiles of substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) and ventral tegmental area (VTA) dopamine neurons is critical to understanding their differential vulnerability in Parkinson’s Disease (PD). Here, we determine transcriptomes of human SNc and VTA dopamine neurons using LCM-seq on a large sample cohort. We apply a bootstrapping strategy as sample input to DESeq2 and identify 33 stably differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between these two subpopulations. We also compute a minimal sample size for identification of stable DEGs, which highlights why previous reported profiles from small sample sizes display extensive variability. Network analysis reveal gene interactions unique to each subpopulation and highlight differences in regulation of mitochondrial stability, apoptosis, neuronal survival, cytoskeleton regulation, extracellular matrix modulation as well as synapse integrity, which could explain the relative resilience of VTA dopamine neurons. Analysis of PD tissues showed that while identified stable DEGs can distinguish the subpopulations also in disease, the SNc markers SLIT1 and ATP2A3 were down-regulated and thus appears to be biomarkers of disease. In summary, our study identifies human SNc and VTA marker profiles, which will be instrumental for studies aiming to modulate dopamine neuron resilience and to validate cell identity of stem cell-derived dopamine neurons.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Proper development and plasticity of hippocampal neurons require specific RNA isoforms to be expressed in the right place at the right time. Precise spatiotemporal transcript regulation requires the incorporation of essential regulatory RNA sequences into expressed isoforms. In this review, we describe several RNA processing strategies utilized by hippocampal neurons to regulate the spatiotemporal expression of genes critical to development and plasticity. The works described here demonstrate how the hippocampus is an ideal investigative model for uncovering alternate isoform-specific mechanisms that restrict the expression of transcripts in space and time.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Integrative Neuroscience: Estimating the Minimal Number of Repeated Examinations for Random Responsiveness With the Coma Recovery Scale—Revised as an Example</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnint.2021.685627</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Objective: The aim of this study was to develop a general method to estimate the minimal number of repeated examinations needed to detect patients with random responsiveness, given a limited rate of missed diagnosis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Basic statistical theory was applied to develop the method. As an application, 100 patients with disorders of consciousness (DOC) were assessed with the Coma Recovery Scale–Revised (CRS-R). DOC patients were supposed to be examined for 13 times over 20 days, while anyone who was diagnosed as a minimally conscious state (MCS) in a round would no longer be examined in the subsequent rounds. To test the validation of this method, a series of the stochastic simulation was completed by computer software under all the conditions of possible combinations of three kinds of distributions for p, five values of p, and four sizes of the sample and repeated for 100 times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: A series of formula was developed to estimate the probability of a positive response to a single examination given by a patient and the minimal number of successive examinations needed based on the numbers of patients detected in the first i (i =1, 2,.) rounds of repeated examinations. As applied to the DOC patients assessed with the CRS-R, with a rate of missed diagnosis &amp;lt; 0.0001, the estimate of the minimal number of examinations was six in traumatic brain injury patients and five in non-traumatic brain injury patients. The outcome of the simulation showed that this method performed well under various conditions possibly occurring in practice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interpretation: The method developed in this paper holds in theory and works well in application and stochastic simulation. It could be applied to any other kind of examinations for random responsiveness, not limited to CRS-R for detecting MCS; this should be validated in further research.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Altered Gray Matter Volume and Functional Connectivity in Patients With Vestibular Migraine</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.683802</link>
	<content:encoded>Subjects&lt;p&gt;Vestibular migraine (VM) is the most common neurological cause of vertigo in adults. Previous neuroimaging studies have reported structural alterations in areas associated with pain and vestibular processing. However, it is unclear whether altered resting-state functional connectivity (FC) exists in brain regions with structural abnormalities in patients with VM.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and three-dimensional T1-weighed MRI were performed in 30 patients with VM and 30 healthy controls (HCs). Patients underwent an evaluation of migraine and dizziness severity. FC and voxel-based morphometry (VBM) were performed using DPABI 4.3 and CAT12, respectively. The association between changes in gray matter (GM) volume or FC and clinical parameters was also analyzed.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Compared with HCs, patients with VM demonstrated a reduced GM volume in the bilateral parietoinsular vestibular cortex (PIVC), right middle frontal gyrus, and precuneus. The GM volume of the left PIVC was negatively associated with Dizziness Handicap Inventory score in patients with VM. Taking this region as a seed region, we further observed increased FC between the left primary somatosensory cortex (S1)/inferior parietal lobule (IPL) and the left PIVC in patients with VM.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;FC between regions with a decline in GM volume (the PIVC and S1/IPL) is altered in patients with VM, suggesting that abnormalities in vestibular cortical network could be useful for understanding the underlying mechanisms of VM.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.607908</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Intermediate progenitors of both excitatory and inhibitory neurons, which can replenish neurons in the adult brain, were recently identified. However, the generation of intermediate progenitors of GABAergic inhibitory neurons (IPGNs) has not been studied in detail. Here, we characterized the spatiotemporal distribution of IPGNs in mouse cerebral cortex. IPGNs generated neurons during both embryonic and postnatal stages, but the embryonic IPGNs were more proliferative. Our lineage tracing analyses showed that the embryonically proliferating IPGNs tended to localize to the superficial layers rather than the deep cortical layers at 3 weeks after birth. We also found that embryonic IPGNs derived from the medial and caudal ganglionic eminence (CGE) but more than half of the embryonic IPGNs were derived from the CGE and broadly distributed in the cerebral cortex. Taken together, our data indicate that the broadly located IPGNs during embryonic and postnatal stages exhibit a different proliferative property and layer distribution.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Over the last few decades, neuroimaging techniques have transformed our understanding of the brain and the effect of neurological conditions on brain function. More recently, light-based modalities such as functional near-infrared spectroscopy have gained popularity as tools to study brain function at the bedside. A recent application is to assess residual awareness in patients with disorders of consciousness, as some patients retain awareness albeit lacking all behavioural response to commands. Functional near-infrared spectroscopy can play a vital role in identifying these patients by assessing command-driven brain activity. The goal of this review is to summarise the studies reported on this topic, to discuss the technical and ethical challenges of working with patients with disorders of consciousness, and to outline promising future directions in this field.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Resting State EEG Related to Mathematical Improvement After Spatial Training in Children</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.698367</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Spatial cognitive abilities, including mental rotation (MR) and visuo-spatial working memory (vsWM) are correlated with mathematical performance, and several studies have shown that training of these abilities can enhance mathematical performance. Here, we investigated the behavioral and neural correlates of MR and vsWM training combined with number line (NL) training. Fifty-seven children, aged 6–7, performed 25 days of NL training combined with either vsWM or MR and participated in an Electroencephalography (EEG)-session in school to measure resting state activity and steady-state visual evoked potentials during a vsWM task before and after training. Fifty children, aged 6–7, received usual teaching and acted as a control group. Compared to the control group, both training groups improved on a combined measure of mathematics. Cognitive improvement was specific to the training. Significant pre-post changes in resting state-EEG (rs-EEG), common to both training groups, were found for power as well as for coherence, with no significant differences in rs-EEG-changes between the vsWM and MR groups. Two of the common rs-EEG changes were correlated with mathematical improvement: (1) an increase in coherence between the central frontal lobe and the right parietal lobe in frequencies ranging from 16 to 25 Hz, and (2) an increase in coherence between the left frontal lobe and the right parietal lobe ranging from 23 to 25 Hz. These results indicate that changes in fronto-parietal coherence are related to an increase in mathematical performance, which thus might be a useful measure in further investigations of mathematical interventions in children.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Electrophysiological Proxy of Cognitive Reserve Index</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.690856</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Cognitive reserve (CR) postulates that individual differences in task performance can be attributed to differences in the brain’s ability to recruit additional networks or adopt alternative cognitive strategies. Variables that are descriptive of lifetime experience such as socioeconomic status, educational attainment, and leisure activity are common proxies of CR. CR is mostly studied using neuroimaging techniques such as functional MRI (fMRI) in which case individuals with a higher CR were observed to activate a smaller brain network compared to individuals with a lower CR, when performing a task equally effectively (higher efficiency), and electroencephalography (EEG) where a particular EEG component (P300) that reflects the attention and working memory load, has been targeted. Despite the contribution of multiple factors such as age, education (formal and informal), working, leisure, and household activities in CR formation, most neuroimaging studies, and those using EEG in particular, focus on formal education level only. The aim of the current EEG study is to investigate how the P300 component, evoked in response to an oddball paradigm, is associated with other components of CR besides education, such as working and leisure activity in older adults. We have used hereto a recently introduced CR index questionnaire (CRIq) that quantifies both professional and leisure activities in terms of their cognitive demand and number of years practiced, as well as a data-driven approach for EEG analysis. We observed complex relationships between CRIq subcomponents and P300 characteristics. These results are especially important given that, unlike previous studies, our measurements (P300 and CRIq) do not require active use of the same executive function and, thus, render our results free of a collinearity bias.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Cerebral Visual Impairment (CVI) is an umbrella term which includes abnormalities in visual acuity, or contrast sensitivity or colour; ocular motility; visual field and the conscious and unconscious filtering or processing of visual input. Children with CVI have specific needs and problems relating to their development from infancy to adulthood which can impact on their wellbeing. Recent research indicates the complexities of living with CVI but there remains limited information of the full impact of CVI on families’ everyday lives. The qualitative interviews reported here explored families’ experiences to discover the impact of CVI on all aspects of everyday life. Parents and children (aged 6–18) were invited to participate in semi-structured interviews, either face to face, by phone or video call between January 2018 and February 2019. Topics covered everyday practicalities of living with CVI, focusing on challenges and what worked well at school and home. Interviews were audio-recorded and subject to thematic analysis to look for patterns across the data. Twenty families took part in interviews, with eight children/young people within those families contributing interviews of their own. Four themes were developed from the interviews: (1) Assessment and understanding implications of CVI, (2) Education, (3) Family life, (4) Psychological wellbeing and quality of life. The interviews provide valuable insights into the impact of living with CVI and highlight the need for more awareness of the condition among professionals in both health and education settings.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: A Lightweight Multi-Scale Convolutional Neural Network for P300 Decoding: Analysis of Training Strategies and Uncovering of Network Decision</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.655840</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which automatically learn features from raw data to approximate functions, are being increasingly applied to the end-to-end analysis of electroencephalographic (EEG) signals, especially for decoding brain states in brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). Nevertheless, CNNs introduce a large number of trainable parameters, may require long training times, and lack in interpretability of learned features. The aim of this study is to propose a CNN design for P300 decoding with emphasis on its lightweight design while guaranteeing high performance, on the effects of different training strategies, and on the use of post-hoc techniques to explain network decisions. The proposed design, named MS-EEGNet, learned temporal features in two different timescales (i.e., multi-scale, MS) in an efficient and optimized (in terms of trainable parameters) way, and was validated on three P300 datasets. The CNN was trained using different strategies (within-participant and within-session, within-participant and cross-session, leave-one-subject-out, transfer learning) and was compared with several state-of-the-art (SOA) algorithms. Furthermore, variants of the baseline MS-EEGNet were analyzed to evaluate the impact of different hyper-parameters on performance. Lastly, saliency maps were used to derive representations of the relevant spatio-temporal features that drove CNN decisions. MS-EEGNet was the lightest CNN compared with the tested SOA CNNs, despite its multiple timescales, and significantly outperformed the SOA algorithms. Post-hoc hyper-parameter analysis confirmed the benefits of the innovative aspects of MS-EEGNet. Furthermore, MS-EEGNet did benefit from transfer learning, especially using a low number of training examples, suggesting that the proposed approach could be used in BCIs to accurately decode the P300 event while reducing calibration times. Representations derived from the saliency maps matched the P300 spatio-temporal distribution, further validating the proposed decoding approach. This study, by specifically addressing the aspects of lightweight design, transfer learning, and interpretability, can contribute to advance the development of deep learning algorithms for P300-based BCIs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.628229</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) and neurofeedback (NFB) are two different types of non-invasive neuromodulation techniques, which can modulate brain activity and improve brain functioning. In this review, we compared the current state of knowledge related to the mechanisms of tACS and NFB and their effects on electroencephalogram (EEG) activity (online period/stimulation period) and on aftereffects (offline period/post/stimulation period), including the duration of their persistence and potential behavioral benefits. Since alpha bandwidth has been broadly studied in NFB and in tACS research, the studies of NFB and tACS in modulating alpha bandwidth were selected for comparing the online and offline effects of these two neuromodulation techniques. The factors responsible for variability in the responsiveness of the modulated EEG activity by tACS and NFB were analyzed and compared too. Based on the current literature related to tACS and NFB, it can be concluded that tACS and NFB differ a lot in the mechanisms responsible for their effects on an online EEG activity but they possibly share the common universal mechanisms responsible for the induction of aftereffects in the targeted stimulated EEG band, namely Hebbian and homeostatic plasticity. Many studies of both neuromodulation techniques report the aftereffects connected to the behavioral benefits. The duration of persistence of aftereffects for NFB and tACS is comparable. In relation to the factors influencing responsiveness to tACS and NFB, significantly more types of factors were analyzed in the NFB studies compared to the tACS studies. Several common factors for both tACS and NFB have been already investigated. Based on these outcomes, we propose several new research directions regarding tACS and NFB.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience: Mind Causality: A Computational Neuroscience Approach</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2021.706505</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A neuroscience-based approach has recently been proposed for the relation between the mind and the brain. The proposal is that events at the sub-neuronal, neuronal, and neuronal network levels take place simultaneously to perform a computation that can be described at a high level as a mental state, with content about the world. It is argued that as the processes at the different levels of explanation take place at the same time, they are linked by a non-causal supervenient relationship: causality can best be described in brains as operating within but not between levels. This mind-brain theory allows mental events to be different in kind from the mechanistic events that underlie them; but does not lead one to argue that mental events cause brain events, or vice versa: they are different levels of explanation of the operation of the computational system. Here, some implications are developed. It is proposed that causality, at least as it applies to the brain, should satisfy three conditions. First, interventionist tests for causality must be satisfied. Second, the causally related events should be at the same level of explanation. Third, a temporal order condition must be satisfied, with a suitable time scale in the order of 10 ms (to exclude application to quantum physics; and a cause cannot follow an effect). Next, although it may be useful for different purposes to describe causality involving the mind and brain at the mental level, or at the brain level, it is argued that the brain level may sometimes be more accurate, for sometimes causal accounts at the mental level may arise from confabulation by the mentalee, whereas understanding exactly what computations have occurred in the brain that result in a choice or action will provide the correct causal account for why a choice or action was made. Next, it is argued that possible cases of “downward causation” can be accounted for by a within-levels-of-explanation account of causality. This computational neuroscience approach provides an opportunity to proceed beyond Cartesian dualism and physical reductionism in considering the relations between the mind and the brain.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2021.699658</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Large and small cortexes of the brain are known to contain vast amounts of neurons that interact with one another. They thus form a continuum of active neural networks whose dynamics are yet to be fully understood. One way to model these activities is to use dynamic neural fields which are mathematical models that approximately describe the behavior of these congregations of neurons. These models have been used in neuroinformatics, neuroscience, robotics, and network analysis to understand not only brain functions or brain diseases, but also learning and brain plasticity. In their theoretical forms, they are given as ordinary or partial differential equations with or without diffusion. Many of their mathematical properties are still under-studied. In this paper, we propose to analyze discrete versions dynamic neural fields based on nearly exact discretization schemes techniques. In particular, we will discuss conditions for the stability of nontrivial solutions of these models, based on various types of kernels and corresponding parameters. Monte Carlo simulations are given for illustration.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neural Circuits: The Medial Septum as a Potential Target for Treating Brain Disorders Associated With Oscillopathies</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncir.2021.701080</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The medial septum (MS), as part of the basal forebrain, supports many physiological functions, from sensorimotor integration to cognition. With often reciprocal connections with a broad set of peers at all major divisions of the brain, the MS orchestrates oscillatory neuronal activities throughout the brain. These oscillations are critical in generating sensory and emotional salience, locomotion, maintaining mood, supporting innate anxiety, and governing learning and memory. Accumulating evidence points out that the physiological oscillations under septal influence are frequently disrupted or altered in pathological conditions. Therefore, the MS may be a potential target for treating neurological and psychiatric disorders with abnormal oscillations (oscillopathies) to restore healthy patterns or erase undesired ones. Recent studies have revealed that the patterned stimulation of the MS alleviates symptoms of epilepsy. We discuss here that stimulus timing is a critical determinant of treatment efficacy on multiple time scales. On-demand stimulation may dramatically reduce side effects by not interfering with normal physiological functions. A precise pattern-matched stimulation through adaptive timing governed by the ongoing oscillations is essential to effectively terminate pathological oscillations. The time-targeted strategy for the MS stimulation may provide an effective way of treating multiple disorders including Alzheimer’s disease, anxiety/fear, schizophrenia, and depression, as well as pain.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neural Circuits: Online Learning and Memory of Neural Trajectory Replays for Prefrontal Persistent and Dynamic Representations in the Irregular Asynchronous State</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncir.2021.648538</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In the prefrontal cortex (PFC), higher-order cognitive functions and adaptive flexible behaviors rely on continuous dynamical sequences of spiking activity that constitute neural trajectories in the state space of activity. Neural trajectories subserve diverse representations, from explicit mappings in physical spaces to generalized mappings in the task space, and up to complex abstract transformations such as working memory, decision-making and behavioral planning. Computational models have separately assessed learning and replay of neural trajectories, often using unrealistic learning rules or decoupling simulations for learning from replay. Hence, the question remains open of how neural trajectories are learned, memorized and replayed online, with permanently acting biological plasticity rules. The asynchronous irregular regime characterizing cortical dynamics in awake conditions exerts a major source of disorder that may jeopardize plasticity and replay of locally ordered activity. Here, we show that a recurrent model of local PFC circuitry endowed with realistic synaptic spike timing-dependent plasticity and scaling processes can learn, memorize and replay large-size neural trajectories online under asynchronous irregular dynamics, at regular or fast (sped-up) timescale. Presented trajectories are quickly learned (within seconds) as synaptic engrams in the network, and the model is able to chunk overlapping trajectories presented separately. These trajectory engrams last long-term (dozen hours) and trajectory replays can be triggered over an hour. In turn, we show the conditions under which trajectory engrams and replays preserve asynchronous irregular dynamics in the network. Functionally, spiking activity during trajectory replays at regular timescale accounts for both dynamical coding with temporal tuning in individual neurons, persistent activity at the population level, and large levels of variability consistent with observed cognitive-related PFC dynamics. Together, these results offer a consistent theoretical framework accounting for how neural trajectories can be learned, memorized and replayed in PFC networks circuits to subserve flexible dynamic representations and adaptive behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: NLRP3 Inflammasome: A Potential Target in Isoflurane Pretreatment Alleviates Stroke-Induced Retinal Injury in Diabetes</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.697449</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Ischemic stroke remains a devastating disease which is the leading cause of death worldwide. Visual impairment after stroke is a common complication which may lead to vision loss, greatly impacting life quality of patients. While ischemic stroke is traditionally characterized by a blockage of blood flow to the brain, this may coincide with reduced blood flow to the eye, resulting in retinal ischemia and leading to visual impairment. Diabetes increases the risk of ischemic stroke and induces diabetic retinopathy; the latter may be more sensitive to the ischemic retinal injury. In diabetic status, the underlying mechanism in stroke-induced retinal injury has not been fully clarified. The NLR pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome is an important activator of inflammation, which may play a critical role in catalyzing and forming certain pro-inflammatory cytokines in both cerebral and retinal ischemia. Isoflurane has been demonstrated to inhibit the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome and show neuroprotective effects. In this study, we established a diabetic mouse model and performed the middle cerebral artery occlusion procedure to induce ischemic stroke. Our results revealed that cerebral ischemia-induced retinal injury in the diabetic model. Isoflurane pretreatment alleviated the cerebral and retinal injury after ischemic stroke. Of note, isoflurane pretreatment inhibited the NLRP3 inflammasome activation in the retina, indicating that isoflurane pretreatment may provide substantial retinal protection in stroke-induced retinal injury in diabetes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Alpha-Synuclein as a Biomarker of Parkinson’s Disease: Good, but Not Good Enough</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.702639</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Parkinson’s disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder of the elderly, presenting primarily with symptoms of motor impairment. The disease is diagnosed most commonly by clinical examination with a great degree of accuracy in specialized centers. However, in some cases, non-classical presentations occur when it may be difficult to distinguish the disease from other types of degenerative or non-degenerative movement disorders with overlapping symptoms. The diagnostic difficulty may also arise in patients at the early stage of PD. Thus, a biomarker could help clinicians circumvent such problems and help them monitor the improvement in disease pathology during anti-parkinsonian drug trials. This review first provides a brief overview of PD, emphasizing, in the process, the important role of α-synuclein in the pathogenesis of the disease. Various attempts made by the researchers to develop imaging, genetic, and various biochemical biomarkers for PD are then briefly reviewed to point out the absence of a definitive biomarker for this disorder. In view of the overwhelming importance of α-synuclein in the pathogenesis, a detailed analysis is then made of various studies to establish the biomarker potential of this protein in PD; these studies measured total α-synuclein, oligomeric, and post-translationally modified forms of α-synuclein in cerebrospinal fluid, blood (plasma, serum, erythrocytes, and circulating neuron-specific extracellular vesicles) and saliva in combination with certain other proteins. Multiple studies also examined the accumulation of α-synuclein in various forms in PD in the neural elements in the gut, submandibular glands, skin, and the retina. The measurements of the levels of certain forms of α-synuclein in some of these body fluids or their components or peripheral tissues hold a significant promise in establishing α-synuclein as a definitive biomarker for PD. However, many methodological issues related to detection and quantification of α-synuclein have to be resolved, and larger cross-sectional and follow-up studies with controls and patients of PD, parkinsonian disorders, and non-parkinsonian movement disorders are to be undertaken.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Sevoflurane is one of the most widely used anesthetics for the induction and maintenance of general anesthesia in surgical patients. Sevoflurane treatment may increase the incidence of postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD), and patients with POCD exhibit lower cognitive abilities than before the operation. POCD affects the lives of patients and places an additional burden on patients and their families. Understanding the mechanism of sevoflurane-induced POCD may improve prevention and treatment of POCD. In this paper, we review the diagnosis of POCD, introduce animal models of POCD in clinical research, analyze the possible mechanisms of sevoflurane-induced POCD, and summarize advances in treatment for this condition.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Background&lt;p&gt;Behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD) is a clinically heterogeneous syndrome with high heredity. However, the frequencies of mutations associated with bvFTD have yet to be determined. The aim of the current study was to investigate the frequency of Chinese Han patients harboring genetic bvFTD variants.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;A total of 49 bvFTD patients selected from our frontotemporal lobar degeneration database, including 14 familial cases belonging to eight families and 35 sporadic cases were consecutively recruited from July 2014 to December 2019 at Xuanwu Hospital (Beijing, China). Whole-exome sequencing (WES) was performed and repeat-primed PCR was used to test samples for the C9orf72 hexanucleotide repeat expansion mutation. The frequency of genetic variants and the pathogenicity of the novel variants were analyzed.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Ten pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants were identified in 17 bvFTD patients, including C9orf72 repeat expansions, six previously reported mutations and three novel mutations (MAPT p. R5C, p. D54N, GRN p. P451L). Genetic mutations accounted for 27.9% (12/43) of total cases, 87.5% (7/8) of patients with familial bvFTD, and 14.3% (5/35) with sporadic bvFTD. Pathogenic variants mostly occurred in MAPT gene (20.9%, 9/43), followed by C9orf72 repeat expansions (2.3%, 1/43), GRN gene (2.3%, 1/43) and FUS gene (2.3%, 1/43).&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;There was a high prevalence of genetic variants in Chinese bvFTD patients, highlighting the necessity of genetic testing for bvFTD.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Cholesterol Hydroxylating Cytochrome P450 46A1: From Mechanisms of Action to Clinical Applications</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.696778</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Cholesterol, an essential component of the brain, and its local metabolism are involved in many neurodegenerative diseases. The blood-brain barrier is impermeable to cholesterol; hence, cholesterol homeostasis in the central nervous system represents a balance between in situ biosynthesis and elimination. Cytochrome P450 46A1 (CYP46A1), a central nervous system-specific enzyme, converts cholesterol to 24-hydroxycholesterol, which can freely cross the blood-brain barrier and be degraded in the liver. By the dual action of initiating cholesterol efflux and activating the cholesterol synthesis pathway, CYP46A1 is the key enzyme that ensures brain cholesterol turnover. In humans and mouse models, CYP46A1 activity is altered in Alzheimer’s and Huntington’s diseases, spinocerebellar ataxias, glioblastoma, and autism spectrum disorders. In mouse models, modulations of CYP46A1 activity mitigate the manifestations of Alzheimer’s, Huntington’s, Nieman-Pick type C, and Machao-Joseph (spinocerebellar ataxia type 3) diseases as well as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, epilepsy, glioblastoma, and prion infection. Animal studies revealed that the CYP46A1 activity effects are not limited to cholesterol maintenance but also involve critical cellular pathways, like gene transcription, endocytosis, misfolded protein clearance, vesicular transport, and synaptic transmission. How CYP46A1 can exert central control of such essential brain functions is a pressing question under investigation. The potential therapeutic role of CYP46A1, demonstrated in numerous models of brain disorders, is currently being evaluated in early clinical trials. This review summarizes the past 70 years of research that has led to the identification of CYP46A1 and brain cholesterol homeostasis as powerful therapeutic targets for severe pathologies of the CNS.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.695117</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Background: Consensus is lacking with regard to whether hearing loss is an independent risk factor for dementia. We therefore conducted a meta-analysis to clarify the relationship of hearing loss and dementia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Prospective cohort studies investigating the association between hearing loss and the incidence of dementia in a community-derived population were included by searching electronic databases that included PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane's Library. A random-effects model was adopted to combine the results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Fourteen cohorts including 726,900 participants were analyzed. It was shown that hearing loss was independently associated with dementia [adjusted hazard ratio (HR): 1.59, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.37 to 1.86, p &amp;lt; 0.001; I&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 86%]. Sensitivity analysis sequentially excluding any of the individual studies included showed similar results. Subgroup analysis according to the diagnostic methods for hearing loss, validation strategy for dementia, follow-up duration, and adjustment of apolipoprotein E genotype also showed consistent results (p-values for subgroup differences all &amp;gt; 0.05). Meta-analysis with five studies showed that hearing loss was also connected to higher risk of Alzheimer's disease (adjusted HR: 2.24, 95% CI: 1.32 to 3.79, p = 0.003; I&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 2%).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: Hearing loss may increase the risk of dementia in the adult population. Whether effective treatment for hearing loss could reduce the incidence of dementia should be explored in the future.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.689098</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The glymphatic system (GS) is a novel defined brain-wide perivascular transit network between cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and interstitial solutes that facilitates the clearance of brain metabolic wastes. The complicated network of the GS consists of the periarterial CSF influx pathway, astrocytes-mediated convective transport of fluid and solutes supported by AQP4 water channels, and perivenous efflux pathway. Recent researches indicate that the GS dysfunction is associated with various neurological disorders, including traumatic brain injury, hydrocephalus, epilepsy, migraine, and Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Meanwhile, the GS also plays a pivotal role in the pathophysiological process of stroke, including brain edema, blood–brain barrier (BBB) disruption, immune cell infiltration, neuroinflammation, and neuronal apoptosis. In this review, we illustrated the key anatomical structures of the GS, the relationship between the GS and the meningeal lymphatic system, the interaction between the GS and the BBB, and the crosstalk between astrocytes and other GS cellular components. In addition, we contributed to the current knowledge about the role of the GS in the pathology of stroke and the role of AQP4 in stroke. We further discussed the potential use of the GS in early risk assessment, diagnostics, prognostics, and therapeutics of stroke.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Background&lt;p&gt;Timely diagnosis of ischemic stroke (IS) in the acute phase is extremely vital to achieve proper treatment and good prognosis. In this study, we developed a novel prediction model based on the easily obtained information at initial inspection to assist in the early identification of IS.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;A total of 627 patients with IS and other intracranial hemorrhagic diseases from March 2017 to June 2018 were retrospectively enrolled in the derivation cohort. Based on their demographic information and initial laboratory examination results, the prediction model was constructed. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator algorithm was used to select the important variables to form a laboratory panel. Combined with the demographic variables, multivariate logistic regression was performed for modeling, and the model was encapsulated within a visual and operable smartphone application. The performance of the model was evaluated on an independent validation cohort, formed by 304 prospectively enrolled patients from June 2018 to May 2019, by means of the area under the curve (AUC) and calibration.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;The prediction model showed good discrimination (AUC = 0.916, cut-off = 0.577), calibration, and clinical availability. The performance was reconfirmed in the more complex emergency department. It was encapsulated as the Stroke Diagnosis Aid app for smartphones. The user can obtain the identification result by entering the values of the variables in the graphical user interface of the application.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;The prediction model based on laboratory and demographic variables could serve as a favorable supplementary tool to facilitate complex, time-critical acute stroke identification.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: DNA-RNA hybrids at DSBs interfere with repair by homologous recombination</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/69881</link>
	<content:encoded>DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) are the most harmful DNA lesions and their repair is crucial for cell viability and genome integrity. The readout of DSB repair may depend on whether DSBs occur at transcribed versus non-transcribed regions. Some studies have postulated that DNA-RNA hybrids form at DSBs to promote recombinational repair, but others have challenged this notion. To directly assess whether hybrids formed at DSBs promote or interfere with recombinational repair we have used plasmid and chromosomal-based systems for the analysis of DSB-induced recombination in &lt;i&gt;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&lt;/i&gt;. We show that, as expected, DNA-RNA hybrid formation is stimulated at DSBs. In addition, mutations that promote DNA-RNA hybrid accumulation, such as &lt;i&gt;hpr1∆&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;rnh1∆ rnh201∆&lt;/i&gt;, cause high levels of plasmid loss when DNA breaks are induced at sites that are transcribed. Importantly, we show that high levels or unresolved DNA-RNA hybrids at the breaks interfere with their repair by homologous recombination. This interference is observed for both plasmid and chromosomal recombination and is independent of whether the DSB is generated by endonucleolytic cleavage or by DNA replication. These data support a model in which DNA-RNA hybrids form fortuitously at DNA breaks during transcription, and need to be removed to allow recombinational repair, rather than playing a positive role.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: Crosstalk between repair pathways elicits Double Strand Breaks in alkylated DNA and implications for the action of temozolomide</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/69544</link>
	<content:encoded>Temozolomide (TMZ), a DNA methylating agent, is the primary chemotherapeutic drug used in glioblastoma treatment. TMZ induces mostly N-alkylation adducts (N7-methylguanine and N3-methyladenine) and some O&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;-methylguanine (O&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;mG). Current models propose that during DNA replication, thymine is incorporated across from O&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;mG, promoting a futile cycle of mismatch repair (MMR) that leads to DNA double strand breaks (DSBs). To revisit the mechanism of O&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;mG processing, we reacted plasmid DNA with N-Methyl-N-nitrosourea (MNU), a temozolomide mimic, and incubated it in Xenopus egg-derived extracts. We show that in this system, mismatch repair (MMR) proteins are enriched on MNU-treated DNA and we observe robust, MMR-dependent, repair synthesis. Our evidence also suggests that MMR, initiated at O&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;mG:C sites, is strongly stimulated in &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt; by repair processing of other lesions, such as N-alkylation adducts. Importantly, MNU-treated plasmids display DSBs in extracts, the frequency of which increased linearly with the square of alkylation dose. We suggest that DSBs result from two independent repair processes, one involving MMR at O&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;mG:C sites and the other involving BER acting at a nearby N-alkylation adducts. We propose a new, replication-independent mechanism of action of TMZ, that operates in addition to the well-studied cell cycle dependent mode of action.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/68656</link>
	<content:encoded>Identifying neural substrates of behavior requires defining actions in terms that map onto brain activity. Brain and muscle activity naturally correlate via the output of motor neurons, but apart from simple movements it has been difficult to define behavior in terms of muscle contractions. By mapping the musculature of the pupal fruit fly and comprehensively imaging muscle activation at single cell resolution, we here describe a multiphasic behavioral sequence in &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt;. Our characterization identifies a previously undescribed behavioral phase and permits extraction of major movements by a convolutional neural network. We deconstruct movements into a syllabary of co-active muscles and identify specific syllables that are sensitive to neuromodulatory manipulations. We find that muscle activity shows considerable variability, with sequential increases in stereotypy dependent upon neuromodulation. Our work provides a platform for studying whole-animal behavior, quantifying its variability across multiple spatiotemporal scales, and analyzing its neuromodulatory regulation at cellular resolution.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/68573</link>
	<content:encoded>The PIWI-interacting RNA (piRNA) pathway controls transposon expression in animal germ cells, thereby ensuring genome stability over generations. In &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt;, piRNAs are intergenerationally inherited through the maternal lineage, and this has demonstrated importance in the specification of piRNA source loci and in silencing of &lt;i&gt;I-&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;P-&lt;/i&gt;elements in the germ cells of daughters. Maternally inherited Piwi protein enters somatic nuclei in early embryos prior to zygotic genome activation and persists therein for roughly half of the time required to complete embryonic development. To investigate the role of the piRNA pathway in the embryonic soma, we created a conditionally unstable Piwi protein. This enabled maternally deposited Piwi to be cleared from newly laid embryos within 30 minutes and well ahead of the activation of zygotic transcription. Examination of RNA and protein profiles over time, and correlation with patterns of H3K9me3 deposition, suggests a role for maternally deposited Piwi in attenuating zygotic transposon expression in somatic cells of the developing embryo. In particular, robust deposition of piRNAs targeting &lt;i&gt;roo&lt;/i&gt;, an element whose expression is mainly restricted to embryonic development, results in the deposition of transient heterochromatic marks at active &lt;i&gt;roo&lt;/i&gt; insertions. We hypothesize that &lt;i&gt;roo&lt;/i&gt;, an extremely successful mobile element, may have adopted a lifestyle of expression in the embryonic soma to evade silencing in germ cells.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: The solubility product extends the buffering concept to heterotypic biomolecular condensates.</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/67176</link>
	<content:encoded>Biomolecular condensates are formed by liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) of multivalent molecules. LLPS from a single ('homotypic') constituent is governed by buffering: above a threshold, free monomer concentration is clamped, with all added molecules entering the condensed phase. However, both experiment and theory demonstrate that buffering fails for the concentration dependence of multi-component ('heterotypic') LLPS. Using network-free stochastic modeling, we demonstrate that LLPS can be described by the solubility product constant (Ksp): the product of free monomer concentrations, accounting for the ideal stoichiometries governed by the valencies, displays a threshold above which additional monomers are funneled into large clusters; this reduces to simple buffering for homotypic systems. The Ksp regulates the composition of the dilute phase for a wide range of valencies and stoichiometries. The role of Ksp is further supported by coarse-grained spatial particle simulations. Thus, the solubility product offers a general formulation for the concentration dependence of LLPS.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/64212</link>
	<content:encoded>MGA, a transcription factor and member of the MYC network, is mutated or deleted in a broad spectrum of malignancies. As a critical test of a tumor suppressive role, we inactivated &lt;i&gt;Mga&lt;/i&gt; in two mouse models of non-small cell lung cancer using a CRISPR-based approach. MGA loss significantly accelerated tumor growth in both models and led to de-repression of non-canonical Polycomb ncPRC1.6 targets, including genes involved in metastasis and meiosis. Moreover, MGA deletion in human lung adenocarcinoma lines augmented invasive capabilities. We further show that MGA-MAX, E2F6, and L3MBTL2 co-occupy thousands of promoters and that MGA stabilizes these ncPRC1.6 subunits. Lastly, we report that MGA loss also induces a pro-growth effect in human colon organoids. Our studies establish MGA as a bona fide tumor suppressor in vivo and suggest a tumor suppressive mechanism in adenocarcinomas resulting from widespread transcriptional attenuation of MYC and E2F target genes mediated by MGA-MAX associated with a non-canonical Polycomb complex.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/61459</link>
	<content:encoded>In animals, early-life stress can result in programmed changes in gene expression that can affect their adult phenotype. In &lt;i&gt;C. elegans&lt;/i&gt; nematodes, starvation during the first larval stage promotes entry into a stress-resistant dauer stage until environmental conditions improve. Adults that have experienced dauer (postdauers) retain a memory of early-life starvation that results in gene expression changes and reduced fecundity. Here we show that the endocrine pathways attributed to the regulation of somatic aging in &lt;i&gt;C. elegans&lt;/i&gt; adults lacking a functional germline also regulate the reproductive phenotypes of postdauer adults that experienced early-life starvation. We demonstrate that postdauer adults reallocate fat to benefit progeny at the expense of the parental somatic fat reservoir and exhibit increased longevity compared to controls. Our results also show that the modification of somatic fat stores due to parental starvation memory is inherited in the F&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; generation and may be the result of crosstalk between somatic and reproductive tissues mediated by the germline nuclear RNAi pathway.</content:encoded>

Subjects performed two tasks that involve three types of cognitive conflict. Neural population representations of conflict, error and control demand generalized across tasks and time while at the same time also encoding task specialization. This arose from a combination of single neurons whose responses were task-invariant and non-linearly mixed. Neurons encoding conflict ex-post served to iteratively update internal estimates of control demand as predicted by a Bayesian model. These findings reveal how the MFC representation of evaluative signals are both abstract and specific, suggesting a mechanism for computing and maintaining control demand estimates across trials and tasks.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.07.08.451561v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>N-type voltage-gated calcium (CaV) channels mediate Ca2+ influx at the presynaptic terminals in response to action potential and play vital roles in synaptogenesis, neurotransmitter releasing, and nociceptive transmission. Here we elucidate a cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of the human CaV2.2 complex at resolution of 2.8 [A]. This complex structure reveals how the CaV2.2, {beta}1, and 2{delta}1 subunits are assembled. In our structure, the second voltage-sensing domain (VSD) is stabilized at a resting-state conformation, which is distinct from the other three VSDs of CaV2.2 as well as activated VSDs observed in previous structures of CaV channels. The structure also shows that the intracellular gate formed by S6 helices is closed, and a W-helix from the DII-III linker is determined to act as a blocking-ball that causes closed-state inactivation in CaV2.2. Collectively, our structure provides previously unseen structural insights into fundamental gating mechanisms of CaV channels.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Spatially resolved transcriptomics reveals unique gene signatures associated with human temporal cortical architecture and Alzheimer's pathology</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.07.07.451554v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Alzheimers disease (AD) is pathologically characterized by amyloid beta (A{beta}) plaques, neurofibrillary tangles (tau aggregates), and alterations in microglia, astrocytes and oligodendrocytes. The mesial temporal lobe is a vulnerable brain region in early AD; however, little is known about the transcriptome-scale gene expression in this region and its relation to AD pathology. Here we use the 10x Genomics Visium platform in combination with co-immunofluorescence staining of AD-associated pathological markers to define the spatial topography of gene expression in the middle temporal gyrus (MTG) from both early AD and age- and gender-matched control cases. We identify unique marker genes for six cortical layers and the adjacent white matter as well as gene expression patterns and alterations that showcase unique gene signatures and pathways associated with a range of AD pathology. Also, gene co-expression analyses of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between AD and controls reveal four unique gene modules, which significantly change their co-expression patterns in the presence of variations of AD pathology. Furthermore, we validate the changes of key representative DEGs that are associated with AD pathology in neurons, microglia, astrocytes and oligodendrocytes using single-molecule fluorescent in situ hybridization. In summary, we provide a rich resource for the spatial transcriptomic profile of the human MTG, which will contribute to our understanding of the complex architecture and AD pathology of this vulnerable brain region.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.07.07.451552v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>The integration of somatosensory signals across fingers is essential for dexterous object manipulation. Previous experiments suggest that neural populations in the primary somatosensory cortex (S1) are responsible for this integration. However, the integration process has not been fully characterized, as previous studies have mainly used two-finger stimulation paradigms. Here, we addressed this gap by stimulating all 31 single- and multi-finger combinations. We measured population-wide activity patterns evoked during finger stimulation in human S1 and primary motor cortex (M1) using 7T functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Using multivariate fMRI analyses, we found clear evidence of unique non-linear interactions between fingers. In Brodmann area (BA) 3b, interactions predominantly occurred between pairs of neighboring fingers. In BA 2, however, we found equally strong interactions between spatially distant fingers, as well as interactions between finger triplets and quadruplets, suggesting the presence of rich, non-linear integration of somatosensory information across fingers.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>In the aging brain, many of the alterations underlying cognitive and behavioral decline remain opaque. C. elegans offers a powerful model for aging research, with a simple, well-studied nervous system to further our understanding of the cellular modifications and functional alterations accompanying senescence. We perform multi-neuronal functional imaging across the aged C. elegans nervous system, measuring an age-associated breakdown in system-wide functional organization. At single-cell resolution, we detect shifts in activity dynamics toward higher frequencies, alongside a specific loss of inhibitory signaling occurring early in the aging process. These effects are partially delayed or accelerated by a long-lived or neurodegenerative mutant background, respectively. We further provide evidence that these effects are partially mediated through degradation of GABA signaling, via a pathway involving UNC-2/CaV2 and caspase activation. Data from mammals are consistent with our findings, suggesting a conserved shift in the balance of excitatory/inhibitory signaling with age leading to functional decline.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.07.07.451472v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>To choose between options, we must solve two important binding problems. First, the features that determine each options values must be appropriately combined and kept separate from the corresponding features of other options. Second, options must be associated with the specific actions needed to select them. We hypothesized that the brain solves these problems through use of aligned (for bound dimensions) and orthogonal (for separated dimensions) population subspaces. We examined responses of single neurons in six putative value-coding regions in rhesus macaques performing a risky choice task. In all areas, single neurons encode the features that define the value of each option (stakes and probability) but only very weakly encode value per se. However, the coding dimensions associated with these features are aligned on a single subspace, from which a strong emergent value signal can be read out. Moreover, all six regions use nearly orthogonal subspaces for the left and right options, thereby linking options to their position in space, implementing functional partitioning, and reducing the possibility of misbinding. These results provide a new solution to the neuroeconomic binding problems and suggest that other forms of binding may work through similar principles.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.07.07.451470v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>The Drosophila larva is extensively used as model species in experiments where behavior is recorded via tracking equipment and evaluated via population-level metrics. Although larva locomotion neuromechanics have been studied in detail, no comprehensive model has been proposed for realistic simulations of foraging experiments directly comparable to tracked recordings. Here we present a virtual larva for simulating autonomous behavior, fitting empirical observations of spatial and temporal kinematics. We propose a trilayer behavior-based control architecture for larva foraging, allowing to accommodate increasingly complex behaviors. At the basic level, forward crawling and lateral bending are generated via coupled, interfering oscillatory processes under the control of an intermittency module, alternating between crawling bouts and pauses. Next, navigation in olfactory environments is achieved via active sensing and top-down modulation of bending dynamics by concentration changes. Finally, adaptation at the highest level entails associative learning. We could accurately reproduce behavioral experiments on autonomous free exploration, chemotaxis, and odor preference testing. Inter-individual variability is preserved across virtual larva populations allowing for single animal and population studies. Our model is ideally suited to interface with neural circuit models of sensation, memory formation and retrieval, and spatial navigation.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Neuropsychiatric manifestations are common in both acute and post-acute phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection, but the mechanism of these effects is unknown. Here, we derive human brain organoids with innately developing microglia to investigate the cellular responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection on a single cell level. We find evidence of limited tropism to SARS-CoV-2 for all major cell types and observe extensive neuronal cell death that also include non-infected cells. Single cell transcriptome profiling reveals distinct responses in microglia and astrocytes that share features with cellular states observed in neurodegenerative diseases, includes upregulation of genes with relevance for synaptic stripping, and suggests altered blood brain barrier integrity. Across all cell types, we observe a global translational shut-down as well as altered carbohydrate metabolism and cellular respiration. Together, our findings provide insights into cellular responses of the resident brain immune cells to SARS-CoV-2 and pinpoint mechanisms that may be of relevance for the neuropathological changes observed in COVID-19 patients.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.07.07.451447v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>A variety of mechanosensory neurons are involved in touch, proprioception and pain. Many molecular components of the mechanotransduction machinery subserving these sensory modalities remain to be discovered. Here, we combined recordings of mechanosensitive (MS) currents in mechanosensory neurons with single cell RNA sequencing. In silico combined analysis with a large-scale dataset enables assigning each transcriptome to DRG genetic clusters. Correlation of current signatures with single-cell transcriptomes provides a one-to-one correspondence between mechanoelectric properties and transcriptomically-defined neuronal populations. Moreover, gene expression differential comparison provides a set of candidate genes for mechanotransduction complexes. Piezo2 was expectedly found to be enriched in rapidly adapting MS current-expressing neurons, whereas Tmem120a and Tmem150c, thought to mediate slow-type MS currents, were uniformly expressed in all neuron subtypes, irrespective of their mechano-phenotype. Further knock-down experiments disqualified them as mediating DRG MS currents. This dataset constitutes an open-resource to explore further the cell-type-specific determinants of mechanosensory properties.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Astrocytic calcium dynamics have been implicated in the encoding of sensory information, and modulating them has been shown to impact behavior. However, real-time calcium activity of astrocytes in the hippocampus of awake mice has never been investigated. We used 2-photon microscopy to chronically image CA1 astrocytes as mice ran in familiar or novel virtual environments and obtained water rewards. We found that astrocytes exhibit persistent ramping activity towards the reward location in a familiar environment, but not in a novel one. Using linear decoders, we could precisely predict the location of the mouse in a familiar environment from astrocyte activity alone. We could not do the same in the novel environment, suggesting astrocyte spatial activity is experience dependent. This is the first indication that astrocytes can encode location in spatial contexts, thereby extending their known computational capabilities, and their role in cognitive functions.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: A DEEP LEARNING APPROACH TO ESTIMATING INITIAL CONDITIONS OF BRAIN NETWORK MODELS IN REFERENCE TO MEASURED FMRI DATA</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.07.07.451431v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Brain Network Models (BNMs) are a family of dynamical systems that simulate whole brain activity using neural mass models to represent local activity in different brain regions that influence each other via a global structural network. Research has been interested in using these network models to explain measured whole brain activity measured via resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI). Properties computed over longer periods of simulated and measured data such as average functional connectivity (FC), have shown to be comparable with similar properties estimated from measured rs-fMRI data. While this shows that these network models have similar properties over the dynamical landscape, it is unclear how well simulated trajectories compare with empirical trajectories on a timepoint-by-timepoint basis. Previous studies have shown that BNMs are able to produce relevant features at shorter timescales, but analysis of short-term trajectories or transient dynamics as defined by synchronized predictions from BNM made at the same timescale as the collected data has not yet been conducted. Relevant neural processes exist in the time frame of measurements and are often used in task fMRI studies to understand neural responses to behavioral cues. Therefore, it is important to investigate how much of these dynamics are captured by our current brain simulations. To test the nature of BNMs short term trajectories against observed data, we utilize a deep learning technique known as Neural ODE that based on an observed sequence of fMRI measurements, estimates the initial conditions such that the BNMs simulation is synchronized to produce the closest trajectory relative to the observed data. We test to see if the parameterization of a specific well studied BNM, the Firing Rate Model, calculated by maximizing its accuracy in reproducing observed short term trajectories matches with the parameterized model that produces the best average long-term metrics. Our results show that such an agreement between parameterization using long and short simulation analysis exists if also considering other factors such as the sensitivity in accuracy with relative to changes in structural connectivity. Therefore, we conclude that there is evidence that by solving for initial conditions, BNMs can be simulated in a meaningful way when comparing against measured data trajectories, although future studies are necessary to establish how BNM activity relate to behavioral variables or to faster neural processes during this time period.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.07.07.451428v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Perceptual decisions are typically accompanied by a subjective sense of (un)certainty. There is robust evidence that observers have access to a reliable estimate of their own uncertainty and can judge the validity of their perceptual decisions. However, there is still a debate to what extent these meta-perceptual judgements underly a common mechanism that can monitor perceptual decisions across different sensory modalities. It has been suggested that perceptual confidence can be evaluated on an abstract scale that is not only task-independent but also modality-independent. We aimed to scrutinize these findings by measuring visual contrast and tactile vibration discrimination thresholds in a confidence forced-choice task. A total of 56 participants took part in our study. We determined thresholds for trials in which perceptual decisions were chosen as confident and for those that were declined as confident. Confidence comparisons were made between perceptual decisions either within the visual and tactile modality, respectively, or across both modalities. Furthermore, we assessed executive functions to explore a possible link between cognitive control and meta-perceptual capacities. We found that perceptual performance was a good predictor of confidence judgments and that the threshold modulation was similarly pronounced in both modalities. Most importantly, participants compared their perceptual confidence across visual and tactile decisions with the same precision as within the same modality. Cognitive control capacities were not related to meta-perceptual performance. In conclusion, our findings corroborate that perceptual uncertainty can be accessed on an abstract scale, allowing for confidence comparisons across sensory modalities.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.07.07.451419v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Visual perception is not only shaped by sensitivity, but also by confidence, i.e. the ability to estimate the accuracy of a visual decision. There is robust evidence that younger observers have access to a reliable measure of their own uncertainty when making visual decisions. This metacognitive ability might be challenged during aging due to increasing sensory noise and decreasing cognitive control resources. We investigated age effects on visual confidence using a confidence forced-choice paradigm. We determined discrimination thresholds for trials in which perceptual judgements were indicated as confident and for those in which they were declined as confident. Younger adults (19-38 years) showed significantly lower discrimination thresholds than older adults (60-78 years). In both age groups, perceptual performance was linked to confidence judgements, but overall results suggest reduced confidence efficiency in older adults. However, we observed substantial variability of confidence effects across all particpants. This variability was closely linked to individual differences in cognitive control capacities, i.e. executive function. Our findings provide evidence for age-related differences in meta-perceptual efficiency that present a specific challenge to perceptual performance in old age. We propose that these age effects are primarily mediated by cognitive control resources, supporting their crucial role for metacognitive efficiency.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.07.07.451407v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Object constancy is one of the most crucial mechanisms of the human visual system enabling viewpoint invariant object recognition. However, the neuronal foundations of object constancy are widely unknown. Research has shown that the ventral visual stream is involved in processing of various kinds of object stimuli and that several regions along the ventral stream are possibly sensitive to the orientation of an object in space. To systematically address the question of viewpoint sensitive object perception, we conducted a study with stroke patients as well as an fMRI experiment with healthy participants applying object stimuli in several spatial orientations, for example in typical and atypical viewing conditions. In the fMRI experiment, we found stronger BOLD signals and above-chance classification accuracies for objects presented in atypical viewing conditions in fusiform face sensitive and lateral occipito-temporal object preferring areas. In the behavioral patient study, we observed that lesions of the right fusiform gyrus were associated with lower performance in object recognition for atypical views. The complementary results from both experiments emphasize the contributions of fusiform and lateral-occipital areas to visual object constancy and indicate that visual object constancy is particularly enabled through increased neuronal activity and specific activation patterns for objects in demanding viewing conditions.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>The insular cortex is an important anatomical integration hub and can serve as a suitable model for exploring structural-functional relationships. In this study, we examined structural and functional magnetic resonance correspondence via the diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) profiles of the insular cortex and its mapping with functional networks (FNs) across the brain. We explored these associations primarily by using a data-driven method to independently estimate the structural-functional connectivity in the human insular cortex system. Data were obtained from the Human Connectome Project comprising 108 resting-state functional magnetic resonance neuroimaging (fMRI) and DTI. Brain networks were acquired and defined according to the seven Yeo FNs. In general, we observed moderate to high association between the structural and functional mapping results of three distinct insular subregions: the posterior insula (sensorimotor: RSFC, DTI = 50%, 72%, respectively), dorsal anterior insula (ventral attention: RSFC, DTI = 83%, 83%, respectively), and ventral anterior insula (frontoparietal: RSFC, DTI = 42%, 89%, respectively). We also examined the cognitive and behavioral domains associated with these three insular subregions using meta-analytic topic mapping and found cognitive and behavioral relations to affective processes, reflecting the core properties of the cytoarchitecture. In sum, given the core role of the insula in the human brain, our findings on the correspondence of the insular cortex system between DTI and RSFC mappings provide a novel approach and insight for clinical researchers to detect dysfunctional brain organization in various neurological disorders.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>As a common neurological disease, epilepsy has been extensively studied. Efforts have been made on rodent and other animal models to reveal the pathogenic mechanisms of epilepsy and develop new drugs as treatment . However, the features of current epilepsy models cannot fully mimic different kinds of epilepsy in human, asking for non-human primates models of epilepsy. The common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) is a New World monkey that is widely used to study brain function. Here, we show a natural marmoset model of generalized epilepsy. In this unique marmoset family, generalized epilepsy was successfully induced by handling operation in some individuals. We mapped the marmoset family with handling-sensitive epilepsy and found that epileptic marmoset had an autosomal dominant genetic predisposition. Those marmosets were more sensitive to epilepsy inducers pentylenetetrazol (PTZ). By electrocorticogram (ECoG) recording, we detected epileptic discharge in marmoset with history of seizures. However, there was no significant change in the overall structure of epileptic marmoset brain. In summary, we report a family of marmosets with generalized seizures induced by handling operation. This epileptic marmoset family provides insights to better understand the mechanism of generalized epilepsy and helps to develop new therapeutic methods.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.07.07.451360v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>The insular cortex has been identified as a promising target in brain-based therapies for Tobacco Use Disorder, and has three major sub-regions (ventral anterior, dorsal anterior, and posterior) that serve distinct functional networks. How these subregions and associated networks contribute to nicotine dependence has not been well understood, and therefore was the subject of this study. Forty-seven individuals (24 women; 18-45 years old) who smoked cigarettes daily rated their dependence using the Fagerstrom Test for Nicotine Dependence (FTND), abstained from smoking overnight (~12 h), and underwent resting-state functional MRI. Correlations between dependence and resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) of the major insular sub-regions were evaluated using whole-brain-corrected voxel-wise analyses and post-hoc region-of-interest (ROI) analyses. Dependence was analyzed both as a unitary (FTND total score) and bivariate construct - two FTND factors (&quot;morning smoking&quot; and &quot;daytime smoking&quot;). Dependence was negatively correlated with connectivity of both the right dorsal and left ventral anterior insula with the left precuneus, and with connectivity of the left posterior insula to the left putamen. In post-hoc analyses, dependence correlated negatively with connectivity between all anterior insula subregions and the left precuneus, and with bilateral posterior insula connectivity with the left posterior putamen. The latter finding was driven by &quot;daytime smoking&quot;. These results suggest an anterior-posterior distinction in functional insular networks associated with different dimensions of nicotine dependence, with greater dependence linked to weaker connectivity. They may inform therapeutic approaches involving brain stimulation that may elicit differential clinical outcomes depending on the insular subnetwork targeted.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.07.07.451307v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Animals have evolved sophisticated visual circuits to solve a vital inference problem: detecting whether or not a visual signal corresponds to an object on a collision course. Such events are detected by specific circuits sensitive to visual looming, or objects increasing in size. Various computational models have been developed for these circuits, but how the collision-detection inference problem itself shapes the computational structures of these circuits remains unknown. Here, inspired by the distinctive structures of LPLC2 neurons in the visual system of Drosophila, we build an anatomically-constrained shallow neural network model and train it to identify visual signals that correspond to impending collisions. Surprisingly, the optimization arrives at two distinct, opposing solutions, only one of which matches the actual dendritic weighting of LPLC2 neurons. The LPLC2-like solutions are favored when a population of units is trained on the task, but not when units are trained in isolation. The trained model reproduces experimentally observed LPLC2 neuron responses for many stimuli, and reproduces canonical tuning of loom sensitive neurons, even though the model are never trained on neural data. These results show that LPLC2 neuron properties and tuning are predicted by optimizing an anatomically-constrained neural network to detect impending collisions.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Humans can robustly interact with external dynamics that are not yet fully understood. This work presents a hierarchical architecture of semi-autonomous controllers that can control the redundant kinematics of the limbs during dynamic interaction, even with delays comparable to the nervous system. The postural optimisation is performed via a non-linear mapping of the system kineto-static properties, and it allows independent control of the end-effector trajectories and the arms stiffness. The proposed architecture is tested in a physical simulator in the absence of gravity, presence of gravity, and with gravity plus a viscous force field. The data indicates that the architecture can generalise the motor strategies to different environmental conditions. The experiments also verify the existence of a deterministic solution to the task-separation principle. The architecture is also compatible with Optimal Feedback Control and the Passive Motion Paradigm. The existence of a deterministic mapping implies that this task could be encoded in neural networks capable of generalisation of motion strategies to affine tasks.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Itch, particularly chronic itch, negatively impacts patients' physical, social, and psychological well-being, leading to deterioration in their quality of life. Limited understanding of itch mechanisms hinders the development of effective antipruritic treatments.TRPV4, a multimodally activated nonselective cation channel, has been detected in sensory neurons of dorsal root and trigeminal ganglion (DRG, TG) and skin cells (e.g. keratinocytes, mast cells, and macrophages). Recent evidence from experimental and clinical relevant studies has implicated that TRPV4 in skin cells plays an important role in both acute and chronic itch. In contrast, little is known whether TRPV4 in sensory neurons directly contributes to scratching behaviors. Here we used sensory neuron-Trpv4 conditional knockout (cKO) mice to address this question. Our results showed that TRPV4 in sensory neurons contributes to scratching behavior evoked by histaminergic (histamine and 48/80) and partial histaminergic (5-HT), but not non-histaminergic (SLIGRL and CQ) pruritogens. Moreover, we observed that TRPV4 in sensory neurons is required for dry skin, but not allergic contact dermatitis, -associated chronic itch. These findings suggest that neuronal-TRPV4 might be specific for some forms of acute and chronic itch.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.07.06.451330v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>One of the most significant Parkinson's disease (PD) risk variants, rs356182, is located at the PD-associated locus near the alpha-synuclein encoding gene, SNCA. SNCA-proximal variants, including rs356182, are thought to function in PD via allele-specific regulatory effects on SNCA expression. However, this interpretation discounts the complex activity of genetic enhancers and possible nonconical effects of alpha-synuclein. Here we investigate a novel risk mechanism for rs356182. We use CRISPR-Cas9 in LUHMES cells, a model for dopaminergic neurons, to generate precise hemizygous lesions at rs356182. The PD-protective (A/-), PD-risk (G/-), and WT (A/G) strains are differentiated into dopaminergic neurons then compared transcriptionally and morphologically. We observe effects not typically ascribed to SNCA; hundreds of differentially expressed genes associated with neuronal differentiation and axonogenesis. Together, the data implicate a risk mechanism for rs356182 in which the risk-allele (G) is associated with abnormal neuronal differentiation. We speculate the disease-relevant effect originates as a diminished population of DA neurons leading to the predisposition for PD later in life.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Visual stimulus-induced narrowband gamma oscillations in electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings have been recently shown to be compromised in subjects with Mild Cognitive Impairment or Alzheimer's Disease (AD), suggesting that gamma could be an inexpensive and easily accessible biomarker for early diagnosis of AD. However, to use gamma as a biomarker, its characteristics should remain consistent across multiple recordings, even when separated over long intervals. Previous magnetoencephalography studies in young subjects have reported that gamma power remains consistent over recordings separated by a few weeks to months. Here, we assessed the consistency of slow (20-35 Hz) and fast gamma (36-66 Hz) oscillations induced by static full-field gratings in male (N=20) and female (N=20) elderly subjects (&amp;gt;49 years) in EEG recordings separated by more than a year and tested the consistency in the magnitude of gamma power, its temporal evolution and spectral profile. Gamma oscillations had distinct spectral and temporal characteristics across subjects, which remained consistent across recordings (average intraclass correlation, ICC of ~0.7). Alpha oscillations (8-12 Hz) and steady-state-visually-evoked-potentials (SSVEPs) were also found to be reliable. We further tested how EEG features can be used to identify two recordings as belonging to the same versus different subjects and found high classifier performance (area under ROC curve of ~0.89), with the temporal evolution of slow gamma and spectral profile emerging as the most informative features. These results suggest that EEG gamma oscillations are reliable across recordings and can be used as a clinical biomarker as well as a potential tool for subject identification.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>The cumulative load of genetic predisposition, early life adversity (ELA) and lifestyle shapes the prevalence of psychiatric disorders. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the human FKBP5 gene were shown to modulate disease risk. To enable investigation of disease-related SNPs in behaviorally relevant context, we generated humanized mouse lines carrying either the risk (AT) or the resiliency (CG) allele of the rs1360780 locus and exposed litters of these mice to maternal separation. Behavioral and physiological aspects of their adult stress responsiveness displayed interactions of genotype, early life condition and sex. In humanized females carrying the CG- but not the AT-allele, ELA led to altered HPA-axis functioning, exploratory behavior and sociability. These changes correlated with differential expression of genes in the hypothalamus, where synaptic transmission, metabolism, and circadian entrainment pathways were deregulated. Our data suggest an integrative role of FKBP5 in shaping the sex-specific outcome of ELA in adulthood.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Humans learn about the environment either directly by interacting with it or indirectly by seeking information about it from social sources such as conspecifics. The degree of confidence in the information obtained through either route should determine the impact that it has on adapting and changing behaviour. We examined whether and how behavioural and neural computations differ during non-social learning as opposed to learning from social sources. Trial-wise confidence judgments about non-social and social information sources offered a window into this learning process. Despite matching exactly the statistical features of social and non-social conditions, confidence judgments were more accurate and less changeable when they were made about social as opposed to non-social information sources. In addition to subjective reports of confidence, differences were also apparent in the Bayesian estimates of participants' subjective beliefs. Univariate activity in dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) and posterior temporo-parietal junction (pTPJ) more closely tracked confidence about social as opposed to non-social information sources. In addition, the multivariate patterns of activity in the same areas encoded identities of social information sources compared to non-social information sources.</content:encoded>

Parkinson’s disease motor symptoms are associated with an increase in subthalamic nucleus beta band oscillatory power. However, these oscillations are phasic, and there is a growing body of evidence suggesting that beta burst duration may be of critical importance to motor symptoms. This makes insights into the dynamics of beta bursting generation valuable, in particular to refine closed-loop deep brain stimulation in Parkinson’s disease. In this study, we ask the question “Can average burst duration reveal how dynamics change between the ON and OFF medication states?”. Our analysis of local field potentials from the subthalamic nucleus demonstrates using linear surrogates that the system generating beta oscillations is more likely to act in a non-linear regime OFF medication and that the change in a non-linearity measure is correlated with motor impairment. In addition, we pinpoint the simplest dynamical changes that could be responsible for changes in the temporal patterning of beta oscillations between medication states by fitting to data biologically inspired models, and simpler beta envelope models. Finally, we show that the non-linearity can be directly extracted from average burst duration profiles under the assumption of constant noise in envelope models. This reveals that average burst duration profiles provide a window into burst dynamics, which may underlie the success of burst duration as a biomarker. In summary, we demonstrate a relationship between average burst duration profiles, dynamics of the system generating beta oscillations, and motor impairment, which puts us in a better position to understand the pathology and improve therapies such as deep brain stimulation.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/uJQRWE_LliA&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Elementary integrate-and-fire process underlies pulse amplitudes in Electrodermal activity</title>

Electrodermal activity (EDA) is a direct read-out of sweat-induced changes in the skin’s electrical conductance. Sympathetically-mediated pulsatile changes in skin sweat measured as EDA resemble an integrate-and-fire process, which yields an inverse Gaussian model as the inter-pulse interval distribution. We have previously showed that the inter-pulse intervals in EDA follow an inverse Gaussian distribution. However, the statistical structure of EDA pulse amplitudes has not yet been characterized based on the physiology. Expanding upon the integrate-and-fire nature of sweat glands, we hypothesized that the amplitude of an EDA pulse is proportional to the excess volume of sweat produced compared to what is required to just reach the surface of the skin. We modeled this as the difference of two inverse Gaussian models for each pulse, one which represents the time required to produce just enough sweat to rise to the surface of the skin and one which represents the time requires to produce the actual volume of sweat. We proposed and tested a series of four simplifications of our hypothesis, ranging from a single difference of inverse Gaussians to a single simple inverse Gaussian. We also tested four additional models for comparison, including the lognormal and gamma distributions. All models were tested on EDA data from two subject cohorts, 11 healthy volunteers during 1 hour of quiet wakefulness and a different set of 11 healthy volunteers during approximately 3 hours of controlled propofol sedation. All four models represent simplifications of our hypothesis outperformed other models across all 22 subjects, as measured by Akaike’s Information Criterion (AIC), as well as mean and maximum distance from the diagonal on a quantile-quantile plot. Our broader model set of four simplifications offered a useful framework to enhance further statistical descriptions of EDA pulse amplitudes. Some of the simplifications prioritize fit near the mode of the distribution, while others prioritize fit near the tail. With this new insight, we can summarize the physiologically-relevant amplitude information in EDA with at most four parameters. Our findings establish that physiologically based probability models provide parsimonious and accurate description of temporal and amplitude characteristics in EDA.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/GW57OrusAVY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Locusts are short horned grasshoppers that exhibit two behaviour types depending on their local population density. These are: solitarious, where they will actively avoid other locusts, and gregarious where they will seek them out. It is in this gregarious state that locusts can form massive and destructive flying swarms or plagues. However, these swarms are usually preceded by the aggregation of juvenile wingless locust nymphs. In this paper we attempt to understand how the distribution of food resources affect the group formation process. We do this by introducing a multi-population partial differential equation model that includes non-local locust interactions, local locust and food interactions, and gregarisation. Our results suggest that, food acts to increase the maximum density of locust groups, lowers the percentage of the population that needs to be gregarious for group formation, and decreases both the required density of locusts and time for group formation around an optimal food width. Finally, by looking at foraging efficiency within the numerical experiments we find that there exists a foraging advantage to being gregarious.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/9wALipy9tlE&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

During development, signal-regulated transcription factors (TFs) act as basal repressors and upon signalling through morphogens or cell-to-cell signalling shift to activators, mediating precise and transient responses. Conversely, at the final steps of neuron specification, terminal selector TFs directly initiate and maintain neuron-type specific gene expression through enduring functions as activators. &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;elegans&lt;/i&gt; contains 3 types of serotonin synthesising neurons that share the expression of the serotonin biosynthesis pathway genes but not of other effector genes. Here, we find an unconventional role for LAG-1, the signal-regulated TF mediator of the Notch pathway, as terminal selector for the ADF serotonergic chemosensory neuron, but not for other serotonergic neuron types. Regulatory regions of ADF effector genes contain functional LAG-1 binding sites that mediate activation but not basal repression. &lt;i&gt;lag-1&lt;/i&gt; mutants show broad defects in ADF effector genes activation, and LAG-1 is required to maintain ADF cell fate and functions throughout life. Unexpectedly, contrary to reported basal repression state for LAG-1 prior to Notch receptor activation, gene expression activation in the ADF neuron by LAG-1 does not require Notch signalling, demonstrating a default activator state for LAG-1 independent of Notch. We hypothesise that the enduring activity of terminal selectors on target genes required uncoupling LAG-1 activating role from receiving the transient Notch signalling.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/DCDTa1kmEI8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Leukotriene B&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (LTB&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) is secreted by chemotactic neutrophils, forming a secondary gradient that amplifies the reach of primary chemoattractants. This strategy increases the recruitment range for neutrophils and is important during inflammation. Here, we show that LTB&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and its synthesizing enzymes localize to intracellular multivesicular bodies, which, upon stimulation, release their content as exosomes. Purified exosomes can activate resting neutrophils and elicit chemotactic activity in an LTB&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; receptor-dependent manner. Inhibition of exosome release leads to loss of directional motility with concomitant loss of LTB&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; release. Our findings establish that the exosomal pool of LTB&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; acts in an autocrine fashion to sensitize neutrophils towards the primary chemoattractant, and in a paracrine fashion to mediate the recruitment of neighboring neutrophils in trans. We envision that this mechanism is used by other signals to foster communication between cells in harsh extracellular environments.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/3JgRrfCI9GI&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience Research: Sensory perception of environmental cues as a modulator of aging and neurodegeneration: Insights from Caenorhabditis elegans</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jnr.24910?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
Environmental stimuli such as temperature, food, and smell significantly influence the physiology and behavior of animals. Animals are differentially adapted to maintain their internal body functions in response to varied environmental conditions. These external cues are sensed by specialized neurons which are a part of the chemosensory and thermosensory systems. The inability to respond correctly to varied environmental conditions may result in compromised bodily functions and reduced longevity. For example, the ability to sense food is derived from the integrated action of olfactory and gustatory systems. The damage to the olfactory system will affect our decision of palatable food items which in turn can affect the response of the gustatory system, ultimately causing abnormal feeding habits. Recent studies have provided evidence that aging is regulated by sensory perception of environment. Aging is one of the most common causes of various neurodegenerative diseases and the perception of environmental cues is also found to regulate the development of neurodegenerative phenotype in several animal models. However, specific molecular signaling pathways involved in the process are not completely understood. The research conducted on one of the best‐studied animal models of aging, Caenorhabditis elegans, has demonstrated multiple examples of gene–environment interaction at the neuronal level which affects life span. The findings may be useful to identify the key neuronal regulators of aging and age‐related diseases in humans owing to conserved core metabolic and aging pathways from worms to humans.</content:encoded>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: MRI Correlates of Multiple Sclerosis Immunopathological Patterns</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.26163?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Objective
Histology reveals that early active multiple sclerosis lesions can be classified into three main inter‐individually heterogeneous but intra‐individually stable immunopathological patterns of active demyelination (patterns I‐III). In pattern I and II, a T‐cell‐ and macrophage‐associated demyelination is suggested, with pattern II only showing signs of a humoral immune response. Pattern III is characterized by inflammatory lesions with an oligodendrocyte degeneration. Patterns suggest pathogenic heterogeneity, and we postulated that they have distinct MRI correlates that may serve as biomarkers.


Methods
We evaluated in an international collaborative retrospective cohort study the MRI lesion characteristics of 789 conventional pre‐biopsy and follow‐up MRIs in relation to their histopathologically classified immunpathological patterns (n=161 subjects) and lesion edge features (n=112).


Results
A strong association of a ring‐like enhancement and a hypointense T2‐weighted rim (T2w rim) with pattern I and II, but not pattern III, was observed. Only a fraction of pattern III patients showed a ring‐like enhancement, and this was always atypical. Ring‐like enhancement and T2w rims colocalized, and ring‐like enhancement showed a strong association with macrophage rims as shown by histology. A strong concordance of MRI lesion characteristics, meaning that different lesions showed the same features, was found when comparing biopsied and non‐biopsied lesions at a given time point, indicating lesion homogeneity within individual patients.


Interpretation
We provide robust evidence that MRI characteristics reflect specific morphological features of MS immunopatterns and that ring‐like enhancement and T2w hypointense rims might serve as a valuable non‐invasive biomarker to differentiate pathological patterns of demyelination.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Automated annotation of epileptiform burden and its association with outcomes</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.26161?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Objective
To determine the dose‐response relation between epileptiform activity burden and outcomes in acutely ill patients.


Methods
Single center retrospective analysis of 1967 neurologic, medical and surgical patients who underwent &amp;gt; 16 hours of continuous EEG between 2011‐2017. We developed an AI algorithm to annotate 11.02 terabytes of EEG and quantify epileptiform activity burden within 72 hours of recording. We evaluated burden in 1) the first 24 hours of recording, 2) the 12‐hr epoch with highest burden (peak burden), and 3) cumulative through the first 72 hours of monitoring. Machine learning was applied to estimate the effect of epileptiform burden on outcome. Outcome measure was discharge modified Rankin Scale, dichotomized as good (0‐4) vs. poor (5‐6).


Results
Peak epileptiform burden was independently associated with poor outcomes (p&amp;lt;0.0001). Other independent associations included age, APACHE II, seizure on presentation, and diagnosis of hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy. Model calibration error was calculated across three strata based on the time interval between last EEG measurement (up to 72 hours of monitoring) and discharge: 1) &amp;lt; 5 days between last measurement and discharge: 0.0941 [CI 0.0706, 0.1191); 5‐10 days between last measurement and discharge: 0.0946 [CI 0.0631, 0.1290]; &amp;gt; 10 days between last measurement and discharge: 0.0998 [CI 0.0698, 0.1335]. After adjusting for covariates, increase in peak epileptiform activity burden from 0% to 100% increased the probability of poor outcome by 35%.


Interpretation
Automated measurement of peak epileptiform activity burden affords a convenient, consistent, and quantifiable target for future multi‐center randomized trials investigating whether suppressing epileptiform activity improves outcomes.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In neuroimaging, MRI tissue properties characterize underlying neurobiology,
provide quantitative biomarkers for neurological disease detection and
analysis, and can be used to synthesize arbitrary MRI contrasts. Estimating
tissue properties from a single scan session using a protocol available on all
clinical scanners promises to reduce scan time and cost, enable quantitative
analysis in routine clinical scans and provide scan-independent biomarkers of
disease. However, existing tissue properties estimation methods - most often
$\mathbf{T_1}$ relaxation, $\mathbf{T_2^*}$ relaxation, and proton density
($\mathbf{PD}$) - require data from multiple scan sessions and cannot estimate
all properties from a single clinically available MRI protocol such as the
multiecho MRI scan. In addition, the widespread use of non-standard acquisition
parameters across clinical imaging sites require estimation methods that can
generalize across varying scanner parameters. However, existing learning
methods are acquisition protocol specific and cannot estimate from heterogenous
clinical data from different imaging sites. In this work we propose an
unsupervised deep-learning strategy that employs MRI physics to estimate all
three tissue properties from a single multiecho MRI scan session, and
generalizes across varying acquisition parameters. The proposed strategy
optimizes accurate synthesis of new MRI contrasts from estimated latent tissue
properties, enabling unsupervised training, we also employ random acquisition
parameters during training to achieve acquisition generalization. We provide
the first demonstration of estimating all tissue properties from a single
multiecho scan session. We demonstrate improved accuracy and generalizability
for tissue property estimation and MRI synthesis.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Spike-timing-dependent plasticity(STDP) is a biological process in which the
precise order and timing of neuronal spikes affect the degree of synaptic
modification. While there have been numerous research focusing on the role of
STDP in neural coding, the functional implications of STDP at the macroscopic
level in the brain have not been fully explored yet. In this work, we propose a
neurodynamical model based on STDP that renders storage and retrieval of a
group of associative memories. We showed that the function of STDP at the
macroscopic level is to form a &quot;memory plane&quot; in the neural state space which
dynamically encodes high dimensional data. We derived the analytic relation
between the input, the memory plane, and the induced macroscopic neural
oscillations around the memory plane. Such plane produces a limit cycle in
reaction to a similar memory cue, which can be used for retrieval of the
original input.

	<title>arXiv: Computer Science: Neural and Evolutionary Computing: An Evolutionary Algorithm for Task Scheduling in Crowdsourced Software Development. (arXiv:2107.02202v1 [cs.SE])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.02202</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The complexity of software tasks and the uncertainty of crowd developer
behaviors make it challenging to plan crowdsourced software development (CSD)
projects. In a competitive crowdsourcing marketplace, competition for shared
worker resources from multiple simultaneously open tasks adds another layer of
uncertainty to the potential outcomes of software crowdsourcing. These factors
lead to the need for supporting CSD managers with automated scheduling to
improve the visibility and predictability of crowdsourcing processes and
outcomes. To that end, this paper proposes an evolutionary algorithm-based task
scheduling method for crowdsourced software development. The proposed
evolutionary scheduling method uses a multiobjective genetic algorithm to
recommend an optimal task start date. The method uses three fitness functions,
based on project duration, task similarity, and task failure prediction,
respectively. The task failure fitness function uses a neural network to
predict the probability of task failure with respect to a specific task start
date. The proposed method then recommends the best tasks start dates for the
project as a whole and each individual task so as to achieve the lowest project
failure ratio. Experimental results on 4 projects demonstrate that the proposed
method has the potential to reduce project duration by a factor of 33-78%.

	<title>arXiv: Computer Science: Neural and Evolutionary Computing: Bayesian Algorithm Execution: Estimating Computable Properties of Black-box Functions Using Mutual Information. (arXiv:2104.09460v2 [stat.ML] UPDATED)</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2104.09460</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In many real-world problems, we want to infer some property of an expensive
black-box function $f$, given a budget of $T$ function evaluations. One example
is budget constrained global optimization of $f$, for which Bayesian
optimization is a popular method. Other properties of interest include local
optima, level sets, integrals, or graph-structured information induced by $f$.
Often, we can find an algorithm $\mathcal{A}$ to compute the desired property,
but it may require far more than $T$ queries to execute. Given such an
$\mathcal{A}$, and a prior distribution over $f$, we refer to the problem of
inferring the output of $\mathcal{A}$ using $T$ evaluations as Bayesian
Algorithm Execution (BAX). To tackle this problem, we present a procedure,
InfoBAX, that sequentially chooses queries that maximize mutual information
with respect to the algorithm's output. Applying this to Dijkstra's algorithm,
for instance, we infer shortest paths in synthetic and real-world graphs with
black-box edge costs. Using evolution strategies, we yield variants of Bayesian
optimization that target local, rather than global, optima. On these problems,
InfoBAX uses up to 500 times fewer queries to $f$ than required by the original
algorithm. Our method is closely connected to other Bayesian optimal
experimental design procedures such as entropy search methods and optimal
sensor placement using Gaussian processes.

	<content:encoded>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Cerebellar transcranial direct current stimulation (c-tDCS) enhances motor skill acquisition and motor learning in young and old adults. Since the cerebellum is involved in the pathophysiology of Parkinson’s disease (PD), c-tDCS may represent an intervention with potential to improve motor learning in PD. The primary purpose was to determine the influence of long-term application of c-tDCS on motor learning in PD. The secondary purpose was to examine the influence of long-term application of c-tDCS on transfer of motor learning in PD. The study was a randomized, double-blind, SHAM-controlled, between-subjects design. Twenty-one participants with PD were allocated to either a tDCS group or a SHAM stimulation group. Participants completed 9 practice sessions over a 2-week period that involved extensive practice of an isometric pinch grip task (PGT) and a rapid arm movement task (AMT). These practice tasks were performed over a 25-min period concurrent with either anodal c-tDCS or SHAM stimulation. A set of transfer tasks that included clinical rating scales, manual dexterity tests, and lower extremity assessments were quantified in &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus internal-ref refid-sec5&quot;&gt;Test sessions&lt;/span&gt; at Baseline, 1, 14, and 28 days after the end of practice (EOP). There were no significant differences between the c-tDCS and SHAM groups as indicated by performance changes in the practice and transfer tasks from Baseline to the 3 EOP Tests. The findings indicate that long-term application of c-tDCS does not improve motor learning or transfer of motor learning to a greater extent than practice alone in PD.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>The Cerebellum: Neurocognitive Changes in Spinocerebellar Ataxia Type 3: A Systematic Review with a Narrative Design</title>

	<content:encoded>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3), the commonest dominantly inherited ataxia worldwide, is characterized by disruption in the cerebellar-cerebral and striatal-cortical networks. Findings on SCA3-associated cognitive impairments are mixed. The classification models, tests and scoring systems used, language, culture, ataxia severity, and depressive symptoms are all potential confounders in neuropsychological assessments and may have contributed to the heterogeneity of the neurocognitive profile of SCA3. We conducted a systematic review of studies evaluating neurocognitive function in SCA3 patients. Of 1304 articles identified, 15 articles met the eligibility criteria. All articles were of excellent quality according to the National Institutes of Health quality assessment tool for case–control studies. In line with the disrupted cerebellar-cerebral and striatal-cortical networks in SCA3, this systematic review found that the neurocognitive profile of SCA3 is characterized by a core impairment of executive function that affects processes such as nonverbal reasoning, executive aspects of language, and recall. Conversely, neurocognitive domains such as general intelligence, verbal reasoning, semantic aspect of language, attention/processing speed, recognition, and visuospatial perception and construction are relatively preserved. This review highlights the importance of evaluating neurocognitive function in SCA3 patients. Considering the negative impact of cognitive and affective impairment on quality of life, this review points to the profound impairments that existing or future treatments should prioritize.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Binaural beat (BB) is a promising technique for memory improvement in elderly or people with neurological conditions. However, the related modulation of cortical networks followed by behavioral changes has not been investigated. The objective of this study is to establish a relationship between BB oscillatory brain activity evoked by stimulation and a behavioral response in a short term memory task. Three Groups A, B, and C of 20 participants each received alpha (10 Hz), beta (14 Hz), and gamma (30 Hz) BB, respectively, for 15 min. Their EEG was recorded in pre, during, and post BB states. Participants performed a digit span test before and after a BB session. A significant increase in the cognitive score was found only for Group A while a significant decrease in reaction time was noted for Groups A and C. Group A had a significant decrease of theta and increase of alpha power, and a significant increase of theta and decrease of gamma imaginary coherence (ICH) post BB. Group C had a significant increase in theta and gamma power accompanied by the increase of theta and gamma ICH post BB. The effectiveness of BB depends on the frequency of stimulation. A putative neural mechanism involves an increase in theta ICH in parieto-frontal and interhemispheric frontal networks.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 Receptor Agonist Ameliorates 1-Methyl-4-Phenyl-1,2,3,6-Tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) Neurotoxicity Through Enhancing Mitophagy Flux and Reducing α-Synuclein and Oxidative Stress</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2021.697440</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Parkinson disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease without known disease modification therapy to slow down disease progression. This disease has pathological features of Lewy bodies with α-synuclein aggregation being the major component and selective dopaminergic neuronal loss over the substantia nigra. Although the exact etiology is still unknown, mitochondrial dysfunction has been shown to be central in PD pathophysiology. Type 2 diabetes mellitus has recently been connected to PD, and anti-diabetic drugs, such as glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs), have been shown to possess neuroprotective effects in PD animal models. The GLP-1RA liraglutide is currently under a phase 2 clinical trial to measure its effect on motor and non-motor symptoms in PD patients. In this study, we used an acute 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) mouse model of PD to test the possible mechanism of the GLP-1RA liraglutide in the pathogenesis of PD. We show that the neurobehavioral and motor dysfunction caused by the mitochondrial complex I inhibitor, MPTP, can be partially reversed by liraglutide. The GLP-1RA can protect mice from apoptosis of substantia nigra neurons induced by MPTP. MPTP treatment led to imbalanced mitochondrial fusion and fission dynamics, altered mitochondrial morphology, impeded autophagy flux, increased α-synuclein accumulation, and elevated oxidative stress. Specifically, the normalizing of mitochondrial fusion-fission dynamic-related proteins and enhancement of autophagy flux after administration of liraglutide is associated with improving neuronal survival. This suggests that GLP-1RAs may provide potential beneficial effects for PD caused by mitochondrial dysfunction through improvement of mitochondrial morphology balance and enhancing damaged organelle degradation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: CircRtn4 Acts as the Sponge of miR-24-3p to Promote Neurite Growth by Regulating CHD5</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2021.660429</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are covalently closed single-stranded RNA molecules. After derived from precursor mRNA back-splicing, circRNAs play important roles in many biological processes. Recently, it was shown that several circRNAs were enriched in the mammalian brain with unclear functions. The expression of circRtn4 in the mouse brain was increased with the differentiation of primary neurons. In our study, knockdown of circRtn4 inhibited neurite growth, while overexpression of circRtn4 significantly increased neurite length. By dual-luciferase reporter assay and RNA antisense purification assay, circRtn4 was identified as a miRNA sponge for miR-24-3p. Moreover, knockdown of miR-24-3p increased neurite length, while overexpression of miR-24-3p significantly inhibited neurite growth. Furthermore, CHD5 was confirmed to be a downstream target gene of miR-24-3p. And CHD5 silence counteracted the positive effect of circRtn4 overexpression on neurite growth. In conclusion, circRtn4 may act as the sponge for miR-24-3p to promote neurite growth by regulating CHD5.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.680572</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Pathogenic variants in SPG11 are the most frequent cause of autosomal recessive complicated hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP). In addition to spastic paraplegia caused by corticospinal degeneration, most patients are significantly affected by progressive weakness and muscle wasting due to alpha motor neuron (MN) degeneration. Mitochondria play a crucial role in neuronal health, and mitochondrial deficits were reported in other types of HSPs. To investigate whether mitochondrial pathology is present in SPG11, we differentiated MNs from induced pluripotent stem cells derived from SPG11 patients and controls. MN derived from human embryonic stem cells and an isogenic SPG11 knockout line were also included in the study. Morphological analysis of mitochondria in the MN soma versus neurites revealed specific alterations of mitochondrial morphology within SPG11 neurites, but not within the soma. In addition, impaired mitochondrial membrane potential was indicative of mitochondrial dysfunction. Moreover, we reveal neuritic aggregates further supporting neurite pathology in SPG11. Correspondingly, using a microfluidic-based MN culture system, we demonstrate that axonal mitochondrial transport was significantly impaired in SPG11. Overall, our data demonstrate that alterations in morphology, function, and transport of mitochondria are an important feature of axonal dysfunction in SPG11 MNs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Three-Dimensional Convolutional Autoencoder Extracts Features of Structural Brain Images With a “Diagnostic Label-Free” Approach: Application to Schizophrenia Datasets</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.652987</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;There has been increasing interest in performing psychiatric brain imaging studies using deep learning. However, most studies in this field disregard three-dimensional (3D) spatial information and targeted disease discrimination, without considering the genetic and clinical heterogeneity of psychiatric disorders. The purpose of this study was to investigate the efficacy of a 3D convolutional autoencoder (3D-CAE) for extracting features related to psychiatric disorders without diagnostic labels. The network was trained using a Kyoto University dataset including 82 patients with schizophrenia (SZ) and 90 healthy subjects (HS) and was evaluated using Center for Biomedical Research Excellence (COBRE) datasets, including 71 SZ patients and 71 HS. We created 16 3D-CAE models with different channels and convolutions to explore the effective range of hyperparameters for psychiatric brain imaging. The number of blocks containing two convolutional layers and one pooling layer was set, ranging from 1 block to 4 blocks. The number of channels in the extraction layer varied from 1, 4, 16, and 32 channels. The proposed 3D-CAEs were successfully reproduced into 3D structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans with sufficiently low errors. In addition, the features extracted using 3D-CAE retained the relation to clinical information. We explored the appropriate hyperparameter range of 3D-CAE, and it was suggested that a model with 3 blocks may be related to extracting features for predicting the dose of medication and symptom severity in schizophrenia.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Rhythmic Neural Patterns During Empathy to Vicarious Pain: Beyond the Affective-Cognitive Empathy Dichotomy</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.708107</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Empathy is often split into an affective facet for embodied simulation or sometimes sensorial processing, and a cognitive facet for mentalizing and perspective-taking. However, a recent neurophenomenological framework proposes a graded view on empathy (i.e., “Graded Empathy”) that extends this dichotomy and considers multiple levels while integrating complex neural patterns and representations of subjective experience. In the current magnetoencephalography study, we conducted a multidimensional investigation of neural oscillatory modulations and their cortical sources in 44 subjects while observing stimuli that convey vicarious pain (vs no-pain) in a broad time window and frequency range to explore rich neural representations of pain empathy. Furthermore, we collected participants’ subjective-experience of sensitivity to vicarious pain, as well as their self-reported trait levels of affective and cognitive empathy to examine the possible associations between neural mechanisms and subjective experiences and reports. While extending previous electrophysiological studies that mainly focused on alpha suppression, we found here four significant power modulation patterns corresponding to multiple facets of empathy: an early central (peaking in the paracentral sulcus) alpha (6–11 Hz) suppression pattern plausibly reflecting sensory processing, two early beta (15–23 Hz) suppression patterns in the mid-cingulate cortex (plausibly reflecting the affective component) and in the precuneus (plausibly reflecting the cognitive component), and a late anterior (peaking in the orbitofrontal cortex) alpha-beta (11–19 Hz) enhancement pattern (plausibly reflecting cognitive-control inhibitory response). Interestingly, the latter measure was negatively correlated with the subjective sensitivity to vicarious pain, thereby possibly revealing a novel inhibitory neural mechanism determining the subjective sensitivity to vicarious pain. Altogether, these multilevel findings cannot be accommodated by the dichotomous model of empathy (i.e., affective-cognitive), and provide empirical support to the Graded Empathy neurophenomenological framework. Furthermore, this work emphasizes the importance of examining multiple neural rhythms, their cortical generators, and reports of subjective-experience in the aim of elucidating the complex nature of empathy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

One thus may hypothesize that the strength of this feeling may not be spatially uniform; rather, it could vary as a function of the degree by which different body parts are involved in motor behavior. Given that our dominant hand plays a leading role in our motor behavior, we hypothesized that it could be more strongly associated with one’s self compared to its non-dominant counterpart. To explore whether this possible asymmetry manifests as a stronger implicit association of the right hand (vs left hand) with the self, we administered the Implicit Association Test to a group of 70 healthy individuals. To control whether this asymmetric association is human-body specific, we further tested whether a similar asymmetry characterizes the association between a right (vs left) animal body part with the concept of self, in an independent sample of subjects (N = 70, 140 subjects total). Our results revealed a linear relationship between the magnitude of the implicit association between the right hand with the self and the subject’s handedness. In detail, the strength of this association increased as a function of hand preference. Critically, the handedness score did not predict the association of the right-animal body part with the self. These findings suggest that, in healthy individuals, the dominant and non-dominant hands are differently perceived at an implicit level as belonging to the self. We argue that such asymmetry may stem from the different roles that the two hands play in our adaptive motor behavior.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neural Circuits: Cannabinoids Regulate Sensory Processing in Early Olfactory and Visual Neural Circuits</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncir.2021.662349</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Our sensory systems such as the olfactory and visual systems are the target of neuromodulatory regulation. This neuromodulation starts at the level of sensory receptors and extends into cortical processing. A relatively new group of neuromodulators includes cannabinoids. These form a group of chemical substances that are found in the cannabis plant. Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD) are the main cannabinoids. THC acts in the brain and nervous system like the chemical substances that our body produces, the endogenous cannabinoids or endocannabinoids, also nicknamed the brain’s own cannabis. While the function of the endocannabinoid system is understood fairly well in limbic structures such as the hippocampus and the amygdala, this signaling system is less well understood in the olfactory pathway and the visual system. Here, we describe and compare endocannabinoids as signaling molecules in the early processing centers of the olfactory and visual system, the olfactory bulb, and the retina, and the relevance of the endocannabinoid system for synaptic plasticity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Microbial Infections Are a Risk Factor for Neurodegenerative Diseases</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.691136</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, comprise a family of disorders characterized by progressive loss of nervous system function. Neuroinflammation is increasingly recognized to be associated with many neurodegenerative diseases but whether it is a cause or consequence of the disease process is unclear. Of growing interest is the role of microbial infections in inciting degenerative neuroinflammatory responses and genetic factors that may regulate those responses. Microbial infections cause inflammation within the central nervous system through activation of brain-resident immune cells and infiltration of peripheral immune cells. These responses are necessary to protect the brain from lethal infections but may also induce neuropathological changes that lead to neurodegeneration. This review discusses the molecular and cellular mechanisms through which microbial infections may increase susceptibility to neurodegenerative diseases. Elucidating these mechanisms is critical for developing targeted therapeutic approaches that prevent the onset and slow the progression of neurodegenerative diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Ubiquitination Destabilizes Protein Sphingosine Kinase 2 to Regulate Glioma Malignancy</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.660354</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Gliomas are the most common and lethal malignant tumor in the central nervous system. The tumor oncogene sphingosine kinase 2 (SphK2) was previously found to be upregulated in glioma tissues and enhance glioma cell epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition through the AKT/β-catenin pathway. Nevertheless, ubiquitination of SphK2 protein has yet to be well elucidated. In this study, mass spectrometry analysis was performed to identify proteins that interacted with SphK2 protein. Co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) and immunoblotting (IB) were used to prove the specific interaction between SphK2 protein and the neural precursor cell-expressed developmentally downregulated 4-like (NEDD4L) protein. Fluorescence microscopy was used for detecting the distribution of related proteins. Ubiquitylation assay was utilized to characterize that SphK2 was ubiquitylated by NEDD4L. Cell viability assay, flow cytometry assay, and transwell invasion assay were performed to illustrate the roles of NEDD4L-mediated SphK2 ubiquitination in glioma viability, apoptosis, and invasion, respectively. We found that NEDD4L directly interacted with SphK2 and ubiquinated it for degradation. Ubiquitination of SphK2 mediated by NEDD4L overexpression suppressed glioma cell viability and invasion but promoted glioma apoptosis. Knockdown of NEDD4L presented opposite results. Moreover, further results suggested that ubiquitination of SphK2 regulated glioma malignancy via the AKT/β-catenin pathway. in vivo assay also supported the above findings. This study reveals that NEDD4L mediates SphK2 ubiquitination to regulate glioma malignancy and may provide some meaningful suggestions for glioma treatment.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: MANF Is Neuroprotective in Early Stages of EAE, and Elevated in Spinal White Matter by Treatment With Dexamethasone</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.640084</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a progressive autoimmune disease characterized by T-cell mediated demyelination in central nervous system (CNS). Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) is a widely used in vivo disease model of MS. Glucocorticoids such as dexamethasone (dex) function as immunosuppressants and are commonly used to treat acute exacerbations of MS. Dex is also often used as a positive control in EAE studies, as it has been shown to promote motor behavior, inhibit immune cell infiltration into the CNS and regulate the activation of glial cell in EAE. This study further validated the effects of intravenously administrated dex by time-dependent fashion in EAE. Dex postponed clinical signs and motor defects in early stages of EAE. Histological analysis revealed that the degeneration of myelin and axons, as well as the infiltration of peripheral immune cells into the white matter of spinal cord was inhibited by dex in early stages of EAE. Additionally, dex-treatment delayed the neuroinflammatory activation of microglia and astrocytes. Furthermore, this study analyzed the expression of the neurotrophic factor mesencephalic astrocyte-derived neurotrophic factor (MANF) in EAE, and the effect of treatment with dex on MANF-expression. We show that in dex-treated EAE mice expression MANF increased within myelinated areas of spinal cord white matter. We also show that intravenous administration with hMANF in EAE mice improved clinical signs and motor behavior in the early stage of EAE. Our report gives insight to the progression of EAE by providing a time-dependent analysis. Moreover, this study investigates the link between MANF and the EAE model, and shows that MANF is a potential drug candidate for MS.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroanatomy: Lack of the Transient Receptor Potential Vanilloid 1 Shifts Cannabinoid-Dependent Excitatory Synaptic Plasticity in the Dentate Gyrus of the Mouse Brain Hippocampus</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnana.2021.701573</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) participates in synaptic functions in the brain. In the dentate gyrus, post-synaptic TRPV1 in the granule cell (GC) dendritic spines mediates a type of long-term depression (LTD) of the excitatory medial perforant path (MPP) synapses independent of pre-synaptic cannabinoid CB&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; receptors. As CB&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; receptors also mediate LTD at these synapses, both CB&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and TRPV1 might be influencing the activity of each other acting from opposite synaptic sites. We tested this hypothesis in the MPP–GC synapses of mice lacking TRPV1 (TRPV1-/-). Unlike wild-type (WT) mice, low-frequency stimulation (10 min at 10 Hz) of TRPV1-/- MPP fibers elicited a form of long-term potentiation (LTP) that was dependent on (1) CB&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; receptors, (2) the endocannabinoid 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG), (3) rearrangement of actin filaments, and (4) nitric oxide signaling. These functional changes were associated with an increase in the maximum binding efficacy of guanosine-5′-O-(3-[&lt;sup&gt;35&lt;/sup&gt;S]thiotriphosphate) ([&lt;sup&gt;35&lt;/sup&gt;S]GTPγS) stimulated by the CB&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; receptor agonist CP 55,940, and a significant decrease in receptor basal activation in the TRPV1-/- hippocampus. Finally, TRPV1-/- hippocampal synaptosomes showed an augmented level of the guanine nucleotide-binding (G) Gα&lt;sub&gt;i1&lt;/sub&gt;, Gα&lt;sub&gt;i2&lt;/sub&gt;, and Gα&lt;sub&gt;i3&lt;/sub&gt; protein alpha subunits. Altogether, the lack of TRPV1 modifies CB&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; receptor signaling in the dentate gyrus and causes the shift from CB&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; receptor-mediated LTD to LTP at the MPP–GC synapses.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

This review features our current understanding of brain WC, both within and external to the brain parenchyma.

We also discuss the relevant role of the CSF and its exit routes in mediating WC. Recent discoveries of the glymphatic system and meningeal lymphatic vessels, and their relevance to brain WC are highlighted. Controversies related to brain WC research and potential future directions are presented.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.679585</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Background: Increasing evidence demonstrates that repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) treatment of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex is beneficial for improving cognitive function in patients with Alzheimer’s disease (AD); however, the underlying mechanism of its therapeutic effect remains unclear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Objectives/Hypothesis: The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of rTMS to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex on functional connectivity along with treatment response in AD patients with different severity of cognitive impairment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: We conducted a 2-week treatment course of 10-Hz rTMS over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in 23 patients with AD who were split into the mild or moderate cognitive impairment subgroup. Resting state electroencephalography and general cognition was assessed before and after rTMS. Power envelope connectivity was used to calculate functional connectivity at the source level. The functional connectivity of AD patients and 11 cognitively normal individuals was compared.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Power envelope connectivity was higher in the delta and theta bands but lower in the beta band in the moderate cognitive impairment group, compared to the cognitively normal controls, at baseline (p &amp;lt; 0.05). The mild cognitive impairment group had no significant abnormities. Montreal Cognitive Assessment scores improved after rTMS in the moderate and mild cognitive impairment groups. Power envelope connectivity in the beta band post-rTMS was increased in the moderate group (p &amp;lt; 0.05) but not in the mild group. No significant changes in the delta and theta band were found after rTMS in both the moderate and mild group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: High-frequency rTMS to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex modulates electroencephalographic functional connectivity while improving cognitive function in patients with AD. Increased beta connectivity may have an important mechanistic role in rTMS therapeutic effects.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: A chimeric nuclease substitutes a phage CRISPR-Cas system to provide sequence-specific immunity against subviral parasites</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/68339</link>
	<content:encoded>Mobile genetic elements, elements that can move horizontally between genomes, have profound effects on their host's fitness. The &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;hage-inducible chromosomal island-&lt;i&gt;l&lt;/i&gt;ike &lt;i&gt;e&lt;/i&gt;lement (PLE) is a mobile element that integrates into the chromosome of &lt;i&gt;Vibrio cholerae&lt;/i&gt; and parasitizes the bacteriophage ICP1 to move between cells. This parasitism by PLE is such that it abolishes the production of ICP1 progeny and provides a defensive boon to the host cell population. In response to the severe parasitism imposed by PLE, ICP1 has acquired an adaptive CRISPR-Cas system that targets the PLE genome during infection. However, ICP1 isolates that naturally lack CRISPR-Cas are still able to overcome certain PLE variants, and the mechanism of this immunity against PLE has thus far remained unknown. Here, we show that ICP1 isolates that lack CRISPR-Cas encode an endonuclease in the same locus, and that the endonuclease provides ICP1 with immunity to a subset of PLEs. Further analysis shows that this endonuclease is of chimeric origin, incorporating a DNA-binding domain that is highly similar to some PLE replication origin-binding proteins. This similarity allows the endonuclease to bind and cleave PLE origins of replication. The endonuclease appears to exert considerable selective pressure on PLEs and may drive PLE replication module swapping and origin restructuring as mechanisms of escape. This work demonstrates that new genome defense systems can arise through domain shuffling and provides a greater understanding of the evolutionary forces driving genome modularity and temporal succession in mobile elements.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/65331</link>
	<content:encoded>Most eukaryotic mRNAs accommodate alternative sites of poly(A) addition in the 3’ untranslated region in order to regulate mRNA function. Here, we present a systematic analysis of 3’ end formation factors, which revealed 3’UTR lengthening in response to a loss of the core machinery, whereas a loss of the Sen1 helicase resulted in shorter 3’UTRs. We show that the anti-cancer drug cordycepin, 3’ deoxyadenosine, caused nucleotide accumulation and the usage of distal poly(A) sites. Mycophenolic acid, a drug which reduces GTP levels and impairs RNA polymerase II (RNAP II) transcription elongation, promoted the usage of proximal sites and reversed the effects of cordycepin on alternative polyadenylation. Moreover, cordycepin-mediated usage of distal sites was associated with a permissive chromatin template and was suppressed in the presence of an &lt;i&gt;rpb1&lt;/i&gt; mutation, which slows RNAP II elongation rate. We propose that alternative polyadenylation is governed by temporal coordination of RNAP II transcription and 3’ end processing and controlled by the availability of 3’ end factors, nucleotide levels and chromatin landscape.</content:encoded>

In &lt;i&gt;Neisseria&lt;/i&gt; species, including &lt;i&gt;Neisseria cinerea&lt;/i&gt; a commensal of the human respiratory tract, interbacterial contacts are mediated by Type four pili (Tfp) which promote formation of aggregates and govern the spatial dynamics of growing &lt;i&gt;Neisseria&lt;/i&gt; microcolonies. Here, we show that &lt;i&gt;N. cinerea&lt;/i&gt; expresses a plasmid-encoded T6SS that is active and can limit growth of related pathogens. We explored the impact of Tfp on &lt;i&gt;N. cinerea&lt;/i&gt; T6SS-dependent killing within a colony and show that pilus expression by a prey strain enhances susceptibility to T6SS compared to a non-piliated prey, by preventing segregation from a T6SS-wielding attacker.

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/61595</link>
	<content:encoded>Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) manifests sensory and perceptual atypicalities. Recent theories suggest that these may reflect a reduced influence of prior information in ASD. Some studies have found reduced adaptation to recent sensory stimuli in ASD. However, the effects of prior stimuli and prior perceptual choices can counteract one-another. Here, we investigated this using two different tasks (in two different cohorts): (i) visual location discrimination, and (ii) multisensory (visual-vestibular) heading discrimination. We fit the data using a logistic regression model to dissociate the specific effects of prior stimuli and prior choices. In both tasks perceptual decisions were biased toward recent choices. Notably, the 'attractive' effect of prior choices was significantly larger in ASD (in both tasks and cohorts), while there was no difference in the influence of prior stimuli. These results challenge theories of reduced priors in ASD, and rather suggest an increased consistency bias for perceptual decisions in ASD.</content:encoded>

Robo βKO mice, in which the genes &lt;i&gt;Robo1&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Robo2&lt;/i&gt; are deleted selectively in β cells, provide a unique model of altered islet spatial architecture without loss of β cell differentiation or islet damage from diabetes.

We provide evidence that this loss is not due to a β cell-intrinsic function of Robo, mis-expression or mis-localization of Cx36 gap junctions, or changes in islet vascularization or innervation, suggesting that the islet architecture itself is required for synchronized Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; oscillations.

	<title>eLife: Propelling and perturbing appendages together facilitate strenuous ground self-righting</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/60233</link>
	<content:encoded>Terrestrial animals must self-right when overturned on the ground, but this locomotor task is strenuous. To do so, the discoid cockroach often pushes its wings against the ground to begin a somersault which rarely succeeds. As it repeatedly attempts this, the animal probabilistically rolls to the side to self-right. During winged self-righting, the animal flails its legs vigorously. Here, we studied whether wing opening and leg flailing together facilitate strenuous ground self-righting. Adding mass to increase hind leg flailing kinetic energy increased the animal’s self-righting probability. We then developed a robot with similar strenuous self-righting behavior and used it as a physical model for systematic experiments. The robot’s self-righting probability increased with wing opening and leg flailing amplitudes. A potential energy landscape model revealed that, although wing opening did not generate sufficient kinetic energy to overcome the high pitch potential energy barrier to somersault, it reduced the barrier for rolling, facilitating the small kinetic energy from leg flailing to probabilistically overcome it to self-right. The model also revealed that the stereotyped body motion during self-righting emerged from physical interaction of the body and appendages with the ground. Our work demonstrated the usefulness of potential energy landscape for modeling self-righting transitions.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.07.07.451421v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>The medial habenula (mHb) is an understudied small brain nucleus linking forebrain and midbrain structures controlling anxiety and fear behaviors. The mechanisms that maintain the structural and functional integrity of mHb neurons and their synapses remain unknown. Using spatio-temporally controlled Cre-mediated recombination in adult mice, we found that the GDNF receptor alpha 1 (GFR1) is required in adult mHb neurons for synaptic stability and function. mHb neurons express some of the highest levels of GFR1 in the mouse brain, and acute ablation of GFR1 results in loss of septo-habenular and habenulo-interpeduncular glutamatergic synapses, with the remaining synapses displaying reduced numbers of presynaptic vesicles. Chemo- and opto-genetic studies in mice lacking GFR1 revealed impaired circuit connectivity, reduced AMPA receptor postsynaptic currents, and abnormally low rectification index of AMPARs, suggesting reduced Ca2+-permeability. Further biochemical and proximity ligation assay studies defined the presence of GluA1/GluA2 (Ca2+-impermeable) as well as GluA1/GluA4 (Ca2+-permeable) AMPAR complexes in mHb neurons, as well as clear differences in the levels and association of AMPAR subunits in mHb neurons lacking GFR1. Finally, acute loss of GFR1 in adult mHb neurons reduced anxiety-like behavior and potentiated context-based fear responses, phenocopying the effects of lesions to septal projections to the mHb. These results uncover an unexpected function for GFR1 in the maintenance and function of adult glutamatergic synapses, and reveal a potential new mechanism for regulating synaptic plasticity in the septo-habenulo-interpeduncular pathway and attuning of anxiety and fear behaviors.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) are two devastating and fatal neurodegenerative conditions. While distinct, they share many clinical, genetic, and pathological characteristics, and both show selective vulnerability of layer 5b extratelencephalic-projecting cortical populations, including Betz cells in ALS and von Economo neurons (VENs) in FTLD. Here, we report the first high resolution single-cell atlas of the human primary motor cortex (MCX) and its transcriptional alterations in ALS and FTLD across ~380,000 nuclei from 64 individuals, including 17 control samples and 47 sporadic and C9orf72-associated ALS and FTLD patient samples. We identify 46 transcriptionally distinct cellular subtypes including two Betz-cell subtypes, and we observe a previously unappreciated molecular similarity between Betz cells and VENs of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and frontal insula. Many of the dysregulated genes and pathways are shared across excitatory neurons, including stress response, ribosome function, oxidative phosphorylation, synaptic vesicle cycle, endoplasmic reticulum protein processing, and autophagy. Betz cells and SCN4B+ long-range projecting L3/L5 cells are the most transcriptionally affected in both ALS and FTLD. Lastly, we find that the VEN/Betz cell-enriched transcription factor, POU3F1, has altered subcellular localization, co-localizes with TDP-43 aggregates, and may represent a cell type-specific vulnerability factor in the Betz cells of ALS and FTLD patient tissues.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.07.07.451278v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Large-volume ultrastructural mapping approaches yield detailed circuit wiring diagrams but lack an integrated synaptic activity readout which is essential for functional interpretation of the connectome. Here we resolve this limitation by combining functional synaptic labelling in vivo with focused ion-beam scanning electron microscopy (FIBSEM) and machine learning-based segmentation. Our approach generates high-resolution near-isotropic three-dimensional readouts of activated vesicle pools across large populations of individual synapses in a volume of tissue, opening the way for detailed functional connectomics studies. We apply this method to measure presynaptic activity in an ultrastructural context in synapses activated by sensory input in primary visual cortex in awake head-fixed mice, showing that the numbers of recycling and non-recycling vesicles approximate to a lognormal distribution across a large number of synapses. We also demonstrate that neighbouring boutons of the same axon, which share the same spiking activity, can differ greatly in their presynaptic release probability.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.07.06.451370v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Neural circuits can generate many spike patterns, but only some are functional. The study of how circuits generate and maintain functional dynamics is hindered by a poverty of description of circuit dynamics across functional and dysfunctional states. For example, although the regular oscillation of a central pattern generator is well characterized by its frequency and the phase relationships between its neurons, these metrics are ineffective descriptors of the irregular and aperiodic dynamics that circuits can generate under perturbation or in disease states. By recording the circuit dynamics of the well-studied pyloric circuit in C. borealis, we used statistical features of spike times from neurons in the circuit to visualize the spike patterns generated by this circuit under a variety of conditions. This unsupervised approach captures both the variability of functional rhythms and the diversity of atypical dynamics in a single map. Clusters in the map identify qualitatively different spike patterns hinting at different dynamical states in the circuit. State probability and the statistics of the transitions between states varied with environmental perturbations, removal of descending neuromodulation, and the addition of exogenous neuromodulators. This analysis reveals strong mechanistically interpretable links between complex changes in the collective behavior of a neural circuit and specific experimental manipulations, and can constrain hypotheses of how circuits generate functional dynamics despite variability in circuit architecture and environmental perturbations.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.07.06.451358v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>We previously identified Hnrnph1 (heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein H1) as a quantitative trait gene underlying reduced methamphetamine behavioral sensitivity. Mice with a heterozygous frameshift deletion in the first coding exon of Hnrnph1 showed reduced methamphetamine-induced dopamine release and behaviors. To inform the mechanism linking hnRNP H dysfunction with reduced methamphetamine-induced dopamine release and behavior, we surveyed the RNA targetome of hnRNP H via cross-linking immunoprecipitation coupled with RNA-sequencing in striatal tissue at baseline and at 30 min post-methamphetamine (2 mg/kg, i.p.). Methamphetamine induced opposite changes in RNA-binding targets of hnRNP H in Hnrnph1 mutants versus wild-types, including 3'UTR targets in mRNAs enriched for synaptic proteins involved in dopamine release and excitatory synaptic plasticity. Targetome, transcriptome, and spliceome analyses triangulated on a methamphetamine-induced upregulation of Cacna2d2 transcript and decreased 3'UTR usage in hyposensitive Hnrnph1 mutants. Our study identifies a dynamic methamphetamine-induced RNA targetome of hnRNP H that has the potential to rapidly regulate gene expression, synaptic transmission, plasticity, and behavior.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.07.06.451315v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Children show marked improvements in executive functioning (EF) between 4 and 7 years of age. In many societies, this time period coincides with the start of formal school education, in which children are required to follow rules in a structured environment, drawing heavily on EF processes such as inhibitory control. This study aimed to investigate the longitudinal development of two aspects of inhibitory control, namely response inhibition and response monitoring and their neural correlates. Specifically, we examined how their longitudinal development may differ by schooling experience, and their potential significance in predicting academic outcomes. Longitudinal data was collected in two groups of children at their homes. At T1, all children were roughly 4.5 years of age and neither group had attended formal schooling. One year later at T2, one group (P1, n = 40) had completed one full year of schooling while the other group (KG, n = 40) had stayed in kindergarten. Behavioural and brain activation data (measured with functional near-infrared spectroscopy, fNIRS) in response to a Go/No-Go task and measures of academic achievement were collected. We found that P1 children, compared to KG children, showed a greater change over time in activation related to response monitoring in the bilateral frontal cortex. The change in left frontal activation difference showed a small positive association with mathematical ability, suggesting certain functional relevance of response monitoring for academic performance. Overall, the school environment is important in shaping the development of the neural network underlying monitoring of one owns performance.

	<content:encoded>Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an opportunistic pathogen that forms antibiotic-resistant biofilms, which facilitate chronic infections in immunocompromised hosts. We have previously shown that P. aeruginosa secretes outer-membrane vesicles that deliver a small RNA to human airway epithelial cells (AECs), in which it suppresses the innate immune response.

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Shrinking Bouma’s window: How to model crowding in dense displays</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/bczjzCZuMmg/article</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Alban Bornet, Adrien Doerig, Michael H. Herzog, Gregory Francis, Erik Van der Burg&lt;/p&gt;

In crowding, perception of a target deteriorates in the presence of nearby flankers. Traditionally, it is thought that visual crowding obeys Bouma’s law, i.e., all elements within a certain distance interfere with the target, and that adding more elements always leads to stronger crowding. Crowding is predominantly studied using sparse displays (a target surrounded by a few flankers). However, many studies have shown that this approach leads to wrong conclusions about human vision. Van der Burg and colleagues proposed a paradigm to measure crowding in dense displays using genetic algorithms. Displays were selected and combined over several generations to maximize human performance. In contrast to Bouma’s law, only the target’s nearest neighbours affected performance. Here, we tested various models to explain these results. We used the same genetic algorithm, but instead of selecting displays based on human performance we selected displays based on the model’s outputs. We found that all models based on the traditional feedforward pooling framework of vision were unable to reproduce human behaviour. In contrast, all models involving a dedicated grouping stage explained the results successfully. We show how traditional models can be improved by adding a grouping stage.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/bczjzCZuMmg&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Sample size calculations are an essential component of the design and evaluation of scientific studies. However, there is a lack of clear guidance for determining the sample size needed for phylogenetic studies, which are becoming an essential part of studying pathogen transmission. We introduce a statistical framework for determining the number of true infector-infectee transmission pairs identified by a phylogenetic study, given the size and population coverage of that study. We then show how characteristics of the criteria used to determine linkage and aspects of the study design can influence our ability to correctly identify transmission links, in sometimes counterintuitive ways. We test the overall approach using outbreak simulations and provide guidance for calculating the sensitivity and specificity of the linkage criteria, the key inputs to our approach. The framework is freely available as the R package &lt;i&gt;phylosamp&lt;/i&gt;, and is broadly applicable to designing and evaluating a wide array of pathogen phylogenetic studies.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/1eSF4MY9g2M&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Adaptive control of movement deceleration during saccades</title>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Simon P. Orozco, Scott T. Albert, Reza Shadmehr&lt;/p&gt;

As you read this text, your eyes make saccades that guide your fovea from one word to the next. Accuracy of these movements require the brain to monitor and learn from visual errors. A current model suggests that learning is supported by two different adaptive processes, one fast (high error sensitivity, low retention), and the other slow (low error sensitivity, high retention). Here, we searched for signatures of these hypothesized processes and found that following experience of a visual error, there was an adaptive change in the motor commands of the subsequent saccade. Surprisingly, this adaptation was not uniformly expressed throughout the movement. Rather, after experience of a single error, the adaptive response in the subsequent trial was limited to the deceleration period. After repeated exposure to the same error, the acceleration period commands also adapted, and exhibited resistance to forgetting during set-breaks. In contrast, the deceleration period commands adapted more rapidly, but suffered from poor retention during these same breaks. State-space models suggested that acceleration and deceleration periods were supported by a shared adaptive state which re-aimed the saccade, as well as two separate processes which resembled a two-state model: one that learned slowly and contributed primarily via acceleration period commands, and another that learned rapidly but contributed primarily via deceleration period commands.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/3MUqSy0IJUA&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Biomechanical forces intimately contribute to cardiac morphogenesis. However, volumetric imaging to investigate the cardiac mechanics with high temporal and spatial resolution remains an imaging challenge. We hereby integrated light-field microscopy (LFM) with light-sheet fluorescence microscopy (LSFM), coupled with a retrospective gating method, to simultaneously access myocardial contraction and intracardiac blood flow at 200 volumes per second. While LSFM allows for the reconstruction of the myocardial function, LFM enables instantaneous acquisition of the intracardiac blood cells traversing across the valves. We further adopted deformable image registration to quantify the ventricular wall displacement and particle tracking velocimetry to monitor intracardiac blood flow. The integration of LFM and LSFM enabled the time-dependent tracking of the individual blood cells and the differential rates of segmental wall displacement during a cardiac cycle. Taken together, we demonstrated a hybrid system, coupled with our image analysis pipeline, to simultaneously capture the myocardial wall motion with intracardiac blood flow during cardiac development.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/ZyS_q2VJ4ow&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Formation of the ventral furrow in the &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; embryo relies on the apical constriction of cells in the ventral region to produce bending forces that drive tissue invagination. In our recent paper we observed that apical constrictions during the initial phase of ventral furrow formation produce elongated patterns of cellular constriction chains prior to invagination and argued that these are indicative of tensile stress feedback. Here, we quantitatively analyze the constriction patterns preceding ventral furrow formation and find that they are consistent with the predictions of our active-granular-fluid model of a monolayer of mechanically coupled stress-sensitive constricting particles. Our model shows that tensile feedback causes constriction chains to develop along underlying precursor tensile stress chains that gradually strengthen with subsequent cellular constrictions. As seen in both our model and available optogenetic experiments, this mechanism allows constriction chains to penetrate or circumvent zones of reduced cell contractility, thus increasing the robustness of ventral furrow formation to spatial variation of cell contractility by rescuing cellular constrictions in the disrupted regions.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/mzp9_Nfj5P8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

A critical facet of adjusting one’s behaviour after succeeding or failing at a task is assigning responsibility for the ultimate outcome. Humans have trait- and state-like tendencies to implicate aspects of their own behaviour (called ‘internal’ ascriptions) or facets of the particular task or Lady Luck (’chance’). However, how these tendencies interact with actual performance is unclear. We designed a novel task in which subjects had to learn the likelihood of achieving their goals, and the extent to which this depended on their efforts. High internality (Levenson I-score) was associated with decision making patterns that are less vulnerable to failure. Our computational analyses suggested that this depended heavily on the adjustment in the perceived achievability of riskier goals following failure. We found beliefs about chance not to be explanatory of choice behaviour in our task. Beliefs about powerful others were strong predictors of behaviour, but only when subjects lacked substantial influence over the outcome. Our results provide an evidentiary basis for heuristics and learning differences that underlie the formation and maintenance of control expectations by the self.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/hAV-hMzko_0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Human immunogenetic variation in the form of HLA and KIR types has been shown to be strongly associated with a multitude of immune-related phenotypes. However, association studies involving immunogenetic loci most commonly involve simple analyses of classical HLA allelic diversity, resulting in limitations regarding the interpretability and reproducibility of results. We here present MiDAS, a comprehensive R package for immunogenetic data transformation and statistical analysis. MiDAS recodes input data in the form of HLA alleles and KIR types into biologically meaningful variables, allowing HLA amino acid fine mapping, analyses of HLA evolutionary divergence as well as experimentally validated HLA-KIR interactions. Further, MiDAS enables comprehensive statistical association analysis workflows with phenotypes of diverse measurement scales. MiDAS thus closes the gap between the inference of immunogenetic variation and its efficient utilization to make relevant discoveries related to immune and disease biology.

PCR amplification plays an integral role in the measurement of mixed microbial communities via high-throughput DNA sequencing of the 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene. Yet PCR is also known to introduce multiple forms of bias in 16S rRNA studies. Here we present a paired modeling and experimental approach to characterize and mitigate PCR NPM-bias (PCR bias from non-primer-mismatch sources) in microbiota surveys. We use experimental data from mock bacterial communities to validate our approach and human gut microbiota samples to characterize PCR NPM-bias under real-world conditions. Our results suggest that PCR NPM-bias can skew estimates of microbial relative abundances by a factor of 4 or more, but that this bias can be mitigated using log-ratio linear models.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/QO-Tb4sz7s8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

This paper uses constructs from machine learning to define pairs of learning tasks that either shared or did not share a common subspace. Human subjects then learnt these tasks using a feedback-based approach and we hypothesised that learning would be boosted for shared subspaces. Our findings broadly supported this hypothesis with either better performance on the second task if it shared the same subspace as the first, or positive correlations over task performance for shared subspaces. These empirical findings were compared to the behaviour of a Neural Network model trained using sequential Bayesian learning and human performance was found to be consistent with a minimal capacity variant of this model. Networks with an increased representational capacity, and networks without Bayesian learning, did not show these transfer effects. We propose that the concept of shared subspaces provides a useful framework for the experimental study of human multitask and transfer learning.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/ZKm31SKqKBs&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Drug-drug interactions account for up to 30% of adverse drug reactions. Increasing prevalence of electronic health records (EHRs) offers a unique opportunity to build machine learning algorithms to identify drug-drug interactions that drive adverse events. In this study, we investigated hospitalizations’ data to study drug interactions with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) that result in drug-induced liver injury (DILI). We propose a logistic regression based machine learning algorithm that unearths several known interactions from an EHR dataset of about 400,000 hospitalization. Our proposed modeling framework is successful in detecting 87.5% of the positive controls, which are defined by drugs known to interact with diclofenac causing an increased risk of DILI, and correctly ranks aggregate risk of DILI for eight commonly prescribed NSAIDs. We found that our modeling framework is particularly successful in inferring associations of drug-drug interactions from relatively small EHR datasets. Furthermore, we have identified a novel and potentially hepatotoxic interaction that might occur during concomitant use of meloxicam and esomeprazole, which are commonly prescribed together to allay NSAID-induced gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding. Empirically, we validate our approach against prior methods for signal detection on EHR datasets, in which our proposed approach outperforms all the compared methods across most metrics, such as area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) and area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC).&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/ayYxQAwESVc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Jennifer Crodelle, David W. McLaughlin&lt;/p&gt;

Recent experiments in the developing mammalian visual cortex have revealed that gap junctions couple excitatory cells and potentially influence the formation of chemical synapses. In particular, cells that were coupled by a gap junction during development tend to share an orientation preference and are preferentially coupled by a chemical synapse in the adult cortex, a property that is diminished when gap junctions are blocked. In this work, we construct a simplified model of the developing mouse visual cortex including spike-timing-dependent plasticity of both the feedforward synaptic inputs and recurrent cortical synapses. We use this model to show that synchrony among gap-junction-coupled cells underlies their preference to form strong recurrent synapses and develop similar orientation preference; this effect decreases with an increase in coupling density. Additionally, we demonstrate that gap-junction coupling works, together with the relative timing of synaptic development of the feedforward and recurrent synapses, to determine the resulting cortical map of orientation preference.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/F04sNpr35H0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Synaptotagmin-7 (Syt7) plays direct or redundant Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; sensor roles in multiple forms of vesicle exocytosis in synapses. Here, we show that Syt7 is a redundant Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; sensor with Syt1/Doc2 to drive spontaneous glutamate release, which functions uniquely to activate the postsynaptic GluN2B-containing NMDARs that significantly contribute to mental illness. In mouse hippocampal neurons lacking Syt1/Doc2, Syt7 inactivation largely diminishes spontaneous release. Using 2 approaches, including measuring Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; dose response and substituting extracellular Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; with Sr&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, we detect that Syt7 directly triggers spontaneous release via its Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; binding motif to activate GluN2B-NMDARs. Furthermore, modifying the localization of Syt7 in the active zone still allows Syt7 to drive spontaneous release, but the GluN2B-NMDAR activity is abolished. Finally, Syt7 SNPs identified in bipolar disorder patients destroy the function of Syt7 in spontaneous release in patient iPSC-derived and mouse hippocampal neurons. Therefore, Syt7 could contribute to neuropsychiatric disorders through driving spontaneous glutamate release.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/a3Cz2WX3HSE&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Mobile genetic elements (MGEs) drive genetic transfers between bacteria using mechanisms that require a physical interaction with the cellular envelope. In the high-priority multidrug-resistant nosocomial pathogens (ESKAPE), the first point of contact between the cell and virions or conjugative pili is the capsule. While the capsule can be a barrier to MGEs, it also evolves rapidly by horizontal gene transfer (HGT). Here, we aim at understanding this apparent contradiction by studying the covariation between the repertoire of capsule genes and MGEs in approximately 4,000 genomes of &lt;i&gt;Klebsiella pneumoniae&lt;/i&gt; (Kpn). We show that capsules drive phage-mediated gene flow between closely related serotypes. Such serotype-specific phage predation also explains the frequent inactivation of capsule genes, observed in more than 3% of the genomes. Inactivation is strongly epistatic, recapitulating the capsule biosynthetic pathway. We show that conjugative plasmids are acquired at higher rates in natural isolates lacking a functional capsular locus and confirmed experimentally this result in capsule mutants. This suggests that capsule inactivation by phage pressure facilitates its subsequent reacquisition by conjugation. Accordingly, capsule reacquisition leaves long recombination tracts around the capsular locus. The loss and regain process rewires gene flow toward other lineages whenever it leads to serotype swaps. Such changes happen preferentially between chemically related serotypes, hinting that the fitness of serotype-swapped strains depends on the host genetic background. These results enlighten the bases of trade-offs between the evolution of virulence and multidrug resistance and caution that some alternatives to antibiotics by selecting for capsule inactivation may facilitate the acquisition of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs).&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/wYh9n9mhdx8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Centromere protein A (CENP-A) is a histone H3 variant that defines centromeric chromatin and is essential for centromere function. In most eukaryotes, CENP-A-containing chromatin is epigenetically maintained, and centromere identity is inherited from one cell cycle to the next. In the germ line of the holocentric nematode &lt;i&gt;Caenorhabditis elegans&lt;/i&gt;, this inheritance cycle is disrupted. CENP-A is removed at the mitosis-to-meiosis transition and is reestablished on chromatin during diplotene of meiosis I. Here, we show that the N-terminal tail of CENP-A is required for the de novo establishment of centromeres, but then its presence becomes dispensable for centromere maintenance during development. Worms homozygous for a CENP-A tail deletion maintain functional centromeres during development but give rise to inviable offspring because they fail to reestablish centromeres in the maternal germ line. We identify the N-terminal tail of CENP-A as a critical domain for the interaction with the conserved kinetochore protein KNL-2 and argue that this interaction plays an important role in setting centromere identity in the germ line. We conclude that centromere establishment and maintenance are functionally distinct in &lt;i&gt;C&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;elegans&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/OGRoMoHQ2kA&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Characterizing the Genetic Architecture of Parkinson's Disease in Latinos</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.26153?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Objective
This work was undertaken in order to identify Parkinson's disease (PD) risk variants in a Latino cohort, to describe the overlap in the genetic architecture of PD in Latinos compared to European‐ancestry subjects, and to increase the diversity in PD genome‐wide association (GWAS) data.


Methods
We genotyped and imputed 1497 PD cases and controls recruited from nine clinical sites across South America. We performed a GWAS using logistic mixed models; variants with a p‐value &amp;lt;1x10−5 were tested in a replication cohort of 1,234 self‐reported Latino PD cases and 439,522 Latino controls from 23andMe, Inc. We also performed an admixture mapping analysis where local ancestry blocks were tested for association with PD status.


Results
One locus, SNCA, achieved genome‐wide significance (p‐value &amp;lt;5x10−8); rs356182 achieved genome‐wide significance in both the discovery and the replication cohorts (discovery, G allele: 1.58 OR, 95% CI 1.35–1.86, p‐value 2.48x10−8; 23andMe, G allele: 1.26 OR, 95% CI 1.16–1.37, p‐value 4.55x10−8). In our admixture mapping analysis, a locus on chromosome 14, containing the gene STXBP6, achieved significance in a joint test of ancestries and in the Native American single‐ancestry test (p‐value &amp;lt;5x10−5). A second locus on chromosome 6, containing the gene RPS6KA2, achieved significance in the African single‐ancestry test (p‐value &amp;lt;5x10−5).


Interpretation
This study demonstrated the importance of the SNCA locus for the etiology of PD in Latinos. By leveraging the demographic history of our cohort via admixture mapping, we identified two potential PD risk loci that merit further study.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In this paper, we propose methods for functional predictor selection and the
estimation of smooth functional coefficients simultaneously in a
scalar-on-function regression problem under high-dimensional multivariate
functional data setting. In particular, we develop two methods for functional

show the convergence of algorithms and the consistency of the estimation and
the selection (oracle property) under infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces.
Simulation studies show the effectiveness of the methods in both the selection
and the estimation of functional coefficients. The applications to the
functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) reveal the regions of the human
brain related to ADHD and IQ.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.01807</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A prominent technique for reducing the memory footprint of Spiking Neural
Networks (SNNs) without decreasing the accuracy significantly is quantization.
However, the state-of-the-art only focus on employing the weight quantization
directly from a specific quantization scheme, i.e., either the post-training
quantization (PTQ) or the in-training quantization (ITQ), and do not consider
(1) quantizing other SNN parameters (e.g., neuron membrane potential), (2)
exploring different combinations of quantization approaches (i.e., quantization
schemes, precision levels, and rounding schemes), and (3) selecting the SNN
model with a good memory-accuracy trade-off at the end. Therefore, the memory
saving offered by these state-of-the-art to meet the targeted accuracy is
limited, thereby hindering processing SNNs on the resource-constrained systems
(e.g., the IoT-Edge devices). Towards this, we propose Q-SpiNN, a novel
quantization framework for memory-efficient SNNs. The key mechanisms of the
Q-SpiNN are: (1) employing quantization for different SNN parameters based on
their significance to the accuracy, (2) exploring different combinations of
quantization schemes, precision levels, and rounding schemes to find efficient
SNN model candidates, and (3) developing an algorithm that quantifies the
benefit of the memory-accuracy trade-off obtained by the candidates, and
selects the Pareto-optimal one. The experimental results show that, for the
unsupervised network, the Q-SpiNN reduces the memory footprint by ca. 4x, while
maintaining the accuracy within 1% from the baseline on the MNIST dataset. For
the supervised network, the Q-SpiNN reduces the memory by ca. 2x, while keeping
the accuracy within 2% from the baseline on the DVS-Gesture dataset.

	<title>arXiv: Computer Science: Neural and Evolutionary Computing: Multi-layer Hebbian networks with modern deep learning frameworks. (arXiv:2107.01729v1 [cs.NE])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.01729</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Deep learning networks generally use non-biological learning methods. By
contrast, networks based on more biologically plausible learning, such as
Hebbian learning, show comparatively poor performance and difficulties of
implementation. Here we show that hierarchical, convolutional Hebbian learning
can be implemented almost trivially with modern deep learning frameworks, by
using specific losses whose gradients produce exactly the desired Hebbian
updates. We provide expressions whose gradients exactly implement a plain
Hebbian rule (dw ~= xy), Grossberg's instar rule (dw ~= y(x-w)), and Oja's rule
(dw ~= y(x-yw)). As an application, we build Hebbian convolutional multi-layer
networks for object recognition. We observe that higher layers of such networks
tend to learn large, simple features (Gabor-like filters and blobs), explaining
the previously reported decrease in decoding performance over successive
layers. To combat this tendency, we introduce interventions (denser activations
with sparse plasticity, pruning of connections between layers) which result in
sparser learned features, massively increase performance, and allow information
to increase over successive layers. We hypothesize that more advanced
techniques (dynamic stimuli, trace learning, feedback connections, etc.),
together with the massive computational boost offered by modern deep learning
frameworks, could greatly improve the performance and biological relevance of
multi-layer Hebbian networks.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.01711</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Feedforward neural networks are widely used as universal predictive models to
fit data distribution. Common gradient-based learning, however, suffers from
many drawbacks making the training process ineffective and time-consuming.
Alternative randomized learning does not use gradients but selects hidden node
parameters randomly. This makes the training process extremely fast. However,
the problem in randomized learning is how to determine the random parameters. A
recently proposed method uses autoencoders for unsupervised parameter learning.
This method showed superior performance on classification tasks. In this work,
we apply this method to regression problems, and, finding that it has some
drawbacks, we show how to improve it. We propose a learning method of
autoencoders that controls the produced random weights. We also propose how to
determine the biases of hidden nodes. We empirically compare autoencoder based
learning with other randomized learning methods proposed recently for
regression and find that despite the proposed improvement of the autoencoder
based learning, it does not outperform its competitors in fitting accuracy.
Moreover, the method is much more complex than its competitors.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;This work contributes to the development of neural forecasting models with
novel randomization-based learning methods. These methods improve the fitting
abilities of the neural model, in comparison to the standard method, by
generating network parameters in accordance with the data and target function

approach useful for forecasting time series with multiple seasonality. In the
simulation study, we evaluate the performance of the proposed models and find
that they can compete in terms of forecasting accuracy with fully-trained
networks. Extremely fast and easy training, simple architecture, ease of
implementation, high accuracy as well as dealing with nonstationarity and
multiple seasonality in time series make the proposed model very attractive for
a wide range of complex time series forecasting problems.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;This work contributes to the development of a new data-driven method (D-DM)
of feedforward neural networks (FNNs) learning. This method was proposed
recently as a way of improving randomized learning of FNNs by adjusting the
network parameters to the target function fluctuations. The method employs
logistic sigmoid activation functions for hidden nodes. In this study, we
introduce other activation functions, such as bipolar sigmoid, sine function,
saturating linear functions, reLU, and softplus. We derive formulas for their
parameters, i.e. weights and biases. In the simulation study, we evaluate the
performance of FNN data-driven learning with different activation functions.
The results indicate that the sigmoid activation functions perform much better
than others in the approximation of complex, fluctuated target functions.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Determining important vertices in large graphs (e.g., Google's PageRank in
the case of the graph of the World Wide Web) facilitated the construction of
excellent web search engines, returning the most important hits corresponding
to the submitted user queries. Interestingly, finding important edges --
instead of vertices -- in large graphs has received much less attention until
now. Here we examine the human structural braingraph (or connectome),
identified by diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) methods, with edges
connecting cortical and subcortical gray matter areas and weighted by fiber
strengths, measured by the number of the discovered fiber tracts along the
edge. We identify several &quot;single&quot; important edges in these braingraphs, whose
high or low weights imply the sex or the age of the subject observed. We call
these edges implicator edges since solely from their weight, one can infer the
sex of the subject with more than 67 \% accuracy or their age group with more
than 62\% accuracy. We argue that these brain connections are the most
important ones characterizing the sex or the age of the subjects. Surprisingly,
the edges implying the male sex are mostly located in the anterior parts of the
brain, while those implying the female sex are mostly in the posterior regions.
Additionally, most of the inter-hemispheric implicator edges are male ones,
while the intra-hemispheric ones are predominantly female edges. Our pioneering
method for finding the sex- or age implicator edges can also be applied for
characterizing other biological and medical properties, including
neurodegenerative- and psychiatric diseases besides the sex or the age of the
subject, if large and high-quality neuroimaging datasets become available.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.01410</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In this paper, we propose a novel pooling layer for graph neural networks
based on maximizing the mutual information between the pooled graph and the
input graph. Since the maximum mutual information is difficult to compute, we
employ the Shannon capacity of a graph as an inductive bias to our pooling
method. More precisely, we show that the input graph to the pooling layer can
be viewed as a representation of a noisy communication channel. For such a
channel, sending the symbols belonging to an independent set of the graph
yields a reliable and error-free transmission of information. We show that
reaching the maximum mutual information is equivalent to finding a maximum
weight independent set of the graph where the weights convey entropy contents.
Through this communication theoretic standpoint, we provide a distinct
perspective for posing the problem of graph pooling as maximizing the
information transmission rate across a noisy communication channel, implemented
by a graph neural network. We evaluate our method, referred to as Maximum
Entropy Weighted Independent Set Pooling (MEWISPool), on graph classification
tasks and the combinatorial optimization problem of the maximum independent
set. Empirical results demonstrate that our method achieves the
state-of-the-art and competitive results on graph classification tasks and the
maximum independent set problem in several benchmark datasets.

	<title>The Cerebellum: Quality of Life since Pre-Ataxic Phases of Spinocerebellar Ataxia Type 3/Machado–Joseph Disease</title>
	<link>http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s12311-021-01299-8</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Although health-related quality of life (HRQoL) has been increasingly valued in healthcare and in clinical trials, there is scarce information about it in spinocerebellar ataxia type 3/Machado–Joseph disease (SCA3/MJD). This study describes the HRQoL results obtained from ataxic SCA3/MJD subjects, and their non-ataxic offspring included in the BIGPRO (Biomarkers and genetic modifiers in a study of presymptomatic and symptomatic SCA3/MJD carriers) study. Demographic data, clinical scales, and HRQoL instruments EQ-5D-3L and SF-36 were collected. Subjects at 50% risk were genotyped in a double-blind manner. The time left until the onset of the disease was estimated for mutation carriers with a SARA &amp;lt; 3 and combined with disease duration of ataxic subjects (TimeToAfterOnset). Analyses were performed using PASW Statistics version 18.0, R version 4.0.0, and G*Power 3.1, and &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Twenty-three ataxic carriers, 33 pre-ataxic carriers, and 21 controls were enrolled. Significant differences between ataxic carriers and controls were seen in EQ-VAS, EQ-5D Index, and in some domains of EQ-5D-3L and SF-36. EQ-5D Index showed the best effect size between ataxic and controls (Cohen’s &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;d&lt;/em&gt; = 2.423). Stepwise changes were seen in pre-ataxic subjects, although not statistically significant. TimeToAfterOnset correlated with EQ-5D Index, EQ-VAS, and SF-36 Physical functioning, Role Physical, Pain, and General Health. EQ-5D Index and EQ-VAS correlated with clinical scales in the ataxic group. These results suggest that HRQoL worsens among carriers since pre-ataxic stages and that they might encompass the underlying disease process. In this cohort, SF-36 Physical Functioning, SF-36 General health, and especially EQ-5D Index and EQ-VAS were the best HRQoL instruments to be used as ancillary evidence to support biological and social meanings for future interventions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>The Cerebellum: The Cost of Living with Inherited Ataxia in Ireland</title>

	<content:encoded>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Inherited ataxias are a heterogenous group of neurodegenerative disorders characterised by progressive impairment of balance and coordination, typically leading to permanent and progressive disability. Diagnosis and management of these disorders incurs a range of direct and indirect financial costs. The aim of this study was to collect individual ataxia-related healthcare resources in a large cohort of individuals with different subtypes of inherited ataxia and calculate the associated cost of illness in the Republic of Ireland. One hundred twenty-nine respondents completed a cross-sectional study on healthcare resource utilisation for progressive ataxia in Ireland. Costs were calculated using a prevalence-based approach and bottom-up methodology. The COI for inherited ataxia in 2016 was €59,993 per person per year. Results were similar between participants with Friedreich’s ataxia (FRDA, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 56), non-FRDA (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 18) and those with undetermined ataxia (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 55). Indirect costs, based on productivity losses by participants or caregivers, accounted for 52% of the cost of illness. Inherited ataxia is associated with significant health and social care costs. Further funding for inherited ataxia to ease the financial burden on patients, caregivers and healthcare system and improve standards of care compliance is warranted.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Experimental Brain Research: White matter deficits correlate with visual motion perception impairments in dyslexic carriers of the DCDC2 genetic risk variant</title>

	<content:encoded>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Motion perception deficits in dyslexia show a large intersubjective variability, partly reflecting genetic factors influencing brain architecture development. In previous work, we have demonstrated that dyslexic carriers of a mutation of the &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;DCDC2&lt;/em&gt; gene have a very strong impairment in motion perception. In the present study, we investigated structural white matter alterations associated with the poor motion perception in a cohort of twenty dyslexics with a subgroup carrying the DCDC2 gene deletion (DCDC2d+) and a subgroup without the risk variant (DCDC2d–). We observed significant deficits in motion contrast sensitivity and in motion direction discrimination accuracy at high contrast, stronger in the DCDC2d+ group. Both motion perception impairments correlated significantly with the fractional anisotropy in posterior ventral and dorsal tracts, including early visual pathways both along the optic radiation and in proximity of occipital cortex, MT and VWFA. However, the DCDC2d+ group showed stronger correlations between FA and motion perception impairments than the DCDC2d– group in early visual white matter bundles, including the optic radiations, and in ventral pathways located in the left inferior temporal cortex. Our results suggest that the DCDC2d+ group experiences higher vulnerability in visual motion processing even at early stages of visual analysis, which might represent a specific feature associated with the genotype and provide further neurobiological support to the visual-motion deficit account of dyslexia in a specific subpopulation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2021.670404</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Most mental disorders originate in childhood, and once symptoms present, a variety of psychosocial and cognitive maladjustments may arise. Although early childhood problems are generally associated with later mental health impairments and psychopathology, pluripotent transdiagnostic trajectories may manifest. Possible predictors range from behavioral and neurobiological mechanisms, genetic predispositions, environmental and social factors, and psychopathological comorbidity. They may manifest in altered neurodevelopmental trajectories and need to be validated capitalizing on large-scale multi-modal epidemiological longitudinal cohorts. Moreover, clinical and etiological variability between patients with the same disorders represents a major obstacle to develop effective treatments. Hence, in order to achieve stratification of patient samples opening the avenue of adapting and optimizing treatment for the individual, there is a need to integrate data from multi-dimensionally phenotyped clinical cohorts and cross-validate them with epidemiological cohort data. In the present review, we discuss these aspects in the context of externalizing and internalizing disorders summarizing the current state of knowledge, obstacles, and pitfalls. Although a large number of studies have already increased our understanding on neuropsychobiological mechanisms of mental disorders, it became also clear that this knowledge might only be the tip of the Eisberg and that a large proportion still remains unknown. We discuss prediction strategies and how the integration of different factors and methods may provide useful contributions to research and at the same time may inform prevention and intervention.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience: How Energy Supports Our Brain to Yield Consciousness: Insights From Neuroimaging Based on the Neuroenergetics Hypothesis</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2021.648860</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Consciousness is considered a result of specific neuronal processes and mechanisms in the brain. Various suggested neuronal mechanisms, including the information integration theory (IIT), global neuronal workspace theory (GNWS), and neuronal construction of time and space as in the context of the temporospatial theory of consciousness (TTC), have been laid forth. However, despite their focus on different neuronal mechanisms, these theories neglect the energetic-metabolic basis of the neuronal mechanisms that are supposed to yield consciousness. Based on the findings of physiology-induced (sleep), pharmacology-induced (general anesthesia), and pathology-induced [vegetative state/unresponsive wakeful syndrome (VS/UWS)] loss of consciousness in both human subjects and animals, we, in this study, suggest that the energetic-metabolic processes focusing on ATP, glucose, and γ-aminobutyrate/glutamate are indispensable for functional connectivity (FC) of normal brain networks that renders consciousness possible. Therefore, we describe the energetic-metabolic predispositions of consciousness (EPC) that complement the current theories focused on the neural correlates of consciousness (NCC).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Synaptic Neuroscience: Fear Memory Retrieval Is Associated With a Reduction in AMPA Receptor Density at Thalamic to Amygdala Intercalated Cell Synapses</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsyn.2021.634558</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The amygdala plays a crucial role in attaching emotional significance to environmental cues. Its intercalated cell masses (ITC) are tight clusters of GABAergic neurons, which are distributed around the basolateral amygdala complex. Distinct ITC clusters are involved in the acquisition and extinction of conditioned fear responses. Previously, we have shown that fear memory retrieval reduces the AMPA/NMDA ratio at thalamic afferents to ITC neurons within the dorsal medio-paracapsular cluster. Here, we investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying the fear-mediated reduction in the AMPA/NMDA ratio at these synapses and, in particular, whether specific changes in the synaptic density of AMPA receptors underlie the observed change. To this aim, we used a detergent-digested freeze-fracture replica immunolabeling technique (FRIL) approach that enables to visualize the spatial distribution of intrasynaptic AMPA receptors at high resolution. AMPA receptors were detected using an antibody raised against an epitope common to all AMPA subunits. To visualize thalamic inputs, we virally transduced the posterior thalamic complex with Channelrhodopsin 2-YFP, which is anterogradely transported along axons. Using face-matched replica, we confirmed that the postsynaptic elements were ITC neurons due to their prominent expression of μ-opioid receptors. With this approach, we show that, following auditory fear conditioning in mice, the formation and retrieval of fear memory is linked to a significant reduction in the density of AMPA receptors, particularly at spine synapses formed by inputs of the posterior intralaminar thalamic and medial geniculate nuclei onto identified ITC neurons. Our study is one of the few that has directly linked the regulation of AMPA receptor trafficking to memory processes in identified neuronal networks, by showing that fear-memory induced reduction in AMPA/NMDA ratio at thalamic-ITC synapses is associated with a reduced postsynaptic AMPA receptor density.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Risperidone Mitigates Enhanced Excitatory Neuronal Function and Repetitive Behavior Caused by an ASD-Associated Mutation of SIK1</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2021.706494</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Six mutations in the salt-inducible kinase 1 (SIK1)-coding gene have been identified in patients with early infantile epileptic encephalopathy (EIEE-30) accompanied by autistic symptoms. Two of the mutations are non-sense mutations that truncate the C-terminal region of SIK1. It has been shown that the C-terminal-truncated form of SIK1 protein affects the subcellular distribution of SIK1 protein, tempting to speculate the relevance to the pathophysiology of the disorders. We generated SIK1-mutant (SIK1-MT) mice recapitulating the C-terminal-truncated mutations using CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing. SIK1-MT protein was distributed in the nucleus and cytoplasm, whereas the distribution of wild-type SIK1 was restricted to the nucleus. We found the disruption of excitatory and inhibitory (E/I) synaptic balance due to an increase in excitatory synaptic transmission and enhancement of neural excitability in the pyramidal neurons in layer 5 of the medial prefrontal cortex in SIK1-MT mice. We also found the increased repetitive behavior and social behavioral deficits in SIK1-MT mice. The risperidone administration attenuated the neural excitability and excitatory synaptic transmission, but the disrupted E/I synaptic balance was unchanged, because it also reduced the inhibitory synaptic transmission. Risperidone also eliminated the repetitive behavior but not social behavioral deficits. These results indicate that risperidone has a role in decreasing neuronal excitability and excitatory synapses, ameliorating repetitive behavior in the SIK1-truncated mice.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Trigeminal nerve injury is known to cause severe persistent pain in the orofacial region. This pain is difficult to diagnose and treat. Recently, many animal studies have reported that rewiring of the peripheral and central nervous systems, non-neuronal cell activation, and up- and down-regulation of various molecules in non-neuronal cells are involved in the development of this pain following trigeminal nerve injury. However, there are many unknown mechanisms underlying the persistent orofacial pain associated with trigeminal nerve injury. In this review, we address recent animal data regarding the involvement of various molecules in the communication of neuronal and non-neuronal cells and examine the possible involvement of ascending pathways in processing pathological orofacial pain. We also address the clinical observations of persistent orofacial pain associated with trigeminal nerve injury and clinical approaches to their diagnosis and treatment.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Impaired SNF2L Chromatin Remodeling Prolongs Accessibility at Promoters Enriched for Fos/Jun Binding Sites and Delays Granule Neuron Differentiation</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2021.680280</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Chromatin remodeling proteins utilize the energy from ATP hydrolysis to mobilize nucleosomes often creating accessibility for transcription factors within gene regulatory elements. Aberrant chromatin remodeling has diverse effects on neuroprogenitor homeostasis altering progenitor competence, proliferation, survival, or cell fate. Previous work has shown that inactivation of the ISWI genes, Smarca5 (encoding Snf2h) and Smarca1 (encoding Snf2l) have dramatic effects on brain development. Smarca5 conditional knockout mice have reduced progenitor expansion and severe forebrain hypoplasia, with a similar effect on the postnatal growth of the cerebellum. In contrast, Smarca1 mutants exhibited enlarged forebrains with delayed progenitor differentiation and increased neuronal output. Here, we utilized cerebellar granule neuron precursor (GNP) cultures from Smarca1 mutant mice (Ex6DEL) to explore the requirement for Snf2l on progenitor homeostasis. The Ex6DEL GNPs showed delayed differentiation upon plating that was not attributed to changes in the Sonic Hedgehog pathway but was associated with overexpression of numerous positive effectors of proliferation, including targets of Wnt activation. Transcriptome analysis identified increased expression of Fosb and Fosl2 while ATACseq experiments identified a large increase in chromatin accessibility at promoters many enriched for Fos/Jun binding sites. Nonetheless, the elevated proliferation index was transient and the Ex6DEL cultures initiated differentiation with a high concordance in gene expression changes to the wild type cultures. Genes specific to Ex6DEL differentiation were associated with an increased activation of the ERK signaling pathway. Taken together, this data provides the first indication of how Smarca1 mutations alter progenitor cell homeostasis and contribute to changes in brain size.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neural Technology: A Novel Cognition-Guided Neurofeedback BCI Dataset on Nicotine Addiction</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.647844</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Compared with the traditional neurofeedback paradigm, the cognition-guided neurofeedback brain–computer interface (BCI) is a novel paradigm with significant effect on nicotine addiction. However, the cognition-guided neurofeedback BCI dataset is extremely lacking at present. This paper provides a BCI dataset based on a novel cognition-guided neurofeedback on nicotine addiction. Twenty-eight participants are recruited and involved in two visits of neurofeedback training. This cognition-guided neurofeedback includes two phases: an offline classifier construction and a real-time neurofeedback training. The original electroencephalogram (EEG) raw data of two phases are provided and evaluated in this paper. The event-related potential (ERP) amplitude and channel waveform suggest that our BCI dataset is of good quality and consistency. During neurofeedback training, the participants’ smoking cue reactivity patterns have a significant reduction. The mean accuracy of the multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) classifier can reach approximately 70%. This novel cognition-guided neurofeedback BCI dataset can be used to develop comparisons with other neurofeedback systems and provide a reference for the development of other BCI algorithms and neurofeedback paradigms on addiction.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroinformatics: MIIND : A Model-Agnostic Simulator of Neural Populations</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fninf.2021.614881</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;MIIND is a software platform for easily and efficiently simulating the behaviour of interacting populations of point neurons governed by any 1D or 2D dynamical system. The simulator is entirely agnostic to the underlying neuron model of each population and provides an intuitive method for controlling the amount of noise which can significantly affect the overall behaviour. A network of populations can be set up quickly and easily using MIIND's XML-style simulation file format describing simulation parameters such as how populations interact, transmission delays, post-synaptic potentials, and what output to record. During simulation, a visual display of each population's state is provided for immediate feedback of the behaviour and population activity can be output to a file or passed to a Python script for further processing. The Python support also means that MIIND can be integrated into other software such as The Virtual Brain. MIIND's population density technique is a geometric and visual method for describing the activity of each neuron population which encourages a deep consideration of the dynamics of the neuron model and provides insight into how the behaviour of each population is affected by the behaviour of its neighbours in the network. For 1D neuron models, MIIND performs far better than direct simulation solutions for large populations. For 2D models, performance comparison is more nuanced but the population density approach still confers certain advantages over direct simulation. MIIND can be used to build neural systems that bridge the scales between an individual neuron model and a population network. This allows researchers to maintain a plausible path back from mesoscopic to microscopic scales while minimising the complexity of managing large numbers of interconnected neurons. In this paper, we introduce the MIIND system, its usage, and provide implementation details where appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: How Action Shapes Body Ownership Momentarily and Throughout the Lifespan</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.697810</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Objects which a human agent controls by efferent activities (such as real or virtual tools) can be perceived by the agent as belonging to his or her body. This suggests that what an agent counts as “body” is plastic, depending on what she or he controls. Yet there are possible limitations for such momentary plasticity. One of these limitations is that sensations stemming from the body (e.g., proprioception) and sensations stemming from objects outside the body (e.g., vision) are not integrated if they do not sufficiently “match”. What “matches” and what does not is conceivably determined by long–term experience with the perceptual changes that body movements typically produce. Children have accumulated less sensorimotor experience than adults have. Consequently, they express higher flexibility to integrate body-internal and body-external signals, independent of their “match” as suggested by rubber hand illusion studies. However, children’s motor performance in tool use is more affected by mismatching body-internal and body-external action effects than that of adults, possibly because of less developed means to overcome such mismatches. We review research on perception-action interactions, multisensory integration, and developmental psychology to build bridges between these research fields. By doing so, we account for the flexibility of the sense of body ownership for actively controlled events and its development through ontogeny. This gives us the opportunity to validate the suggested mechanisms for generating ownership by investigating their effects in still developing and incomplete stages in children. We suggest testable predictions for future studies investigating both body ownership and motor skills throughout the lifespan.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Dynamic Functional Connectivity Predicts Treatment Response to Electroconvulsive Therapy in Major Depressive Disorder</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.689488</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Background: Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is one of the most effective treatments for major depressive disorder. Recently, there has been increasing attention to evaluate the effect of ECT on resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI). This study aims to compare rs-fMRI of depressive disorder (DEP) patients with healthy participants, investigate whether pre-ECT dynamic functional network connectivity network (dFNC) estimated from patients rs-fMRI is associated with an eventual ECT outcome, and explore the effect of ECT on brain network states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Method: Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data were collected from 119 patients with depression or depressive disorder (DEP) (76 females), and 61 healthy (HC) participants (34 females), with an age mean of 52.25 (N = 180) years old. The pre-ECT and post-ECT Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) were 25.59 ± 6.14 and 11.48 ± 9.07, respectively. Twenty-four independent components from default mode (DMN) and cognitive control network (CCN) were extracted, using group-independent component analysis from pre-ECT and post-ECT rs-fMRI. Then, the sliding window approach was used to estimate the pre-and post-ECT dFNC of each subject. Next, k-means clustering was separately applied to pre-ECT dFNC and post-ECT dFNC to assess three distinct states from each participant. We calculated the amount of time each subject spends in each state, which is called “occupancy rate” or OCR. Next, we compared OCR values between HC and DEP participants. We also calculated the partial correlation between pre-ECT OCRs and HDRS change while controlling for age, gender, and site. Finally, we evaluated the effectiveness of ECT by comparing pre- and post-ECT OCR of DEP and HC participants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: The main findings include (1) depressive disorder (DEP) patients had significantly lower OCR values than the HC group in state 2, where connectivity between cognitive control network (CCN) and default mode network (DMN) was relatively higher than other states (corrected p = 0.015), (2) Pre-ECT OCR of state, with more negative connectivity between CCN and DMN components, is linked with the HDRS changes (R = 0.23 corrected p = 0.03). This means that those DEP patients who spent less time in this state showed more HDRS change, and (3) The post-ECT OCR analysis suggested that ECT increased the amount of time DEP patients spent in state 2 (corrected p = 0.03).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: Our finding suggests that dynamic functional network connectivity (dFNC) features, estimated from CCN and DMN, show promise as a predictive biomarker of the ECT outcome of DEP patients. Also, this study identifies a possible underlying mechanism associated with the ECT effect on DEP patients.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Cerebral White Matter Myelination and Relations to Age, Gender, and Cognition: A Selective Review</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.662031</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;White matter makes up about fifty percent of the human brain. Maturation of white matter accompanies biological development and undergoes the most dramatic changes during childhood and adolescence. Despite the advances in neuroimaging techniques, controversy concerning spatial, and temporal patterns of myelination, as well as the degree to which the microstructural characteristics of white matter can vary in a healthy brain as a function of age, gender and cognitive abilities still exists. In a selective review we describe methods of assessing myelination and evaluate effects of age and gender in nine major fiber tracts, highlighting their role in higher-order cognitive functions. Our findings suggests that myelination indices vary by age, fiber tract, and hemisphere. Effects of gender were also identified, although some attribute differences to methodological factors or social and learning opportunities. Findings point to further directions of research that will improve our understanding of the complex myelination-behavior relation across development that may have implications for educational and clinical practice.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neural Circuits: Contextual Fear Memory Maintenance Changes Expression of pMAPK, BDNF and IBA-1 in the Pre-limbic Cortex in a Layer-Specific Manner</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncir.2021.660199</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a debilitating and chronic fear-based disorder. Pavlovian fear conditioning protocols have long been utilised to manipulate and study these fear-based disorders. Contextual fear conditioning (CFC) is a particular Pavlovian conditioning procedure that pairs fear with a particular context. Studies on the neural mechanisms underlying the development of contextual fear memories have identified the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), or more specifically, the pre-limbic cortex (PL) of the mPFC as essential for the expression of contextual fear. Despite this, little research has explored the role of the PL in contextual fear memory maintenance or examined the role of neuronal mitogen-activated protein kinase (pMAPK; ERK 1/2), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and IBA-1 in microglia in the PL as a function of Pavlovian fear conditioning. The current study was designed to evaluate how the maintenance of two different long-term contextual fear memories leads to changes in the number of immune-positive cells for two well-known markers of neural activity (phosphorylation of MAPK and BDNF) and microglia (IBA-1). Therefore, the current experiment is designed to assess the number of immune-positive pMAPK and BDNF cells, microglial number, and morphology in the PL following CFC. Specifically, 2 weeks following conditioning, pMAPK, BDNF, and microglia number and morphology were evaluated using well-validated antibodies and immunohistochemistry (n = 12 rats per group). A standard CFC protocol applied to rats led to increases in pMAPK, BDNF expression and microglia number as compared to control conditions. Rats in the unpaired fear conditioning (UFC) procedure, despite having equivalent levels of fear to context, did not have any change in pMAPK, BDNF expression and microglia number in the PL compared to the control conditions. These data suggest that alterations in the expression of pMAPK, BDNF, and microglia in the PL can occur for up to 2 weeks following CFC. Together the data suggest that MAPK, BDNF, and microglia within the PL of the mPFC may play a role in contextual fear memory maintenance.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.698126</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The immune system is crucial for defending against various invaders, such as pathogens, cancer cells or misfolded proteins. With increasing age, the diminishing immune response, known as immunosenescence, becomes evident. Concomitantly, some diseases like infections, autoimmune diseases, chronic inflammatory diseases and cancer, accumulate with age. Different cell types are part of the innate immunity response and produce soluble factors, cytokines, chemokines, and type I interferons. Improper maturation of innate immune cells or their dysfunction have been linked to numerous age-related diseases. In parallel to the occurrence of the many functional facets of the immune response, a symbiotic microbiota had been acquired. For the relevant and situation-dependent function of the immune system the microbiome plays an essential role because it fine-tunes the immune system and its responses during life. Nevertheless, how the age-related alterations in the microbiota are reflected in the innate immune system, is still poorly understood. With this review, we provide an up-to-date overview on our present understanding of the gut microbiota effects on innate immunity, with a particular emphasis on aging-associated changes in the gut microbiota and the implications for the brain innate immune response.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Anterior Cingulate Cortex Activity During Rest Is Related to Alterations in Pain Perception in Aging</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.695200</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Alterations in the affective component of pain perception are related to the development of chronic pain and may contribute to the increased vulnerability to pain observed in aging. The present study analyzed age-related changes in resting-state brain activity and their possible relation to an increased pain perception in older adults. For this purpose, we compared EEG current source density and fMRI functional-connectivity at rest in older (n = 20, 66.21 ± 3.08 years) and younger adults (n = 21, 20.71 ± 2.30 years) and correlated those brain activity parameters with pain intensity and unpleasantness ratings elicited by painful stimulation. We found an age-related increase in beta2 and beta3 activity in temporal, frontal, and limbic areas, and a decrease in alpha activity in frontal areas. Moreover, older participants displayed increased functional connectivity in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and the insula with precentral and postcentral gyrus. Finally, ACC beta3 activity was positively correlated with pain intensity and unpleasantness ratings in older, and ACC-precentral/postcentral gyrus connectivity was positively correlated with unpleasantness ratings in older and younger participants. These results reveal that ACC resting-state hyperactivity is a stable trait of brain aging and may underlie their characteristic altered pain perception.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Tobacco Smoking Increases Methylation of Polypyrimidine Tract Binding Protein 1 Promoter in Intracranial Aneurysms</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.688179</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;DNA methylation at the gene promoter region is reportedly involved in the development of intracranial aneurysm (IA). This study aims to investigate the methylation levels of polypyrimidine tract-binding protein 1 (PTBP1) in IA, as well as its potential to predict IA. Forty-eight patients with IA and 48 age- and sex-matched healthy controls were recruited into this study. Methylation levels of CpG sites were determined via bisulfite pyrosequencing. The PTBP1 levels in the blood were determined using a real-time quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction test. Significant differences were found between IAs and controls in CpG1 (p = 0.001), CpG2 (p &amp;lt; 0.001), CpG3 (p = 0.037), CpG4 (p = 0.003), CpG5 (p = 0.006), CpG6 (p = 0.02), and mean methylation (p &amp;lt; 0.001). The mRNA level of PTBP1 in the blood was much lower in IAs compared with controls (p = 0.002), and the PTBP1 expression was significantly associated with DNA methylation promoter levels in individuals (r = −0.73, p &amp;lt; 0.0001). In addition, stratification analysis comparing smokers and non-smokers revealed that tobacco smokers had significantly higher levels of DNA methylation in PTBP1 than non-smokers (p = 0.002). However, no statistical difference in PTBP1 methylation was found between ruptured and unruptured IA groups (p &amp;gt; 0.05). The ROC analyses of curves revealed that PTBP1 methylation may be a predictor of IA regardless of sex (both sexes, area under curve (AUC) = 0.78, p &amp;lt; 0.0001; male, AUC = 0.76, p = 0.002; female, AUC = 0.79, p &amp;lt; 0.0001). These findings suggest that long-term tobacco smoke exposure led to DNA methylation in the promoter region of the PTBP1 gene, which further decreased PTBP1 gene expression and participated in the pathogenesis of IA. The methylation of PTBP1 may be a potential predictive marker for the occurrence of IA.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Introduction&lt;p&gt;In Alzheimer’s disease, the severity of symptoms is linked to a loss of synaptic density and the spread of pathologically hyperphosphorylated tau. The established cerebrospinal fluid markers Aβ, tau and phospho-tau reflect the histopathological hallmarks of Alzheimer’s disease but do not indicate disease progression. Such markers are of special interest, especially for trials of disease modifying drugs. Microvesicles are produced by stressed cells and reflect part of the metabolism of their cells of origin. Therefore, we investigated microvesicles of neuronal origin in cerebrospinal fluid.&lt;/p&gt;Materials and Methods&lt;p&gt;We used flow cytometry to analyze microvesicles carrying tau, phospho-tau-Thr181, phospho-tau-Ser202Thr205, synaptophysin, and SNAP-25 in the cerebrospinal fluid of 19 patients with Alzheimer’s disease and 15 non-inflammatory neurological disease controls.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;The percentages of synaptophysin-bearing microvesicles were significantly higher in the cerebrospinal fluid of patients with Alzheimer’s disease than in the CSF of non-inflammatory neurological disease controls. Tau, phospho-tau-Thr181, phospho-tau-Ser202Thr205, and SNAP-25 did not differ between the groups. The percentages of synaptophysin-bearing vesicles distinguished patients with Alzheimer’s disease from the controls (AUC = 0.81).&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;The loss of synapses in Alzheimer’s disease may be reflected by synaptophysin-bearing microvesicles in the cerebrospinal fluid.

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: The Impact of Age on Mortality and Disability in Patients With Ischemic Stroke Who Underwent Cerebral Reperfusion Therapy: A Brazilian Cohort Study</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.649902</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Introduction: The main driver for increased stroke prevalence is the aging of the population; however, the best evidenced-based strategies for stroke treatment and prevention are not always followed for older patients. Therefore, the aim was studying the association of age with clinical outcomes (mortality and functional disability) in stroke patients who underwent cerebral reperfusion therapy at hospital discharge and 90 days after ictus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: This was a retrospective (stroke databank analysis) cohort study of participants who had been diagnosed with ischemic stroke and undergone intravenous cerebral reperfusion therapy or mechanical thrombectomy. The variable of interest was patient age, which was categorized into four groups: (1) up to 59 years; (2) 60 to 69 years; (3) 70 to 79 years old; and (4) above 79 years. The primary outcome was mortality at hospital discharge and 90 days after stroke, and the secondary outcome was functional capacity at hospital discharge and 90 days after stroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: A total of 281 patients was included in the study (235 treated by thrombolysis alone, and 46 treated with mechanical thrombectomy). The mean age of the total sample was 67 ± 13.1 years. The oldest patients had the most unfavorable outcomes, except for mortality rate, at hospital discharge (mRS &amp;gt; 2; OR: 1.028; 95% CI 1.005 to 1.051; p = 0.017; mRS &amp;gt; 3; OR: 1.043, 95% CI 1.018 to 1.069; p = 0.001) and 90 days after stroke (mRS &amp;gt; 2; OR: 1.028; 95% CI 1.005 to 1.051; p = 0.017; mRS &amp;gt; 3; OR: 1.043, 95% CI 1.018 to 1.069; p = 0.001).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: Cerebral reperfusion was a viable treatment for ischemic stroke in both elderly and very elderly patients, as it did not increase mortality. However, it was observed that older individuals had worse functional outcomes at hospital discharge and 90 days after stroke.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Pericytes have been implicated in various neuropathologies, yet, little is known about their function and signaling pathways in health. Here, we characterized calcium dynamics of cortical mural cells in anesthetized or awake &lt;i&gt;Pdgfrb&lt;/i&gt;-CreERT2;Rosa26 mice and in acute brain slices. Smooth muscle cells (SMCs) and ensheathing pericytes (EPs), also named as terminal vascular SMCs, revealed similar calcium dynamics &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. In contrast, calcium signals in capillary pericytes (CPs) were irregular, higher in frequency and occurred in cellular microdomains. In the absence of the vessel constricting agent U46619 in acute slices, SMCs and EPs revealed only sparse calcium signals whereas CPs retained their spontaneous calcium activity. Interestingly, chemogenetic activation of neurons &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; and acute elevations of extracellular potassium in brain slices strongly decreased calcium activity in CPs. We propose that neuronal activation and an extracellular increase in potassium suppress calcium activity in CPs, likely mediated by Kir2.2 and K&lt;sub&gt;ATP&lt;/sub&gt; channels.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: Genetic depletion studies inform receptor usage by virulent hantaviruses in human endothelial cells</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/69708</link>
	<content:encoded>Hantaviruses are RNA viruses with known epidemic threat and potential for emergence. Several rodent-borne hantaviruses cause zoonoses accompanied by severe illness and death. However, assessments of zoonotic risk and the development of countermeasures are challenged by our limited knowledge of the molecular mechanisms of hantavirus infection, including the identities of cell entry receptors and their roles in influencing viral host range and virulence. Despite the long-standing presumption that β3/β1-containing integrins are the major hantavirus entry receptors, rigorous genetic loss-of-function evidence supporting their requirement, and that of decay-accelerating factor (DAF), is lacking. Here, we used CRISPR/Cas9 engineering to knockout candidate hantavirus receptors, singly and in combination, in a human endothelial cell line that recapitulates the properties of primary microvascular endothelial cells, the major targets of viral infection in humans. The loss of β3 integrin, β1 integrin, and/or DAF had little or no effect on entry by a large panel of hantaviruses. By contrast, loss of protocadherin-1, a recently identified entry receptor for some hantaviruses, substantially reduced hantavirus entry and infection. We conclude that major host molecules necessary for endothelial cell entry by PCDH1-independent hantaviruses remain to be discovered.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: Improving statistical power in severe malaria genetic association studies by augmenting phenotypic precision</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/69698</link>
	<content:encoded>Severe falciparum malaria has substantially affected human evolution. Genetic association studies of patients with clinically defined severe malaria and matched population controls have helped characterise human genetic susceptibility to severe malaria, but phenotypic imprecision compromises discovered associations. In areas of high malaria transmission the diagnosis of severe malaria in young children and, in particular, the distinction from bacterial sepsis, is imprecise. We developed a probabilistic diagnostic model of severe malaria using platelet and white count data. Under this model we re-analysed clinical and genetic data from 2,220 Kenyan children with clinically defined severe malaria and 3,940 population controls, adjusting for phenotype mis-labelling. Our model, validated by the distribution of sickle trait, estimated that approximately one third of cases did not have severe malaria. We propose a data-tilting approach for case-control studies with phenotype mis-labelling and show that this reduces false discovery rates and improves statistical power in genome-wide association studies.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: Novel neuroanatomical integration and scaling define avian brain shape evolution and development</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/68809</link>
	<content:encoded>How do large and unique brains evolve? Historically, comparative neuroanatomical studies have attributed the evolutionary genesis of highly encephalized brains to deviations along, as well as from, conserved scaling relationships among brain regions. However, the relative contributions of these concerted (integrated) and mosaic (modular) processes as drivers of brain evolution remain unclear, especially in non-mammalian groups. While proportional brain sizes have been the predominant metric used to characterize brain morphology to date, we perform a high-density geometric morphometric analysis on the encephalized brains of crown birds (Neornithes or Aves) compared to their stem taxa—the non-avialan coelurosaurian dinosaurs and &lt;i&gt;Archaeopteryx&lt;/i&gt;. When analyzed together with developmental neuroanatomical data of model archosaurs (&lt;i&gt;Gallus&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Alligator&lt;/i&gt;), crown birds exhibit a distinct allometric relationship that dictates their brain evolution and development. Furthermore, analyses by neuroanatomical regions reveal that the acquisition of this derived shape-to-size scaling relationship occurred in a mosaic pattern, where the avian-grade optic lobe and cerebellum evolved first among non-avialan dinosaurs, followed by major changes to the evolutionary and developmental dynamics of cerebrum shape after the origin of Avialae. Notably, the brain of crown birds is a more integrated structure than non-avialan archosaurs, implying that diversification of brain morphologies within Neornithes proceeded in a more coordinated manner, perhaps due to spatial constraints and abbreviated growth period. Collectively, these patterns demonstrate a plurality in evolutionary processes that generate encephalized brains in archosaurs and across vertebrates.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/66876</link>
	<content:encoded>The normal wound healing process is characterised by proteolytic events, whereas infection results in dysfunctional activations by endogenous and bacterial proteases. Peptides, downstream reporters of these proteolytic actions, could therefore serve as a promising tool for diagnosis of wounds. Using mass-spectrometry analyses, we here for the first time characterise the peptidome of human wound fluids. Sterile post-surgical wound fluids were found to contain a high degree of peptides in comparison to human plasma. Analyses of the peptidome from uninfected healing wounds and &lt;i&gt;Staphylococcus aureus&lt;/i&gt; -infected wounds identify unique peptide patterns of various proteins, including coagulation and complement factors, proteases, and antiproteinases. Together, the work defines a workflow for analysis of peptides derived from wound fluids and demonstrates a proof-of-concept that such fluids can be used for analysis of qualitative differences of peptide patterns from larger patient cohorts, providing potential biomarkers for wound healing and infection.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/66036</link>
	<content:encoded>Ornithischian dinosaurs were ecologically prominent herbivores of the Mesozoic Era that achieved a global distribution by the onset of the Cretaceous. The ornithischian body plan is aberrant relative to other ornithodiran clades, and crucial details of their early evolution remain obscure. We present a new, fully articulated skeleton of the early branching ornithischian &lt;i&gt;Heterodontosaurus tucki&lt;/i&gt;. Phase-contrast enhanced synchrotron data of this new specimen reveal a suite of novel postcranial features unknown in any other ornithischian, with implications for the early evolution of the group. These features include a large, anteriorly projecting sternum; bizarre, paddle-shaped sternal ribs; and a full gastral basket – the first recovered in Ornithischia. These unusual anatomical traits provide key information on the evolution of the ornithischian body plan and suggest functional shifts in the ventilatory apparatus occurred close to the base of the clade. We complement these anatomical data with a quantitative analysis of ornithischian pelvic architecture, which allows us to make a specific, stepwise hypothesis for their ventilatory evolution.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/65930</link>
	<content:encoded>Hair cells, the receptors of the inner ear, detect sounds by transducing mechanical vibrations into electrical signals. From the top surface of each hair cell protrudes a mechanical antenna, the hair bundle, which the cell uses to detect and amplify auditory stimuli, thus sharpening frequency selectivity and providing a broad dynamic range. Current methods for mechanically stimulating hair bundles are too slow to encompass the frequency range of mammalian hearing and are plagued by inconsistencies. To overcome these challenges, we have developed a method to move individual hair bundles with photonic force. This technique uses an optical fiber whose tip is tapered to a diameter of a few micrometers and endowed with a ball lens to minimize divergence of the light beam. Here we describe the fabrication, characterization, and application of this optical system and demonstrate the rapid application of photonic force to vestibular and cochlear hair cells.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: Cortico-autonomic local arousals and heightened somatosensory arousability during NREM sleep of mice in neuropathic pain</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/65835</link>
	<content:encoded>Frequent nightly arousals typical for sleep disorders cause daytime fatigue and present health risks. As such arousals are often short, partial, or occur locally within the brain, reliable characterization in rodent models of sleep disorders and in human patients is challenging. We found that the EEG spectral composition of non-rapid-eye-movement sleep (NREMS) in healthy mice shows an infraslow (~50 s) interval over which microarousals appear preferentially. NREMS could hence be vulnerable to abnormal arousals on this time scale. Chronic pain is well-known to disrupt sleep. In the spared-nerve-injury (SNI) mouse model of chronic neuropathic pain, we found more numerous local cortical arousals accompanied by heart rate increases in hindlimb primary somatosensory, but not in prelimbic, cortices, although sleep macroarchitecture appeared unaltered. Closed-loop mechanovibrational stimulation further revealed higher sensory arousability. Chronic pain thus preserved conventional sleep measures but resulted in elevated spontaneous and evoked arousability. We develop a novel moment-to-moment probing of NREMS vulnerability and propose that chronic pain-induced sleep complaints arise from perturbed arousability.</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: Molecular cell identities in the mediodorsal thalamus of infant mice and marmoset</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cne.25203?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>The mediodorsal thalamus (MD) can be divided into three distinctive regions, which project to the different cortical areas. Here we searched for subdivision‐specific molecular markers in developing mouse MD thalamus. We made an MD region‐specific Cre mouse line based on this search, which clearly shows specific projections to PrL/IL and AID in PFC. Further, we showed molecular organization in developing common marmoset, which showed dynamic expression differences compared to mouse MD, suggesting diverse MD function and connectivity in different species.







Abstract
The mediodorsal thalamus (MD) is a higher‐order nucleus located within the central thalamus in many mammalian species. Emerging evidence from MD lesions and tracer injections suggests that the MD is reciprocally connected to the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and plays an essential role in specific cognitive processes and tasks. MD subdivisions (medial, central, and lateral) are poorly segregated at the molecular level in rodents, leading to a lack of MD subdivision‐specific Cre driver mice. Moreover, this lack of molecular identifiers hinders MD subdivision‐ and cell‐type‐specific circuit formation and function analysis. Therefore, using publicly available databases, we explored molecules separately expressed in MD subdivisions. In addition to MD subdivision markers, we identified several genes expressed in a subdivision‐specific combination and classified them. Furthermore, after developing medial MD (MDm) or central MD (MDc) region‐specific Cre mouse lines, we identified diverse region‐ and layer‐specific PFC projection patterns. Comparison between classified MD marker genes in mice and common marmosets, a nonhuman primate model, revealed diverging gene expression patterns. These results highlight the species‐specific organization of cell types and their projections in the MD thalamus.</content:encoded>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Targeting inflammasomes to treat neurological diseases</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.26158?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Inflammasomes are multimeric protein complexes that can sense a plethora of microbe‐ and damage‐associated molecular signals. They play important roles in innate immunity and are key regulators of inflammation in health and disease. Inflammasome‐mediated processing and secretion of pro‐inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin 1β (IL‐1β) and IL‐18 and induction of pyroptosis, a pro‐inflammatory form of cell death, has been associated with the development and progression of common immune‐mediated and degenerative central nervous system (CNS) diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, multiple sclerosis, brain injury, stroke, epilepsy, Parkinson's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. A growing number of pharmacological compounds inhibiting inflammasome activation and signalling shows therapeutic efficacy in preclinical models of the aforementioned disease conditions. Here, we illustrate regulatory mechanisms of inflammasome activation during CNS homeostasis and tissue injury. We highlight the evidence for inflammasome activation as a mechanistic underpinning in a wide range of CNS diseases and critically discuss the promise and potential limitations therapeutic strategies that aim to inhibit the inflammasome components in neurological disorders.

	<content:encoded>At present, resilience refers to a highly heterogeneous concept with ill‐defined determinants, mechanisms and outcomes. This call for action argues for the need to define resilience as a person‐centered multi‐dimensional metric, informed by a dynamic lifespan perspective and combining observational and interventional experimental studies to identify specific neural markers and correlated behavioral measures. The COVID‐19 pandemic highlights the urgent need of such an effort with the ultimate goal of defining a new vital sign, an individual index of resilience, as a life‐long metric with the capacity to predict an individual's risk for disability in the face of a stressor, insult, injury or disease.

	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cne.25201?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>The avian dorsal telencephalon contains discrete areas receiving visual, auditory, and trigeminal ascending projections. Recent studies have shown that the auditory and the visual regions embodied “columnar and layered” cytoarchitectural motifs, which bears a striking resemblance to that of the mammalian sensory cortices. At present, it is not known to what extent this type of organization also extends to the trigemino‐recipient area. The question is of interest, since afferents forming this sensory pathway are exceptionally not thalamic but rhombencephalic in origin. We investigated this question by placing minute injections of neural tracers into selected locations of vital slices of the chicken telencephalon. We conclude that the trigeminal area share, to a detailed level, a common columnar‐layered neuroarchitectectonic motif with other sensory areas.







Abstract
The dorsal ventricular ridge (DVR), which is the largest component of the avian pallium, contains discrete partitions receiving tectovisual, auditory, and trigeminal ascending projections. Recent studies have shown that the auditory and the tectovisual regions can be regarded as complexes composed of three highly interconnected layers: an internal senso‐recipient one, an intermediate afferent/efferent one, and a more external re‐entrant one. Cells located in homotopic positions in each of these layers are reciprocally linked by an interlaminar loop of axonal processes, forming columnar‐like local circuits. Whether this type of organization also extends to the trigemino‐recipient DVR is, at present, not known. This question is of interest, since afferents forming this sensory pathway, exceptional among amniotes, are not thalamic but rhombencephalic in origin. We investigated this question by placing minute injections of neural tracers into selected locations of vital slices of the chicken telencephalon. We found that neurons of the trigemino‐recipient nucleus basorostralis pallii (Bas) establish reciprocal, columnar and homotopical projections with cells located in the overlying ventral mesopallium (MV). “Column‐forming” axons originated in B and MV terminate also in the intermediate strip, the fronto‐trigeminal nidopallium (NFT), in a restricted manner. We also found that the NFT and an internal partition of B originate substantial, coarse‐topographic projections to the underlying portion of the lateral striatum. We conclude that all sensory areas of the DVR are organized according to a common neuroarchitectonic motif, which bears a striking resemblance to that of the radial/laminar intrinsic circuits of the sensory cortices of mammals.</content:encoded>

                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;The process of ageing accompanies several metabolic diseases. With ageing, fats accumulate to increase the visceral and abdominal adiposity leading to hyperinsulinemia, insulin resistance, obesity and several other diseases. &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Drosophila melanogaster&lt;/em&gt; is often used to study the ageing process and its related disorders. Therefore, in this study, we performed an in silico analysis to relate the process of ageing and insulin resistance. We analysed the data of insulin-resistant &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Drosophila&lt;/em&gt; from the GEO database and compared it with the data from the literature survey. We observed that 98 genes were common in both the models, and they showed gene modulations related to metabolic pathways, fatty acid metabolism, insulin resistance and neural receptor–ligand binding pathways. Analysis of the REACTOME database against human data revealed that the TRKB signalling pathway is commonly affected. The TRKB-mediated BDNF pathway is a major regulator of memory loss. We further analysed the common genes in Alzheimer’s disease and compared the fly data with human data to identify the diseases related to these common genes. Then, we performed a literature survey to provide protective mechanisms for the TRKB signalling pathway activation, mediated through polyphenols. We treated the flies with sesamol-conjugated lipoic acid derivative (a phenolic compound) at hormetic doses to evaluate its effect on the memory of flies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;X-linked intellectual disability can be diagnosed in about 10–12% of intellectually disabled males. In the past, mutations affecting the &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;PAK3&lt;/em&gt; gene (p21 protein-activated kinase 3, MIM#300142) have been associated with a non-syndromic form of X-linked intellectual disability, which has to date been identified in a limited number of families.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Since this neurodevelopmental disorder mostly afflicts males, descriptions of symptomatic female carriers are quite rare.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;We describe a female patient with neurodevelopmental delay and a novel &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;PAK3&lt;/em&gt; variant. Interestingly, she manifests craniofacial anomalies, including microcephaly, representing the second reported microcephalic female but the first for whom a detailed clinical description is available. She also displays other uncommon clinical findings, which we illustrate.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Moreover, a comprehensive clinical and molecular review of all to date published patients has been made. &lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;This study contributes to further delineate the &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;PAK3&lt;/em&gt;-related phenotype, which can be considered a non-syndromic X-linked intellectual disability, with seemingly recurrent craniofacial abnormalities.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;A previous study reported that cystatin C was related to acute ischemic stroke. The association between cystatin C and the clinical outcome in acute ischaemic stroke patients with successful recanalization after endovascular thrombectomy has rarely been reported. This study aimed to evaluate the association between cystatin C and futile recanalization in AIS patients who underwent endovascular thrombectomy.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec2&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Methods&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;We carried out a retrospective study of acute ischaemic stroke patients with anterior circulation proximal arterial occlusion who achieved complete arterial recanalization after mechanical thrombectomy from May 2017 to April 2020. The patients with complete recanalization were divided into a useful recanalization group and a futile recanalization group according to their 3-month modified Rankin scale score. FR was defined as a modified mRS score of 3–6 at 3 months. Logistic regression analysis was used to identify the risk factors for FR. Receiver operating characteristic curves were used to assess the predictive value of cystatin C for FR.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec3&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Of 241 patients, 125 underwent futile recanalization and 116 underwent useful recanalization. Baseline serum cystatin C levels were higher in the futile recanalization group than in the useful recanalization group. After adjustment for potential confounding factors, multivariable adjusted regression models showed that cystatin C was an independent predictor of futile recanalization (odds ratio, 4.111 [95% CI 1.427–11.840], &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; = 0.009). Receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve analysis indicated that the model combining cystatin C with other factors model effectively predicted unfavourable outcomes at 3 months (area under the curve = 0.782, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.01).&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec4&quot;&gt;

                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;A higher level of cystatin C is associated with unfavourable outcomes at 3 months in anterior circulation acute ischaemic stroke patients with endovascular thrombectomy.&lt;/p&gt;

                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;To investigate the role of GluN2A and GluN2B in neuroprotective effect of sevoflurane preconditioning against cerebral ischemia–reperfusion injury (CIRI). Rats were randomly divided into five groups as follows: control, ischemia–reperfusion (I/R) 6 h, sevoflurane preconditioning (SP), SP + amantadine, SP + NMDA. Immunoblot and immunoprecipitation were used to detect the tyrosine phosphorylation of GluN2A/GluN2B, the interaction of GluN2A/GluN2B-PSD-95-MLK3 and the expression of phosphorylation of MLK3, MKK7 and JNK3. Cresyl violet staining was employed to analyse neuronal injury in rat hippocampal CA1 subfields. Sevoflurane preconditioning inhibits the tyrosine phosphorylation of GluN2A/GluN2B, the interaction of GluN2A/GluN2B-PSD-95-MLK3 and the phosphorylation of MLK3, MKK7 and JNK3 in rat hippocampus. An &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;N&lt;/em&gt;-methyl-&lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus emphasis type-small-caps&quot;&gt;d&lt;/span&gt;-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) antagonist amantadine reversed the MLK3-MKK7- JNK3 signal events. Such reversion was also realized by NMDA (60 and 80 nmol) and low doses of NMDA (0–40 nmol) could not change the inhibitory effect of sevoflurane preconditioning on MLK3-MKK7-JNK3 signal events. Finally, Cresyl violet staining also confirmed that low dose of NMDA reduced neuronal loss in rat hippocampal CA1 subfields. Sevoflurane preconditioning provides neuroprotection against CIRI by inhibiting NMDAR over-activation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Experimental Brain Research: Gamma oscillations modulate working memory recall precision</title>

	<content:encoded>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Working memory (WM)—the ability to keep information in mind for short periods of time—is linked to attention and inhibitory abilities, i.e., the capacity to ignore task-irrelevant information. These abilities have been associated with brain oscillations, especially parietal gamma and alpha bands, but it is yet unknown whether these oscillations also modulate attention and inhibitory abilities. To test this, we compared parietal gamma-transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) to alpha-tACS and to a non-stimulation condition (Sham) in 51 young participants. Stimulation was coupled with a WM task probing memory-based attention and inhibitory abilities by means of probabilistic retrospective cues, including informative (valid), uninformative (invalid) and neutral. Our results show that relative to alpha and sham stimulation, parietal gamma-tACS significantly increased working memory recall precision. Additional post hoc analyses also revealed strong individual variability before and following stimulation; low-baseline performers showed no significant changes in performance following both gamma and alpha-tACS relative to sham. In contrast, in high-baseline performers gamma- (but not alpha) tACS selectively and significantly improved misbinding-feature errors as well as memory precision, particularly in uninformative (invalid) cues which rely more strongly on attentional abilities. We concluded that parietal gamma oscillations, therefore, modulate working memory recall processes, although baseline performance may further influence the effect of stimulation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience: The Impact of Small Time Delays on the Onset of Oscillations and Synchrony in Brain Networks</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2021.688517</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The human brain constitutes one of the most advanced networks produced by nature, consisting of billions of neurons communicating with each other. However, this communication is not in real-time, with different communication or time-delays occurring between neurons in different brain areas. Here, we investigate the impacts of these delays by modeling large interacting neural circuits as neural-field systems which model the bulk activity of populations of neurons. By using a Master Stability Function analysis combined with numerical simulations, we find that delays (1) may actually stabilize brain dynamics by temporarily preventing the onset to oscillatory and pathologically synchronized dynamics and (2) may enhance or diminish synchronization depending on the underlying eigenvalue spectrum of the connectivity matrix. Real eigenvalues with large magnitudes result in increased synchronizability while complex eigenvalues with large magnitudes and positive real parts yield a decrease in synchronizability in the delay vs. instantaneously coupled case. This result applies to networks with fixed, constant delays, and was robust to networks with heterogeneous delays. In the case of real brain networks, where the eigenvalues are predominantly real, owing to the nearly symmetric nature of these weight matrices, biologically plausible, small delays, are likely to increase synchronization, rather than decreasing it.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Synaptic Neuroscience: Reducing Auditory Nerve Excitability by Acute Antagonism of Ca2+-Permeable AMPA Receptors</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsyn.2021.680621</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Hearing depends on glutamatergic synaptic transmission mediated by α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptors (AMPARs). AMPARs are tetramers, where inclusion of the GluA2 subunit reduces overall channel conductance and Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; permeability. Cochlear afferent synapses between inner hair cells (IHCs) and auditory nerve fibers (ANFs) contain the AMPAR subunits GluA2, 3, and 4. However, the tetrameric complement of cochlear AMPAR subunits is not known. It was recently shown in mice that chronic intracochlear delivery of IEM-1460, an antagonist selective for GluA2-lacking AMPARs [also known as Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-permeable AMPARs (CP-AMPARs)], before, during, and after acoustic overexposure prevented both the trauma to ANF synapses and the ensuing reduction of cochlear nerve activity in response to sound. Surprisingly, baseline measurements of cochlear function before exposure were unaffected by chronic intracochlear delivery of IEM-1460. This suggested that cochlear afferent synapses contain GluA2-lacking CP-AMPARs alongside GluA2-containing Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-impermeable AMPA receptors (CI-AMPARs), and that the former can be antagonized for protection while the latter remain conductive. Here, we investigated hearing function in the guinea pig during acute local or systemic delivery of CP-AMPAR antagonists. Acute intracochlear delivery of IEM-1460 or systemic delivery of IEM-1460 or IEM-1925 reduced the amplitude of the ANF compound action potential (CAP) significantly, for all tone levels and frequencies, by &amp;gt; 50% without affecting CAP thresholds or distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAE). Following systemic dosing, IEM-1460 levels in cochlear perilymph were ~ 30% of blood levels, on average, consistent with pharmacokinetic properties predicting permeation of the compounds into the brain and ear. Both compounds were metabolically stable with half-lives &amp;gt;5 h in vitro, and elimination half-lives in vivo of 118 min (IEM-1460) and 68 min (IEM-1925). Heart rate monitoring and off-target binding assays suggest an enhanced safety profile for IEM-1925 over IEM-1460. Compound potency on CAP reduction (IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; ~ 73 μM IEM-1460) was consistent with a mixture of GluA2-lacking and GluA2-containing AMPARs. These data strongly imply that cochlear afferent synapses of the guinea pig contain GluA2-lacking CP-AMPARs. We propose these CP-AMPARs may be acutely antagonized with systemic dosing, to protect from glutamate excitotoxicity, while transmission at GluA2-containing AMPARs persists to mediate hearing during the protection.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: The Metallome as a Link Between the “Omes” in Autism Spectrum Disorders</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2021.695873</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Metal dyshomeostasis plays a significant role in various neurological diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD), and many more. Like studies investigating the proteome, transcriptome, epigenome, microbiome, etc., for years, metallomics studies have focused on data from their domain, i.e., trace metal composition, only. Still, few have considered the links between other “omes,” which may together result in an individual’s specific pathologies. In particular, ASD have been reported to have multitudes of possible causal effects. Metallomics data focusing on metal deficiencies and dyshomeostasis can be linked to functions of metalloenzymes, metal transporters, and transcription factors, thus affecting the proteome and transcriptome. Furthermore, recent studies in ASD have emphasized the gut-brain axis, with alterations in the microbiome being linked to changes in the metabolome and inflammatory processes. However, the microbiome and other “omes” are heavily influenced by the metallome. Thus, here, we will summarize the known implications of a changed metallome for other “omes” in the body in the context of “omics” studies in ASD. We will highlight possible connections and propose a model that may explain the so far independently reported pathologies in ASD.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Knockdown of Dehydrodolichyl Diphosphate Synthase in the Drosophila Retina Leads to a Unique Pattern of Retinal Degeneration</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2021.693967</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Dehydrodolichyl diphosphate synthase (DHDDS) is a ubiquitously expressed enzyme that catalyzes cis-prenyl chain elongation to produce the poly-prenyl backbone of dolichol. It appears in all tissues including the nervous system and it is a highly conserved enzyme that can be found in all animal species. Individuals who have biallelic missense mutations in the DHDDS gene are presented with non-syndromic retinitis pigmentosa with unknown underlying mechanism. We have used the Drosophila model to compromise DHDDS ortholog gene (CG10778) in order to look for cellular and molecular mechanisms that, when defective, might be responsible for this retinal disease. The Gal4/UAS system was used to suppress the expression of CG10778 via RNAi-mediated-knockdown in various tissues. The resulting phenotypes were assessed using q-RT-PCR, transmission-electron-microscopy (TEM), electroretinogram, antibody staining and Western blot analysis. Targeted knockdown of CG10778-mRNA in the early embryo using the actin promoter or in the developing wings using the nub promoter resulted in lethality, or wings loss, respectively. Targeted expression of CG10778-RNAi using the glass multiple reporter (GMR)-Gal4 driver (GMR-DHDDS-RNAi) in the larva eye disc and pupal retina resulted in a complex phenotype: (a) TEM retinal sections revealed a unique pattern of retinal-degeneration, where photoreceptors R2 and R5 exhibited a nearly normal structure of their signaling-compartment (rhabdomere), but only at the region of the nucleus, while all other photoreceptors showed retinal degeneration at all regions. (b) Western blot analysis revealed a drastic reduction in rhodopsin levels in GMR-DHDDS-RNAi-flies and TEM sections showed an abnormal accumulation of endoplasmic reticulum (ER). To conclude, compromising DHDDS in the developing retina, while allowing formation of the retina, resulted in a unique pattern of retinal degeneration, characterized by a dramatic reduction in rhodopsin protein level and an abnormal accumulation of ER membranes in the photoreceptors cells, thus indicating that DHDDS is essential for normal retinal formation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.687493</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A growing number of studies is using fMRI-based connectivity to guide transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) target identification in both normal and clinical populations. TMS has gained increasing attention as a potential therapeutic strategy also in Alzheimer’s disease (AD), but an endorsed target localization strategy in this population is still lacking. In this proof of concept study, we prove the feasibility of a tailored TMS targeting approach for AD, which stems from a network-based perspective. Based on functional imaging, the procedure allows to extract individual optimal targets meanwhile accounting for functional variability. Single-subject resting-state fMRI was used to extract individual target coordinates of two networks primarily affected in AD, the default mode and the fronto-parietal network. The localization of these targets was compared to that of traditional group-level approaches and tested against varying degrees of TMS focality. The distance between individual fMRI-derived coordinates and traditionally defined targets was significant for a supposed TMS focality of 12 mm and in some cases up to 20 mm. Comparison with anatomical labels confirmed a lack of 1:1 correspondence between anatomical and functional targets. The proposed network-based fMRI-guided TMS approach, while accounting for inter-individual functional variability, allows to target core AD networks, and might thus represent a step toward tailored TMS interventions for AD.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.685050</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Objective: Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the anterior nucleus of the thalamus (ANT) is a potentially effective, minimally invasive, and reversible method for treating epilepsy. The goal of this study was to explore whether 3 T quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) could delineate the ANT from surrounding structures, which is important for the direct targeting of DBS surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: We obtained 3 T QSM, T1-weighted (T1w), and T2-weighted (T2w) images from 11 patients with Parkinson’s disease or dystonia who received subthalamic nucleus (STN) or globus pallidus interna (GPi) DBS surgery in our center. The ANT and its surrounding white matter structures on QSM were compared with available atlases. The contrast-to-noise ratios (CNRs) of ANT relative to the external medullary lamina (eml) were compared across the three imaging modalities. Additionally, the morphology and location of the ANT were depicted in the anterior commissure (AC)-posterior commissure (PC)-based system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: ANT can be clearly distinguished from the surrounding white matter laminas and appeared hyperintense on QSM. The CNRs of the ANT-eml on QSM, T1w, and T2w images were 10.20 ± 4.23, 1.71 ± 1.03, and 1.35 ± 0.70, respectively. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) indicated significant differences in CNRs among QSM, T1w, and T2w imaging modalities [F(2) = 85.28, p &amp;lt; 0.0001]. In addition, both the morphology and location of the ANT were highly variable between patients in the AC–PC-based system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: The potential utility of QSM for the visualization of ANTs in clinical imaging is promising and may be suitable for targeting the ANT for DBS to treat epilepsy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.684926</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Previous studies have identified altered brain changes in chronic pain patients, however, it remains unclear whether these changes are reversible. We summarized the neural and molecular changes in patients with chronic pain and employed a meta-analysis approach to quantify the changes. We included 75 studies and 11 of these 75 studies were included in the activation likelihood estimation (ALE) analysis. In the 62 functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies, the primary somatosensory and motor cortex (SI and MI), thalamus, insula, and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) showed significantly decreased activity after the treatments compared to baseline. In the 13 positron emission tomography (PET) studies, the SI, MI, thalamus, and insula showed significantly increased glucose uptake, blood flow, and opioid-receptor binding potentials after the treatments compared to baseline. A meta-analysis of fMRI studies in patients with chronic pain, during pain-related tasks, showed a significant deactivation likelihood cluster in the left medial posterior thalamus. Further studies are warranted to understand brain reorganization in patients with chronic pain compared to the normal state, in terms of its relationship with symptom reduction and baseline conditions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Background&lt;p&gt;Emerging evidence suggests structural and functional disruptions of the thalamus in schizophrenia, but whether thalamus abnormalities are able to be used for disease identification and prediction of early treatment response in schizophrenia remains to be determined. This study aims at developing and validating a method of disease identification and prediction of treatment response by multi-dimensional thalamic features derived from magnetic resonance imaging in schizophrenia patients using radiomics approaches.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;A total of 390 subjects, including patients with schizophrenia and healthy controls, participated in this study, among which 109 out of 191 patients had clinical characteristics of early outcome (61 responders and 48 non-responders). Thalamus-based radiomics features were extracted and selected. The diagnostic and predictive capacity of multi-dimensional thalamic features was evaluated using radiomics approach.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Using radiomics features, the classifier accurately discriminated patients from healthy controls, with an accuracy of 68%. The features were further confirmed in prediction and random forest of treatment response, with an accuracy of 75%.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;Our study demonstrates a radiomics approach by multiple thalamic features to identify schizophrenia and predict early treatment response. Thalamus-based classification could be promising to apply in schizophrenia definition and treatment selection.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: The Influence of Radio-Frequency Transmit Field Inhomogeneities on the Accuracy of G-ratio Weighted Imaging</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.674719</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;G-ratio weighted imaging is a non-invasive, in-vivo MRI-based technique that aims at estimating an aggregated measure of relative myelination of axons across the entire brain white matter. The MR g-ratio and its constituents (axonal and myelin volume fraction) are more specific to the tissue microstructure than conventional MRI metrics targeting either the myelin or axonal compartment. To calculate the MR g-ratio, an MRI-based myelin-mapping technique is combined with an axon-sensitive MR technique (such as diffusion MRI). Correction for radio-frequency transmit (B1+) field inhomogeneities is crucial for myelin mapping techniques such as magnetization transfer saturation. Here we assessed the effect of B1+ correction on g-ratio weighted imaging. To this end, the B1+ field was measured and the B1+ corrected MR g-ratio was used as the reference in a Bland-Altman analysis. We found a substantial bias (≈-89%) and error (≈37%) relative to the dynamic range of g-ratio values in the white matter if the B1+ correction was not applied. Moreover, we tested the efficiency of a data-driven B1+ correction approach that was applied retrospectively without additional reference measurements. We found that it reduced the bias and error in the MR g-ratio by a factor of three. The data-driven correction is readily available in the open-source hMRI toolbox (www.hmri.info) which is embedded in the statistical parameter mapping (SPM) framework.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Functional Brain Connectivity During Narrative Processing Relates to Transportation and Story Influence</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.665319</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Engaging with narratives involves a complex array of cognitive and affective processes. These processes make stories persuasive in ways that standard arguments are not, though the underlying reasons for this remain unclear. Transportation theory proposes a potential explanation for this: narratives are processed in a way which makes individuals feel immersed in the world of a story, which in turn leads people to resonate emotionally with the events of the story. Recent fMRI studies have shown that the posterior medial cortex (PMC) and anterior insula (AI) play important roles in understanding the meaning of stories and experiencing the feelings they produce. In this study, we aimed to explore the AI’s and PMC’s role in narrative processing by measuring their functional connectivity with the rest of the brain during story listening, and how connectivity changes as a function of narrative transportation and the persuasiveness of the story. We analyzed data from 36 right-handed subjects who listened to two stories, obtained from podcasts, inside the fMRI scanner. After the scan, subjects were asked a series of questions, including a measure of how transported into the story they felt, how likely they would be to donate to causes related to the messages of the stories. We used searchlight multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) to classify functional connectivity maps using seeds in both the AI and PMC and to compare these maps between participants who differed in transportation and prosocial intention. We found that connectivity to various regions successfully distinguished between high and low ratings on each of these behavioral measures with accuracies over 75%. However, only one pattern of connectivity was consistent across both stories: PMC-inferior frontal gyrus connectivity successfully distinguished high and low ratings of narrative transportation in both stories. All other findings were not consistent across stories. Instead, we found that patterns of connectivity may relate more to the specific content of the story rather than to a universal way in which narratives are processed.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.695899</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are small, membrane-bound vesicles released by cells as a means of intercellular communication. EVs transfer proteins, nucleic acids, and other biologically relevant molecules from one cell to another. In the context of viral infections, EVs can also contain viruses, viral proteins, and viral nucleic acids. While there is some evidence that the inclusion of viral components within EVs may be part of the host defense, much of the research in this field supports a pro-viral role for EVs. Packaging of viruses within EVs has repeatedly been shown to protect viruses from antibody neutralization while also allowing for their integration into cells otherwise impervious to the virus. EVs also bidirectionally cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB), providing a potential route for peripheral viruses to enter the brain while exiting EVs may serve as valuable biomarkers of neurological disease burden. Within the brain, EVs can alter glial activity, increase neuroinflammation, and induce neurotoxicity. The purpose of this mini-review is to summarize research related to viral manipulation of EV-mediated intercellular communication and how such manipulation may lead to infection of the central nervous system, chronic neuroinflammation, and neurodegeneration.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Human cerebral organoid (CO) is a three-dimensional (3D) cell culture system that recapitulates the developing human brain. While CO has proved an invaluable tool for studying neurological disorders in a more clinically relevant matter, there have still been several shortcomings including CO variability and reproducibility as well as lack of or underrepresentation of certain cell types typically found in the brain. As the technology to generate COs has continued to improve, more efficient and streamlined protocols have addressed some of these issues. Here we present a novel scalable and simplified system to generate microglia-containing CO (MCO). We characterize the cell types and dynamic development of MCOs and validate that these MCOs harbor microglia, astrocytes, neurons, and neural stem/progenitor cells, maturing in a manner that reflects human brain development. We introduce a novel technique for the generation of embryoid bodies (EBs) directly from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) that involves simplified steps of transitioning directly from 3D cultures as well as orbital shaking culture in a standard 6-well culture plate. This allows for the generation of MCOs with an easy-to-use system that is affordable and accessible by any general lab.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.674123</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Previous studies suggested that the SARS-CoV-2 virus may gain access to the brain by using a route along the olfactory nerve. However, there is a general consensus that the obligatory virus entry receptor, angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), is not expressed in olfactory receptor neurons, and the timing of arrival of the virus in brain targets is inconsistent with a neuronal transfer along olfactory projections. We determined whether nervus terminalis neurons and their peripheral and central projections should be considered as a potential alternative route from the nose to the brain. Nervus terminalis neurons in postnatal mice were double-labeled with antibodies against ACE2 and two nervus terminalis markers, gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) and choline acetyltransferase (CHAT). We show that a small fraction of CHAT-labeled nervus terminalis neurons, and the large majority of GnRH-labeled nervus terminalis neurons with cell bodies in the region between the olfactory epithelium and the olfactory bulb express ACE2 and cathepsins B and L. Nervus terminalis neurons therefore may provide a direct route for the virus from the nasal epithelium, possibly via innervation of Bowman’s glands, to brain targets, including the telencephalon and diencephalon. This possibility needs to be examined in suitable animal models and in human tissues.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.641802</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Neurons utilize plasticity of dendritic arbors as part of a larger suite of adaptive plasticity mechanisms. This explicitly manifests with motoneurons in the Drosophila embryo and larva, where dendritic arbors are exclusively postsynaptic and are used as homeostatic devices, compensating for changes in synaptic input through adapting their growth and connectivity. We recently identified reactive oxygen species (ROS) as novel plasticity signals instrumental in this form of dendritic adjustment. ROS correlate with levels of neuronal activity and negatively regulate dendritic arbor size. Here, we investigated NADPH oxidases as potential sources of such activity-regulated ROS and implicate Dual Oxidase (but not Nox), which generates hydrogen peroxide extracellularly. We further show that the aquaporins Bib and Drip, but not Prip, are required for activity-regulated ROS-mediated adjustments of dendritic arbor size in motoneurons. These results suggest a model whereby neuronal activity leads to activation of the NADPH oxidase Dual Oxidase, which generates hydrogen peroxide at the extracellular face; aquaporins might then act as conduits that are necessary for these extracellular ROS to be channeled back into the cell where they negatively regulate dendritic arbor size.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.703434</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Although cognitive decline has previously been associated with mobility limitations and frailty, the relationship between sustained attention and gait speed is incompletely characterized. To better quantify the specificity of the sustained attention and gait speed association, we examined the extent to which this relationship is unique rather than accounted for by executive functioning and physical health characteristics. 58 middle-to-older-aged community-dwelling adults without overt evidence of cognitive impairment (45–90 years old; 21 females) participated in the study. Each participant completed a 4-meter gait speed assessment and validated neuropsychological tests to examine various domains of executive functioning including working memory (i.e., Digit Span), inhibitory control (i.e., D-KEFS Color-Word Interference), and task switching (i.e., D-KEFS Number/Letter Switching). Multiple physical and vascular risk factors were also evaluated. Sustained attention was assessed using the gradual onset continuous performance task (gradCPT), a well-validated go/no-go sustained attention task. A series of linear regression models were used to examine how different aspects of cognition, including sustained attention and traditional measures of executive functioning, related to gait speed while controlling for a variety of physical and vascular risk factors. Among all predictors, gradCPT accuracy explained the most variance in gait speed (R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.19, p &amp;lt; 0.001) and was the only significant predictor (β = 0.35, p = 0.01) when accounting for executive functioning and other physical and vascular risk factors. The present results indicate that sustained attention may be uniquely sensitive and mechanistically linked to mobility limitations in middle-to-older adults.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.702739</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Many older adults have difficulty understanding speech in noisy backgrounds. In this study, we examined peripheral auditory, higher-level auditory, and cognitive factors that may contribute to such difficulties. A convenience sample of 137 volunteer older adults, 90 women, and 47 men, ranging in age from 47 to 94 years (M = 69.2 and SD = 10.1 years) completed a large battery of tests. Auditory tests included measures of pure-tone threshold, clinical and psychophysical, as well as two measures of gap-detection threshold and four measures of temporal-order identification. The latter included two monaural and two dichotic listening conditions. In addition, cognition was assessed using the complete Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-3rd Edition (WAIS-III). Two monaural measures of speech-recognition threshold (SRT) in noise, the QuickSIN, and the WIN, were obtained from each ear at relatively high presentation levels of 93 or 103 dB SPL to minimize audibility concerns. Group data, both aggregate and by age decade, were evaluated initially to allow comparison to data in the literature. Next, following the application of principal-components factor analysis for data reduction, individual differences in speech-recognition-in-noise performance were examined using multiple-linear-regression analyses. Excellent fits were obtained, accounting for 60–77% of the total variance, with most accounted for by the audibility of the speech and noise stimuli and the severity of hearing loss with the balance primarily associated with cognitive function.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Compromised Brain Activity With Age During a Game-Like Dynamic Balance Task: Single- vs. Dual-Task Performance</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.657308</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Background: Postural control and cognition are affected by aging. We investigated whether cognitive distraction influenced neural activity differently in young and older adults during a game-like mediolateral weight-shifting task with a personalized task load.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Seventeen healthy young and 17 older adults performed a balance game, involving hitting virtual wasps, serial subtractions and a combination of both (dual-task). A motion analysis system estimated each subject's center of mass position. Cortical activity in five regions was assessed by measuring oxygenated hemoglobin (HbO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) with a functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: When adding cognitive load to the game, weight-shifting speed decreased irrespective of age, but older adults reduced the wasp-hits more than young adults. Accompanying these changes, older adults decreased HbO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in the left pre-frontal cortex (PFC) and frontal eye fields (FEF) compared to single-tasking, a finding not seen in young adults. Additionally, lower HbO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; levels were found during dual-tasking compared to the summed activation of the two single tasks in all regions except for the right PFC. These relative reductions were specific for the older age group in the left premotor cortex (PMC), the right supplementary motor area (SMA), and the left FEF.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: Older adults showed more compromised neural activity than young adults when adding a distraction to a challenging balance game. We interpret these changes as competitive downgrading of neural activity underpinning the age-related deterioration of game performance during dual-tasking. Future work needs to ascertain if older adults can train their neural flexibility to withstand balance challenges during daily life activities.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Functional Connectivity and Compensation of Phonemic Fluency in Aging</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.644611</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Neural compensatory mechanisms associated with broad cognitive abilities have been studied. However, those associated with specific cognitive subdomains (e.g., verbal fluency) remain to be investigated in healthy aging. Here, we delineate: (a) neural substrates of verbal (phonemic) fluency, and (b) compensatory mechanisms mediating the association between these neural substrates and phonemic fluency. We analyzed resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging from 133 right-handed, cognitively normal individuals who underwent the Controlled Oral Word Association Test (COWAT) to record their phonemic fluency. We evaluated functional connectivity in an established and extended language network comprising Wernicke, Broca, thalamic and anti-correlated modules. (a) We conducted voxel-wise multiple linear regression to identify the brain areas associated with phonemic fluency. (b) We used mediation effects of cognitive reserve, measured by the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale—Information subtest, upon the association between functional connectivity and phonemic fluency tested to investigate compensation. We found that: (a) Greater functional connectivity between the Wernicke module and brain areas within the anti-correlated module was associated with better performance in phonemic fluency, (b) Cognitive reserve was an unlikely mediator in younger adults. In contrast, cognitive reserve was a partial mediator of the association between functional connectivity and phonemic fluency in older adults, likely representing compensation to counter the effect of aging. We conclude that in healthy aging, higher performance in phonemic fluency at older ages could be attributed to greater functional connectivity partially facilitated by higher cognitive reserve, presumably reflecting compensatory mechanisms to minimize the effect of aging.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Measurement of Cortical Atrophy and Its Correlation to Memory Impairment in Patients With Asymptomatic Carotid Artery Stenosis Based on VBM-DARTEL</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.620763</link>
	<content:encoded>Objective&lt;p&gt;Severe carotid artery stenosis (CAS) can lead to atrophy of gray matter (GM) and memory impairment; however, the underlying mechanism is unknown. Thus, we aimed to identify memory impairment and GM atrophy and explore the possible correlation between them in patients with asymptomatic severe CAS.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;Twenty-four patients with asymptomatic severe CAS and 10 healthy controls completed the mini-mental state examination (MMSE) and clinical memory scale (CMS) and underwent 7T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan. Field intensity inhomogeneities were corrected. Images were processed using VBM8, and GM images were flipped. First, 11 flipped and 10 non-flipped images of patients with unilateral CAS and 5 flipped and 5 non-flipped images of controls were pre-processed using DARTEL algorithm and analyzed using an analysis of variance (ANOVA). Second, flipped and non-flipped images of unilateral patients were similarly pre-processed and analyzed using the paired t-test. Third, pre-processed non-flipped GM images and CMS scores of 24 patients were analyzed by multiple regression analysis. Nuisance variables were corrected accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Basic information was well matched between patients and controls. MMSE scores of patients were in the normal range; however, memory function was significantly reduced (all P &amp;lt; 0.05). GM volumes of patients were significantly reduced in the anterior circulation regions. The stenosis-side hemispheres showed greater atrophy. GM volumes of the left pars opercularis, pars triangularis, and middle frontal gyrus were strongly positively correlated with the total scores of CMS (all r &amp;gt; 0.7, P = 0.001). Additionally, the left middle frontal gyrus was strongly positively correlated with associative memory (r = 0.853, P = 0.001). The left pars opercularis was moderately positively correlated with semantic memory (r = 0.695, P = 0.001).&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;Patients with asymptomatic CAS suffer from memory impairment. Bilateral anterior circulation regions showed extensive atrophy. The hemisphere with stenosis showed severer atrophy. Memory impairment in patients may be related to atrophy of the left frontal gyrus and atrophy of different regions may result in different memory impairments.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: White Matter Hyperintensity Volume and Location: Associations With WM Microstructure, Brain Iron, and Cerebral Perfusion</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.617947</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Cerebral white matter hyperintensities (WMHs) represent macrostructural brain damage associated with various etiologies. However, the relative contributions of various etiologies to WMH volume, as assessed via different neuroimaging measures, is not well-understood. Here, we explored associations between three potential early markers of white matter hyperintensity volume. Specifically, the unique variance in total and regional WMH volumes accounted for by white matter microstructure, brain iron concentration and cerebral blood flow (CBF) was assessed. Regional volumes explored were periventricular and deep regions. Eighty healthy older adults (ages 60–86) were scanned at 3 Tesla MRI using fluid-attenuated inversion recovery, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), multi-echo gradient-recalled echo and pseudo-continuous arterial spin labeling sequences. In a stepwise regression model, DTI-based radial diffusivity accounted for significant variance in total WMH volume (adjusted R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; change = 0.136). In contrast, iron concentration (adjusted R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; change = 0.043) and CBF (adjusted R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; change = 0.027) made more modest improvements to the variance accounted for in total WMH volume. However, there was an interaction between iron concentration and location on WMH volume such that iron concentration predicted deep (p = 0.034) but not periventricular (p = 0.414) WMH volume. Our results suggest that WM microstructure may be a better predictor of WMH volume than either brain iron or CBF but also draws attention to the possibility that some early WMH markers may be location-specific.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: Morphological properties of the axon initial segment‐like process of AII amacrine cells in the rat retina</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cne.25210?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>AII amacrine cells in the mammalian retina display an axon initial segment (AIS)‐like process that expresses voltage‐gated Na+ channels and generates spikes. Immunolabeling for the cytoskeletal linker protein ankyrin‐G enables detection of the AIS‐like processes in wholemounts and analysis of its distribution and spatial orientation. The AIS‐like processes display no preferred orientation in the horizontal plane and randomly ascend or descend from the site of origin in the vertical plane of the retina, suggesting that this unique process is unlikely to take part in conventional synaptic connections. Instead, it may be adapted to respond to volume transmission by means of extrasynaptic receptors.






Abstract
Signal processing within the retina is generally mediated by graded potentials, whereas output is conveyed by action potentials transmitted along optic nerve axons. Among retinal neurons, amacrine cells seem to be an exception to this general rule, as several types generate voltage‐gated Na+ (Nav) channel‐dependent action potentials. The AII, a narrow‐field, bistratified axon‐less amacrine cell found in mammalian retinas, displays a unique process that resembles an axon initial segment (AIS), with expression of Nav channels colocalized with the cytoskeletal protein ankyrin‐G, and generates action potentials. As the role of spiking in AIIs is uncertain, we hypothesized that the morphological properties of the AIS‐like process could provide information relevant for its functional importance, including potential pre‐ and/or postsynaptic connectivity. For morphological analysis, we injected AII amacrine cells in slices with fluorescent dye and immunolabeled the slices for ankyrin‐G. Subsequently, this enabled us to reliably identify AII‐type processes among ankyrin‐G labeled processes in wholemount retina. We systematically analyzed the laminar localization, spatial orientation, and distribution of the AIS‐like processes as a function of retinal eccentricity. In the horizontal plane, the processes displayed no preferred orientation and terminal endings were randomly distributed. In the vertical plane, the processes displayed a horizontal preference, but also ascended and descended into the inner nuclear layer and proximal inner plexiform layer, respectively. These results suggest that the AII amacrine AIS‐like process is unlikely to take part in conventional synaptic connections, but may instead be adapted to respond to volume neurotransmission by means of extrasynaptic receptors.

                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Progressive myoclonic epilepsy is a group of neurodegenerative diseases with complex clinical and genetic heterogeneity, which is associated with spontaneous or action-induced myoclonus and progressive neurodegeneration. Since 2020, 4 families with progressive myoclonic epilepsy-11 [OMIM#618876] have been reported with a very limited spectrum of SEMA6B pathogenic variants. In our study, whole-exome sequencing was used in a proband from a nonconsanguineous Chinese family presenting with growth retardation and recurrent atonic seizures. A deletion mutation (c.1960_1978del, p.Leu654Argfs*25) in the last exon of SEMA6B was detected, which is a de novo variant and pathogenic. The new genetic evidence we reported here strengthened the gene-disease relationship, and the gene curation level between SEMA6B and progressive myoclonic epilepsy-11 became “strong” following the ClinGen SOP. Therefore, the results of this study broaden the mutation spectrum of SEMA6B in different ethnic groups and strengthen the gene-disease relationship between SEMA6B and progressive myoclonic epilepsy-11.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;We aimed to investigate the ability of MRI radiomics features-based machine learning (ML) models to classify the time since stroke onset (TSS), which could aid in stroke assessment and treatment options.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec2&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Methods&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;This study involved 84 patients with acute ischemic stroke due to anterior circulation artery occlusion (51 in the training cohort and 33 in the independent test cohort). Region of infarct segmentation was manually outlined by 3D-slicer software. Image processing including registration, normalization and radiomics features calculation were done in R (version 3.6.1). A total of 4312 radiomic features from each image sequence were captured and used in six ML models to estimate stroke onset time for binary classification (≤ 4.5 h). Receiver-operating characteristic curve (ROC) and other parameters were calculated to evaluate the performance of the models in both training and test cohorts.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;

                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Twelve radiomics and six clinic features were selected to construct the ML models for TSS classification. The deep learning model-based DWI/ADC radiomic features performed the best for binary TSS classification in the independent test cohort, with an AUC of 0.754, accuracy of 0.788, sensitivity of 0.952, specificity of 0.500, positive predictive value of 0.769, and negative predictive value of 0.857, respectively. Furthermore, adding clinical information did not improve the performance of the DWI/ADC-based deep learning model. The TSS prediction models can be visited at: &lt;a class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot; href=&quot;http://123.57.65.199:3838/deeptss/&quot;&gt;http://123.57.65.199:3838/deeptss/&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Experimental Brain Research: Spatial asymmetries (“pseudoneglect”) in free visual exploration—modulation of age and relationship to line bisection</title>

	<content:encoded>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;When humans visually explore an image, they typically tend to start exploring its left side. This phenomenon, so-called pseudoneglect, is well known, but its time-course has only sparsely been studied. Furthermore, it is unclear whether age influences pseudoneglect, and the relationship between visuo-spatial attentional asymmetries in a free visual exploration task and a classical line bisection task has not been established. To address these questions, 60 healthy participants, aged between 22 and 86, were assessed by means of a free visual exploration task with a series of naturalistic, colour photographs of everyday scenes, while their gaze was recorded by means of a contact-free eye-tracking system. Furthermore, a classical line bisection task was administered, and information concerning handedness and subjective alertness during the experiment was obtained. The results revealed a time-sensitive window during visual exploration, between 260 and 960 ms, in which age was a significant predictor of the leftward bias in gaze position, i.e., of pseudoneglect. Moreover, pseudoneglect as assessed by the line bisection task correlated with the average gaze position throughout a time-window of 300–1490 ms during the visual exploration task. These results suggest that age influences visual exploration and pseudoneglect in a time-sensitive fashion, and that the degree of pseudoneglect in the line bisection task correlates with the average gaze position during visual exploration in a time-sensitive manner.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Successful propagation throughout the step cycle is contingent on adequate regulation of whole-limb stiffness by proprioceptive feedback. Following spinal cord injury (SCI), there are changes in the strength and organization of proprioceptive feedback that can result in altered joint stiffness. In this study, we measured changes in autogenic feedback of five hindlimb extensor muscles following chronic low thoracic lateral hemisection (LSH) in decerebrate cats. We present three features of the autogenic stretch reflex obtained using a mechanographic method. Stiffness was a measure of the resistance to stretch during the length change. The dynamic index documented the extent of adaptation or increase of the force response during the hold phase, and the impulse measured the integral of the response from initiation of a stretch to the return to the initial length. The changes took the form of variable and transient increases in the stiffness of vastus (VASTI) group, soleus (SOL), and flexor hallucis longus (FHL), and either increased (VASTI) or decreased adaptation (GAS and PLANT). The stiffness of the gastrocnemius group (GAS) was also variable over time but remained elevated at the final time point. An unexpected finding was that these effects were observed bilaterally. Potential reasons for this finding and possible sources of increased excitability to this muscle group are discussed.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Perfusion imaging and clinical outcome in acute ischemic stroke with large core</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.26152?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Objective
Mechanical thrombectomy (MT) is not recommended for acute stroke with large vessel occlusion (LVO) and a large volume of irreversibly injured tissue (“core”). Perfusion imaging may identify a subset of patients with large core who benefit from MT.


Methods
We compared two cohorts of LVO‐related patients with large core (&amp;gt;50 ml on diffusion‐weighted‐imaging or CT‐perfusion using RAPID), available perfusion imaging, and treated within 6 hrs from onset by either MT + Best Medical Management (BMM) in one prospective study, or BMM alone in the pre‐MT era from a prospective registry. Primary outcome was 90‐day modified Rankin Scale≤2. We searched for an interaction between treatment group and amount of penumbra as estimated by the mismatch ratio (MMRatio = critical hypoperfusion/core volume).


Results
Overall, 107 patients were included (56 MT + BMM + 51 BMM): Mean age was 68 ± 15 yrs, median core volume 99 ml (IQR: 72–131) and MMRatio 1.4 (IQR: 1.0–1.9). Baseline clinical and radiological variables were similar between the 2 groups, except for a higher intravenous thrombolysis rate in the BMM group. The MMRatio strongly modified the clinical outcome following MT (Pinteraction &amp;lt; 0.001 for continuous MMRatio); MT was associated with a higher rate of good outcome in patients with, but not in those without, MMRatio&amp;gt;1.2 (adjusted OR [95%CI] = 6.8 [1.7–27.0] vs. 0.7 [0.1–6.2], respectively). Similar findings were present for MMRatio≥1.8 in the subgroup with core≥70 ml. Parenchymal hemorrhage on follow‐up imaging was more frequent in the MT + BMM group regardless of the MMRatio.


Interpretation
Perfusion imaging may help select which patients with large core should be considered for MT. Randomized studies are warranted.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Spinal fluid myeloid microvesicles predict disease course in multiple sclerosis</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.26154?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Objective
In vivo measures of myeloid activity are promising biomarkers in Multiple Sclerosis. We previously demonstrated that CSF myeloid microvesicles are markers of microglial/macrophage activity and neuroinflammation in Multiple Sclerosis. Here we aimed at investigating diagnostic and prognostic value of myeloid microvesicles in clinical setting.


Methods
Six‐hundred‐one patients discharged with a diagnosis of neuroinflammatory, neurodegenerative or no neurological disease were enrolled. Myeloid microvesicles were measured with flow‐cytometry as Ib4+ events in fresh CSF. Clinical, demographical and MRI data were collected at diagnosis (all patients) and during follow‐up (n=176).


Results
CSF myeloid microvesicles were elevated in neuroinflammatory patients as compared to neurodegenerative and control group. In multiple sclerosis, microvesicles were higher in patients with MRI disease activity and their concentration increased along with the enhancing lesions number (p&amp;lt;0.0001, Jonckheere‐Terpstra). CSF myeloid microvesicles were also higher in patients with higher disease activity in the month and year preceding diagnosis.
Microvesicles excellently discriminated between relapsing‐remitting and control group (ROC curve, AUC=0.939, p&amp;lt;0.0001) and between radiologically isolated syndrome and unspecific brain lesions (0.942, p&amp;lt;0.0001). Furthermore, microvesicles were independent predictors of prognosis both for relapsing‐remitting and progressive groups. Microvesicles independently predict future disease activity in relapsing‐remitting patients (HR=1.967, CI95% 1.147‐3.372), once correcting for prognostic factors of standard clinical use. In the progressive group, microvesicles were independent predictors of disability accrual (HR=10.767, CI95% 1.335‐86.812).


Interpretation
Our results confirm that CSF myeloid microvesicles are a clinically meaningful biomarker of neuroinflammation and microglial/macrophage activity in vivo. These findings may support a possible use in clinical practice during diagnostic work‐up and prognostic assessment.

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: Organization and neural connections of the lateral complex in the brain of the desert locust</title>

	<content:encoded>Single cell tracer injections suggest that the lateral complex in the brain of the desert locust integrates sensory signals with internal compass information to drive descending and premotor neurons that are likely involved in steering of the animal during locomotion. Overlap of inputs and outputs of the central complex in the gall and ovoid body of the lateral complex suggest feedback loops in the sky compass system.






Abstract
The lateral complexes (LXs) are bilaterally paired neuropils in the insect brain that mediate communication between the central complex (CX), a brain center controlling spatial orientation, various sensory processing areas, and thoracic motor centers that execute locomotion. The LX of the desert locust consists of the lateral accessory lobe (LAL), and the medial and lateral bulb. We have analyzed the anatomical organization and the neuronal connections of the LX in the locust, to provide a basis for future functional studies. Reanalyzing the morphology of neurons connecting the CX and the LX revealed likely feedback loops in the sky compass network of the CX via connections in the gall of the LAL and a newly identified neuropil termed ovoid body. In addition, we characterized sixteen different types of neuron that connect the LAL with other areas in the brain. Eight types of neuron provide information flow between both LALs, five types are LAL input neurons, and three types are LAL output neurons. Among these are neurons providing input from sensory brain areas such as the lobula and antennal neuropils. Brain regions most often targeted by LAL neurons are the posterior slope, the wedge, and the crepine. Two descending neurons with dendrites in the LAL were identified. Our data support and complement existing knowledge about how the LAL is embedded in the neuronal network involved in processing of sensory information and generation of appropriate behavioral output for goal‐directed locomotion.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Targeted tDCS mitigates dual‐task costs to gait and balance in older adults</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.26156?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract

Objective
Among older adults, the ability to stand or walk while performing cognitive tasks (i.e., dual‐tasking) requires coordinated activation of several brain networks. In this multi‐center, double‐blinded, randomized, and sham‐controlled study, we examined the effects of modulating the excitability of the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (L‐DLPFC) and the primary sensorimotor cortex (SM1) on dual‐task performance ‘costs’ to standing and walking.


Methods
Fifty‐seven older adults without overt illness or disease completed four separate study visits during which they received 20‐minutes of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) optimized to facilitate the excitability of the L‐DLPFC and SM1 simultaneously, each region separately, or neither region (sham). Before and immediately after stimulation, participants completed a dual‐task paradigm in which they were asked to stand and walk with and without concurrent performance of a serial‐subtraction task.


Results
tDCS simultaneously targeting the L‐DLPFC and SM1, as well as tDCS targeting the L‐DLPFC alone, mitigated dual‐task costs to standing and walking to a greater extent than tDCS targeting SM1 alone or sham (p&amp;lt;0.02). Blinding efficacy was excellent and participant subjective belief in the type of stimulation received (real or sham) did not contribute to the observed functional benefits of tDCS.


Interpretation
These results demonstrate that in older adults, dual‐task decrements may be amenable to change and implicate L‐DPFC excitability as a modifiable component of the control system that enables dual‐task standing and walking. tDCS may be used to improve resilience and the ability of older results to walk and stand under challenging conditions, potentially enhancing everyday functioning.

                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec1&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Primary progressive aphasia (PPA) is divided into three prototypical subtypes that are all characterized by their single core symptom of aphasia. Although later in their course, other cognitive, behavioral, and motor domains may become involved, little is known about the progression profile of each subtype relative to the other subtypes.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec2&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Methods&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;In this longitudinal retrospective cohort study, based on the recent biomarker-supported diagnostic criteria, 24 subjects diagnosed with semantic variant (svPPA), 22 with non-fluent variant (nfvPPA), and 18 with logopenic variant (lvPPA) were collected and followed up for 1–6 years. Symptom distribution, cognitive test and neuropsychiatric inventory scores, and progression into another syndrome were assessed.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec3&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Over time, lvPPA progressed with broader language problems (PPA-extended) and nfvPPA progressed to mutism, whereas semantic impairment remained the major problem in svPPA. Apart from linguistic problems, svPPA developed pronounced behavioral disturbances, whereas lvPPA exhibited a greater cognitive decline. By contrast, in nfvPPA motor deficits were more common. Furthermore, within 5 years (IQR = 2.5) after clinical onset, 65.6% of the patients additionally fulfilled the clinical criteria for another neurodegenerative syndrome (PPA-plus). Fourteen out of 24 (58%) svPPA patients additionally met the diagnostic criteria of behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (5.1 years, IQR = 1.1), whereas the clinical features of 15/18 (83%) lvPPA patients were consistent with Alzheimer disease dementia (4.5 years IQR = 3.4). Furthermore, 12/22 (54%) of the subjects with the nfvPPA progressed to meet the diagnostic criteria of corticobasal syndrome, progressive supranuclear palsy, or motor neuron disease (5.1 years IQR = 3.4).&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec4&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Discussion&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Despite aphasia being the initial and unique hallmark of the syndrome, our longitudinal results showed that PPA is not a language limited disorder and progression differs widely for each subtype, both with respect to the nature of symptoms and disease duration.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Experimental Brain Research: Time-dependent inhibition of covert shifts of attention</title>

	<content:encoded>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Visual transients can interrupt overt orienting by abolishing the execution of a planned eye movement due about 90 ms later, a phenomenon known as saccadic inhibition (SI). It is not known if the same inhibitory process might influence covert orienting in the absence of saccades, and consequently alter visual perception. In Experiment 1 (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;n &lt;/em&gt;= 14), we measured orientation discrimination during a covert orienting task in which an uninformative exogenous visual cue preceded the onset of an oriented probe by 140–290 ms. In half of the trials, the onset of the probe was accompanied by a brief irrelevant flash, a visual transient that would normally induce SI. We report a time-dependent inhibition of covert orienting in which the irrelevant flash impaired orientation discrimination accuracy when the probe followed the cue by 190 and 240 ms. The interference was more pronounced when the cue was incongruent with the probe location, suggesting an impact on the reorienting component of the attentional shift. In Experiment 2 (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;n &lt;/em&gt;= 12), we tested whether the inhibitory effect of the flash could occur within an earlier time range, or only within the later, reorienting range. We presented probes at congruent cue locations in a time window between 50 and 200 ms. Similar to Experiment 1, discrimination performance was altered at 200 ms after the cue. We suggest that covert attention may be susceptible to similar inhibitory mechanisms that generate SI, especially in later stages of attentional shifting (&amp;gt; 200 ms after a cue), typically associated with reorienting.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Experimental Brain Research: The role of binocular disparity and active motion parallax in cybersickness</title>
	<link>http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s00221-021-06124-6</link>

                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Cybersickness is an enduring problem for users of virtual environments. While it is generally assumed that cybersickness is caused by discrepancies in perceived self-motion between the visual and vestibular systems, little is known about the relative contribution of active motion parallax and binocular disparity to the occurrence of cybersickness. We investigated the role of these two depth cues in cybersickness by simulating a roller-coaster ride using a head-mounted display. Participants could see the tracks via a virtual frame placed at the front of the roller-coaster cart. We manipulated the state of the frame, so it behaved like: (1) a window into the virtual scene, (2) a 2D screen, (3) and (4) a window for one of the two depth cues, and a 2D screen for the other. Participants completed the Simulator Sickness Questionnaire before and after the experiment, and verbally reported their level of discomfort at repeated intervals during the ride. Additionally, participants’ electrodermal activity (EDA) was recorded. The results of the questionnaire and the continuous ratings revealed the largest increase in cybersickness when the frame behaved like a window, and least increase when the frame behaved like a 2D screen. Cybersickness scores were at an intermediate level for the conditions where the frame simulated only one depth cue. This suggests that neither active motion parallax nor binocular disparity had a more prominent effect on the severity of cybersickness. The EDA responses increased at about the same rate in all conditions, suggesting that EDA is not necessarily coupled with subjectively experienced cybersickness.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Broad scale remote sensing promises to build forest inventories at unprecedented scales. A crucial step in this process is to associate sensor data into individual crowns. While dozens of crown detection algorithms have been proposed, their performance is typically not compared based on standard data or evaluation metrics. There is a need for a benchmark dataset to minimize differences in reported results as well as support evaluation of algorithms across a broad range of forest types. Combining RGB, LiDAR and hyperspectral sensor data from the USA National Ecological Observatory Network’s Airborne Observation Platform with multiple types of evaluation data, we created a benchmark dataset to assess crown detection and delineation methods for canopy trees covering dominant forest types in the United States. This benchmark dataset includes an R package to standardize evaluation metrics and simplify comparisons between methods. The benchmark dataset contains over 6,000 image-annotated crowns, 400 field-annotated crowns, and 3,000 canopy stem points from a wide range of forest types. In addition, we include over 10,000 training crowns for optional use. We discuss the different evaluation data sources and assess the accuracy of the image-annotated crowns by comparing annotations among multiple annotators as well as overlapping field-annotated crowns. We provide an example submission and score for an open-source algorithm that can serve as a baseline for future methods.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/6pTTI418wOk&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Zika virus (ZIKV) and chikungunya virus (CHIKV) were recently introduced into the Americas resulting in significant disease burdens. Understanding their spatial and temporal dynamics at the subnational level is key to informing surveillance and preparedness for future epidemics. We analyzed anonymized line list data on approximately 105,000 Zika virus disease and 412,000 chikungunya fever suspected and laboratory-confirmed cases during the 2014–2017 epidemics. We first determined the week of invasion in each city. Out of 1,122, 288 cities met criteria for epidemic invasion by ZIKA and 338 cities by CHIKV. We analyzed risk factors for invasion using linear and logistic regression models. We also estimated that the geographic origin of both epidemics was located in Barranquilla, north Colombia. We assessed the spatial and temporal invasion dynamics of both viruses to analyze transmission between cities using a suite of (i) gravity models, (ii) Stouffer’s rank models, and (iii) radiation models with two types of distance metrics, geographic distance and travel time between cities. Invasion risk was best captured by a gravity model when accounting for geographic distance and intermediate levels of density dependence; Stouffer’s rank model with geographic distance performed similarly well. Although a few long-distance invasion events occurred at the beginning of the epidemics, an estimated distance power of 1.7 (95% CrI: 1.5–2.0) from the gravity models suggests that spatial spread was primarily driven by short-distance transmission. Similarities between the epidemics were highlighted by jointly fitted models, which were preferred over individual models when the transmission intensity was allowed to vary across arboviruses. However, ZIKV spread considerably faster than CHIKV.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/N60hMmsOwUU&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

There are currently 85,000 chemicals registered with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) under the Toxic Substances Control Act, but only a small fraction have measured toxicological data. To address this gap, high-throughput screening (HTS) and computational methods are vital. As part of one such HTS effort, embryonic zebrafish were used to examine a suite of morphological and mortality endpoints at six concentrations from over 1,000 unique chemicals found in the ToxCast library (phase 1 and 2). We hypothesized that by using a conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN) or deep neural networks (DNN), and leveraging this large set of toxicity data we could efficiently predict toxic outcomes of untested chemicals. Utilizing a novel method in this space, we converted the 3D structural information into a weighted set of points while retaining all information about the structure. &lt;i&gt;In vivo&lt;/i&gt; toxicity and chemical data were used to train two neural network generators. The first was a DNN (Go-ZT) while the second utilized cGAN architecture (GAN-ZT) to train generators to produce toxicity data. Our results showed that Go-ZT significantly outperformed the cGAN, support vector machine, random forest and multilayer perceptron models in cross-validation, and when tested against an external test dataset. By combining both Go-ZT and GAN-ZT, our consensus model improved the SE, SP, PPV, and Kappa, to 71.4%, 95.9%, 71.4% and 0.673, respectively, resulting in an area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) of 0.837. Considering their potential use as prescreening tools, these models could provide &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; toxicity predictions and insight into the hundreds of thousands of untested chemicals to prioritize compounds for HT testing.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/4ofsmWSkuFw&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: eVIP2: Expression-based variant impact phenotyping to predict the function of gene variants</title>

While advancements in genome sequencing have identified millions of somatic mutations in cancer, their functional impact is poorly understood. We previously developed the expression-based variant impact phenotyping (eVIP) method to use gene expression data to characterize the function of gene variants. The eVIP method uses a decision tree-based algorithm to predict the functional impact of somatic variants by comparing gene expression signatures induced by introduction of wild-type (WT) versus mutant cDNAs in cell lines. The method distinguishes between variants that are gain-of-function, loss-of-function, change-of-function, or neutral. We present eVIP2, software that allows for pathway analysis (eVIP Pathways) and usage with RNA-seq data. To demonstrate the eVIP2 software and approach, we characterized two recurrent frameshift variants in RNF43, a negative regulator of Wnt signaling, frequently mutated in colorectal, gastric, and endometrial cancer. RNF43 WT, RNF43 R117fs, RNF43 G659fs, or GFP control cDNA were overexpressed in HEK293T cells. Analysis with eVIP2 predicted that the frameshift at position 117 was a loss-of-function mutation, as expected. The second frameshift at position 659 has been previously described as a passenger mutation that maintains the RNF43 WT function as a negative regulator of Wnt. Surprisingly, eVIP2 predicted G659fs to be a change-of-function mutation. Additional eVIP Pathways analysis of RNF43 G659fs predicted 10 pathways to be significantly altered, including TNF-α via NFκB signaling, KRAS signaling, and hypoxia, highlighting the benefit of a more comprehensive approach when determining the impact of gene variant function. To validate these predictions, we performed reporter assays and found that each pathway activated by expression of RNF43 G659fs, but not expression of RNF43 WT, was identified as impacted by eVIP2, supporting that RNF43 G659fs is a change-of-function mutation and its effect on the identified pathways. Pathway activation was further validated by Western blot analysis. Lastly, we show primary colon adenocarcinoma patient samples with R117fs and G659fs variants have transcriptional profiles similar to BRAF missense mutations with activated RAS/MAPK signaling, consistent with KRAS signaling pathways being GOF in both variants. The eVIP2 method is an important step towards overcoming the current challenge of variant interpretation in the implementation of precision medicine. eVIP2 is available at https://github.com/BrooksLabUCSC/eVIP2.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/AwH86XwVOsY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience Research: The transcription factors SIX3 and VAX1 are required for suprachiasmatic nucleus circadian output and fertility in female mice</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jnr.24864?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Using transgenic mice, where the Synapsincre allele conditionally deleted the homeodomain transcription factors SIX homeobox 3 (Six3) or ventral anterior homeobox 1 (Vax1) in maturing neurons, here referred to as Six3syn and Vax1syn mice, we show that Six3 and Vax1 are required for female, but not male fertility. Specifically, Six3syn and Vax1syn females have weakened suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) circadian output, causing weakened circadian wheel‐running activity patterns. The weakened SCN output was associated with impairment of the luteinizing hormone (LH) surge driving ovulation, providing a mechanism linking weakened SCN function with the LH surge and female subfertility.

Abstract
The homeodomain transcription factors sine oculis homeobox 3 (Six3) and ventral anterior homeobox 1 (Vax1) are required for brain development. Their expression in specific brain areas is maintained in adulthood, where their functions are poorly understood. To identify the roles of Six3 and Vax1 in neurons, we conditionally deleted each gene using Synapsincre, a promoter targeting maturing neurons, and generated Six3syn and Vax1syn mice. Six3syn and Vax1syn females, but not males, had reduced fertility, due to impairment of the luteinizing hormone (LH) surge driving ovulation. In nocturnal rodents, the LH surge requires a precise timing signal from the brain's circadian pacemaker, the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), near the time of activity onset. Indeed, both Six3syn and Vax1syn females had impaired rhythmic SCN output, which was associated with weakened Period 2 molecular clock function in both Six3syn and Vax1syn mice. These impairments were associated with a reduction of the SCN neuropeptide vasoactive intestinal peptide in Vax1syn mice and a modest weakening of SCN timekeeping function in both Six3syn and Vax1syn mice. Changes in SCN function were associated with mistimed peak PER2::LUC expression in the SCN and pituitary in both Six3syn and Vax1syn females. Interestingly, Six3syn ovaries presented reduced sensitivity to LH, causing reduced ovulation during superovulation. In conclusion, we have identified novel roles of the homeodomain transcription factors SIX3 and VAX1 in neurons, where they are required for proper molecular circadian clock function, SCN rhythmic output, and female fertility.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2021.672614</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Sampling the live brain is difficult and dangerous, and withdrawing cerebrospinal fluid is uncomfortable and frightening to the subject, so new sources of real-time analysis are constantly sought. Cell-free DNA (cfDNA) derived from glia and neurons offers the potential for wide-ranging neurological disease diagnosis and monitoring. However, new laboratory and bioinformatic strategies are needed. DNA methylation patterns on individual cfDNA fragments can be used to ascribe their cell-of-origin. Here we describe bisulfite sequencing assays and bioinformatic processing methods to identify cfDNA derived from glia and neurons. In proof-of-concept experiments, we describe the presence of both glia- and neuron-cfDNA in the blood plasma of human subjects following mild trauma. This detection of glia- and neuron-cfDNA represents a significant step forward in the translation of liquid biopsies for neurological diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Attenuated Postprandial GLP-1 Response in Parkinson’s Disease</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.660942</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The incretin hormone glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) has neuroprotective effects in animal models of Parkinson’s disease (PD), and GLP-1 receptor agonists are associated with clinical improvements in human PD patients. GLP-1 is produced and secreted by intestinal L-cells in response to consumption of a meal. Specifically, intestinal microbiota produce short chain fatty acids (SCFA) which, in turn, promote secretion of GLP-1 into the systemic circulation, from which it can enter the brain. Our group and others have reported that PD patients have an altered intestinal microbial community that produces less SCFA compared to age-matched controls. In this report, we demonstrate that PD patients have diminished GLP-1 secretion in response to a meal compared to their household controls. Peak postprandial GLP-1 levels did not correlate with PD disease severity, motor function, or disease duration. These data provide the scientific rationale for future studies designed to elucidate the role of GLP-1 in the pathogenesis of PD and test the potential utility of GLP-1-directed therapies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Recent Trends and Perspectives in Cerebral Organoids Imaging and Analysis</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.629067</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Purpose: Since their first generation in 2013, the use of cerebral organoids has spread exponentially. Today, the amount of generated data is becoming challenging to analyze manually. This review aims to overview the current image acquisition methods and to subsequently identify the needs in image analysis tools for cerebral organoids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: To address this question, we went through all recent articles published on the subject and annotated the protocols, acquisition methods, and algorithms used.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Over the investigated period of time, confocal microscopy and bright-field microscopy were the most used acquisition techniques. Cell counting, the most common task, is performed in 20% of the articles and area; around 12% of articles calculate morphological parameters. Image analysis on cerebral organoids is performed in majority using ImageJ software (around 52%) and Matlab language (4%). Treatments remain mostly semi-automatic. We highlight the limitations encountered in image analysis in the cerebral organoid field and suggest possible solutions and implementations to develop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: In addition to providing an overview of cerebral organoids cultures and imaging, this work highlights the need to improve the existing image analysis methods for such images and the need for specific analysis tools. These solutions could specifically help to monitor the growth of future standardized cerebral organoids.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.681634</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Recent evidence suggests that being physically active can mitigate age-related white matter (WM) changes. In a randomized clinical trial, the effect of 6-month aerobic exercise (AE) or stretching/toning interventions on measures of WM microstructure (WMM) was assessed in a sample of 74 adults aged 20–67 years. Major WM pathways were reconstructed. No significant group-level change in WM tract microstructure following an AE training was observed. Without adjustment for multiple comparisons, an increase in fractional anisotropy (FA) and a decrease in mean diffusivity (MD) of the uncinate fasciculus were observed post-intervention in the AE group in comparison with the stretching group. In the AE group, a significant increase in cardiorespiratory fitness was measured but did not correlate with FA and MD change. The present results of this study are in accordance with similar studies in healthy adults that did not show significant benefit on WMM after participating in an AE program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clinical Trial Registration:Clinicaltrials.gov identifier, NCT01179958.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Presurgical Evaluation of Epilepsy Using Resting-State MEG Functional Connectivity</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.649074</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Epilepsy is caused by abnormal electrical discharges (clinically identified by electrophysiological recording) in a specific part of the brain [originating in only one part of the brain, namely, the epileptogenic zone (EZ)]. Epilepsy is now defined as an archetypical hyperexcited neural network disorder. It can be investigated through the network analysis of interictal discharges, ictal discharges, and resting-state functional connectivity. Currently, there is an increasing interest in embedding resting-state connectivity analysis into the preoperative evaluation of epilepsy. Among the various neuroimaging technologies employed to achieve brain functional networks, magnetoencephalography (MEG) with the excellent temporal resolution is an ideal tool for estimating the resting-state connectivity between brain regions, which can reveal network abnormalities in epilepsy. What value does MEG resting-state functional connectivity offer for epileptic presurgical evaluation? Regarding this topic, this paper introduced the origin of MEG and the workflow of constructing source–space functional connectivity based on MEG signals. Resting-state functional connectivity abnormalities correlate with epileptogenic networks, which are defined by the brain regions involved in the production and propagation of epileptic activities. This paper reviewed the evidence of altered epileptic connectivity based on low- or high-frequency oscillations (HFOs) and the evidence of the advantage of using simultaneous MEG and intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) recordings. More importantly, this review highlighted that MEG-based resting-state functional connectivity has the potential to predict postsurgical outcomes. In conclusion, resting-state MEG functional connectivity has made a substantial progress toward serving as a candidate biomarker included in epileptic presurgical evaluations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.691067</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The neuroinflammatory basis of depression encompasses the detrimental role of otherwise supportive non-neuronal cells and neuroinflammation in hampering neuronal function, leading to depressive behavior. Animals subjected to different stress paradigms show glial cell activation and a surge in proinflammatory cytokines in various brain regions. The concept of sterile inflammation observed in animal models of depression has intrigued many researchers to determine the possible triggers of central immune cell activation. Notably, microglial activation and subsequent phenotypic polarization in depression have been strongly advocated by the wealth of recent preclinical studies; however, findings from human studies have shown contradictory results. Despite intensive investigation, many research gaps still exist to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of neuroinflammatory cascades underlying the pathophysiology of depression. In this mini-review, recent progress in understanding neuroinflammatory mechanisms in light of experimental models of depression will be thoroughly discussed. The challenges of mirroring depression in animal and in vitro models will also be highlighted. Furthermore, prospects of targeting neuroinflammation to treat depressive disorder will be covered.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Background and Purpose&lt;p&gt;The effect of antiplatelet therapy (APT) on early postoperative rehemorrhage and outcomes of patients with spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is still unclear. This study is to evaluate the effect of preoperative APT on early postoperative rehemorrhage and outcomes in ICH patients.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;This was a multicenter cohort study. ICH patients undergoing surgery were divided into APT group and no antiplatelet therapy (nAPT) group according to whether patients received APT or not. Chi-square test, t-test, and Mann–Whitney U test were used to compare the differences in variables, postoperative rehematoma, and outcomes between groups. Multivariate logistics regression analysis was used to correct for confounding variables, which were different in group comparison.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;One hundred fifty ICH patients undergoing surgical treatment were consecutively included in this study. Thirty five (23.33%) people were included in the APT group, while 115 (76.67%) people were included in the nAPT group. The incidence of early postoperative rehemorrhage in the APT group was significantly higher than that in the nAPT group (25.7% VS 10.4%, p = 0.047 &amp;lt; 0.05). After adjustment for age, ischemic stroke history, and ventricular hematoma, preoperative APT had no significant effect on early postoperative rehemorrhage (p = 0.067). There was no statistical difference between the two groups in early poorer outcomes (p = 0.222) at 14 days after surgery. After adjustment for age, ischemic stroke history, and ventricular hematoma, preoperative APT also had no significant effect on early poorer modified Rankin Scale (mRS) (p = 0.072).&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, preoperative APT appears to be safe and have no significant effect on early postoperative rehematoma and outcomes in ICH patients.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: PKC Delta Activation Promotes Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress (ERS) and NLR Family Pyrin Domain-Containing 3 (NLRP3) Inflammasome Activation Subsequent to Asynuclein-Induced Microglial Activation: Involvement of Thioredoxin-Interacting Protein (TXNIP)/Thioredoxin (Trx) Redoxisome Pathway</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.661505</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A classical hallmark of Parkinson’s disease (PD) pathogenesis is the accumulation of misfolded alpha-synuclein (αSyn) within Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites, although its role in microglial dysfunction and resultant dopaminergic (DAergic) neurotoxicity is still elusive. Previously, we identified that protein kinase C delta (PKCδ) is activated in post mortem PD brains and experimental Parkinsonism and that it participates in reactive microgliosis; however, the relationship between PKCδ activation, endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS) and the reactive microglial activation state in the context of α-synucleinopathy is largely unknown. Herein, we show that oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, NLR family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome activation, and PKCδ activation increased concomitantly with ERS markers, including the activating transcription factor 4 (ATF-4), serine/threonine-protein kinase/endoribonuclease inositol-requiring enzyme 1α (p-IRE1α), p-eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF2α) as well as increased generation of neurotoxic cytokines, including IL-1β in aggregated αSyn&lt;sub&gt;agg&lt;/sub&gt;-stimulated primary microglia. Importantly, in mouse primary microglia-treated with αSyn&lt;sub&gt;agg&lt;/sub&gt; we observed increased expression of Thioredoxin-interacting protein (TXNIP), an endogenous inhibitor of the thioredoxin (Trx) pathway, a major antioxidant protein system. Additionally, αSyn&lt;sub&gt;agg&lt;/sub&gt; promoted interaction between NLRP3 and TXNIP in these cells. In vitro knockdown of PKCδ using siRNA reduced ERS and led to reduced expression of TXNIP and the NLRP3 activation response in αSyn&lt;sub&gt;agg&lt;/sub&gt;-stimulated mouse microglial cells (MMCs). Additionally, attenuation of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mitoROS) via mito-apocynin and amelioration of ERS via the eIF2α inhibitor salubrinal (SAL) reduced the induction of the ERS/TXNIP/NLRP3 signaling axis, suggesting that mitochondrial dysfunction and ERS may act in concert to promote the αSyn&lt;sub&gt;agg&lt;/sub&gt;-induced microglial activation response. Likewise, knockdown of TXNIP by siRNA attenuated the αSyn&lt;sub&gt;agg&lt;/sub&gt;-induced NLRP3 inflammasome activation response. Finally, unilateral injection of αSyn preformed fibrils (αSyn&lt;sub&gt;PFF&lt;/sub&gt;) into the striatum of wild-type mice induced a significant increase in the expression of nigral p-PKCδ, ERS markers, and upregulation of the TXNIP/NLRP3 inflammasome signaling axis prior to delayed loss of TH&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; neurons. Together, our results suggest that inhibition of ERS and its downstream signaling mediators TXNIP and NLRP3 might represent novel therapeutic avenues for ameliorating microglia-mediated neuroinflammation in PD and other synucleinopathies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder. AD is characterized by the production and aggregation of beta-amyloid (Aβ) peptides, hyperphosphorylated tau proteins that form neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), and subsequent neuroinflammation, synaptic dysfunction, autophagy and oxidative stress. Non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) can be used as potential therapeutic targets and biomarkers due to their vital regulatory roles in multiple biological processes involved in disease development. The involvement of ncRNAs in the pathogenesis of AD has been increasingly recognized. Here, we review the ncRNAs implicated in AD and elaborate on their main regulatory pathways, which might have contributions for discovering novel therapeutic targets and drugs for AD.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Metabolomics and proteomics, like other omics domains, usually face a data mining challenge in providing an understandable output to advance in biomarker discovery and precision medicine. Often, statistical analysis is one of the most difficult challenges and it is critical in the subsequent biological interpretation of the results. Because of this, combined with the computational programming skills needed for this type of analysis, several bioinformatic tools aimed at simplifying metabolomics and proteomics data analysis have emerged. However, sometimes the analysis is still limited to a few hidebound statistical methods and to data sets with limited flexibility. POMAShiny is a web-based tool that provides a structured, flexible and user-friendly workflow for the visualization, exploration and statistical analysis of metabolomics and proteomics data. This tool integrates several statistical methods, some of them widely used in other types of omics, and it is based on the POMA R/Bioconductor package, which increases the reproducibility and flexibility of analyses outside the web environment. POMAShiny and POMA are both freely available at https://github.com/nutrimetabolomics/POMAShiny and https://github.com/nutrimetabolomics/POMA, respectively.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/w8oDgONs5wU&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Modeling changes in probabilistic reinforcement learning during adolescence</title>

In the real world, many relationships between events are uncertain and probabilistic. Uncertainty is also likely to be a more common feature of daily experience for youth because they have less experience to draw from than adults. Some studies suggest probabilistic learning may be inefficient in youths compared to adults, while others suggest it may be more efficient in youths in mid adolescence. Here we used a probabilistic reinforcement learning task to test how youth age 8-17 (N = 187) and adults age 18-30 (N = 110) learn about stable probabilistic contingencies. Performance increased with age through early-twenties, then stabilized. Using hierarchical Bayesian methods to fit computational reinforcement learning models, we show that all participants’ performance was better explained by models in which negative outcomes had minimal to no impact on learning. The performance increase over age was driven by 1) an increase in learning rate (i.e. decrease in integration time scale); 2) a decrease in noisy/exploratory choices. In mid-adolescence age 13-15, salivary testosterone and learning rate were positively related. We discuss our findings in the context of other studies and hypotheses about adolescent brain development.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/YWuy92-1tZE&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

It has been widely accepted that dopamine (DA) plays a major role in motivation, yet the specific contribution of DA signaling at D&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-like receptor (D&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;R) and D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-like receptor (D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;R) to cost–benefit trade-off remains unclear. Here, by combining pharmacological manipulation of DA receptors (DARs) and positron emission tomography (PET) imaging, we assessed the relationship between the degree of D&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;R/D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;R blockade and changes in benefit- and cost-based motivation for goal-directed behavior of macaque monkeys. We found that the degree of blockade of either D&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;R or D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;R was associated with a reduction of the positive impact of reward amount and increasing delay discounting. Workload discounting was selectively increased by D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;R antagonism. In addition, blocking both D&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;R and D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;R had a synergistic effect on delay discounting but an antagonist effect on workload discounting. These results provide fundamental insight into the distinct mechanisms of DA action in the regulation of the benefit- and cost-based motivation, which have important implications for motivational alterations in both neurological and psychiatric disorders.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/AbZP7xw0cCU&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience Research: Microstructural changes in normal‐appearing white matter in male sleep apnea patients are reversible after treatment: A pilot study</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jnr.24858?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>This study investigates microstructural changes in the Normal Appearing White Matter (NAWM) in patients with Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) before and after specific treatment. Indeed, CPAP‐treatment significantly increased DTI parameters such as Fractional Anisotropy (FA) in NAWM of the brainstem, corpus callosum and bilateral internal capsule of OSA patients at follow‐up compared to baseline. The recovery of NAWM alterations correlated to the improvement in the neurocognitive profile.

Abstract
Visually appreciable white matter (WM) changes have been described in obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). However, few data exist on the involvement of silent WM abnormalities. This prospective study investigated the microstructural integrity of normal‐appearing white matter (NAWM) in male OSA patients before and after continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) treatment, using a neuroimaging approach. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was acquired from 32 participants (16 severe never‐treated OSA and 16 controls). Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and Tract‐Based Spatial Statistics (TBSS) were used to assess the microstructural NAWM changes in fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), axial diffusivity (AD), and radial diffusivity (RD). In order to evaluate the efficacy of the therapy, OSA patients underwent MRI evaluations at baseline and after 3 months of treatment (follow‐up). CPAP treatment significantly increased the FA in NAWM of the brain stem, corpus callosum and bilateral internal capsule of OSA patients at follow‐up compared to baseline (p &amp;lt; 0.05, TFCE‐corrected). OSA patients also showed increases in AD in the corpus callosum, superior corona radiata, and internal capsule of the right hemisphere (p &amp;lt; 0.05, TFCE‐corrected) after CPAP treatment. A significant negative correlation was found between the FA of the corona radiata, corpus callosum, internal capsule, limbic structures, and neuropsychological scores at follow‐up evaluation. No significant differences were found in MD and RD of NAWM in our patients after treatment. Our results demonstrate that FA and AD of NAWM in major tracts such as the corpus callosum and the internal capsule increased significantly after CPAP treatment, as a potential beneficial effect of ventilatory therapy. The recovery of NAWM alterations might also be related to the improvement in the neurocognitive profile, suggesting that nonclearly visible WM alterations may contribute to the physiopathology of OSA‐related cognitive impairment.</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience Research: AMPA induced cognitive impairment in rats: Establishing the role of endoplasmic reticulum stress inhibitor, 4‐PBA</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jnr.24859?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>The effect of AMPA induced excitotoxicity was studied on the rat hippocampus. AMPA apprehended the expression of GLUR receptors which afflict ER environment, thus inducing UPR and other cognitive impairments. Inhibiting ER stress with its specific inhibitor 4‐PBA apprehended cognitive impairment and maintained neurotransmitters levels in addition to detaining UPR induced neuronal damage.

Abstract
Glutamate excitotoxicity and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) recently have been found to be instrumental in the pathogenesis of various neurodegenerative diseases. However, the paucity of literature deciphering the inter‐linkage among glutamate receptors, behavioral alterations, and ER demands thorough exploration. Reckoning the aforesaid concerns, a prospective study was outlined to delineate the influence of ER stress inhibition via 4‐phenylbutyric acid (PBA) on α‐amino‐3‐hydroxy‐5‐methyl‐4‐isoxazole propionic acid (AMPA) excitotoxicity‐induced behavioral aspects and possible ER stress‐glutamate linkage. Male SD rats were randomly divided into four groups namely sham (surgical control+vehicle, group 1), AMPA‐induced excitotoxic group 2 receive a single intra‐hippocampal injection of 10 mM AMPA, group 3 received AMPA along with PBA (i.p, 100 mg/kg body weight) for 15 days, and group 4 received PBA alone. Behavioral analyses were performed prior to the sacrifice of animals and hippocampus was extracted thereafter for further analysis. AMPA‐induced excitotoxicity exhibited significant impairment of locomotion as well as cognitive functions. The levels of neurotransmitters such as dopamine, homo vanillic acid (HVA), norepinephrine, and serotonin were reduced accompanied by reduced expression of GLUR1 and GLUR4 (glutamate receptor) as well as loss of neurons in different layers of hippocampus. ER stress markers were upregulated upon AMPA excitotoxicity. However, chemical chaperone PBA supplementation remarkably mitigated the behavioral alterations along with expression of glutamate and ER stress intermediates/markers in AMPA excitotoxic animals. Therefore, the present exploration convincingly emphasizes the significance of ER stress and its inhibition via PBA in combating cognitive impairment as well as improving locomotion in excitotoxic animals.</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: The distribution, number, and certain neurochemical identities of infracortical white matter neurons in a chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes) brain</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cne.25202?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Immunohistochemical staining for neuronal nuclear marker (NeuN) reveals the subcortical white matter neurons, or white matter interstitial cells (WMICs), deep to the gray matter of the temporal neocortex in the brain of a chimpanzee. GM—gray matter, WM—white matter, dashed line indicates the approximate GM/WM border.







Abstract
We examined the number, distribution, and immunoreactivity of the infracortical white matter neuronal population, also termed white matter interstitial cells (WMICs), throughout the telencephalic white matter of an adult female chimpanzee. Staining for neuronal nuclear marker (NeuN) revealed WMICs throughout the infracortical white matter, these cells being most numerous and dense close to the inner border of cortical layer VI, decreasing significantly in density with depth in the white matter. Stereological analysis of NeuN‐immunopositive cells revealed an estimate of approximately 137.2 million WMICs within the infracortical white matter of the chimpanzee brain studied. Immunostaining revealed subpopulations of WMICs containing neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS, approximately 14.4 million in number), calretinin (CR, approximately 16.7 million), very few WMICs containing parvalbumin (PV), and no calbindin‐immunopositive neurons. The nNOS, CR, and PV immunopositive WMICs, possibly all inhibitory neurons, represent approximately 22.6% of the total WMIC population. As the white matter is affected in many cognitive conditions, such as schizophrenia, autism, epilepsy, and also in neurodegenerative diseases, understanding these neurons across species is important for the translation of findings of neural dysfunction in animal models to humans. Furthermore, studies of WMICs in species such as apes provide a crucial phylogenetic context for understanding the evolution of these cell types in the human brain.</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: The Molecular Basis of Depression: Implications of Sex-Related Differences in Epigenetic Regulation</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2021.708004</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a leading cause of disability worldwide. Although the etiology and pathophysiology of MDD remain poorly understood, aberrant neuroplasticity mediated by the epigenetic dysregulation of gene expression within the brain, which may occur due to genetic and environmental factors, may increase the risk of this disorder. Evidence has also been reported for sex-related differences in the pathophysiology of MDD, with female patients showing a greater severity of symptoms, higher degree of functional impairment, and more atypical depressive symptoms. Males and females also differ in their responsiveness to antidepressants. These clinical findings suggest that sex-dependent molecular and neural mechanisms may underlie the development of depression and the actions of antidepressant medications. This review discusses recent advances regarding the role of epigenetics in stress and depression. The first section presents a brief introduction of the basic mechanisms of epigenetic regulation, including histone modifications, DNA methylation, and non-coding RNAs. The second section reviews their contributions to neural plasticity, the risk of depression, and resilience against depression, with a particular focus on epigenetic modulators that have causal relationships with stress and depression in both clinical and animal studies. The third section highlights studies exploring sex-dependent epigenetic alterations associated with susceptibility to stress and depression. Finally, we discuss future directions to understand the etiology and pathophysiology of MDD, which would contribute to optimized and personalized therapy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Structures of Pathological and Functional Amyloids and Prions, a Solid-State NMR Perspective</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2021.670513</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Infectious proteins or prions are a remarkable class of pathogens, where pathogenicity and infectious state correspond to conformational transition of a protein fold. The conformational change translates into the formation by the protein of insoluble amyloid aggregates, associated in humans with various neurodegenerative disorders and systemic protein-deposition diseases. The prion principle, however, is not limited to pathogenicity. While pathological amyloids (and prions) emerge from protein misfolding, a class of functional amyloids has been defined, consisting of amyloid-forming domains under natural selection and with diverse biological roles. Although of great importance, prion amyloid structures remain challenging for conventional structural biology techniques. Solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (SSNMR) has been preferentially used to investigate these insoluble, morphologically heterogeneous aggregates with poor crystallinity. SSNMR methods have yielded a wealth of knowledge regarding the fundamentals of prion biology and have helped to solve the structures of several prion and prion-like fibrils. Here, we will review pathological and functional amyloid structures and will discuss some of the obtained structural models. We will finish the review with a perspective on integrative approaches combining solid-state NMR, electron paramagnetic resonance and cryo-electron microscopy, which can complement and extend our toolkit to structurally explore various facets of prion biology.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2021.665800</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Anxiety disorders are the most frequently diagnosed psychological condition, associated with serious comorbidities including excessive fear and interference with daily life. Drugs for anxiety disorders are typically prescribed but the side effects include weight gain, nausea, and sleepiness. Exercise is an effective treatment for anxiety. Exercise induces the release of extracellular vesicles (EVs) into the circulation, which transmit signals between organs. However, the effects of exercise-induced EVs on anxiety remain poorly understood. Here, we isolated EVs from the sera of mice that were sedentary or that voluntarily exercised. We characterized the changes in the miRNA profile of serum EVs after 4 weeks of voluntary exercise. miRNA sequencing showed that 82 miRNAs (46 of which were positive and 36 negative regulators) changed after exercise. We selected genes affected by at least two miRNAs. Of these, 27.27% were associated with neurotrophin signaling (9.09% with each of central nervous system neuronal development, cerebral cortical cell migration, and peripheral neuronal development). We also analyzed behavioral changes in mice with 3 weeks of restraint stress-induced anxiety after injection of 20 μg amounts of EVs from exercised or sedentary mice into the left cerebral ventricle. We found that exercise-derived EVs reduced anxiety (compared to a control group) in a nest-building test but found no between-group differences in the rotarod or open field tests. Exercise-derived EVs enhanced the expression of neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction genes. Thus, exercise-derived EVs may exhibit anti-anxiety effects and may be of therapeutic utility.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: LPC-DHA/EPA-Enriched Diets Increase Brain DHA and Modulate Behavior in Mice That Express Human APOE4</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.690410</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Compared with APOE3, APOE4 is associated with greater age-related cognitive decline and higher risk of neurodegenerative disorders. Therefore, development of supplements that target APOE genotype-modulated processes could provide a great benefit for the aging population. Evidence suggests a link between APOE genotype and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA); however, clinical studies with current DHA supplements have produced negative results in dementia. The lack of beneficial effects with current DHA supplements may be related to limited bioavailability, as the optimal form of DHA for brain uptake is lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC)-DHA. We previously developed a method to enrich the LPC-DHA content of krill oil through lipase treatment (LT-krill oil), which resulted in fivefold higher enrichment in brain DHA levels in wild-type mice compared with untreated krill oil. Here, we evaluated the effect of a control diet, diet containing krill oil, or a diet containing LT-krill oil in APOE3- and APOE4-targeted replacement mice (APOE-TR mice; treated from 4 to 12 months of age). We found that DHA levels in the plasma and hippocampus are lower in APOE4-TR mice and that LT-krill oil increased DHA levels in the plasma and hippocampus of both APOE3- and APOE4-TR mice. In APOE4-TR mice, LT-krill oil treatment resulted in higher levels of the synaptic vesicle protein SV2A and improved performance on the novel object recognition test. In conclusion, our data demonstrate that LPC-DHA/EPA-enriched krill oil can increase brain DHA and improve memory-relevant behavior in mice that express APOE4. Therefore, long-term use of LT-krill oil supplements may on some level protect against age-related neurodegeneration.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: A Meta-Analysis of the Effect of Subthalamic Nucleus-Deep Brain Stimulation in Parkinson's Disease-Related Pain</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.688818</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Pain from Parkinson's disease (PD) is a non-motor symptom affecting the quality of life and has prevalence of 20–80%. However, it is unclear whether subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation (STN–DBS), a well-established treatment for PD, is effective forPD-related pain. Thus, the objective of this meta-analysis was to investigate the efficacy of STN-DBS on PD-related pain and explore how its duration affects the efficacy of STN-DBS. A systematic search was performed using PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library. Nine studies included numerical rating scale (NRS), visual analog scale (VAS), or non-motor symptom scale (NMSS) scores at baseline and at the last follow-up visit and therefore met the inclusion criteria of the authors. These studies exhibited moderate- to high-quality evidence. Two reviewers conducted assessments for study eligibility, risk of bias, data extraction, and quality of evidence rating. Random effect meta-analysis revealed a significant change in PD-related pain as assessed by NMSS, NRS, and VAS (P &amp;lt;0.01). Analysis of the short and long follow-up subgroups indicated delayed improvement in PD-related pain. These findings (a) show the efficacy of STN-DBS on PD-related pain and provide higher-level evidence, and (b) implicate delayed improvement in PD-related pain, which may help programming doctors with supplement selecting target and programming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Systematic Review Registration: This study is registered in Open Science Framework (DOI: 10.17605/OSF.IO/DNM6K).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Connectivity Measures Differentiate Cortical and Subcortical Sub-Acute Ischemic Stroke Patients</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.669915</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Brain lesions caused by cerebral ischemia lead to network disturbances in both hemispheres, causing a subsequent reorganization of functional connectivity both locally and remotely with respect to the injury. Quantitative electroencephalography (qEEG) methods have long been used for exploring brain electrical activity and functional connectivity modifications after stroke. However, results obtained so far are not univocal. Here, we used basic and advanced EEG methods to characterize how brain activity and functional connectivity change after stroke. Thirty-three unilateral post stroke patients in the sub-acute phase and ten neurologically intact age-matched right-handed subjects were enrolled. Patients were subdivided into two groups based on lesion location: cortico-subcortical (CS, n = 18) and subcortical (S, n = 15), respectively. Stroke patients were evaluated in the period ranging from 45 days since the acute event (T0) up to 3 months after stroke (T1) with both neurophysiological (resting state EEG) and clinical assessment (Barthel Index, BI) measures, while healthy subjects were evaluated once. Brain power at T0 was similar between the two groups of patients in all frequency bands considered (δ, θ, α, and β). However, evolution of θ-band power over time was different, with a normalization only in the CS group. Instead, average connectivity and specific network measures (Integration, Segregation, and Small-worldness) in the β-band at T0 were significantly different between the two groups. The connectivity and network measures at T0 also appear to have a predictive role in functional recovery (BI T1-T0), again group-dependent. The results obtained in this study showed that connectivity measures and correlations between EEG features and recovery depend on lesion location. These data, if confirmed in further studies, on the one hand could explain the heterogeneity of results so far observed in previous studies, on the other hand they could be used by researchers as biomarkers predicting spontaneous recovery, to select homogenous groups of patients for the inclusion in clinical trials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.663463</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The Trail Making Test (TMT) is widely used to probe brain function and is performed with pen and paper, involving Parts A (linking numbers) and B (alternating between linking numbers and letters). The relationship between TMT performance and the underlying brain activity remains to be characterized in detail. Accordingly, sixteen healthy young adults performed the TMT using a touch-sensitive tablet to capture enhanced performance metrics, such as the speed of linking movements, during simultaneous electroencephalography (EEG). Linking and non-linking periods were derived as estimates of the time spent executing and preparing movements, respectively. The seconds per link (SPL) was also used to quantify TMT performance. A strong effect of TMT Part A and B was observed on the SPL value as expected (Part B showing increased SPL value); whereas the EEG results indicated robust effects of linking and non-linking periods in multiple frequency bands, and effects consistent with the underlying cognitive demands of the test.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neural Circuits: The Drosophila Larval Locomotor Circuit Provides a Model to Understand Neural Circuit Development and Function</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncir.2021.684969</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;It is difficult to answer important questions in neuroscience, such as: “how do neural circuits generate behaviour?,” because research is limited by the complexity and inaccessibility of the mammalian nervous system. Invertebrate model organisms offer simpler networks that are easier to manipulate. As a result, much of what we know about the development of neural circuits is derived from work in crustaceans, nematode worms and arguably most of all, the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster. This review aims to demonstrate the utility of the Drosophila larval locomotor network as a model circuit, to those who do not usually use the fly in their work. This utility is explored first by discussion of the relatively complete connectome associated with one identified interneuron of the locomotor circuit, A27h, and relating it to similar circuits in mammals. Next, it is developed by examining its application to study two important areas of neuroscience research: critical periods of development and interindividual variability in neural circuits. In summary, this article highlights the potential to use the larval locomotor network as a “generic” model circuit, to provide insight into mammalian circuit development and function.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Living on the Edge of the CNS: Meninges Cell Diversity in Health and Disease</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.703944</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The meninges are the fibrous covering of the central nervous system (CNS) which contain vastly heterogeneous cell types within its three layers (dura, arachnoid, and pia). The dural compartment of the meninges, closest to the skull, is predominantly composed of fibroblasts, but also includes fenestrated blood vasculature, an elaborate lymphatic system, as well as immune cells which are distinct from the CNS. Segregating the outer and inner meningeal compartments is the epithelial-like arachnoid barrier cells, connected by tight and adherens junctions, which regulate the movement of pathogens, molecules, and cells into and out of the cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) and brain parenchyma. Most proximate to the brain is the collagen and basement membrane-rich pia matter that abuts the glial limitans and has recently be shown to have regional heterogeneity within the developing mouse brain. While the meninges were historically seen as a purely structural support for the CNS and protection from trauma, the emerging view of the meninges is as an essential interface between the CNS and the periphery, critical to brain development, required for brain homeostasis, and involved in a variety of diseases. In this review, we will summarize what is known regarding the development, specification, and maturation of the meninges during homeostatic conditions and discuss the rapidly emerging evidence that specific meningeal cell compartments play differential and important roles in the pathophysiology of a myriad of diseases including: multiple sclerosis, dementia, stroke, viral/bacterial meningitis, traumatic brain injury, and cancer. We will conclude with a list of major questions and mechanisms that remain unknown, the study of which represent new, future directions for the field of meninges biology.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: BK Channel-Mediated Microglial Phagocytosis Alleviates Neurological Deficit After Ischemic Stroke</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.683769</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Microglial phagocytosis benefits neurological recovery after stroke. Large-conductance Ca2&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-activated K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; currents are expressed in activated microglia, and BK channel knockout aggravates cerebral ischemic injury. However, the effect of BK channels on microglial phagocytosis after ischemic stroke remains unknown. Here, we explored whether BK channel activation is beneficial for neurological outcomes through microglial phagocytosis after ischemic stroke. ICR mice after transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO) were treated with dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), BK channel activator NS19504, and inhibitor Paxilline. The results showed a decrease in BK channel expression after tMCAO. BK channel activator NS19504 alleviates neurological deficit after experimental modeling of tMCAO in mice compared to the control. Furthermore, we treated primary microglia with DMSO, NS19504, and Paxilline after oxygen glucose deprivation (OGD). NS19504 promoted primary microglial phagocytosing fluorescent beads and neuronal debris, which reduced neuronal apoptosis after stroke. These effects could be reversed by BK channel inhibitor Paxilline. Finally, NS19504 increased relative phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 expression compared to the Paxilline group at the third day after stroke. Our findings indicate that microglial BK channels are a potential target for acute stage of ischemic stroke therapy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Identifying Mild Cognitive Impairment in Parkinson’s Disease With Electroencephalogram Functional Connectivity</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.701499</link>
	<content:encoded>Objective&lt;p&gt;Cognitive impairment occurs frequently in Parkinson’s disease (PD) and negatively impacts the patient’s quality of life. However, its pathophysiological mechanism remains unclear, hindering the development of new therapies. Changes in brain connectivity are related to cognitive impairment in patients with PD, with the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) being considered the essential region related to PD cognitive impairment. Nevertheless, few studies have focused on the global connectivity responsible for communication with the DLPFC node, the posterior division of the middle frontal gyrus (PMFG) in patients with PD; this was the focus of this study.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;We applied resting-state electroencephalography (EEG) and calculated a reliable functional connectivity measurement, the debiased weighted phase lag index (dWPLI), to examine inter-regional functional connectivity in 68 patients with PD who were classified into two groups according to their cognitive condition.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;We observed that altered left and right PMFG-based functional connectivity associated with cognitive impairment in patients with PD in the theta frequency bands under the eyes closed condition (r = −0.426, p &amp;lt; 0.001 and r = −0.437, p &amp;lt; 0.001, respectively). Exploratory results based on the MoCA subdomains indicated that poorer visuospatial function was associated with higher right PMFG-based functional connectivity (r = −0.335, p = 0.005), and poorer attention function was associated with higher left and right PMFG-based functional connectivity (r = −0.380, p = 0.001 and r = −0.256, p = 0.035, respectively). Further analysis using logistic regression and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves found that this abnormal functional connectivity was an independent risk factor for cognitive impairment [odds ratio (OR): 2.949, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.294–6.725, p = 0.01 for left PMFG; OR: 11.278, 95% CI: 2.578–49.335, p = 0.001 for right PMFG, per 0.1 U], and provided moderate classification power to discriminate between cognitive abilities in patients with PD [area under the ROC curve (AUC) = 0.770 for left PMFG; AUC = 0.809 for right PMFG].&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;These preliminary findings indicate that abnormal PMFG-based functional connectivity patterns associated with cognitive impairment in the theta frequency bands under the eyes closed condition and altered functional connectivity patterns have the potential to act as reliable biomarkers for identifying cognitive impairment in patients with PD.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Mechanistic Analysis of Age-Related Clinical Manifestations in Down Syndrome</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.700280</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Down syndrome (DS) is the most common genetic cause of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) due to trisomy for all or part of human chromosome 21 (Hsa21). It is also associated with other phenotypes including distinctive facial features, cardiac defects, growth delay, intellectual disability, immune system abnormalities, and hearing loss. All adults with DS demonstrate AD-like brain pathology, including amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, by age 40 and dementia typically by age 60. There is compelling evidence that increased APP gene dose is necessary for AD in DS, and the mechanism for this effect has begun to emerge, implicating the C-terminal APP fragment of 99 amino acid (β-CTF). The products of other triplicated genes on Hsa21 might act to modify the impact of APP triplication by altering the overall rate of biological aging. Another important age-related DS phenotype is hearing loss, and while its mechanism is unknown, we describe its characteristics here. Moreover, immune system abnormalities in DS, involving interferon pathway genes and aging, predispose to diverse infections and might modify the severity of COVID-19. All these considerations suggest human trisomy 21 impacts several diseases in an age-dependent manner. Thus, understanding the possible aging-related mechanisms associated with these clinical manifestations of DS will facilitate therapeutic interventions in mid-to-late adulthood, while at the same time shedding light on basic mechanisms of aging.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: No Arachnoid Granulations—No Problems: Number, Size, and Distribution of Arachnoid Granulations From Birth to 80 Years of Age</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2021.698865</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Introduction: The study aims to quantify changes in the number, size, and distribution of arachnoid granulations during the human lifespan to elucidate their role in cerebrospinal fluid physiology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Material and Methods: 3T magnetic resonance imaging of the brain was performed in 120 subjects of different ages (neonate, 2 years, 10 years, 20 years, 40 years, 60 years, and 80 years) all with the normal findings of the cerebrospinal fluid system (CSF). At each age, 10 male and 10 female subjects were analyzed. Group scanned at neonatal age was re-scanned at the age of two, while all other groups were scanned once. Arachnoid granulations were analyzed on T2 coronal and axial sections. Each arachnoid granulation was described concerning size and position relative to the superior sagittal, transverse, and sigmoid sinuses and surrounding cranial bones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Our study shows that 85% of neonates and 2-year-old children do not have visible arachnoid granulations in the dural sinuses and cranial bones on magnetic resonance imaging. With age, the percentage of patients with arachnoid granulations in the superior sagittal sinus increases significantly, but there is no increase in the sigmoid and transverse sinuses. However, numerous individuals in different age groups do not have arachnoid granulations in dural sinuses. Arachnoid granulations in the cranial bones are found only around the superior sagittal sinus, for the first time at the age of 10, and over time their number increases significantly. From the age of 60 onwards, arachnoid granulations were more numerous in the cranial bones than in the dural sinuses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: The results show that the number, size, and distribution of arachnoid granulations in the superior sagittal sinus and surrounding cranial bones change significantly over a lifetime. However, numerous individuals with a completely normal CSF system do not have arachnoid granulations in the dural sinuses, which calls into question their role in CSF physiology. It can be assumed that arachnoid granulations do not play an essential role in CSF absorption as it is generally accepted. Therefore, the lack of arachnoid granulations does not appear to cause problems in intracranial fluid homeostasis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Additionally, the early-MCI patients displayed higher FC values than the HC and late-MCI patients in the right superior medial frontal gyrus, cerebellum crus 1, and left cerebellum crus 2 (Bonferroni-corrected p &amp;lt; 0.05).

The pig is commonly used as an experimental model of human heart disease, including for the study of mechanisms of arrhythmia. However, there exist differences between human and porcine cellular electrophysiology: The pig action potential (AP) has a deeper phase-1 notch, a longer duration at 50% repolarization, and higher plateau potentials than human. Ionic differences underlying the AP include larger rapid delayed-rectifier and smaller inward-rectifier K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-currents (I&lt;sub&gt;Kr&lt;/sub&gt; and I&lt;sub&gt;K1&lt;/sub&gt; respectively) in humans. AP steady-state rate-dependence and restitution is steeper in pigs. Porcine Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; transients can have two components, unlike human. Although a reliable computational model for human ventricular myocytes exists, one for pigs is lacking. This hampers translation from results obtained in pigs to human myocardium. Here, we developed a computational model of the pig ventricular cardiomyocyte AP using experimental datasets of the relevant ionic currents, Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-handling, AP shape, AP duration restitution, and inducibility of triggered activity and alternans. To properly capture porcine Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; transients, we introduced a two-step process with a faster release in the t-tubular region, followed by a slower diffusion-induced release from a non t-tubular subcellular region. The pig model behavior was compared with that of a human ventricular cardiomyocyte (O’Hara-Rudy) model. The pig, but not the human model, developed early afterdepolarizations (EADs) under block of I&lt;sub&gt;K1&lt;/sub&gt;, while I&lt;sub&gt;Kr&lt;/sub&gt; block led to EADs in the human but not in the pig model. At fast rates (pacing cycle length = 400 ms), the human cell model was more susceptible to spontaneous Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; release-mediated delayed afterdepolarizations (DADs) and triggered activity than pig. Fast pacing led to alternans in human but not pig. Developing species-specific models incorporating electrophysiology and Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+-&lt;/sup&gt;handling provides a tool to aid translating antiarrhythmic and arrhythmogenic assessment from the bench to the clinic.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/BVP46t33U0E&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Aberrant signaling through insulin (Ins) and insulin-like growth factor I (IGF1) receptors contribute to the risk and advancement of many cancer types by activating cell survival cascades. Similarities between these pathways have thus far prevented the development of pharmacological interventions that specifically target either Ins or IGF1 signaling. To identify differences in early Ins and IGF1 signaling mechanisms, we developed a dual receptor (IGF1R &amp;amp; InsR) computational response model. The model suggested that ribosomal protein S6 kinase (RPS6K) plays a critical role in regulating MAPK and Akt activation levels in response to Ins and IGF1 stimulation. As predicted, perturbing RPS6K kinase activity led to an increased Akt activation with Ins stimulation compared to IGF1 stimulation. Being able to discern differential downstream signaling, we can explore improved anti-IGF1R cancer therapies by eliminating the emergence of compensation mechanisms without disrupting InsR signaling.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/ZVEt7PIuwF8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Clustering high-dimensional data, such as images or biological measurements, is a long-standing problem and has been studied extensively. Recently, Deep Clustering has gained popularity due to its flexibility in fitting the specific peculiarities of complex data. Here we introduce the Mixture-of-Experts Similarity Variational Autoencoder (MoE-Sim-VAE), a novel generative clustering model. The model can learn multi-modal distributions of high-dimensional data and use these to generate realistic data with high efficacy and efficiency. MoE-Sim-VAE is based on a Variational Autoencoder (VAE), where the decoder consists of a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture. This specific architecture allows for various modes of the data to be automatically learned by means of the experts. Additionally, we encourage the lower dimensional latent representation of our model to follow a Gaussian mixture distribution and to accurately represent the similarities between the data points. We assess the performance of our model on the MNIST benchmark data set and challenging real-world tasks of clustering mouse organs from single-cell RNA-sequencing measurements and defining cell subpopulations from mass cytometry (CyTOF) measurements on hundreds of different datasets. MoE-Sim-VAE exhibits superior clustering performance on all these tasks in comparison to the baselines as well as competitor methods.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/kRd-T1PTHPM&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Paradoxical phase response of gamma rhythms facilitates their entrainment in heterogeneous networks</title>

The synchronization of different &lt;i&gt;γ&lt;/i&gt;-rhythms arising in different brain areas has been implicated in various cognitive functions. Here, we focus on the effect of the ubiquitous neuronal heterogeneity on the synchronization of ING (interneuronal network gamma) and PING (pyramidal-interneuronal network gamma) rhythms. The synchronization properties of rhythms depends on the response of their collective phase to external input. We therefore determine the macroscopic phase-response curve for finite-amplitude perturbations (fmPRC) of ING- and PING-rhythms in all-to-all coupled networks comprised of linear (IF) or quadratic (QIF) integrate-and-fire neurons. For the QIF networks we complement the direct simulations with the adjoint method to determine the infinitesimal macroscopic PRC (imPRC) within the exact mean-field theory. We show that the intrinsic neuronal heterogeneity can qualitatively modify the fmPRC and the imPRC. Both PRCs can be biphasic and change sign (type II), even though the phase-response curve for the individual neurons is strictly non-negative (type I). Thus, for ING rhythms, say, external inhibition to the inhibitory cells can, in fact, advance the collective oscillation of the network, even though the same inhibition would lead to a delay when applied to uncoupled neurons. This paradoxical advance arises when the external inhibition modifies the internal dynamics of the network by reducing the number of spikes of inhibitory neurons; the advance resulting from this disinhibition outweighs the immediate delay caused by the external inhibition. These results explain how intrinsic heterogeneity allows ING- and PING-rhythms to become synchronized with a periodic forcing or another rhythm for a wider range in the mismatch of their frequencies. Our results identify a potential function of neuronal heterogeneity in the synchronization of coupled &lt;i&gt;γ&lt;/i&gt;-rhythms, which may play a role in neural information transfer via communication through coherence.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/k7q9H5KmN4I&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Biology: Sleep drive reconfigures wake-promoting clock circuitry to regulate adaptive behavior</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~3/zS__JqbUlLg/article</link>

Circadian rhythms help animals synchronize motivated behaviors to match environmental demands. Recent evidence indicates that clock neurons influence the timing of behavior by differentially altering the activity of a distributed network of downstream neurons. Downstream circuits can be remodeled by Hebbian plasticity, synaptic scaling, and, under some circumstances, activity-dependent addition of cell surface receptors; the role of this receptor respecification phenomena is not well studied. We demonstrate that high sleep pressure quickly reprograms the wake-promoting large ventrolateral clock neurons to express the pigment dispersing factor receptor (PDFR). The addition of this signaling input into the circuit is associated with increased waking and early mating success. The respecification of PDFR in both young and adult large ventrolateral neurons requires 2 dopamine (DA) receptors and activation of the transcriptional regulator &lt;i&gt;nejire&lt;/i&gt; (cAMP response element-binding protein [CREB]). These data identify receptor respecification as an important mechanism to sculpt circuit function to match sleep levels with demand.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/zS__JqbUlLg&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Oxytocin/vasopressin-related neuropeptides are highly conserved and play major roles in regulating social behavior across vertebrates. However, whether their insect orthologue, inotocin, regulates the behavior of social groups remains unknown. Here, we show that in the clonal raider ant &lt;i&gt;Ooceraea biroi&lt;/i&gt;, individuals that perform tasks outside the nest have higher levels of inotocin in their brains than individuals of the same age that remain inside the nest. We also show that older ants, which spend more time outside the nest, have higher inotocin levels than younger ants. Inotocin thus correlates with the propensity to perform tasks outside the nest. Additionally, increasing inotocin pharmacologically increases the tendency of ants to leave the nest. However, this effect is contingent on age and social context. Pharmacologically treated older ants have a higher propensity to leave the nest only in the presence of larvae, whereas younger ants seem to do so only in the presence of pupae. Our results suggest that inotocin signaling plays an important role in modulating behaviors that correlate with age, such as social foraging, possibly by modulating behavioral response thresholds to specific social cues. Inotocin signaling thereby likely contributes to behavioral individuality and division of labor in ant societies.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/TEXK-Kti1r0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Hippocampus: Temporal dynamic of the hippocampal structural plasticity associated with the fear memory destabilization/reconsolidation process</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hipo.23374?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
Reconsolidation of a contextual fear memory is a protein synthesis‐dependent process in which a previously destabilized memory returns to a stable state. This process has become the subject of many studies due to its importance in memory processing, maintenance and updating, and its potential role as a therapeutical target in fear memory disorders such as phobias and post‐traumatic stress disorder. In this sense, understanding the underlying mechanisms of memory reconsolidation is paramount in developing potential treatments for such memory dysfunctions. In the present work, we studied the interaction between two key neural structures involved in the reconsolidation process: the basolateral amygdala complex of the amygdala (BLA) and the dorsal hippocampus (DH). Our results show changes in the structural plasticity of the CA1 region of the DH in the form of dendritic spines density changes associated with the destabilization/reconsolidation process. Furthermore, we demonstrate a modulatory role of BLA over such structural plasticity by infusing different drugs such as ifenprodil, a destabilization blocker, and propranolol, a reconsolidation disruptor, in this brain structure. Altogether our work shows a particular temporal dynamic in the CA1 region of DH that accompanies the destabilization/reconsolidation process and aims to provide new information on the underlying mechanisms of this process that potentially contributes for a better understanding of memory storage, maintenance, expression and updating, and its potential medical applications.</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Inhibition of AKT Signaling Alters βIV Spectrin Distribution at the AIS and Increases Neuronal Excitability</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2021.643860</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The axon initial segment (AIS) is a highly regulated subcellular domain required for neuronal firing. Changes in the AIS protein composition and distribution are a form of structural plasticity, which powerfully regulates neuronal activity and may underlie several neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders. Despite its physiological and pathophysiological relevance, the signaling pathways mediating AIS protein distribution are still poorly studied. Here, we used confocal imaging and whole-cell patch clamp electrophysiology in primary hippocampal neurons to study how AIS protein composition and neuronal firing varied in response to selected kinase inhibitors targeting the AKT/GSK3 pathway, which has previously been shown to phosphorylate AIS proteins. Image-based features representing the cellular pattern distribution of the voltage-gated Na+ (Nav) channel, ankyrin G, βIV spectrin, and the cell-adhesion molecule neurofascin were analyzed, revealing βIV spectrin as the most sensitive AIS protein to AKT/GSK3 pathway inhibition. Within this pathway, inhibition of AKT by triciribine has the greatest effect on βIV spectrin localization to the AIS and its subcellular distribution within neurons, a phenotype that Support Vector Machine classification was able to accurately distinguish from control. Treatment with triciribine also resulted in increased excitability in primary hippocampal neurons. Thus, perturbations to signaling mechanisms within the AKT pathway contribute to changes in βIV spectrin distribution and neuronal firing that may be associated with neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Integrative Neuroscience: Behavioral and Thermoregulatory Responses to Changes in Ambient Temperature and Wheel Running Availability in Octodon degus</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnint.2021.684988</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Octodon degus is primarily a diurnal species, however, in laboratory conditions, it can switch from diurnal to nocturnal in response to wheel running availability. It has been proposed that this activity inversion obeys thermoregulatory constraints induced by vigorous physical exercise. Thus, its activity shifts to the night as the ambient temperature is lower.Here, we investigate the relationship between thermoregulation and the activity phase-inversion in response to wheel-running in this species. We measured behavioral activity and body temperature rhythms in diurnal naïve animals under 12 h light: 12 h dark cycles at four different ambient temperatures (spanning from ~26°C to 32°C), and following access to running wheels while maintained under high ambient temperature.Our results show that naïve degus do not shift their diurnal activity and body temperature rhythms to a nocturnal phase when subjected to sequential increases in ambient temperature. However, when they were provided with wheels under constant high-temperature conditions, all animals inverted their diurnal phase preference becoming nocturnal. Both, negative masking by light and entrainment to the dark phase appeared involved in the nocturnalism of these animals. Analysis of the thermoregulatory response to wheel running revealed some differences between masked and entrained nocturnal chronotypes.These data highlight the importance of the coupling between wheel running availability and ambient temperature in the nocturnalism of the degus. The results support the view that an innate “protective” pre-program mechanism (associating darkness and lower ambient temperature) may change the timing of behavioral activity in this species to reduce the potential risk of hyperthermia.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.691222</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s disease is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by disrupted memory, learning functions, reduced life expectancy, and locomotor dysfunction, as a result of the accumulation and aggregation of amyloid peptides that cause neuronal damage in neuronal circuits. In the current study, we exploited a transgenic Drosophila melanogaster line, expressing amyloid-β peptides to investigate the efficacy of a newly synthesized acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, named XJP-1, as a potential AD therapy. Behavioral assays and confocal microscopy were used to characterize the drug effect on AD symptomatology and amyloid peptide deposition. The symptomatology induced in this particular transgenic model recapitulates the scenario observed in human AD patients, showing a shortened lifespan and reduced locomotor functions, along with a significant accumulation of amyloid plaques in the brain. XJP-1 treatment resulted in a significant improvement of AD symptoms and a reduction of amyloid plaques by diminishing the amyloid aggregation rate. In comparison with clinically effective AD drugs, our results demonstrated that XJP-1 has similar effects on AD symptomatology, but at 10 times lower drug concentration than donepezil. It also showed an earlier beneficial effect on the reduction of amyloid plaques at 10 days after drug treatment, as observed for donepezil at 20 days, while the other drugs tested have no such effect. As a novel and potent AChE inhibitor, our study demonstrates that inhibition of the enzyme AChE by XJP-1 treatment improves the amyloid-induced symptomatology in Drosophila, by reducing the number of amyloid plaques within the fruit fly CNS. Thus, compound XJP-1 has the therapeutic potential to be further investigated for the treatment of AD.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Monitoring and Prognostic Analysis of Severe Cerebrovascular Diseases Based on Multi-Scale Dynamic Brain Imaging</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.684469</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Severe cerebrovascular disease is an acute cerebrovascular event that causes severe neurological damage in patients, and is often accompanied by severe dysfunction of multiple systems such as breathing and circulation. Patients with severe cerebrovascular disease are in critical condition, have many complications, and are prone to deterioration of neurological function. Therefore, they need closer monitoring and treatment. The treatment strategy in the acute phase directly determines the prognosis of the patient. The case of this article selected 90 patients with severe cerebrovascular disease who were hospitalized in four wards of the Department of Neurology and the Department of Critical Care Medicine in a university hospital. The included cases were in accordance with the guidelines for the prevention and treatment of cerebrovascular diseases. Patients with cerebral infarction are given routine treatments such as improving cerebral circulation, protecting nutrient brain cells, dehydration, and anti-platelet; patients with cerebral hemorrhage are treated within the corresponding safe time window. We use Statistical Product and Service Solutions (SPSS) Statistics21 software to perform statistical analysis on the results. Based on the study of the feature extraction process of convolutional neural network, according to the hierarchical principle of convolutional neural network, a backbone neural network MF (Multi-Features)—Dense Net that can realize the fusion, and extraction of multi-scale features is designed. The network combines the characteristics of densely connected network and feature pyramid network structure, and combines strong feature extraction ability, high robustness and relatively small parameter amount. An end-to-end monitoring algorithm for severe cerebrovascular diseases based on MF-Dense Net is proposed. In the experiment, the algorithm showed high monitoring accuracy, and at the same time reached the speed of real-time monitoring on the experimental platform. An improved spatial pyramid pooling structure is designed to strengthen the network’s ability to merge and extract local features at the same level and at multiple scales, which can further improve the accuracy of algorithm monitoring by paying a small amount of additional computational cost. At the same time, a method is designed to strengthen the use of low-level features by improving the network structure, which improves the algorithm’s monitoring performance on small-scale severe cerebrovascular diseases. For patients with severe cerebrovascular disease in general, APACHEII1, APACHEII2, APACHEII3 and the trend of APACHEII score change are divided into high-risk group and low-risk group. The overall severe cerebrovascular disease, severe cerebral hemorrhage and severe cerebral infarction are analyzed, respectively. The differences are statistically significant.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neural Technology: Multiscale Computational Model Reveals Nerve Response in a Mouse Model for Temporal Interference Brain Stimulation</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.684465</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;There has been a growing interest in the non-invasive stimulation of specific brain tissues, while reducing unintended stimulation in surrounding regions, for the medical treatment of brain disorders. Traditional methods for non-invasive brain stimulation, such as transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) or transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), can stimulate brain regions, but they also simultaneously stimulate the brain and non-brain regions that lie between the target and the stimulation site of the source. Temporal interference (TI) stimulation has been suggested to selectively stimulate brain regions by superposing two alternating currents with slightly different frequencies injected through electrodes attached to the scalp. Previous studies have reported promising results for TI applied to the motor area in mice, but the mechanisms are yet to be clarified. As computational techniques can help reveal different aspects of TI, in this study, we computationally investigated TI stimulation using a multiscale model that computes the generated interference current pattern effects in a neural cortical model of a mouse head. The results indicated that the threshold increased with the carrier frequency and that the beat frequency did not influence the threshold. It was also found that the intensity ratio between the alternating currents changed the location of the responding nerve, which is in agreement with previous experiments. Moreover, particular characteristics of the envelope were investigated to predict the stimulation region intuitively. It was found that regions with high modulation depth (| maximum| − | minimum| values of the envelope) and low minimum envelope (near zero) corresponded with the activation region obtained via neural computation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Randomized Cross Over Study Assessing the Efficacy of Non-invasive Stimulation of the Vagus Nerve in Patients With Axial Spondyloarthritis Resistant to Biotherapies: The ESNV-SPA Study Protocol</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.679775</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Axial spondyloarthritis (SpA), is a major cause of chronic pain and disability that profoundly alters the quality of life of patients. Nearly half of patients with SpA usually develop drug resistance. Non-pharmacological treatments targeting inflammation are an attractive alternative to drug administration. Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS), by promoting a cholinergic anti-inflammatory reflex holds promise for treating inflammatory disease. Inflammatory reflex signaling, which is enhanced by electrically stimulating the vagus nerve, significantly reduces cytokine production and attenuates disease severity in animal models of endotoxemia, sepsis, colitis, and other preclinical models of inflammatory diseases. It has been proposed that vagal efferent fibers release acetylcholine (Ach), which can interact with α7-subunit-containing nicotinic receptors expressed by tissue macrophages and other immune cells to rapidly inhibit the synthesis/release of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNFα, IL-1β, IL-6, and IL-18. External vagal nerve stimulation devices are now available that do not require surgery nor implantation to non-invasively stimulate the vagal nerve. This double-blind randomized cross-over clinical trial aims to study the change in SpA disease activity, according to Assessment in Ankylosing Spondylitis 20 (ASAS20) definition, after 12 weeks of non-invasive VNS treatment vs. non-specific dummy stimulation (control group). One hundred and twenty adult patients with drug resistant SpA, meeting the ASAS classification criteria, will be included in the study. Patients will be randomized into two parallel groups according to a cross over design: either active VNS for 12 weeks, then dummy stimulation for 12 weeks, or dummy stimulation for 12 weeks, then active VNS for 12 weeks. The two stimulation periods will be separated by a 4 weeks wash-out period. A transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulator Tens Eco Plus SCHWA MEDICO&lt;sup&gt;TM&lt;/sup&gt; France will be used in this study. The active VNS stimulation will be applied in the cymba conchae of the left ear upon the auricular branch of the vagus nerve, using low intensity (2–5 mA), once à week, during 1 h. Dummy stimulation will be performed under the same conditions and parameters as active VNS stimulation, but at an irrelevant anatomical site: the left ear lobule. This multicenter study was registered on ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT04286373.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Both neural activities and psychological processes vary over time. Individuals with interdependent self-construal tend to define themselves and adjust their behaviors to social contexts and others. The current research tested the hypothesis that the coordination between interdependent self-construal and neural variability could predict life satisfaction changes in university freshmen. We integrated resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging scanning and self-construal assessment to estimate self-dependent neural variability (SDNV). In the whole-brain prediction, SDNV successfully predicted individuals’ life satisfaction changes over 2 years. Interdependent individuals with higher neural variability and independent individuals with lower neural variability became more satisfied with their lives. In the network-based prediction, the predictive effects were significant in the default mode, frontoparietal control, visual and salience networks. The important nodes that contributed to the predictive models were more related to psychological constructs associated with the social and self-oriented functions. The current research sheds light on the neural and psychological mechanisms of the subjective well-being of individuals from a dynamic perspective.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.664039</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The present study aimed to explore the cortical activity underlying mental rotation in high-altitude immigrants via the event-related desynchronization (ERD), the electroencephalogram time–frequency analysis, and source localization based on electroencephalographic data. When compared with the low-altitude individuals, the reaction time of mental rotation tasks was significantly slower in immigrants who had lived in high-altitude areas for 3 years. The time–frequency analysis showed that the alpha ERD and the beta ERD within the time window (400–700 ms) were decreased during the mental rotation tasks in these immigrants. The decreased ERD was observed at the parietal–occipital regions within the alpha band and at the central–parietal regions within the beta band. The decreased ERD might embody the sensorimotor-related cortical activity from hypoxia, which might be involved in cognitive control function in high-altitude immigrants, which provided insights into the neural mechanism of spatial cognition change on aspect of embodied cognition due to high-altitude exposure.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Imagining How Lines Were Drawn: The Appreciation of Calligraphy and the Facilitative Factor Based on the Viewer’s Rating and Heart Rate</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.654610</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;For this study, we examined how recognizing the writing process of calligraphy influences the cognitive and affective processes related to appreciating it, with the aim of contributing to both graphonomics and the psychology of aesthetics. To this end, we conducted two Web-based experiments in which some participants were instructed to view calligraphy by tracing it with their eyes (the tracing method), while others were told to feel free to think and imagine whatever they wanted. Study 1 (N = 103) revealed that the tracing method elicits stronger admiration, inspiration, and empathy in viewers. Study 2 (N = 87) showed that the tracing method decreases the average heart rate of those who do not frequently engage in calligraphy appreciation as they gaze at calligraphy for a minute-and-a-half (during the second half of the stimulus duration); this suggests that the tracing method could keep viewers from becoming bored while looking at calligraphy. In sum, the tracing method has positive effects on viewing calligraphy. From a broader perspective, the results imply that how in detail viewers recognize the process of creating an artwork will be a key determinant of art appreciation. In addition, our findings demonstrate how we can measure cardiac activities using the emerging technology of the photoplethysmogram (PPG).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neural Circuits: Widely Different Correlation Patterns Between Pairs of Adjacent Thalamic Neurons In vivo</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncir.2021.692923</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;We have previously reported different spike firing correlation patterns among pairs of adjacent pyramidal neurons within the same layer of S1 cortex in vivo, which was argued to suggest that acquired synaptic weight modifications would tend to differentiate adjacent cortical neurons despite them having access to near-identical afferent inputs. Here we made simultaneous single-electrode loose patch-clamp recordings from 14 pairs of adjacent neurons in the lateral thalamus of the ketamine-xylazine anesthetized rat in vivo to study the correlation patterns in their spike firing. As the synapses on thalamic neurons are dominated by a high number of low weight cortical inputs, which would be expected to be shared for two adjacent neurons, and as far as thalamic neurons have homogenous membrane physiology and spike generation, they would be expected to have overall similar spike firing and therefore also correlation patterns. However, we find that across a variety of thalamic nuclei the correlation patterns between pairs of adjacent thalamic neurons vary widely. The findings suggest that the connectivity and cellular physiology of the thalamocortical circuitry, in contrast to what would be expected from a straightforward interpretation of corticothalamic maps and uniform intrinsic cellular neurophysiology, has been shaped by learning to the extent that each pair of thalamic neuron has a unique relationship in their spike firing activity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neural Circuits: Revisiting Persistent Neuronal Activity During Covert Spatial Attention</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncir.2021.679796</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Persistent activity has been observed in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), in particular during the delay periods of visual attention tasks. Classical approaches based on the average activity over multiple trials have revealed that such an activity encodes the information about the attentional instruction provided in such tasks. However, single-trial approaches have shown that activity in this area is rather sparse than persistent and highly heterogeneous not only within the trials but also between the different trials. Thus, this observation raised the question of how persistent the actually persistent attention-related prefrontal activity is and how it contributes to spatial attention. In this paper, we review recent evidence of precisely deconstructing the persistence of the neural activity in the PFC in the context of attention orienting. The inclusion of machine-learning methods for decoding the information reveals that attention orienting is a highly dynamic process, possessing intrinsic oscillatory dynamics working at multiple timescales spanning from milliseconds to minutes. Dimensionality reduction methods further show that this persistent activity dynamically incorporates multiple sources of information. This novel framework reflects a high complexity in the neural representation of the attention-related information in the PFC, and how its computational organization predicts behavior.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.696540</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The neurovascular unit (NVU) of the brain is composed of multiple cell types that act synergistically to modify blood flow to locally match the energy demand of neural activity, as well as to maintain the integrity of the blood-brain barrier (BBB). It is becoming increasingly recognized that the functional specialization, as well as the cellular composition of the NVU varies spatially. This heterogeneity is encountered as variations in vascular and perivascular cells along the arteriole-capillary-venule axis, as well as through differences in NVU composition throughout anatomical regions of the brain. Given the wide variations in metabolic demands between brain regions, especially those of gray vs. white matter, the spatial heterogeneity of the NVU is critical to brain function. Here we review recent evidence demonstrating regional specialization of the NVU between brain regions, by focusing on the heterogeneity of its individual cellular components and briefly discussing novel approaches to investigate NVU diversity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: HDAC4 Knockdown Alleviates Denervation-Induced Muscle Atrophy by Inhibiting Myogenin-Dependent Atrogene Activation</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.663384</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Denervation can activate the catabolic pathway in skeletal muscle and lead to progressive skeletal muscle atrophy. At present, there is no effective treatment for muscle atrophy. Histone deacetylase 4 (HDAC4) has recently been found to be closely related to muscle atrophy, but the underlying mechanism of HDAC4 in denervation-induced muscle atrophy have not been described clearly yet. In this study, we found that the expression of HDAC4 increased significantly in denervated skeletal muscle. HDAC4 inhibition can effectively diminish denervation-induced muscle atrophy, reduce the expression of muscle specific E3 ubiquitin ligase (MuRF1 and MAFbx) and autophagy related proteins (Atg7, LC3B, PINK1 and BNIP3), inhibit the transformation of type I fibers to type II fibers, and enhance the expression of SIRT1 and PGC-1 α. Transcriptome sequencing and bioinformatics analysis was performed and suggested that HDAC4 may be involved in denervation-induced muscle atrophy by regulating the response to denervation involved in the regulation of muscle adaptation, cell division, cell cycle, apoptotic process, skeletal muscle atrophy, and cell differentiation. STRING analysis showed that HDAC4 may be involved in the process of muscle atrophy by directly regulating myogenin (MYOG), cell cycle inhibitor p21 (CDKN1A) and salt induced kinase 1 (SIK1). MYOG was significantly increased in denervated skeletal muscle, and MYOG inhibition could significantly alleviate denervation-induced muscle atrophy, accompanied by the decreased MuRF1 and MAFbx. MYOG overexpression could reduce the protective effect of HDAC4 inhibition on denervation-induced muscle atrophy, as evidenced by the decreased muscle mass and cross-sectional area of muscle fibers, and the increased mitophagy. Taken together, HDAC4 inhibition can alleviate denervation-induced muscle atrophy by reducing MYOG expression, and HDAC4 is also directly related to CDKN1A and SIK1 in skeletal muscle, which suggests that HDAC4 inhibitors may be a potential drug for the treatment of neurogenic muscle atrophy. These results not only enrich the molecular regulation mechanism of denervation-induced muscle atrophy, but also provide the experimental basis for HDAC4-MYOG axis as a new target for the prevention and treatment of muscular atrophy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience Research: Remember as we empathize. Do brain mechanisms engaged in autobiographical memory retrieval causally affect empathy awareness? A combined TMS and EEG registered report</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jnr.24906?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
Social interactions are partly driven by our ability to empathize—the capacity to share and understand others’ inner states. While a growing body of evidence suggests a link between past experiences and empathy, to what degree empathy is dependent on our own previous experiences (autobiographical memories, AMs) is still unclear. Whereas neuroimaging studies have shown wide overlapping brain networks underpinning AM and empathic processes, studies on clinical populations with memory loss have not always shown empathy is impaired. The current transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and electroencephalography study will seek to shed light on this neuropsychological puzzle by testing whether self‐perceived empathy is causally linked to AM retrieval. Cortical activity, together with self‐rating of empathy, will be recorded for scenarios that echo personal experiences while a brain region critical for AM retrieval will be transiently inhibited using TMS before task performance.</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Biology: FisB relies on homo-oligomerization and lipid binding to catalyze membrane fission in bacteria</title>

Little is known about mechanisms of membrane fission in bacteria despite their requirement for cytokinesis. The only known dedicated membrane fission machinery in bacteria, fission protein B (FisB), is expressed during sporulation in &lt;i&gt;Bacillus subtilis&lt;/i&gt; and is required to release the developing spore into the mother cell cytoplasm. Here, we characterized the requirements for FisB-mediated membrane fission. FisB forms mobile clusters of approximately 12 molecules that give way to an immobile cluster at the engulfment pole containing approximately 40 proteins at the time of membrane fission. Analysis of FisB mutants revealed that binding to acidic lipids and homo-oligomerization are both critical for targeting FisB to the engulfment pole and membrane fission. Experiments using artificial membranes and filamentous cells suggest that FisB does not have an intrinsic ability to sense or induce membrane curvature but can bridge membranes. Finally, modeling suggests that homo-oligomerization and &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;-interactions with membranes are sufficient to explain FisB accumulation at the membrane neck that connects the engulfment membrane to the rest of the mother cell membrane during late stages of engulfment. Together, our results show that FisB is a robust and unusual membrane fission protein that relies on homo-oligomerization, lipid binding, and the unique membrane topology generated during engulfment for localization and membrane scission, but surprisingly, not on lipid microdomains, negative-curvature lipids, or curvature sensing.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/vSwKiN4nIyM&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Pathogenic MAST3 variants in the STK domain are associated with epilepsy</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.26147?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Objective
The MAST family of microtubule‐associated serine–threonine kinases (STK) have distinct expression patterns in the developing and mature human and mouse brain. To date, only MAST1 has been conclusively associated with neurological disease, with de novo variants in individuals with a neurodevelopmental disorder, including a mega corpus callosum.


Methods
Using exome sequencing we identify MAST3 missense variants in individuals with epilepsy. We also assess the effect of these variants on the ability of MAST3 to phosphorylate the target gene product ARPP‐16 in HEK293T cells.


Results
We identify de novo missense variants in the STK domain in 11 individuals, including two recurrent variants p.G510S (n = 5) and p.G515S (n = 3). All 11 individuals had developmental and epileptic encephalopathy, with 8 having normal development prior to seizure onset at &amp;lt;2 years of age. All patients developed multiple seizure types, while 9/11 had seizures triggered by fever and 9/11 had drug‐resistant seizures. In vitro analysis of HEK293T cells transfected with MAST3 cDNA carrying a subset of these patient‐specific missense variants demonstrated variable but generally lower expression, with concomitant increased phosphorylation of the MAST3 target, ARPP‐16, compared to wildtype. These findings suggest the patient‐specific variants may confer MAST3 gain‐of‐function. Moreover, single‐nuclei RNA sequencing and immunohistochemistry shows that MAST3 expression is restricted to excitatory neurons in the cortex late in prenatal development and postnatally.


Interpretation
In summary, we describe MAST3 as a novel epilepsy‐associated gene with a potential gain‐of‐function pathogenic mechanism that may be primarily restricted to excitatory neurons in the cortex.

	<content:encoded>Resilience to stress in male rats is lost 2 weeks after social defeat stress.

Abstract
Resilience to stress is the ability to quickly adapt to adversity. There is evidence that exposure to prolonged stress triggers neuroinflammation what produces individual differences in stress vulnerability. However, the relationship between stress resilience, neuroinflammation, and depressive‐like behaviors remains unknown. The aim of this study was to analyze the long‐term effects of social defeat stress (SDS) on neuroinflammation in the hippocampus and depressive‐like behaviors. Male rats were subjected to the SDS paradigm. Social interaction was analyzed 1 and 2 weeks after ending the SDS to determine which animals were susceptible or resilient to stress. Neuroinflammation markers glial fibrillary acidic protein, ionized calcium‐binding adaptor molecule 1, and elevated membrane permeability in astrocytes and microglia, as well as depressive‐like behaviors in the sucrose preference test and forced swim test were evaluated in all rats. One week after SDS, resilient rats increased their sucrose preference, and time spent in the floating behavior decreased in the forced swim test compared to susceptible rats. Surprisingly, resilient rats became susceptible to stress, and presented neuroinflammation 2 weeks after SDS. These findings suggest that SDS‐induced hippocampal neuroinflammation persists in post‐stress stages, regardless of whether rats were initially resilient or not. Our study opens a new approach to understanding the neurobiology of stress resilience.</content:encoded>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Genome Wide Association Study Identifies Risk Loci For Cluster Headache</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.26150?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Objective
To identify susceptibility loci for cluster headache and obtain insights into relevant disease pathways.


Methods
We carried out a genome‐wide association study, where 852 UK and 591 Swedish cluster headache cases were compared with 5,614 and 1,134 controls, respectively. Following quality control and imputation, single variant association testing was conducted using a logistic mixed model, for each cohort. The two cohorts were subsequently combined in a merged analysis. Downstream analyses, such as gene‐set enrichment, functional variant annotation, prediction and pathway analyses, were performed.


Results
Initial independent analysis identified two replicable cluster headache susceptibility loci on chromosome 2. A merged analysis identified an additional locus on chromosome 1 and confirmed a locus significant in the UK analysis on chromosome 6, which overlaps with a previously known migraine locus. The lead single nucleotide polymorphisms were rs113658130 (p = 1.92 x 10−17, OR [95%CI] = 1.51 [1.37–1.66]) and rs4519530 (p = 6.98 x 10−17, OR = 1.47 [1.34–1.61]) on chromosome 2, rs12121134 on chromosome 1 (p = 1.66 x 10−8, OR = 1.36 [1.22–1.52]) and rs11153082 (p = 1.85 x 10−8, OR = 1.30 [1.19–1.42]) on chromosome 6. Downstream analyses implicated immunological processes in the pathogenesis of cluster headache.


Interpretation
We identified and replicated several genome‐wide‐significant associations supporting a genetic predisposition in cluster headache in a genome‐wide association study involving 1,443 cases. Replication in larger independent cohorts combined with comprehensive phenotyping, in relation to e.g. treatment response and cluster headache subtypes, could provide unprecedented insights into genotype–phenotype correlations and the pathophysiological pathways underlying cluster headache.

	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jnr.24907?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
Neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease (PD) have a huge impact on patients, caregivers, and the health‐care system. To date, the diagnosis of mild cognitive impairments in PD has been established based on domain‐general functions such as executive functions, attention, or working memory. However, specific numerical deficits observed in clinical practice have not yet been systematically investigated. PD‐immanent deterioration of domain‐general functions and domain‐specific numerical areas suggests the mechanisms of both primary and secondary dyscalculia. The current study will systematically investigate basic number processing performance in PD patients for the first time, targeting domain‐specific cognitive representations of numerosity and the influence of domain‐general factors. The overall sample consists of patients with a diagnosis of PD, according to consensus guidelines, and healthy controls. PD patients will be stratified into patients with normal cognition or mild cognitive impairment (level I‐PD‐MCI based on cognitive screening). Basic number processing will be assessed using transcoding, number line estimation, and (non)symbolic number magnitude comparison tasks. Discriminant analysis will be employed to assess whether basic number processing tasks can differentiate between a healthy control group and both PD groups. All participants will be subjected to a comprehensive numerical and a neuropsychological test battery, as well as sociodemographic and clinical measures. Study results will give the first broad insight into the extent of basic numerical deficits in different PD patient groups and will help us to understand the underlying mechanisms of the numerical deficits faced by PD patients in daily life.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>The illustration of the generation of sympathetic neurons and chromaffin cells from SCPs associated with nerves during zebrafish development. In fish, peripheral nerve‐associated SCPs detach and generate the majority of sympathetic neurons and chromaffin cells over significant periods of development and growth.

Abstract
The autonomic portion of the peripheral nervous system orchestrates tissue homeostasis through direct innervation of internal organs, and via release of adrenalin and noradrenalin into the blood flow. The developmental mechanisms behind the formation of autonomic neurons and chromaffin cells are not fully understood. Using genetic tracing, we discovered that a significant proportion of sympathetic neurons in zebrafish originates from Schwann cell precursors (SCPs) during a defined period of embryonic development. Moreover, SCPs give rise to the main portion of the chromaffin cells, as well as to a significant proportion of enteric and other autonomic neurons associated with internal organs. The conversion of SCPs into neuronal and chromaffin cells is ErbB receptor dependent, as the pharmacological inhibition of the ErbB pathway effectively perturbed this transition. Finally, using genetic ablations, we revealed that SCPs producing neurons and chromaffin cells migrate along spinal motor axons to reach appropriate target locations. This study reveals the evolutionary conservation of SCP‐to‐neuron and SCP‐to‐chromaffin cell transitions over significant growth periods in fish and highlights relevant cellular‐genetic mechanisms. Based on this, we anticipate that multipotent SCPs might be present in postnatal vertebrate tissues, retaining the capacity to regenerate autonomic neurons and chromaffin cells.</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Zinc and Copper Brain Levels and Expression of Neurotransmitter Receptors in Two Rat ASD Models</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2021.656740</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Zinc and copper are important trace elements necessary for the proper functioning of neurons. Impaired zinc and/or copper metabolism and signaling are implicated in many brain diseases, including autism (ASD). In our studies, autistic-like behavior in rat offsprings was induced by application to pregnant mothers valproic acid or thalidomide. Zinc and copper contents were measured in serum and brain structures: hippocampus, cerebral cortex, and cerebellum. Our research shows no interconnections in the particular metal concentrations measured in autistic animal brains and their sera. Based on patient researches, we studied 26 genes belonging to disturbed neurotransmitter pathways. In the same brain regions, we examined the expression of genes encoding proteins of cholinergic, adrenergic, serotonin, and dopamine receptors. In both rats’ ASD models, 17 out of the tested gene expression were decreased. In the cerebellum and cerebral cortex, expression of genes encoding cholinergic, adrenergic, and dopaminergic receptors decreased, whereas in the hippocampus only expression of serotoninergic receptors genes was downregulated. The changes in metals content observed in the rat brain can be secondary phenomena, perhaps elements of mechanisms that compensate for neurotransmission dysfunctions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Integrative Neuroscience: Local Translation in Nervous System Pathologies</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnint.2021.689208</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Dendrites and axons can extend dozens to hundreds of centimeters away from the cell body so that a single neuron can sense and respond to thousands of stimuli. Thus, for an accurate function of dendrites and axons the neuronal proteome needs to be asymmetrically distributed within neurons. Protein asymmetry can be achieved by the transport of the protein itself or the transport of the mRNA that is then translated at target sites in neuronal processes. The latter transport mechanism implies local translation of localized mRNAs. The role of local translation in nervous system (NS) development and maintenance is well established, but recently there is growing evidence that this mechanism and its deregulation are also relevant in NS pathologies, including neurodegenerative diseases. For instance, upon pathological signals disease-related proteins can be locally synthesized in dendrites and axons. Locally synthesized proteins can exert their effects at or close to the site of translation, or they can be delivered to distal compartments like the nucleus and induce transcriptional responses that lead to neurodegeneration, nerve regeneration and other cell-wide responses. Relevant key players in the process of local protein synthesis are RNA binding proteins (RBPs), responsible for mRNA transport to neurites. Several neurological and neurodegenerative disorders, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis or spinal motor atrophy, are characterized by mutations in genes encoding for RBPs and consequently mRNA localization and local translation are impaired. In other diseases changes in the local mRNA repertoire and altered local protein synthesis have been reported. In this review, we will discuss how deregulation of localized translation at different levels can contribute to the development and progression of nervous system pathologies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Up to now, lots of efforts have been made in the incorporation of the bio-inspired sensing and neuromorphic engineering in the booming artificial intelligence industry. In this review, we first introduce neuromorphic devices based on diverse materials and mechanisms. Then we summarize the progress made in the emulation of biological sensing and perception systems. Finally, the challenges and opportunities in these fields are also discussed.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: When Is Simultaneous Recording Necessary? A Guide for Researchers Considering Combined EEG-fMRI</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.636424</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Electroencephalography (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) provide non-invasive measures of brain activity at varying spatial and temporal scales, offering different views on brain function for both clinical and experimental applications. Simultaneous recording of these measures attempts to maximize the respective strengths of each method, while compensating for their weaknesses. However, combined recording is not necessary to address all research questions of interest, and experiments may have greater statistical power to detect effects by maximizing the signal-to-noise ratio in separate recording sessions. While several existing papers discuss the reasons for or against combined recording, this article aims to synthesize these arguments into a flow chart of questions that researchers can consider when deciding whether to record EEG and fMRI separately or simultaneously. Given the potential advantages of simultaneous EEG-fMRI, the aim is to provide an initial overview of the most important concepts and to direct readers to relevant literature that will aid them in this decision.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: How Self-Appraisal Is Mediated by the Brain</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.700046</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Self-appraisal is a process that leads to the formation of self-esteem, which contributes to subjective well-being and mental health. Neuroimaging studies link self-esteem with the activity of the medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC), right temporoparietal junction (rTPJ), posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), anterior insula (AIns), and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. It is not known, however, how the process of self-appraisal itself is mediated by the brain and how different nodes of the self-appraisal network interact with each other. In this study, we used multilevel mediation analysis of functional MRI data recorded during the trait adjective judgment task, treating the emotional valence of adjectives as the predictor, behavioral response as the dependent variable, and brain activity as the mediator. The mediation effect was revealed in the rTPJ. Dynamic causal modeling showed that positive self-descriptions trigger communication within the network, with the rTPJ exerting the strongest excitatory output and MPFC receiving the strongest excitatory input. rAIns receives the strongest inhibitory input and sends exclusively inhibitory connections to other regions pointing out to its role in the processing of negative self-descriptions. Analysis of individual differences showed that in some individuals, self-appraisal is mostly driven by the endorsement of positive self-descriptions and is accompanied by increased activation and communication between rTPJ, MPFC, and PCC. In others, self-appraisal is driven by the rejection of negative self-descriptions and is accompanied by increased activation of rAIns and inhibition of PCC and MPFC. Membership of these groups was predicted by different personality variables. This evidence uncovers different mechanisms of positive self-bias, which may contribute to different facets of self-esteem and are associated with different personality profiles.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Neurofeedback Learning Is Skill Acquisition but Does Not Guarantee Treatment Benefit: Continuous-Time Analysis of Learning-Curves From a Clinical Trial for ADHD</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.668780</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Neurofeedback for attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) has long been studied as an alternative to medication, promising non-invasive treatment with minimal side-effects and sustained outcome. However, debate continues over the efficacy of neurofeedback, partly because existing evidence for efficacy is mixed and often non-specific, with unclear relationships between prognostic variables, patient performance when learning to self-regulate, and treatment outcomes. We report an extensive analysis on the understudied area of neurofeedback learning. Our data comes from a randomised controlled clinical trial in adults with ADHD (registered trial ISRCTN13915109; N = 23; 13:10 female:male; age 25–57). Patients were treated with either theta-beta ratio or sensorimotor-rhythm regimes for 40 one-hour sessions. We classify 11 learners vs 12 non-learners by the significance of random slopes in a linear mixed growth-curve model. We then analyse the predictors, outcomes, and processes of learners vs non-learners, using these groups as mutual controls. Significant predictive relationships were found in anxiety disorder (GAD), dissociative experience (DES), and behavioural inhibition (BIS) scores obtained during screening. Low DES, but high GAD and BIS, predicted positive learning. Patterns of behavioural outcomes from Test Of Variables of Attention, and symptoms from adult ADHD Self-Report Scale, suggested that learning itself is not required for positive outcomes. Finally, the learning process was analysed using structural-equations modelling with continuous-time data, estimating the short-term and sustained impact of each session on learning. A key finding is that our results support the conceptualisation of neurofeedback learning as skill acquisition, and not merely operant conditioning as originally proposed in the literature.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.640329</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Action video gaming (AVG) places sustained cognitive load on various behavioral systems, thus offering new insights into learning-related neural plasticity. This study aims to determine whether AVG experience is associated with resting-state electroencephalogram (rs-EEG) temporal and spatial complexity, and if so, whether this effect is observable across AVG subgenres. Two AVG games – League of Legends (LOL) and Player Unknown’s Battle Grounds (PUBG) that represent two major AVG subgenres – were examined. We compared rs-EEG microstate and omega complexity between LOL experts and non-experts (Experiment 1) and between PUBG experts and non-experts (Experiment 2). We found that the experts and non-experts had different rs-EEG activities in both experiments, thus revealing the adaptive effect of AVG experience on brain development. Furthermore, we also found certain subgenre-specific complexity changes, supporting the recent proposal that AVG should be categorized based on the gaming mechanics of a specific game rather than a generic genre designation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Classification of Microglial Morphological Phenotypes Using Machine Learning</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2021.701673</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Microglia are the brain’s immunocompetent macrophages with a unique feature that allows surveillance of the surrounding microenvironment and subsequent reactions to tissue damage, infection, or homeostatic perturbations. Thereby, microglia’s striking morphological plasticity is one of their prominent characteristics and the categorization of microglial cell function based on morphology is well established. Frequently, automated classification of microglial morphological phenotypes is performed by using quantitative parameters. As this process is typically limited to a few and especially manually chosen criteria, a relevant selection bias may compromise the resulting classifications. In our study, we describe a novel microglial classification method by morphological evaluation using a convolutional neuronal network on the basis of manually selected cells in addition to classical morphological parameters. We focused on four microglial morphologies, ramified, rod-like, activated and amoeboid microglia within the murine hippocampus and cortex. The developed method for the classification was confirmed in a mouse model of ischemic stroke which is already known to result in microglial activation within affected brain regions. In conclusion, our classification of microglial morphological phenotypes using machine learning can serve as a time-saving and objective method for post-mortem characterization of microglial changes in healthy and disease mouse models, and might also represent a useful tool for human brain autopsy samples.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroanatomy: Evolutionary Modifications Are Moderate in the Astroglial System of Actinopterygii as Revealed by GFAP Immunohistochemistry</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnana.2021.698459</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The present paper is the first comparative study on the astroglia of several actinopterygian species at different phylogenetical positions, teleosts (16 species), and non-teleosts (3 species), based on the immunohistochemical staining of GFAP (glial fibrillary acidic protein), the characteristic cytoskeletal intermediary filament protein, and immunohistochemical marker of astroglia. The question was, how the astroglial architecture reflexes the high diversity of this largest vertebrate group. The actinopterygian telencephalon has a so-called ‘eversive’ development in contrast to the ‘evagination’ found in sarcopterygii (including tetrapods). Several brain parts either have no equivalents in tetrapod vertebrates (e.g., torus longitudinalis, lobus inferior, lobus nervi vagi), or have rather different shapes (e.g., the cerebellum). GFAP was visualized applying DAKO polyclonal anti-GFAP serum. The study was focused mainly on the telencephalon (eversion), tectum (visual orientation), and cerebellum (motor coordination) where the evolutionary changes were most expected, but the other areas were also investigated. The predominant astroglial elements were tanycytes (long, thin, fiber-like cells). In the teleost telencephala a ‘fan-shape’ re-arrangement of radial glia reflects the eversion. In bichir, starlet, and gar, in which the eversion is less pronounced, the ‘fan-shape’ re-arrangement did not form. In the tectum the radial glial processes were immunostained, but in Ostariophysi and Euteleostei it did not extend into their deep segments. In the cerebellum Bergmann-like glia was found in each group, including non-teleosts, except for Cyprinidae. The vagal lobe was uniquely enlarged and layered in Cyprininae, and had a corresponding layered astroglial system, which left almost free of GFAP the zones of sensory and motor neurons. In conclusion, despite the diversity and evolutionary alterations of Actinopterygii brains, the diversity of the astroglial architecture is moderate. In contrast to Chondrichthyes and Amniotes; in Actinopterygii true astrocytes (stellate-shaped extraependymal cells) did not appear during evolution, and the expansion of GFAP-free areas was limited.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Proteins of the major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC I), predominantly known for antigen presentation in the immune system, have recently been shown to be necessary for developmental neural refinement and adult synaptic plasticity. However, their roles in nonneuronal cell populations in the brain remain largely unexplored. Here, we identify classical MHC I molecule H2-K&lt;sup&gt;b&lt;/sup&gt; as a negative regulator of proliferation in neural stem and progenitor cells (NSPCs). Using genetic knockout mouse models and in vivo viral-mediated RNA interference (RNAi) and overexpression, we delineate a role for H2-K&lt;sup&gt;b&lt;/sup&gt; in negatively regulating NSPC proliferation and adult hippocampal neurogenesis. Transcriptomic analysis of H2-K&lt;sup&gt;b&lt;/sup&gt; knockout NSPCs, in combination with in vitro RNAi, overexpression, and pharmacological approaches, further revealed that H2-K&lt;sup&gt;b&lt;/sup&gt; inhibits cell proliferation by dampening signaling pathways downstream of fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (Fgfr1). These findings identify H2-K&lt;sup&gt;b&lt;/sup&gt; as a critical regulator of cell proliferation through the modulation of growth factor signaling.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/Gcex-ADRIZs&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Can transcranial direct current stimulation of the primary motor cortex improve implicit motor sequence learning in individuals with Parkinson's disease? A comparison with neurologically healthy, age‐ and sex‐matched controls.

Abstract
Implicit motor sequence learning (IMSL) is a cognitive function that is known to be directly associated with impaired motor function in Parkinson's disease (PD). Research on healthy young participants shows the potential for transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), a noninvasive brain stimulation technique, over the primary motor cortex (M1) to enhance IMSL. tDCS has direct effects on the underlying cortex, but also induces distant (basal ganglia) network effects—hence its potential value in PD, a prime model of basal ganglia dysfunction. To date, only null effects have been reported in persons with PD. However, these studies did not determine the reacquisition effects, although previous studies in healthy young adults suggest that tDCS specifically exerts its beneficial effects on IMSL on reacquisition rather than acquisition. In the current study, we will therefore establish possible reacquisition effects, which are of a particular interest, as long‐term effects are vital for the successful functional rehabilitation of persons with PD. Using a sham‐controlled, counterbalanced design, we will investigate the potential of tDCS delivered over M1 to enhance IMSL, as measured by the serial reaction time task, in persons with PD and a neurologically healthy age‐ and sex‐matched control (HC) group. Multilevel Mixed Models will be implemented to analyze the sequence‐specific aspect of IMSL (primary outcome) and general learning (secondary outcome). We will determine not only the immediate effects that may occur concurrently with the application of tDCS but also the short‐term (5 min post‐tDCS) and long‐term (1 week post‐tDCS) reacquisition effects.</content:encoded>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Non‐cell autonomous epileptogenesis in focal cortical dysplasia</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.26149?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Objective
Low‐level somatic mosaicism in the brain has been shown to be a major genetic cause of intractable focal epilepsy. However, how a relatively few mutation‐carrying neurons are able to induce epileptogenesis at the local network level remains poorly understood.


Methods
To probe the origin of epileptogenesis, we measured the excitability of neurons with MTOR mutation and nearby non‐mutated neurons recorded by whole‐cell patch‐clamp and array‐based electrodes comparing the topographic distribution of mutation. Computational simulation is used to understand neural network‐level changes based on electrophysiological properties. To examine the underlying mechanism, we measured inhibitory and excitatory synaptic inputs in mutated neurons and nearby neurons by electrophysiological and histological methods using the mouse model and postoperative human brain tissue for cortical dysplasia. To explain non‐cell autonomous hyperexcitability, an inhibitor of adenosine kinase was injected into mice to enhance adenosine signaling and to mitigate hyperactivity of nearby non‐mutated neurons.


Results
We generated mice having a low‐level somatic mutation in MTOR presenting spontaneous seizures. The seizure‐triggering hyperexcitability was originated from non‐mutated neurons near mutation‐carrying neurons which proved to be less excitable than non‐mutated neurons. Interestingly, the net balance between excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs onto mutated neurons remained unchanged. Additionally, we found that inhibition of adenosine kinase, which affects adenosine metabolism and neuronal excitability, reduced the hyperexcitability of non‐mutated neurons.


Interpretation
This study showed that neurons carrying somatic mutations in MTOR lead to focal epileptogenesis via non‐cell autonomous hyperexcitability of nearby non‐mutated neurons.

The highly conserved variant, absent in healthy individuals and public SNP databases, affected a functional domain of the protein with neuroprotective properties.

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: Differential expression of microRNAs in the developing avian auditory hindbrain</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cne.25205?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>This study analyzed the spatiotemporal expression of ten microRNAs (miRNAs) in the chicken auditory hindbrain. All miRNAs were broadly expressed in all four auditory nuclei.  In the nucleus magnocelluaris (NM), nine miRNAs showed a spatially differential expression along the cochleotopic axis at embryonic day 13, a pre‐hearing stage. Quantification resulted in four distinct miRNA expression patterns, namely, homogenous, gradient, selective, and highly selective. The latter two expression patterns matched rhombomeric boundaries of this plurisegmental nucleus. Bioinformatics identified several functional groups of target mRNAs that might play an important role during ontogeny of this nucleus. This study adds miRNAs to the list of developmental gradients in the auditory system.







Abstract
The avian auditory hindbrain is a longstanding model for studying neural circuit development. Information on gene regulatory network (GRN) components underlying this process, however, is scarce. Recently, the spatiotemporal expression of 12 miRNAs was investigated in the mammalian auditory hindbrain. As a comparative study, we here investigated the spatiotemporal expression of the orthologous miRNAs during development of the chicken auditory hindbrain. All miRNAs were expressed both at E13, an immature stage, and P14, a mature stage of the auditory system. In most auditory nuclei, a homogeneous expression pattern was observed at both stages, like the mammalian system. An exception was the nucleus magnocellularis (NM). There, at E13, nine miRNAs showed a differential expression pattern along the cochleotopic axis with high expression at the rostromedial pole. One of them showed a gradient expression whereas eight showed a spatially selective expression at the rostral pole that reflected the different rhombomeric origins of this composite nucleus. The miRNA differential expression persisted in the NM to the mature stage, with the selective expression changed to linear gradients. Bioinformatics analysis predicted mRNA targets that are associated with neuronal developmental processes such as neurite and synapse organization, calcium and ephrin‐Eph signaling, and neurotransmission. Overall, this first analysis of miRNAs in the chicken central auditory system reveals shared and strikingly distinct features between chicken and murine orthologues. The embryonic gradient expression of these GRN elements in the NM adds miRNA patterns to the list of cochleotopic and developmental gradients in the central auditory system.

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: Anatomy and function of retinorecipient arborization fields in zebrafish</title>

	<content:encoded>Abstract
Burrill and Easter (1994) described the retinal projections in embryonic and larval zebrafish, introducing the term &quot;arborization fields&quot; (AFs) for the retinorecipient areas. AFs were numbered from 1 to 10 according to their positions along the optic tract. With the exception of AF10 (neuropil of the optic tectum), annotations of AFs remained tentative. Here we offer an update on the likely identities and functions of zebrafish AFs after successfully matching classical neuroanatomy to the digital Max Plack Zebrafish Brain atlas. In our system, individual AFs are neuropil areas associated with the following nuclei: AF1 with the suprachiasmatic nucleus; AF2 with the posterior parvocellular preoptic nucleus; AF3 and AF4 with the ventrolateral thalamic nucleus; AF4 with the anterior and intermediate thalamic nuclei; AF5 with the dorsal accessory optic nucleus; AF7 with the parvocellular superficial pretectal nucleus; AF8 with the central pretectal nucleus; and AF9d and AF9v with the dorsal and ventral periventricular pretectal nuclei. AF6 is probably part of the accessory optic system. Imaging, ablation and activation experiments showed contributions of AF5 and potentially AF6 to optokinetic and optomotor reflexes, AF4 to phototaxis, and AF7 to prey detection. AF6, AF8 and AF9v respond to dimming, and AF4 and AF9d to brightening. While few annotations remain tentative, it is apparent that the larval zebrafish visual system is anatomically and functionally continuous with its adult successor and fits the general cyprinid pattern. This study illustrates the synergy created by merging classical neuroanatomy with a cellular‐resolution digital brain atlas resource and functional imaging in larval zebrafish.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Genetic susceptibility loci in genome‐wide association study of cluster headache</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ana.26146?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>Objective
Identifying common genetic variants that confer genetic risk for cluster headache.


Methods
We conducted a case–control study in the Dutch Leiden University Cluster headache neuro‐Analysis program (LUCA) study population (n = 840) and controls from the Netherlands Epidemiology of Obesity Study (NEO) (n = 1,457), representing the general population. Replication was performed in a Norwegian sample of 144 cases from the Trondheim Cluster headache sample and 1,800 controls from the Nord‐Trøndelag Health Survey (HUNT). Gene set and tissue enrichment analyses, blood cell‐derived RNA‐sequencing of genes around the risk loci and linkage disequilibrium score regression were part of the downstream analyses.


Results
An association was found with cluster headache for four independent loci (r2 &amp;lt; 0.1) with genome‐wide significance (p &amp;lt; 5 x 10−8), rs11579212 (odds ratio (OR) = 1.51, 95% CI 1.33–1.72 near RP11‐815 M8.1), rs6541998 (OR = 1.53, 95% CI 1.37–1.74 near MERTK), rs10184573 (OR = 1.43, 95% CI 1.26–1.61 near AC093590.1), and rs2499799 (OR = 0.62, 95% CI 0.54–0.73 near UFL1/FHL5), collectively explaining 7.2% of the variance of the phenotype. SNPs rs11579212, rs10184573 and rs976357, as proxy SNP for rs2499799 (r2 = 1.0), replicated in the Norwegian sample (p &amp;lt; 0.05). Gene‐based mapping yielded ASZ1 as possible fifth locus. RNA‐sequencing indicated differential expression of POLR1B and TMEM87B in cluster headache.


Interpretation
This GWAS identified and replicated genetic risk loci for cluster headache with effect sizes larger than those typically seen in complex genetic disorders.
