	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Prediction and classification in equation-free collective motion dynamics</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/NsjShI_rpFk/article</link>

Modeling the complex collective behavior is a challenging issue in several material and life sciences. The collective motion has been usually modeled by simple interaction rules and explained by global statistics. However, it remains difficult to bridge the gap between the dynamic properties of the complex interaction and the emerging group-level functions. Here we introduce decomposition methods to directly extract and classify the latent global dynamics of nonlinear dynamical systems in an equation-free manner, even including complex interaction in few data dimensions. We first verified that the basic decomposition method can extract and discriminate the dynamics of a well-known rule-based fish-schooling (or bird-flocking) model. The method extracted different temporal frequency modes with spatial interaction coherence among three distinct emergent motions, whereas these wave properties in multiple spatiotemporal scales showed similar dispersion relations. Second, we extended the basic method to map high-dimensional feature space for application to actual small-dimensional systems complexly changing the interaction rules. Using group sports human data, we classified the dynamics and predicted the group objective achievement. Our methods have a potential for classifying collective motions in various domains which obey in non-trivial dominance law known as active matters.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/NsjShI_rpFk&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Synthetic protein alignments by CCMgen quantify noise in residue-residue contact prediction</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/5FzLM7-LUk4/article</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Susann Vorberg, Stefan Seemayer, Johannes Söding&lt;/p&gt;

Compensatory mutations between protein residues in physical contact can manifest themselves as statistical couplings between the corresponding columns in a multiple sequence alignment (MSA) of the protein family. Conversely, large coupling coefficients predict residues contacts. Methods for de-novo protein structure prediction based on this approach are becoming increasingly reliable. Their main limitation is the strong systematic and statistical noise in the estimation of coupling coefficients, which has so far limited their application to very large protein families. While most research has focused on improving predictions by adding external information, little progress has been made to improve the statistical procedure at the core, because our lack of understanding of the sources of noise poses a major obstacle. First, we show theoretically that the expectation value of the coupling score assuming no coupling is proportional to the product of the square roots of the column entropies, and we propose a simple entropy bias correction (EntC) that subtracts out this expectation value. Second, we show that the average product correction (APC) includes the correction of the entropy bias, partly explaining its success. Third, we have developed CCMgen, the first method for simulating protein evolution and generating realistic synthetic MSAs with pairwise statistical residue couplings. Fourth, to learn exact statistical models that reliably reproduce observed alignment statistics, we developed CCMpredPy, an implementation of the persistent contrastive divergence (PCD) method for exact inference. Fifth, we demonstrate how CCMgen and CCMpredPy can facilitate the development of contact prediction methods by analysing the systematic noise contributions from phylogeny and entropy. Using the entropy bias correction, we can disentangle both sources of noise and find that entropy contributes roughly twice as much noise as phylogeny.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/5FzLM7-LUk4&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Chromatin remodelers couple inchworm motion with twist-defect formation to slide nucleosomal DNA</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/HpvJUPawGl8/article</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Giovanni B. Brandani, Shoji Takada&lt;/p&gt;

ATP-dependent chromatin remodelers are molecular machines that control genome organization by repositioning, ejecting, or editing nucleosomes, activities that confer them essential regulatory roles on gene expression and DNA replication. Here, we investigate the molecular mechanism of active nucleosome sliding by means of molecular dynamics simulations of the Snf2 remodeler translocase in complex with a nucleosome. During its inchworm motion driven by ATP consumption, the translocase overwrites the original nucleosome energy landscape via steric and electrostatic interactions to induce sliding of nucleosomal DNA unidirectionally. The sliding is initiated at the remodeler binding location via the generation of a pair of twist defects, which then spontaneously propagate to complete sliding throughout the entire nucleosome. We also reveal how remodeler mutations and DNA sequence control active nucleosome repositioning, explaining several past experimental observations. These results offer a detailed mechanistic picture of remodeling important for the complete understanding of these key biological processes.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/HpvJUPawGl8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Replays of spatial memories suppress topological fluctuations in cognitive map. (arXiv:1811.00941v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1811.00941</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The spiking activity of the hippocampal place cells plays a key role in
producing and sustaining an internalized representation of the ambient
space---a cognitive map. These cells do not only exhibit location-specific
spiking during navigation, but also may rapidly replay the navigated routs
through endogenous dynamics of the hippocampal network. Physiologically, such
reactivations are viewed as manifestations of &quot;memory replays&quot; that help to
learn new information and to consolidate previously acquired memories by
reinforcing synapses in the parahippocampal networks. Below we propose a
computational model of these processes that allows assessing the effect of
replays on acquiring a robust topological map of the environment and
demonstrate that replays may play a key role in stabilizing the hippocampal
representation of space.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Epilepsy is the most common neurological disorder and an accurate forecast of
seizures would help to overcome the patient's uncertainty and helplessness. In
this contribution, we present and discuss a novel methodology for the
classification of intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) for seizure
prediction. Contrary to previous approaches, we categorically refrain from an
extraction of hand-crafted features and use a convolutional neural network
(CNN) topology instead for both the determination of suitable signal
characteristics and the binary classification of preictal and interictal
segments. Three different models have been evaluated on public datasets with
long-term recordings from four dogs and three patients. Overall, our findings
demonstrate the general applicability. In this work we discuss the strengths
and limitations of our methodology.

platform provides flexibility, as will be demonstrated in the demos provided,
so that researchers may manipulate the disturbances, delay, and quantization
(data rate) in the layered feedback loops, including a high-level advanced plan
layer and a low-level delayed reflex layer. In this paper, we illustrate
WheelCon's graphical user interface (GUI), the input and output of existing
demos, and how to design new games. In addition, we present the basic feedback
model, and we show the testing results from our demo games which align well
with prediction from the model. In short, the platform is featured as cheap,
simple to use, and flexible to program for effective sensorimotor neuroscience
research and control engineering education.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1811.00688</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Identification of patterns from discrete data time-series for statistical
inference, threat detection, social opinion dynamics, brain activity prediction
has received recent momentum. In addition to the huge data size, the associated
challenges are, for example, (i) missing data to construct a closed
time-varying complex network, and (ii) contribution of unknown sources which
are not probed. Towards this end, the current work focuses on statistical
neuron system model with multi-covariates and unknown inputs. Previous research
of neuron activity analysis is mainly limited with effects from the spiking
history of target neuron and the interaction with other neurons in the system
while ignoring the influence of unknown stimuli. We propose to use unknown
unknowns, which describes the effect of unknown stimuli, undetected neuron
activities and all other hidden sources of error. The maximum likelihood
estimation with the fixed-point iteration method is implemented. The
fixed-point iterations converge fast, and the proposed methods can be
efficiently parallelized and offer computational advantage especially when the
input spiking trains are over long time-horizon. The developed framework
provides an intuition into the meaning of having extra degrees-of-freedom in
the data to support the need for unknowns. The proposed algorithm is applied to
simulated spike trains and on real-world experimental data of mouse
somatosensory, mouse retina and cat retina. The model shows a successful
increasing of system likelihood with respect to the conditional intensity
function, and it also reveals the convergence with iterations. Results suggest
that the neural connection model with unknown unknowns can efficiently estimate
the statistical properties of the process by increasing the network likelihood.

	<title>eLife: latest articles: A novel mechanism of gland formation in zebrafish involving transdifferentiation of renal epithelial cells and live cell extrusion</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/38911</link>
	<content:encoded>Transdifferentiation is the poorly understood phenomenon whereby a terminally differentiated cell acquires a completely new identity. Here, we describe a rare example of a naturally occurring transdifferentiation event in zebrafish in which kidney distal tubule epithelial cells are converted into an endocrine gland known as the Corpuscles of Stannius (CS). We find that this process requires Notch signalling and is associated with the cytoplasmic sequestration of the Hnf1b transcription factor, a master-regulator of renal tubule fate. A deficiency in the Irx3b transcription factor results in ectopic transdifferentiation of distal tubule cells to a CS identity but in a Notch-dependent fashion. Using live-cell imaging we show that CS cells undergo apical constriction &lt;i&gt;en masse&lt;/i&gt; and are then extruded from the tubule to form a distinct organ. This system provides a valuable new model to understand the molecular and morphological basis of transdifferentiation and will advance efforts to exploit this rare phenomenon therapeutically.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/38677</link>
	<content:encoded>Adaptive behavior requires the separation of current from future goals in working memory. We used fMRI of object-selective cortex to determine the representational (dis)similarities of memory representations serving current and prospective perceptual tasks. Participants remembered an object drawn from three possible categories as the target for one of two consecutive visual search tasks. A cue indicated whether the target object should be looked for first (currently relevant), second (prospectively relevant), or if it could be forgotten (irrelevant). Prior to the first search, representations of current, prospective and irrelevant objects were similar, with strongest decoding for current representations compared to prospective (Experiment 1) and irrelevant (Experiment 2). Remarkably, during the first search, prospective representations could also be decoded, but revealed anti-correlated voxel patterns compared to currently relevant representations of the same category. We propose that the brain separates current from prospective memories within the same neuronal ensembles through opposite representational patterns.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/463042v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Hemodynamic recordings from visual cortex contain powerful endogenous task-related responses that may reflect task-engagement distinct from attention. We tested this hypothesis with hemodynamic measurements (intrinsic-signal optical imaging) from monkey V1, while the animals engagement in a periodic fixation task over several hours was varied though reward size, and as animals took breaks. With higher rewards, animals appeared more task-engaged; task-related responses were more temporally precise at the task period (~ 10-20 seconds), and modestly stronger. Surprisingly, 2-5-minute blocks of high-reward trials led to ramp-like decreases in mean local blood volume; these reversed with ramp-like increases during low reward. The blood volume increased even more sharply when the animal shut his eyes and disengaged completely from the task (5-10 minutes). We propose a mechanism that controls vascular tone, likely along with local neural responses, with phasic and tonic components tied to task-engagement.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/462952v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Objective Different components of body image processing seem to be reflected by different neural mechanisms. A core symptom of Anorexia nervosa (AN) is a disturbance of body image with correlates found on a neural level. The present study focusses at the neural processing of visual body stimuli of different weight categories in adolescent and adult AN patients. Method 33 adolescents aged 12-18 years (15 AN patients, 18 control participants) and 36 adult women (19 AN patients, 17 control participants) underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) while performing a perceptive and an affective body image task involving photographic stimuli of women belonging to different BMI categories. Results Differential effects on activation depending on the BMI of the women shown in the pictures were found in frontal brain regions, the thalamus, caudate and the fusiform gyrus. Group effects differentiating between AN patients and control participants were seen mainly in the caudate and insula. Discussion During a perceptive task, diminished activation of regions involved in perceptive and evaluative functions as well as emotional reasoning was seen in AN. During evaluation of the neural processing in an affective task there was a tendency towards activation differences reflecting reduced ability of size estimation and impaired integration of visual and body perception with emotions.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/461160v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Spiking Neural Network (SNN) simulations require internal variables - such as the membrane voltages of individual neurons and their synaptic inputs - to be updated on a sub-millisecond resolution. As a result, a single second of simulation time requires many thousands of update calculations per neuron. Furthermore, increases in the scale of SNN models have, accordingly, led to manyfold increases in the runtime of SNN simulations. Existing solutions to this problem of scale include high performance CPU based simulators capable of multithreaded execution (&quot;CPU parallelism&quot;). More recent GPU based simulators have emerged, which aim to utilise GPU parallelism for SNN execution. We have identified several key speedups, which give GPU based simulators up to an order of magnitude performance increase over CPU based simulators on several benchmarks. We present the Spike simulator with three key optimisations: timestep grouping, active synapse grouping, and delay insensitivity. Combined, these optimisations massively increase the speed of executing a SNN simulation and produce a simulator which is, on a single machine, faster than currently available simulators.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/461087v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is a chronic condition characterized by high levels of impulsivity, affective instability, and difficulty to establish and manage interpersonal relationships. This paper assessed differences in performance on social cognitive paradigms (MASC, RMTE) and how it related to child abuse. Specifically, it evaluated the relationship between performance on cognitive paradigms and baseline brain connectivity in patients with BPD, compared to healthy controls. BPD patients had higher levels of childhood maltreatment, increased impulsivity and aggression, and more dissociative symptoms than control subjects. For the sexual abuse subdimension, there were no differences between the BPD and the control groups, but there was a negative correlation between MASC scores and total childhood maltreatment levels, as well as between physical abuse, physical negligence, and MASC. Both groups showed that the higher the level of childhood maltreatment, the lower the performance on the MASC social cognitive test. Further, in the BPD group, there was hypoconnectivity between the structures responsible for emotion regulation and social cognitive responses that have been described as part of the frontolimbic circuitry. The more serious the child abuse, the lower the connectivity.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/460840v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Vanishing white matter (VWM) is a fatal, stress-sensitive leukodystrophy that mainly affects children and is currently without treatment. VWM is caused by recessive mutations in eukaryotic initiation factor 2B (eIF2B) that is crucial for initiation of mRNA translation and its regulation under stress conditions. Mice with bi-allelic missense mutations in eIF2B recapitulate human VWM. VWM pathomechanisms are unclear. Using polysomal profiling to screen for mRNAs with altered translation we observed most prominent changes in expression of integrated stress response (ISR) mRNAs in brains of mutant compared to wild-type mice; expression levels correlated with disease severity. We substantiated these findings in VWM patients' brains. ISRIB, an ISR inhibitor, normalized expression of mRNA markers, ameliorated white matter pathology and improved motor skills in VWM mice, thus showing that the ISR is central in VWM pathomechanisms and a viable target for therapy.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/460576v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Phasic pain stimuli are inhibited when they are applied concomitantly with a conditioning tonic stimulus at another body location (Heterotopic Noxious Conditioning Stimulation, HNCS). While this effect is thought to rely on a spino-bulbo-spinal mechanism in animals (Diffuse Noxious Inhibitory Controls, DNIC), the underlying neurophysiology in humans may further involve other pathways. In this study, we investigated the role of supraspinal mechanisms in HNCS by presenting auditory stimuli during a conditioning tonic painful stimulus (the Cold Pressor Test, CPT). Considering that auditory stimuli are not conveyed through the spinal cord, any changes in brain responses to auditory stimuli during HNCS can be ascribed entirely to supraspinal mechanisms. High-density electroencephalography (EEG) was recorded during HNCS and auditory stimuli were administered in three blocks, before, during, and after HNCS. Nociceptive Withdrawal Reflexes (NWRs) were recorded at the same time points to investigate spinal processing. Our results showed that AEPs were significantly reduced during HNCS. Moreover, the amplitude of the NWR was significantly diminished during HNCS in most participants. Given that spinal and supraspinal mechanisms operate concomitantly during HNCS, the possibility of isolating their individual contributions to DNIC-like effects in humans is questionable. We conclude that the net effects of HCNS cannot be measured independently from attentional/cognitive influences.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/454298v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>The mentalizing network and the putative mirror neuron system (pMNS) are two important large scale brain networks for social cognition, with very little overlap between them. Evidence suggests however that the two networks can collaborate for understanding the state of mind of others on the basis of their body movements. Here using fMRI we find that when participants view hand actions to detect hesitations they activate both their mentalizing and pMNS networks and information is exchanged across these networks. In a follow-up experiment using repetitive TMS we find that disturbing activity in either network slows hesitation attribution. In contrast, watching the same actions to determine the size of the object being grasped only triggered activity in the pMNS network, and rTMS over the mentalizing network then no longer slowed reactions. When we see others' actions, we recruit our own motor system. Our results suggest that for detecting a simple mental state like hesitation, this pre-processed motor information becomes a necessary input into a mentalizing network that is essential for associating deviations from a predicted motor program with a specific mental state.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/461723v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Neocortical choline acetyltransferase (ChAT)-expressing interneurons are a subclass of vasoactive intestinal peptide (ChAT-VIP) neurons of which circuit and behavioural function are unknown. It has also not been addressed whether these neurons release both neurotransmitters acetylcholine (ACh) and GABA. Here, we find that in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), ChAT-VIP neurons directly excite interneurons in layers (L)1-3 as well as pyramidal neurons in L2/3 and L6 by fast cholinergic transmission. Dual recordings of presynaptic ChAT-VIP neurons and postsynaptic L1 interneurons show fast nicotinic receptor currents strictly time-locked to single presynaptic action potentials. A fraction (10-20%) of postsynaptic neurons that received cholinergic input from ChAT-VIP interneurons also received GABAergic input from these neurons. In contrast to regular VIP interneurons, ChAT-VIP neurons did not disinhibit pyramidal neurons, but instead depolarized fast spiking and low threshold spiking interneurons. Finally, we find that ChAT-VIP neurons control attention behaviour distinctly from basal forebrain ACh inputs to mPFC. Our findings show that ChAT-VIP neurons are a local source of cortical ACh, that directly excite pyramidal and interneurons throughout cortical layers.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/461616v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>A common assumption from experiments that interfere with memory consolidation is that the resultant amnesia returns the brain of an animal to a tabula rasa state with respect to disturbed experience. However, recent studies in terrestrial snail classical conditioning revealed an odd phenomenon: animals were unable to relearn conditioned avoidance of specific food after this memory had been impaired by protein-synthesis inhibitors or N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonists. Here we examined whether such specific memory reacquisition deficit can also be observed in vertebrate learning. We trained day-old chicks in a one-trial passive avoidance task by presenting them a bead of a specific color covered with a repellent substance, methyl anthranilate. Training was preceded by administration of the protein synthesis inhibitor anisomycin or the NMDA receptor antagonist MK-801. Both drugs produced permanent amnesia, and no spontaneous recovery of memory was observed. A second training was given to the amnestic animals either using a bead of the same color (retraining) or a new color (novel training). The interval between the first and second training was 2 or 24 h, and the retention test was given from 30 min to 48 h after the second training. Retraining of the amnestic chicks with the bead that was presented during the initial training failed to produce new avoidance memory for this stimulus at all the between-training and training-to-test intervals. This memory reacquisition deficit was specific and was not transferred to a new conditioned stimulus, which was readily learned. We suggest that such pharmacologically induced experience-specific anterograde amnesia might reflect general properties of normal memory allocation, and we discuss its possible neural bases.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Evidence suggests meditation may improve health and well-being. However, understanding how meditation practices impact therapeutic outcomes is poorly characterized, in part because existing measures cannot track internal attentional states during meditation. To address this, we applied machine learning to track fMRI brain activity patterns associated with distinct mental states during meditation. Individualized brain patterns were distinguished for different forms of internal attention (breath attention, mind wandering, and self-referential processing) during a directed internal attention task. Next, these brain patterns were used to track the internal focus of attention, from moment to moment, for meditators and matched controls during breath-focused meditation. We observed that while all participants spent the majority of time attending to breath (vs. mind wandering or self-referential processing), meditators with more lifetime practice demonstrated greater overall breath attention. This new framework holds promise for elucidating therapeutic mechanisms of meditation and furthering precision medicine approaches to health.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/461582v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Understanding how sensory space maps to neural activity in the olfactory system requires efficiently and flexibly delivering numerous odorants within single experimental preparations. Such delivery is difficult with current olfactometer designs, which typically include limited numbers of stimulus channels and are subject to inter-trial and inter-channel contamination of odorants. Here, we present a novel olfactometer design that is easily constructed, modular, and capable of delivering an unlimited number of odorants with temporal precision and no detectable inter-trial or inter-channel contamination. The olfactometer further allows for flexible generation of odorant mixtures and flexible timing of odorant sequences. Odorant delivery from the olfactometer is turbulent but reliable from trial-to-trial, supporting operant conditioning of mice in an odorant discrimination task and permitting odorants and concentrations to be mapped to neural activity with a level of precision equivalent to that obtained with a flow dilution olfactometer. This novel design thus provides several unique advantages for interrogating olfactory perception and for mapping sensory space to neural activity in the olfactory system.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/461558v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Why do brain responses (e.g. event-related potentials, ERPs) vary across repeated presentations of the same stimulus? Fluctuations in neural excitability, indexed by prestimulus oscillations (8-30 Hz), are hypothesized to account for this variability. In this study, we considered different mechanisms for ERP generation and how they may be modulated by prestimulus oscillations. During stimulation with identical visual stimuli, we found that strong prestimulus alpha- and beta-band power inhibit sensory responses as characterized by early ERP components (C1 and N150). In addition, we confirmed that the late component of the ERP was generated by a baseline shift due to the event-related modulation of non-zero-mean oscillations. Importantly, we found that strong prestimulus power lead to greater event-related desynchronization (ERD), which manifested as an amplified late ERP component. Our results reveal that at least two distinct mechanisms give rise to the relationship between prestimulus brain activity and sensory responses.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Inputs from the ventral hippocampus (vHIP) to the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) have been implicated in several neuropsychiatric disorders. Here, we show that the long-range vHIP-mPFC projection is hyperactive in the Mecp2 knockout (KO) mouse model of the autism spectrum disorder Rett syndrome, which has deficits in social memory. Chronically mimicking vHIP-mPFC hyperexcitability in wild-type mice impaired social memory, whereas chronic inhibition of mPFC-projecting vHIP neurons in Mecp2 KO mice rescued social memory deficits; the extent of memory rescue was negatively correlated with the strength of vHIP input to the mPFC. Acute manipulations of the vHIP-mPFC projection also affected social memory in a specific and selective manner, suggesting that proper vHIP-mPFC signaling is necessary to recall social memories. In addition, we identified an altered vHIP-mPFC innervation pattern and increased synaptic strength onto layer 5 pyramidal neurons as contributing factors in aberrant vHIP-mPFC signaling in Mecp2 KO mice.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Particular deep artificial neural networks (ANNs) are today's most accurate models of the primate brain's ventral visual stream. Here we report that, using a targeted ANN-driven image synthesis method, new luminous power patterns (i.e. images) can be applied to the primate retinae to predictably push the spiking activity of targeted V4 neural sites beyond naturally occurring levels. More importantly, this method, while not yet perfect, already achieves unprecedented independent control of the activity state of entire populations of V4 neural sites, even those with overlapping receptive fields. These results show how the knowledge embedded in today's ANN models might be used to non-invasively set desired internal brain states at neuron-level resolution, and suggest that more accurate ANN models would produce even more accurate control.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Oligodendrocyte Precursor Cells Are Co-Opted by the Immune System to Cross-Present Antigen and Mediate Cytotoxicity</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/461434v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) are abundant in the adult CNS and can be recruited to form new oligodendrocytes and myelin in response to injury or disease. However, in multiple sclerosis (MS), oligodendrocyte regeneration and remyelination are often incomplete, suggesting that recruitment and maturation of OPCs is impaired. MS and the rodent model experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) are characterized by infiltration of activated T-cells into the CNS. To investigate the mechanisms by which this neuroinflammatory process influences OPC mobilization, we performed in vivo fate tracing in an inflammatory demyelinating animal model. Results of our studies showed that the OPC differentiation and myelin production are inhibited by either adoptive transfer of CNS infiltrating cytokine producing effector T-cells or CNS production of interferon gamma (IFN{gamma}), using an astrocyte specific IFN{gamma} transgene model. In both systems, IFN{gamma} changes the profile of OPCs by inducing functional expression of the immunoproteasome and upregulation of MHC class I. OPCs exposed to IFN{gamma} are shown to cross present exogenous antigen to cytotoxic CD8 T-cells, which then produce proteases and FasL that results in subsequent caspase 3/7 activation and OPC death, both in vitro and in vivo. Cross presentation by OPCs is dependent on the cytosolic processing pathway and can be inhibited by small molecules targeting MHC class I antigen processing and the immunoproteasome subunits. Finally, the immunoproteasome subunit, PSMB8, is shown to be markedly increased on Sox10+ oligodendrocyte lineage cells only in the demyelinated white matter lesions from patients with MS. These findings support the notion that OPCs have multiple functions beyond differentiation into myelinating cells and adapt to their microenvironment by responding to local cues. In MS, OPCs may be co-opted by the immune system to perpetuate the autoimmune response. Strategies aimed at inhibiting the aberrant immune activation pathways in OPCs may allow more efficient remyelination in MS.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/461350v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Personalization is rapidly becoming standard practice in medical diagnosis and treatment. This study is part of an ambitious program towards computational personalization of neuromodulatory interventions in neuropsychiatry. We propose to model the individual human brain as a network of neural masses embedded in a realistic physical matrix capable of representing measurable electrical brain activity. We call this a hybrid brain model (HBM) to highlight that it encodes both biophysical and physiological characteristics of an individual brain. Although the framework is general, we provide here a pipeline for the integration of anatomical, structural and functional connectivity data obtained from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), diffuse tensor imaging (DTI connectome) and electroencephalography (EEG). We personalize model parameters through a comparison of simulated cortical functional connectivity with functional connectivity profiles derived from cortically-mapped, subject-specific EEG. We show that individual information can be represented in model space through the proper adjustment of two parameters (global coupling strength and conduction velocity), and that the underlying structural information has a strong impact on the functional outcome of the model. These findings provide a proof of concept and open the door for further advances, including the model-driven design of non-invasive brain-stimulation protocols.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/460949v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Minimally invasive electrodes of cellular scale that approach a bio-integrative level of neural recording could enable the development of scalable brain machine interfaces that stably interface with the same neural populations over long period of time. In this paper, we designed and created NeuroRoots, a bio-mimetic multi-channel implant sharing similar dimension (10m wide, 1.5m thick), mechanical flexibility and spatial distribution as axon bundles in the brain. A simple approach of delivery is reported based on the assembly and controllable immobilization of the electrode onto a 35m microwire shuttle by using capillarity and surface-tension in aqueous solution. Once implanted into targeted regions of the brain, the microwire was retracted leaving NeuroRoots in the biological tissue with minimal surgical footprint and perturbation of existing neural architectures within the tissue. NeuroRoots was implanted using a platform compatible with commercially available electrophysiology rigs and with measurements of interests in behavioral experiments in adult rats freely moving into maze. We demonstrated that NeuroRoots electrodes reliably detected action potentials for at least 7 weeks and the signal amplitude and shape remained relatively constant during long-term implantation. This research represents a step forward in the direction of developing the next generation of seamless brain-machine interface to study and modulate the activities of specific sub- populations of neurons, and to develop therapies for a plethora of neurological diseases.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/460659v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Deciphering the neural code involves interpreting the responses of sensory neurons from the perspective of a downstream population. Performing such a read-out is an important step towards understanding how the brain processes sensory information and has implications for Brain-Machine Interfaces. While previous work has focused on classification algorithms to identify a stimulus in a predefined set of categories, few studies have approached a full-stimulus reconstruction task, especially from calcium imaging recordings. Here, we attempt a pixel-by-pixel reconstruction of complex natural stimuli from two-photon calcium imaging of mouse primary visual cortex. We decoded the activity of 103 neurons from layer 2/3 using an optimal linear estimator and investigated which factors drive the reconstruction performance at the pixel level. We find the density of receptive fields to be the most influential feature. Finally, we use the receptive field data and simulations from a linear-nonlinear Poisson model to extrapolate decoding accuracy as a function of network size. We find that, on this dataset, reconstruction performance can increase by more than 50%, provided that the receptive fields are sampled more uniformly in the full visual field. These results provide practical experimental guidelines to boost the accuracy of full-stimulus reconstruction.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/460535v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus is a symptomatic treatment of Parkinson's disease but benefits only to a minority of patients due to stringent eligibility criteria. To investigate new targets for less invasive therapies, we aimed at elucidating key mechanisms supporting deep brain stimulation efficiency. Here, using in vivo electrophysiology, optogenetics and modeling, we found that subthalamic stimulation normalizes pathological hyperactivity of motor cortex pyramidal cells, while concurrently activating somatostatin and inhibiting parvalbumin interneurons. In vivo opto-activation of cortical somatostatin interneurons alleviates motor symptoms in a parkinsonian mouse model. A mathematical model highlights how the decrease in pyramidal neurons activity can restore information processing capabilities. Overall, these results demonstrate that activation of cortical somatostatin interneurons may constitute a less invasive alternative than subthalamic stimulation.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: AUTOMAGIC: Standardized Preprocessing of Big EEG Data</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/460469v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Electroencephalography (EEG) recordings have been rarely included in large-scale neuropsychiatric biomarker studies. This is arguably not due to a lack of information that lies in EEG recordings but mainly on account of methodological issues. In many cases, particularly in clinical or pediatric populations, the EEG has a high degree of artifact contamination and the quality of EEG recordings often substantially differs between subjects. Although there exist a variety of standardized preprocessing methods to clean EEG from artifacts, currently there is no method to objectively quantify the quality of preprocessed EEG. This makes the commonly accepted procedure of excluding subjects from analyses due to exceeding contamination of artifacts highly subjective. As a consequence, P-hacking is fostered, the replicability of results is decreased, and it is difficult to compare data from different study sites. In addition, in large-scale studies, data are collected over years or even decades, requiring software that controls and manages the preprocessing of ongoing and dynamically growing studies. To address these two challenges, we developed AUTOMAGIC, an open-source MATLAB toolbox that acts as wrapper to run currently available preprocessing methods and offers objective standardized quality assessment for growing studies. In the present paper we outline the functionality of AUTOMAGIC and examine the effect of applying combinations of methods on a sample of resting EEG data. This examination suggests that a applying a pipeline of algorithms to detect artifactual channels in combination with Multiple Artifact Rejection Algorithm (MARA), an independent component analysis (ICA)-based artifact correction method, is sufficient to reduce a large extent of artifacts.</content:encoded>

In this study, participants were simultaneously presented with 2 unrelated stories—one spoken and one written—and asked to attend one while ignoring the other. We used fMRI and a novel intersubject correlation analysis to track the spread of information along the processing hierarchy as a function of task. Processing the unattended spoken (written) information was confined to auditory (visual) cortices. In contrast, attending to the spoken (written) story enhanced the stimulus-selective responses in sensory regions and allowed it to spread into higher-order areas. Surprisingly, we found that the story-specific spoken (written) responses for the attended story also reached secondary visual (auditory) regions of the unattended sensory modality. These results demonstrate how attention enhances the processing of attended input and allows it to propagate across brain areas.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Epidemiological and experimental studies suggest that maternal immune activation (MIA) leads to developmental brain disorders, but whether the pathogenic mechanism impacts neurons already at birth is not known. We now report that MIA abolishes in mice the oxytocin-mediated delivery γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) shift from depolarizing to hyperpolarizing in CA3 pyramidal neurons, and this is restored by the NKCC1 chloride importer antagonist bumetanide. Furthermore, MIA hippocampal pyramidal neurons at birth have a more exuberant apical arbor organization and increased apical dendritic length than age-matched controls. The frequency of spontaneous glutamatergic postsynaptic currents is also increased in MIA offspring, as well as the pairwise correlation of the synchronized firing of active cells in CA3. These alterations produced by MIA persist, since at P14–15 GABA action remains depolarizing, produces excitatory action, and network activity remains elevated with a higher frequency of spontaneous glutamatergic postsynaptic currents. Therefore, the pathogenic actions of MIA lead to important morphophysiological and network alterations in the hippocampus already at birth.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

The region of the striatum that most contributes to reversal learning remains unclear, with studies in primates implicating both caudate nucleus and putamen. We trained four marmosets on a touchscreen-based serial reversal task and implanted each with cannulae targeting both putamen and caudate bilaterally. This allowed reversible inactivation of the two areas within the same monkeys, but across separate sessions, to directly investigate their respective contributions to reversal performance. Behavioral sensitivity to the GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; agonist muscimol varied across subjects and between brain regions, so each marmoset received a range of doses. Intermediate doses of intra-putamen muscimol selectively impaired reversal performance, leaving the baseline discrimination phase unchanged. There was no effect of low doses and high doses were generally disruptive. By contrast, low doses of intra-caudate muscimol improved reversal performance, while high doses impaired both reversal and baseline discrimination performance. These data provide evidence for a specific role of the putamen in serial reversal learning, which may reflect the more habitual nature of repeated reversals using the same stimulus pair.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Hypercholesterolemia is a risk factor for neurodegenerative diseases, but how high blood cholesterol levels are linked to neurodegeneration is still unknown. Here, we show that an excess of the blood–brain barrier permeable cholesterol metabolite 27-hydroxycholesterol (27-OH) impairs neuronal morphology and reduces hippocampal spine density and the levels of the postsynaptic protein PSD95. Dendritic spines are the main postsynaptic elements of excitatory synapses and are crucial structures for memory and cognition. Furthermore, PSD95 has an essential function for synaptic maintenance and plasticity. PSD95 synthesis is controlled by the REST–miR124a–PTBP1 axis. Here, we report that high levels of 27-OH induce REST–miR124a–PTBP1 axis dysregulation in a possible RxRγ-dependent manner, suggesting that 27-OH reduces PSD95 levels through this mechanism. Our results reveal a possible molecular link between hypercholesterolemia and neurodegeneration. We discuss the possibility that reduction of 27-OH levels could be a useful strategy for preventing memory and cognitive decline in neurodegenerative disorders.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

Using fMRI responses to natural sounds, we investigated the representation of multiple acoustic features in auditory cortex of awake macaques and humans. Comparative analyses revealed homologous large-scale topographies not only for frequency but also for temporal and spectral modulations. In both species, posterior regions preferably encoded relatively fast temporal and coarse spectral information, whereas anterior regions encoded slow temporal and fine spectral modulations. Conversely, we observed a striking interspecies difference in cortical sensitivity to temporal modulations: While decoding from macaque auditory cortex was most accurate at fast rates (&amp;gt; 30 Hz), humans had highest sensitivity to ~3 Hz, a relevant rate for speech analysis. These findings suggest that characteristic tuning of human auditory cortex to slow temporal modulations is unique and may have emerged as a critical step in the evolution of speech and language.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;A major limitation of conventional human brain research has been its basis in highly artificial laboratory experiments. Due to technical constraints, little is known about the nature of cortical activations during ecological real life. We have previously proposed the “spontaneous trait reactivation (STR)” hypothesis arguing that resting-state patterns, which emerge spontaneously in the absence of external stimulus, reflect the statistics of habitual cortical activations during real life. Therefore, these patterns can serve as a window into daily life cortical activity. A straightforward prediction of this hypothesis is that spontaneous patterns should preferentially correlate to patterns generated by naturalistic stimuli compared with artificial ones. Here we targeted high-level category-selective visual areas and tested this prediction by comparing BOLD functional connectivity patterns formed during rest to patterns formed in response to naturalistic stimuli, as well as to more artificial category-selective, dynamic stimuli. Our results revealed a significant correlation between the resting-state patterns and functional connectivity patterns generated by naturalistic stimuli. Furthermore, the correlations to naturalistic stimuli were significantly higher than those found between resting-state patterns and those generated by artificial control stimuli. These findings provide evidence of a stringent link between spontaneous patterns and the activation patterns during natural vision.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

Spontaneous emergence of synchronized population activity is a characteristic feature of developing brain circuits. Recent experiments in the developing neo-cortex showed the existence of &lt;i&gt;driver cells&lt;/i&gt; able to impact the synchronization dynamics when single-handedly stimulated. We have developed a spiking network model capable to reproduce the experimental results, thus identifying two classes of driver cells: functional hubs and low functionally connected (LC) neurons. The functional hubs arranged in a &lt;i&gt;clique&lt;/i&gt; orchestrated the synchronization build-up, while the LC drivers were lately or not at all recruited in the synchronization process. Notwithstanding, they were able to alter the network state when stimulated by modifying the temporal activation of the functional clique or even its composition. LC drivers can lead either to higher population synchrony or even to the arrest of population dynamics, upon stimulation. Noticeably, some LC driver can display both effects depending on the received stimulus. We show that in the model the presence of inhibitory neurons together with the assumption that younger cells are more excitable and less connected is crucial for the emergence of LC drivers. These results provide a further understanding of the structural-functional mechanisms underlying synchronized firings in developing circuits possibly related to the coordinated activity of cell assemblies in the adult brain.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/783EnQXt2yU&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Multiscale modeling provides a very powerful means of studying complex biological systems. An important component of this strategy involves coarse-grained (CG) simplifications of regions of the system, which allow effective exploration of complex systems. Here we studied aspects of CG modeling of the human zinc transporter ZnT2. Zinc is an essential trace element with 10% of the proteins in the human proteome capable of zinc binding. Thus, zinc deficiency or impairment of zinc homeostasis disrupt key cellular functions. Mammalian zinc transport proceeds via two transporter families: ZnT and ZIP; however, little is known about the zinc permeation pathway through these transporters. As a step towards this end, we herein undertook comprehensive computational analyses employing multiscale techniques, focusing on the human zinc transporter ZnT2 and its bacterial homologue, YiiP. Energy calculations revealed a favorable pathway for zinc translocation via alternating access. We then identified key residues presumably involved in the passage of zinc ions through ZnT2 and YiiP, and functionally validated their role in zinc transport using site-directed mutagenesis of ZnT2 residues. Finally, we use a CG Monte Carlo simulation approach to sample the transition between the inward-facing and the outward-facing states. We present our structural models of the inward- and outward-facing conformations of ZnT2 as a blueprint prototype of the transporter conformations, including the putative permeation pathway and participating residues. The insights gained from this study may facilitate the delineation of the pathways of other zinc transporters, laying the foundations for the molecular basis underlying ion permeation. This may possibly facilitate the development of therapeutic interventions in pathological states associated with zinc deficiency and other disorders based on loss-of-function mutations in solute carriers.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/rnGbpKWnECI&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

In a second series of minimally invasive experiments, auditory brainstem responses (ABR) were recorded in the same four adult barn owls (&lt;i&gt;Tyto alba&lt;/i&gt;), aged between 5 and 32 months, under three different anaesthetic protocols: Ketamine (10 mg/kg) plus xylazine (3 mg/kg), isoflurane (1-1.5%) and sevoflurane (2-3%) in carbogen. Finally, the ABR measurements on adult owls were repeated in terminal experiments including more invasive procedures such as artificial respiration and higher isoflurane dosage. The main finding was a significant deterioration of auditory sensitivity in barn owls under gas anaesthesia, at the level of the auditory nerve, i.e., a very peripheral level of the auditory system. The effect was drastic in the young animals which suffered threshold elevations in auditory-nerve single-unit responses of 20 dB or more. ABR thresholds assessed repeatedly in experiments on adult owls were also significantly higher under isoflurane and sevoflurane, on average by 7 and 15 dB, compared to ketamine/xylazine. This difference already occurred with minimal dosages and was reversibly enlarged with increased isoflurane concentration. Finally, there was evidence for confounding detrimental effects associated with artificial respiration over many hours which suggested oxygen toxicity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Anaesthesia and analgesia are necessary for most invasive experiments. Their effects are also a concern for studying normal neural and sensory functions. We show a significant deterioration of hearing sensitivity of the auditory nerve under gas anaesthesia (isoflurane or sevoflurane), compared to injection anaesthesia with ketamine/xylazine, in barn owls. This generalises similar findings across birds and mammals and suggests that while inhalants are widely recommended as safe and easy-to-use anaesthetics in veterinary contexts, they should only be used with great caution in auditory neurophysiology, even at the most peripheral level. Future important questions are whether the deterioration of sensitivity at the periphery generalises to other senses and what the precise mechanisms are that determine the species-specific extent of sensitivity loss.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1811.00231</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In good old-fashioned artificial intelligence (GOFAI), humans specified
systems that solved problems. Much of the recent progress in AI has come from
replacing human insights by learning. However, learning itself is still usually
built by humans -- specifically the choice that parameter updates should follow
the gradient of a cost function. Yet, in analogy with GOFAI, there is no reason
to believe that humans are particularly good at defining such learning systems:
we may expect learning itself to be better if we learn it. Recent research in
machine learning has started to realize the benefits of that strategy. We
should thus expect this to be relevant for neuroscience: how could the correct
learning rules be acquired? Indeed, behavioral science has long shown that
humans learn-to-learn, which is potentially responsible for their impressive
learning abilities. Here we discuss ideas across machine learning,
neuroscience, and behavioral science that matter for the principle of
learning-to-learn.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Neural ring homomorphisms and maps between neural codes. (arXiv:1511.00255v2 [q-bio.NC] UPDATED)</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.00255</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Neural codes are binary codes that are used for information processing and
representation in the brain. In previous work, we have shown how an algebraic
structure, called the {\it neural ring}, can be used to efficiently encode
geometric and combinatorial properties of a neural code \cite{neuralring}. In
this work, we consider maps between neural codes and the associated
homomorphisms of their neural rings. In order to ensure that these maps are
meaningful and preserve relevant structure, we find that we need additional
constraints on the ring homomorphisms. This motivates us to define {\it neural
ring homomorphisms}. Our main results characterize all code maps corresponding
to neural ring homomorphisms as compositions of 5 elementary code maps. As an
application, we find that neural ring homomorphisms behave nicely with respect
to convexity. In particular, if $\mathcal{C}$ and $\mathcal{D}$ are convex
codes, the existence of a surjective code map $\mathcal{C}\rightarrow
\mathcal{D}$ with a corresponding neural ring homomorphism implies that the
minimal embedding dimensions satisfy $d(\mathcal{D}) \leq d(\mathcal{C})$.

	<title>eLife: latest articles: Altered hippocampal interneuron activity precedes ictal onset</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/40750</link>
	<content:encoded>Although failure of GABAergic inhibition is a commonly hypothesized mechanism underlying seizure disorders, the series of events that precipitate a rapid shift from healthy to ictal activity remain unclear. Furthermore, the diversity of inhibitory interneuron populations poses a challenge for understanding local circuit interactions during seizure initiation. Using a combined optogenetic and electrophysiological approach, we examined the activity of identified mouse hippocampal interneuron classes during chemoconvulsant seizure induction &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. Surprisingly, synaptic inhibition from parvalbumin- (PV) and somatostatin-expressing (SST) interneurons remained intact throughout the preictal period and early ictal phase. However, these two sources of inhibition exhibited cell type-specific differences in their preictal firing patterns and sensitivity to input. Our findings suggest that the onset of ictal activity is not associated with loss of firing by these interneurons or a failure of synaptic inhibition, but is instead linked with disruptions of the respective roles these interneurons play in the hippocampal circuit.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/39800</link>
	<content:encoded>A subset of atypical memory B cells accumulates in malaria and several infections, autoimmune disorders and aging in both humans and mice. It has been suggested these cells are exhausted long-lived memory B cells, and their accumulation may contribute to poor acquisition of long-lasting immunity to certain chronic infections, such as malaria and HIV. Here, we generated an immunoglobulin heavy chain knock-in mouse with a BCR that recognizes MSP1 of the rodent malaria parasite, &lt;i&gt;Plasmodium chabaudi&lt;/i&gt;. In combination with a mosquito-initiated &lt;i&gt;P. chabaudi &lt;/i&gt;infection, we show that &lt;i&gt;Plasmodium&lt;/i&gt;-specific atypical memory B cells are short-lived and disappear upon natural resolution of chronic infection. These cells show features of activation, proliferation, DNA replication, and plasmablasts. Our data demonstrate that &lt;i&gt;Plasmodium&lt;/i&gt;-specific atypical memory B cells are not a subset of long-lived memory B cells, but rather short-lived activated cells, and part of a physiologic ongoing B-cell response.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: latest articles: Value-based attentional capture affects multi-alternative decision making</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/39659</link>
	<content:encoded>Humans and other animals often violate economic principles when choosing between multiple alternatives, but the underlying neurocognitive mechanisms remain elusive. A robust finding is that adding a third option can alter the relative preference for the original alternatives, but studies disagree on whether the third option’s value decreases or increases accuracy. To shed light on this controversy, we used and extended the paradigm of one study reporting a positive effect. However, our four experiments with 147 human participants and a reanalysis of the original data revealed that the positive effect is neither replicable nor reproducible. In contrast, our behavioral and eye-tracking results are best explained by assuming that the third option’s value captures attention and thereby impedes accuracy. We propose a computational model that accounts for the complex interplay of value, attention, and choice. Our theory explains how choice sets and environments influence the neurocognitive processes of multi-alternative decision making.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: latest articles: Recalibrating timing behavior via expected covariance between temporal cues</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/38790</link>
	<content:encoded>Individuals must predict future events to proactively guide their behavior. Predicting when events will occur is a critical component of these expectations. Temporal expectations are often generated based on individual cue-duration relationships. However, the durations associated with different environmental cues will often co-vary due to a common cause. We show that timing behavior may be calibrated based on this expected covariance, which we refer to as the 'common cause hypothesis'. In five experiments using rats, we found that when the duration associated with one temporal cue changes, timed-responding to other cues shift in the same direction. Furthermore, training subjects that expecting covariance is not appropriate in a given situation blocks this effect. Finally, we confirmed that this transfer is context-dependent. These results reveal a novel principle that modulates timing behavior, which we predict will apply across a variety of magnitude-expectations.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: latest articles: CA2 neuronal activity controls hippocampal low gamma and ripple oscillations</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/38052</link>
	<content:encoded>Hippocampal oscillations arise from coordinated activity among distinct populations of neurons and are associated with cognitive functions. Much progress has been made toward identifying the contribution of specific neuronal populations in hippocampal oscillations, but less is known about the role of hippocampal area CA2, which is thought to support social memory. Furthermore, the little evidence on the role of CA2 in oscillations has yielded conflicting conclusions. Therefore, we sought to identify the contribution of CA2 to oscillations using a controlled experimental system. We used excitatory and inhibitory DREADDs to manipulate CA2 neuronal activity and studied resulting hippocampal-prefrontal cortical network oscillations. We found that modification of CA2 activity bidirectionally regulated hippocampal and prefrontal cortical low gamma oscillations and inversely modulated hippocampal ripple oscillations in mice. These findings support a role for CA2 in low gamma generation and ripple modulation within the hippocampus and underscore the importance of CA2 in extrahippocampal oscillations.</content:encoded>

In this paper we describe how to efficiently record the entire genetic history of a population in forwards-time, individual-based population genetics simulations with arbitrary breeding models, population structure and demography. This approach dramatically reduces the computational burden of tracking individual genomes by allowing us to simulate only those loci that may affect reproduction (those having non-neutral variants). The genetic history of the population is recorded as a succinct tree sequence as introduced in the software package msprime, on which neutral mutations can be quickly placed afterwards. Recording the results of each breeding event requires storage that grows linearly with time, but there is a great deal of redundancy in this information. We solve this storage problem by providing an algorithm to quickly ‘simplify’ a tree sequence by removing this irrelevant history for a given set of genomes. By periodically simplifying the history with respect to the extant population, we show that the total storage space required is modest and overall large efficiency gains can be made over classical forward-time simulations. We implement a general-purpose framework for recording and simplifying genealogical data, which can be used to make simulations of any population model more efficient. We modify two popular forwards-time simulation frameworks to use this new approach and observe efficiency gains in large, whole-genome simulations of one to two orders of magnitude. In addition to speed, our method for recording pedigrees has several advantages: (1) All marginal genealogies of the simulated individuals are recorded, rather than just genotypes. (2) A population of &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt; individuals with &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt; polymorphic sites can be stored in &lt;i&gt;O&lt;/i&gt;(&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt; log &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt; + &lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;) space, making it feasible to store a simulation’s entire final generation as well as its history. (3) A simulation can easily be initialized with a more efficient coalescent simulation of deep history. The software for recording and processing tree sequences is named tskit.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/K2Bw7mxuTw0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Motif-Aware PRALINE: Improving the alignment of motif regions</title>

Protein or DNA motifs are sequence regions which possess biological importance. These regions are often highly conserved among homologous sequences. The generation of multiple sequence alignments (MSAs) with a correct alignment of the conserved sequence motifs is still difficult to achieve, due to the fact that the contribution of these typically short fragments is overshadowed by the rest of the sequence. Here we extended the PRALINE multiple sequence alignment program with a novel motif-aware MSA algorithm in order to address this shortcoming. This method can incorporate explicit information about the presence of externally provided sequence motifs, which is then used in the dynamic programming step by boosting the amino acid substitution matrix towards the motif. The strength of the boost is controlled by a parameter, &lt;i&gt;α&lt;/i&gt;. Using a benchmark set of alignments we confirm that a good compromise can be found that improves the matching of motif regions while not significantly reducing the overall alignment quality. By estimating &lt;i&gt;α&lt;/i&gt; on an unrelated set of reference alignments we find there is indeed a strong conservation signal for motifs. A number of typical but difficult MSA use cases are explored to exemplify the problems in correctly aligning functional sequence motifs and how the motif-aware alignment method can be employed to alleviate these problems.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/KBwcHKOmgY0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Active dendrites regulate the spatiotemporal spread of signaling microdomains</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/SMnJLZ99N1Y/article</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Reshma Basak, Rishikesh Narayanan&lt;/p&gt;

Microdomains that emerge from spatially constricted spread of biochemical signaling components play a central role in several neuronal computations. Although dendrites, endowed with several voltage-gated ion channels, form a prominent structural substrate for microdomain physiology, it is not known if these channels regulate the spatiotemporal spread of signaling microdomains. Here, we employed a multiscale, morphologically realistic, conductance-based model of the hippocampal pyramidal neuron that accounted for experimental details of electrical and calcium-dependent biochemical signaling. We activated synaptic N-Methyl-d-Aspartate receptors through theta-burst stimulation (TBS) or pairing (TBP) and assessed microdomain propagation along a signaling pathway that included calmodulin, calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) and protein phosphatase 1. We found that the spatiotemporal spread of the TBS-evoked microdomain in phosphorylated CaMKII (pCaMKII) was amplified in comparison to that of the corresponding calcium microdomain. Next, we assessed the role of two dendritically expressed inactivating channels, one restorative (&lt;i&gt;A&lt;/i&gt;-type potassium) and another regenerative (&lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;-type calcium), by systematically varying their conductances. Whereas &lt;i&gt;A&lt;/i&gt;-type potassium channels suppressed the spread of pCaMKII microdomains by altering the voltage response to TBS, &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;-type calcium channels enhanced this spread by modulating TBS-induced calcium influx without changing the voltage. Finally, we explored cross-dependencies of these channels with other model components, and demonstrated the heavy mutual interdependence of several biophysical and biochemical properties in regulating microdomains and their spread. Our conclusions unveil a pivotal role for dendritic voltage-gated ion channels in actively amplifying or suppressing biochemical signals and their spatiotemporal spread, with critical implications for clustered synaptic plasticity, robust information transfer and efficient neural coding.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/SMnJLZ99N1Y&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1810.13373</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Deep neural networks (DNNs) transform stimuli across multiple processing
stages to produce representations that can be used to solve complex tasks, such
as object recognition in images. However, a full understanding of how they
achieve this remains elusive. The complexity of biological neural networks
substantially exceeds the complexity of DNNs, making it even more challenging
to understand the representations that they learn. Thus, both machine learning
and computational neuroscience are faced with a shared challenge: how can we
analyze their representations in order to understand how they solve complex
tasks?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We review how data-analysis concepts and techniques developed by
computational neuroscientists can be useful for analyzing representations in
DNNs, and in turn, how recently developed techniques for analysis of DNNs can
be useful for understanding representations in biological neural networks. We
explore opportunities for synergy between the two fields, such as the use of
DNNs as in-silico model systems for neuroscience, and how this synergy can lead
to new hypotheses about the operating principles of biological neural networks.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Evaluation of spike sorting algorithms: Simulations and application to human Subthalamic Nucleus recordings. (arXiv:1810.13302v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1810.13302</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;An important prerequisite for the analysis of spike synchrony in
extracellular recordings is the extraction of single unit activity from the
recorded multi unit signal. To identify single units (SUs), potential spikes
are detected and separated with respect to their potential neuronal origins
('spike sorting'). However, different sorting algorithms yield inconsistent
unit assignments which seriously influences the subsequent analyses of the
spiking activity. To evaluate the quality of spike sortings performed with
different prevalent algorithms offered by the 'Plexon Offline Sorter' we first
apply these algorithms to experimental data (ED), namely recordings in the
Subthalamic Nucleus of patients with Parkinson's disease, obtained during Deep
Brain Stimulation surgery. Since this procedure leaves us unsure about the best
sorting result we then apply all methods again to artificial data (AD) with
known ground truth (GT). AD consists of pairs of SUs with different shape
similarity embedded in the background noise of the ED. The sorting evaluation
is based on the influence of the respective methods on the SU assignments and
its effect on the resulting firing characteristics. We find a high variability
in the sorting results obtained by different algorithms that increases with SU
shape similarity. We also find significant differences in the resulting firing
characteristics of the ED. We conclude that Valley-Seeking produces the most
accurate results if the exclusion of artifacts as unsorted events is important.
If the latter is less important ('clean' data) K-Means is a better option. Our
results strongly argue for the need of standardized validation procedures for
spike sorting based on GT data. The recipe suggested here is simple enough to
become a standard procedure.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1810.13034</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The inverse stochastic resonance (ISR) phenomenon consists in an unexpected
depression in the response of a system under external noise, e.g., as observed
in the behavior of the mean-firing rate in some pacemaker neurons in the
presence of moderate values of noise. A possible requirement for such behavior
is the existence of a bistable regime in the behavior of these neurons. We here
explore theoretically the possible emergence of this behavior in a general
bistable system, and conclude on conditions the potential function which drives
the dynamics must accomplish. We show that such an intriguing, and apparently
widely observed, phenomenon ensues in the case of an asymmetric potential
function when the high activity minimum state of the system is metastable with
the largest basin of attraction and the low activity state is the global
minimum with a smaller basin of attraction. We discuss on the relevance of such
a picture to understand the ISR features and to predict its general appearance
in other natural systems that share the requirements described here. Finally,
we report another intriguing non-standard stochastic resonance in our system,
which occurs in the absence of any weak signal input into the system and whose
emergence can be explained, with the ISR, within our theoretical framework in
this paper in terms of the shape of the potential function.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Alternating Diffusion Map Based Fusion of Multimodal Brain Connectivity Networks for IQ Prediction. (arXiv:1810.12954v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1810.12954</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;To explain individual differences in development, behavior, and cognition,
most previous studies focused on projecting resting-state functional MRI (fMRI)
based functional connectivity (FC) data into a low-dimensional space via linear
dimensionality reduction techniques, followed by executing analysis operations.
However, linear dimensionality analysis techniques may fail to capture
nonlinearity of brain neuroactivity. Moreover, besides resting-state FC, FC
based on task fMRI can be expected to provide complementary information.
Motivated by these considerations, we nonlinearly fuse resting-state and
task-based FC networks (FCNs) to seek a better representation in this paper. We
propose a framework based on alternating diffusion map (ADM), which extracts
geometry-preserving low-dimensional embeddings that successfully parameterize
the intrinsic variables driving the phenomenon of interest. Specifically, we
first separately build resting-state and task-based FCNs by symmetric positive
definite matrices using sparse inverse covariance estimation for each subject,
and then utilize the ADM to fuse them in order to extract significant
low-dimensional embeddings, which are used as fingerprints to identify
individuals. The proposed framework is validated on the Philadelphia
Neurodevelopmental Cohort data, where we conduct extensive experimental study
on resting-state and fractal $n$-back task fMRI for the classification of
intelligence quotient (IQ). The fusion of resting-state and $n$-back task fMRI
by the proposed framework achieves better classification accuracy than any
single fMRI, and the proposed framework is shown to outperform several other
data fusion methods. To our knowledge, this paper is the first to demonstrate a
successful extension of the ADM to fuse resting-state and task-based fMRI data
for accurate prediction of IQ.

	<title>eLife: latest articles: Cryo-EM structure of the mechanically activated ion channel OSCA1.2</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/41845</link>
	<content:encoded>Mechanically activated ion channels underlie touch, hearing, shear-stress sensing, and response to turgor pressure. OSCA/TMEM63s are a newly-identified family of eukaryotic mechanically activated ion channels opened by membrane tension. The structural underpinnings of OSCA/TMEM63 function are not explored. Here, we elucidate high resolution cryo-electron microscopy structures of OSCA1.2, revealing a dimeric architecture containing eleven transmembrane helices per subunit and surprising topological similarities to TMEM16 proteins. We locate the ion permeation pathway within each subunit by demonstrating that a conserved acidic residue is a determinant of channel conductance. Molecular dynamics simulations reveal membrane interactions, suggesting the role of lipids in OSCA1.2 gating. These results lay a foundation to decipher how the structural organization of OSCA/TMEM63 is suited for their roles as MA ion channels.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: latest articles: OSCA/TMEM63 are an evolutionarily conserved family of mechanically activated ion channels</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/41844</link>
	<content:encoded>Mechanically activated (MA) ion channels convert physical forces into electrical signals, and are essential for eukaryotic physiology. Despite their importance, few bona-fide MA channels have been described in plants and animals. Here, we show that various members of the OSCA and TMEM63 family of proteins from plants, flies, and mammals confer mechanosensitivity to naïve cells. We conclusively demonstrate that OSCA1.2, one of the &lt;i&gt;Arabidopsis thaliana &lt;/i&gt;OSCA proteins, is an inherently mechanosensitive, pore-forming ion channel. Our results suggest that OSCA/TMEM63 proteins are the largest family of MA ion channels identified, and are conserved across eukaryotes. Our findings will enable studies to gain deep insight into molecular mechanisms of MA channel gating, and will facilitate a better understanding of mechanosensory processes &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; across plants and animals.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>In the mid-20th century, the unicellular and genetically tractable green alga &lt;i&gt;Chlamydomonas reinhardtii&lt;/i&gt; was first developed as a model organism to elucidate fundamental cellular processes such as photosynthesis, light perception and the structure, function and biogenesis of cilia. Various studies of &lt;i&gt;C. reinhardtii&lt;/i&gt; have profoundly advanced plant and cell biology, and have also impacted algal biotechnology and our understanding of human disease. However, the 'real' life of &lt;i&gt;C. reinhardtii&lt;/i&gt; in the natural environment has largely been neglected. To extend our understanding of the biology of &lt;i&gt;C. reinhardtii&lt;/i&gt;, it will be rewarding to explore its behavior in its natural habitats, learning more about its abundance and life cycle, its genetic and physiological diversity, and its biotic and abiotic interactions.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/38617</link>
	<content:encoded>KCNQ2/3 channels, ubiquitously expressed neuronal potassium channels, have emerged as indispensable regulators of brain network activity. Despite their critical role in brain homeostasis, the mechanisms by which KCNQ2/3 dysfunction lead to hypersychrony are not fully known. Here, we show that deletion of KCNQ2/3 channels changed PV&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; interneurons’, but not SST&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; interneurons’, firing properties. We also find that deletion of either KCNQ2/3 or KCNQ2 channels from PV&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; interneurons led to elevated homeostatic potentiation of fast excitatory transmission in pyramidal neurons. &lt;i&gt;Pvalb-Kcnq2&lt;/i&gt; null-mice showed increased seizure susceptibility, suggesting that decreases in interneuron KCNQ2/3 activity remodels excitatory networks, providing a new function for these channels.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/37550</link>
	<content:encoded>Using FIB-SEM we report the entire synaptic connectome of glomerulus VA1v of the right antennal lobe in &lt;i&gt;Drosophila melanogaster&lt;/i&gt;. Within the glomerulus we densely reconstructed all neurons, including hitherto elusive local interneurons. The &lt;i&gt;fruitless&lt;/i&gt;-positive, sexually dimorphic VA1v included &amp;gt;11,140 presynaptic sites with ~38,050 postsynaptic dendrites. These connected input olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs, 51 ipsilateral, 56 contralateral), output projection neurons (18 PNs), and local interneurons (56 of &amp;gt;150 previously reported LNs). ORNs are predominantly presynaptic and PNs predominantly postsynaptic; newly reported LN circuits are largely an equal mixture and confer extensive synaptic reciprocity, except the newly reported LN2V with input from ORNs and outputs mostly to monoglomerular PNs, however. PNs were more numerous than previously reported from genetic screens, suggesting that the latter failed to reach saturation. We report a matrix of 192 bodies each having &lt;span class=&quot;underline&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;50 connections; these form 88% of the glomerulus' pre/postsynaptic sites.</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: A Pareto approach to resolve the conflict between information gain and experimental costs: Multiple-criteria design of carbon labeling experiments</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/XVaL83E8BL0/article</link>

Science revolves around the best way of conducting an experiment to obtain insightful results. Experiments with maximal information content can be found by computational experimental design (ED) strategies that identify optimal conditions under which to perform the experiment. Several criteria have been proposed to measure the information content, each emphasizing different aspects of the design goal, i.e., reduction of uncertainty. Where experiments are complex or expensive, second sight is at the budget governing the achievable amount of information. In this context, the design objectives &lt;i&gt;cost&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;information gain&lt;/i&gt; are often incommensurable, though dependent. By casting the ED task into a multiple-criteria optimization problem, a set of trade-off designs is derived that approximates the Pareto-frontier which is instrumental for exploring preferable designs. In this work, we present a computational methodology for multiple-criteria ED of information-rich experiments that accounts for virtually any set of design criteria. The methodology is implemented for the case of &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C metabolic flux analysis (MFA), which is arguably the most expensive type among the ‘omics’ technologies, featuring dozens of design parameters (tracer composition, analytical platform, measurement selection etc.). Supported by an innovative visualization scheme, we demonstrate with two realistic showcases that the use of multiple criteria reveals deep insights into the conflicting interplay between information carriers and cost factors that are not amendable to single-objective ED. For instance, tandem mass spectrometry turns out as best-in-class with respect to information gain, while it delivers this information quality cheaper than the other, routinely applied analytical technologies. Therewith, our Pareto approach to ED offers the investigator great flexibilities in the conception phase of a study to balance costs and benefits.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/XVaL83E8BL0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Malaria is a life-threatening disease spread by mosquitoes. &lt;i&gt;Plasmodium falciparum&lt;/i&gt; M1 alanyl aminopeptidase (&lt;i&gt;Pf&lt;/i&gt;M1-AAP) is a promising target for the treatment of malaria. The recently solved crystal structures of &lt;i&gt;Pf&lt;/i&gt;M1-AAP revealed that the buried active site can be accessed through two channel openings: a short N-terminal channel with the length of 8 Å and a long C-terminal channel with the length of 30 Å. It is unclear, however, how substrates and inhibitors migrate to the active site and a product of cleavage leaves. Here, we study the molecular mechanism of substrate and inhibitor migration to the active site and the product release using steered molecular dynamics simulations. We identified a stepwise passage of substrates and inhibitors in the C-terminal channel of &lt;i&gt;Pf&lt;/i&gt;M1-AAP, involving (I) ligand recognition at the opening of the channel, (II) ionic translation to the ‘water reservoir’, (III) ligand reorientation in the ‘water reservoir’ and (IV) passage in a suitable conformation into the active site. Endorsed by enzymatic analysis of functional recombinant &lt;i&gt;Pf&lt;/i&gt;M1-AAP and mutagenesis studies, our novel ligand-residue binding network analysis has identified the functional residues controlling ligand migration within the C-terminal channel of &lt;i&gt;Pf&lt;/i&gt;M1-AAP. Furthermore, from unbinding simulations of the Arg product we propose a charge repulsion as the driving force to expel the product out from the N-terminal channel of &lt;i&gt;Pf&lt;/i&gt;M1-AAP. Our work paves the way towards the design of a novel class of P&lt;i&gt;f&lt;/i&gt;M1-AAP inhibitors based on preventing substrate entry to the active site.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/hf_kiQ3xpNU&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Molecular characterization of breast and lung tumors by integration of multiple data types with functional sparse-factor analysis</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/1Oc1xvSZWcU/article</link>

Effective cancer treatment is crucially dependent on the identification of the biological processes that drive a tumor. However, multiple processes may be active simultaneously in a tumor. Clustering is inherently unsuitable to this task as it assigns a tumor to a single cluster. In addition, the wide availability of multiple data types per tumor provides the opportunity to profile the processes driving a tumor more comprehensively. Here we introduce Functional Sparse-Factor Analysis (funcSFA) to address these challenges. FuncSFA integrates multiple data types to define a lower dimensional space capturing the relevant variation. A tailor-made module associates biological processes with these factors. FuncSFA is inspired by iCluster, which we improve in several key aspects. First, we increase the convergence efficiency significantly, allowing the analysis of multiple molecular datasets that have not been pre-matched to contain only concordant features. Second, FuncSFA does not assign tumors to discrete clusters, but identifies the dominant driver processes active in each tumor. This is achieved by a regression of the factors on the RNA expression data followed by a functional enrichment analysis and manual curation step. We apply FuncSFA to the TCGA breast and lung datasets. We identify EMT and Immune processes common to both cancer types. In the breast cancer dataset we recover the known intrinsic subtypes and identify additional processes. These include immune infiltration and EMT, and processes driven by copy number gains on the 8q chromosome arm. In lung cancer we recover the major types (adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma) and processes active in both of these types. These include EMT, two immune processes, and the activity of the NFE2L2 transcription factor. We validate the breast cancer findings on the METABRIC set and demonstrate the translatability of the TCGA breast cancer factors to METABRIC. In summary, FuncSFA is a robust method to perform discovery of key driver processes in a collection of tumors through unsupervised integration of multiple molecular data types and functional annotation.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/1Oc1xvSZWcU&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0290-18.2018v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Pain serves vital protective functions, which crucially depend on appropriate motor responses to noxious stimuli. Such responses not only depend on but can themselves shape the perception of pain. In chronic pain, perception is often decoupled from noxious stimuli and motor responses are no longer protective, which suggests that the relationships between noxious stimuli, pain perception and behavior might be changed. We here performed a simple experiment to quantitatively assess the relationships between noxious stimuli, perception and behavior in 22 chronic pain patients and 22 age-matched healthy human participants. Brief noxious and tactile stimuli were applied to the participants’ hands and participants performed speeded motor responses and provided perceptual ratings of the stimuli. Multi-level moderated mediation analyses assessed the relationships between stimulus intensity, perceptual ratings and reaction times for both stimulus types. The results revealed a significantly stronger involvement of motor responses in the translation of noxious stimuli into perception than in the translation of tactile stimuli into perception. This significant influence of motor responses on pain perception was found for both chronic pain patients and healthy participants. Thus, stimulus-perception-behavior relationships appear to be at least partially preserved in chronic pain patients and motor-related as well as behavioral interventions might harness these functional relationships to modulate pain perception.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Despite its frequent conceptualization as a perceptual phenomenon, the protective function of pain crucially depends on appropriate motor responses to potentially harmful stimuli. However, it is not fully clear how motor responses and pain perception relate to each other. The present study confirms that motor responses to noxious stimuli are significantly involved in shaping pain perception in healthy human participants. Moreover, the results reveal that similar effects can be observed in chronic pain patients. Thus, stimulus-perception-behavior relationships seem to be at least partially preserved in chronic pain patients. This can further the understanding of how behavioral therapies and motor-related stimulation techniques can be used to reshape the perception of pain in chronic pain patients.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>RSS PAP: Cell type- and layer-specific muscarinic potentiation of excitatory synaptic drive onto parvalbumin neurons in mouse prefrontal cortex</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0208-18.2018v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Cholinergic neuromodulation is thought to shape network activity in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), and thus PFC-dependent cognitive functions. Acetylcholine (ACh) may modulate the activity of parvalbumin-positive (PV&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) neurons, which critically regulate cortical network function. However, the mechanisms of cholinergic regulation of PV&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; neuron activity, and particularly of the basket (BC) versus chandelier (ChC) subtypes, are unclear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using patch clamp recordings in acute slices, we examined the effects of the ACh receptor (AChR) agonist carbachol on the excitatory synaptic drive onto BCs or ChCs in layers 2 to 6 of mouse PFC. Carbachol increased the frequency and amplitude of spontaneous excitatory synaptic currents (sEPSCs) recorded from PV&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; BCs in layers 3-6, but not in BCs from layer 2. Moreover, carbachol did not change the sEPSCs in ChCs, which were located exclusively in layer 2. The potentiation of sEPSCs in layers 3-6 BCs was prevented by the Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channel blocker tetrodotoxin and was abolished by the M1-selective muscarinic AChR antagonist pirenzepine. Thus, carbachol potentiates the activity-dependent excitatory drive onto PV&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; neurons via M1-muscarinic AChR activation in a cell type- and layer-specific manner. In current clamp recordings with synaptic transmission blocked, carbachol directly evoked firing in deep layer pyramidal neurons (PNs). In contrast, carbachol elicited deep layer BC firing indirectly, via glutamate-mediated synaptic drive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our data suggest that ACh powerfully regulates PFC microcircuit function by facilitating the firing of pyramidal neurons that synaptically recruit deep layer PV&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; BC activity, possibly shaping the patterns of network activity that contribute to cognitive function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Cholinergic neuromodulation and parvalbumin-positive (PV&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) neurons may be essential for regulation of prefrontal cortex (PFC) network activity. To determine whether cholinergic input modulates PFC network function via PV&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; neurons, we examined the effects of the cholinergic agonist carbachol on the excitatory synaptic drive onto PV&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; neurons in mouse PFC. Carbachol, via M1 muscarinic receptor activation, potentiated the excitatory synaptic currents onto PV&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; basket cells in deep cortical layers, but not onto superficial layer basket or chandelier cells. Carbachol directly elicited firing in deep layer pyramidal neurons but basket cell activity was recruited indirectly, via synaptic glutamate-mediated excitatory drive. Our data suggest that cholinergic neuromodulation contributes to PFC-dependent cognitive function recruiting PV&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; neuron activity in a cell type- and layer-specific manner.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Neogenin in Amygdala for Neuronal Activity and Information Processing</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/44/9600?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Fear learning and memory are vital for livings to survive, dysfunctions in which have been implicated in various neuropsychiatric disorders. Appropriate neuronal activation in amygdala is critical for fear memory. However, the underlying regulatory mechanisms are not well understood. Here we report that Neogenin, a DCC (deleted in colorectal cancer) family receptor, which plays important roles in axon navigation and adult neurogenesis, is enriched in excitatory neurons in BLA (Basolateral amygdala). Fear memory is impaired in male &lt;i&gt;Neogenin&lt;/i&gt; mutant mice. The number of cFos&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; neurons in response to tone-cued fear training was reduced in mutant mice, indicating aberrant neuronal activation in the absence of Neogenin. Electrophysiological studies show that &lt;i&gt;Neogenin&lt;/i&gt; mutation reduced the cortical afferent input to BLA pyramidal neurons and compromised both induction and maintenance of Long-Term Potentiation evoked by stimulating cortical afferent, suggesting a role of Neogenin in synaptic plasticity. Concomitantly, there was a reduction in spine density and in frequency of miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs), but not miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents, suggesting a role of Neogenin in forming excitatory synapses. Finally, ablating &lt;i&gt;Neogenin&lt;/i&gt; in the BLA in adult male mice impaired fear memory likely by reducing mEPSC frequency in BLA excitatory neurons. These results reveal an unrecognized function of Neogenin in amygdala for information processing by promoting and maintaining neurotransmission and synaptic plasticity and provide insight into molecular mechanisms of neuronal activation in amygdala.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Appropriate neuronal activation in amygdala is critical for information processing. However, the underlying regulatory mechanisms are not well understood. Neogenin is known to regulate axon navigation and adult neurogenesis. Here we show that it is critical for neurotransmission and synaptic plasticity in the amygdala and thus fear memory by using a combination of genetic, electrophysiological, behavioral techniques. Our studies identify a novel function of Neogenin and provide insight into molecular mechanisms of neuronal activation in amygdala for fear processing.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Neural Deletion of Glucose Transporter Isoform 3 Creates Distinct Postnatal and Adult Neurobehavioral Phenotypes</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/44/9579?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;We created a neural-specific conditional murine &lt;i&gt;glut3&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;Slc2A3&lt;/i&gt;) deletion (&lt;i&gt;glut3&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;flox/flox/nestin-Cre+&lt;/sup&gt;) to examine the effect of a lack of Glut3 on neurodevelopment. Compared with age-matched &lt;i&gt;glut3&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;flox/flox&lt;/sup&gt; = WT and heterozygotes (&lt;i&gt;glut3&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;flox/+/nestin-Cre+&lt;/sup&gt;), we found that a &amp;gt;90% reduction in male and female brain Glut3 occurred by postnatal day 15 (PN15) in &lt;i&gt;glut3&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;flox/flox/nestin-Cre+&lt;/sup&gt;. This genetic manipulation caused a diminution in brain weight and cortical thickness at PN15, a reduced number of dendritic spines, and fewer ultrasonic vocalizations. Patch-clamp recordings of cortical pyramidal neurons revealed increased frequency of bicuculline-induced paroxysmal discharges as well as reduced latency, attesting to a functional synaptic and cortical hyperexcitability. Concomitant stunting with lower glucose concentrations despite increased milk intake shortened the lifespan, failing rescue by a ketogenic diet. This led to creating &lt;i&gt;glut3&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;flox/flox/CaMK2α-Cre+&lt;/sup&gt; mice lacking Glut3 in the adult male limbic system. These mice had normal lifespan, displayed reduced IPSCs in cortical pyramidal neurons, less anxiety/fear, and lowered spatial memory and motor abilities but heightened exploratory and social responses. These distinct postnatal and adult phenotypes, based upon whether &lt;i&gt;glut3&lt;/i&gt; gene is globally or restrictively absent, have implications for humans who carry copy number variations and present with neurodevelopmental disorders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Lack of the key brain-specific glucose transporter 3 gene found in neurons during early postnatal life results in significant stunting, a reduction in dendritic spines found on neuronal processes and brain size, heightened neuronal excitability, along with a shortened lifespan. When occurring in the adult and limited to the limbic system alone, lack of this gene in neurons reduces the fear of spatial exploration and socialization but does not affect the lifespan. These features are distinct heralding differences between postnatal and adult phenotypes based upon whether the same gene is globally or restrictively lacking. These findings have implications for humans who carry copy number variations pertinent to this gene and have been described to present with neurodevelopmental disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Emergence of Binocular Disparity Selectivity through Hebbian Learning</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/44/9563?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Neural selectivity in the early visual cortex strongly reflects the statistics of our environment (Barlow, 2001; Geisler, 2008). Although this has been described extensively in literature through various encoding hypotheses (Barlow and Földiák, 1989; Atick and Redlich, 1992; Olshausen and Field, 1996), an explanation as to how the cortex might develop the computational architecture to support these encoding schemes remains elusive. Here, using the more realistic example of binocular vision as opposed to monocular luminance-field images, we show how a simple Hebbian coincidence-detector is capable of accounting for the emergence of binocular, disparity selective, receptive fields. We propose a model based on spike timing-dependent plasticity, which not only converges to realistic single-cell and population characteristics, but also demonstrates how known biases in natural statistics may influence population encoding and downstream correlates of behavior. Furthermore, we show that the receptive fields we obtain are closer in structure to electrophysiological data reported in macaques than those predicted by normative encoding schemes (Ringach, 2002). We also demonstrate the robustness of our model to the input dataset, noise at various processing stages, and internal parameter variation. Together, our modeling results suggest that Hebbian coincidence detection is an important computational principle and could provide a biologically plausible mechanism for the emergence of selectivity to natural statistics in the early sensory cortex.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Neural selectivity in the early visual cortex is often explained through encoding schemes that postulate that the computational aim of early sensory processing is to use the least possible resources (neurons, energy) to code the most informative features of the stimulus (information efficiency). In this article, using stereo images of natural scenes, we demonstrate how a simple Hebbian rule can lead to the emergence of a disparity-selective neural population that not only shows realistic single-cell and population tunings, but also demonstrates how known biases in natural statistics may influence population encoding and downstream correlates of behavior. Our approach allows us to view early neural selectivity, not as an optimization problem, but as an emergent property driven by biological rules of plasticity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: On the Role of Cortex-Basal Ganglia Interactions for Category Learning: A Neurocomputational Approach</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/44/9551?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In addition to the prefrontal cortex (PFC), the basal ganglia (BG) have been increasingly often reported to play a fundamental role in category learning, but the circuit mechanisms mediating their interaction remain to be explored. We developed a novel neurocomputational model of category learning that particularly addresses the BG–PFC interplay. We propose that the BG bias PFC activity by removing the inhibition of cortico–thalamo–cortical loop and thereby provide a teaching signal to guide the acquisition of category representations in the corticocortical associations to the PFC. Our model replicates key behavioral and physiological data of macaque monkey learning a prototype distortion task from Antzoulatos and Miller (2011). Our simulations allowed us to gain a deeper insight into the observed drop of category selectivity in striatal neurons seen in the experimental data and in the model. The simulation results and a new analysis of the experimental data based on the model's predictions show that the drop in category selectivity of the striatum emerges as the variability of responses in the striatum rises when confronting the BG with an increasingly larger number of stimuli to be classified. The neurocomputational model therefore provides new testable insights of systems-level brain circuits involved in category learning that may also be generalized to better understand other cortico–BG–cortical loops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Inspired by the idea that basal ganglia (BG) teach the prefrontal cortex (PFC) to acquire category representations, we developed a novel neurocomputational model and tested it on a task that was recently applied in monkey experiments. As an advantage over previous models of category learning, our model allows to compare simulation data with single-cell recordings in PFC and BG. We not only derived model predictions, but already verified a prediction to explain the observed drop in striatal category selectivity. When testing our model with a simple, real-world face categorization task, we observed that the fast striatal learning with a performance of 85% correct responses can teach the slower PFC learning to push the model performance up to almost 100%.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Sox14 Is Required for a Specific Subset of Cerebello-Olivary Projections</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/44/9539?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;We identify &lt;i&gt;Sox14&lt;/i&gt; as an exclusive marker of inhibitory projection neurons in the lateral and interposed, but not the medial, cerebellar nuclei. &lt;i&gt;Sox14&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt; neurons make up ~80% of &lt;i&gt;Gad1&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt; neurons in these nuclei and are indistinguishable by soma size from other inhibitory neurons. All &lt;i&gt;Sox14&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt; neurons of the lateral and interposed cerebellar nuclei are generated at approximately E10/10.5 and extend long-range, predominantly contralateral projections to the inferior olive. A small &lt;i&gt;Sox14&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt; population in the adjacent vestibular nucleus &quot;Y&quot; sends an ipsilateral projection to the oculomotor nucleus. Cerebellar &lt;i&gt;Sox14&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt; and glutamatergic projection neurons assemble in non-overlapping populations at the nuclear transition zone, and their integration into a coherent nucleus depends on &lt;i&gt;Sox14&lt;/i&gt; function. Targeted ablation of &lt;i&gt;Sox14&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt; cells by conditional viral expression of diphtheria toxin leads to significantly impaired motor learning. Contrary to expectations, associative learning is unaffected by unilateral &lt;i&gt;Sox14&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt; neuron elimination in the interposed and lateral nuclei.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The cerebellar nuclei are central to cerebellar function, yet how they modulate and process cerebellar inputs and outputs is still primarily unknown. Our study gives a direct insight into how nucleo-olivary projection neurons are generated, their projections, and their function in an intact behaving mouse. These neurons play a critical conceptual role in all models of cerebellar function, and this study represents the first specific analysis of their molecular identity and function and offers a powerful model for future investigation of cerebellar function in motor control and learning.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: The Time Course of Target Template Activation Processes during Preparation for Visual Search</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/44/9527?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Search for target objects in visual scenes is guided by mental representations of target features (attentional templates). However, it is unknown when such templates are activated during each search episode and whether this can be controlled by temporal expectations. We used electrophysiological measures to track search template activation processes in real time. In three experiments, female and male humans searched for a color-defined target object in search displays where targets were accompanied by distractors in different nontarget colors. Brief task-irrelevant color singleton probes that matched the target template were flashed rapidly (every 200 ms) throughout each block. Probes presented at times when the target template is active should capture attention, whereas probes presented at other times should not. To assess this, N2pc components were measured as markers of attentional capture, separately for probes at each successive temporal position between two search displays. Results demonstrated that search templates were active from ~1000 ms before the arrival of the next search display, and were deactivated after each search episode, even when the preceding search display did not contain a target object. Templates were activated later when the predictable interval between search displays was increased. Results demonstrate that search templates are not continuously active but are transiently activated during the preparation for each new search episode. These activation states are regulated in a top-down fashion by temporal expectations about when an attentional template will become task-relevant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; It is often assumed that observers prepare for a visual search task by activating mental representations of search target objects (attentional templates). However, the time course of such template activation processes is completely unknown. By using a new sequential probe presentation technique and electrophysiological measures of attentional processing, we demonstrate that target templates are rapidly activated and deactivated before and after each successive search display, and that these template activation states are tuned to observers' temporal expectations. These results provide novel insights into the temporal dynamics of cognitive control processes in visual attention. They show that attentional templates for visual search are preparatory states that are activated in a transient fashion before each new search episode.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: CREST in the Nucleus Accumbens Core Regulates Cocaine Conditioned Place Preference, Cocaine-Seeking Behavior, and Synaptic Plasticity</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/44/9514?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Epigenetic mechanisms result in persistent changes at the cellular level that can lead to long-lasting behavioral adaptations. Nucleosome remodeling is a major epigenetic mechanism that has not been well explored with regards to drug-seeking behaviors. Nucleosome remodeling is performed by multi-subunit complexes that interact with DNA or chromatin structure and possess an ATP-dependent enzyme to disrupt nucleosome-DNA contacts and ultimately regulate gene expression. Calcium responsive transactivator (CREST) is a transcriptional activator that interacts with enzymes involved in both histone acetylation and nucleosome remodeling. Here, we examined the effects of knocking down CREST in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) core on drug-seeking behavior and synaptic plasticity in male mice as well as drug-seeking in male rats. Knocking down CREST in the NAc core results in impaired cocaine-induced conditioned place preference (CPP) as well as theta-induced long-term potentiation in the NAc core. Further, similar to the CPP findings, using a self-administration procedure, we found that CREST knockdown in the NAc core of male rats had no effect on instrumental responding for cocaine itself on a first-order schedule, but did significantly attenuate responding on a second-order chain schedule, in which responding has a weaker association with cocaine. Together, these results suggest that CREST in the NAc core is required for cocaine-induced CPP, synaptic plasticity, as well as cocaine-seeking behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; This study demonstrates a key role for the role of Calcium responsive transactivator (CREST), a transcriptional activator, in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) core with regard to cocaine-induced conditioned place preference (CPP), self-administration (SA), and synaptic plasticity. CREST is a unique transcriptional regulator that can recruit enzymes from two different major epigenetic mechanisms: histone acetylation and nucleosome remodeling. In this study we also found that the level of potentiation in the NAc core correlated with whether or not animals formed a CPP. Together the results indicate that CREST is a key downstream regulator of cocaine action in the NAc.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/44/9505?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;PDGFRα, specifically expressed by immature oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) in the CNS, plays a critical role in OPC proliferation and migration. However, it has been uncertain whether all cells of oligodendrocyte lineage are derived from the PDGFRα-expressing OPCs. In the present study, we uncovered a PDGFRα-independent oligodendrocyte lineage in the developing cortex. This OPC subpopulation originates from the local ventricular/subventricular zone after birth and contributes to the earliest mature oligodendrocytes in the cortex. PDGFRα signaling does not regulate the generation and differentiation of cortical OPCs. Fate-mapping studies in the PDGFRα&lt;sup&gt;CreER&lt;/sup&gt;; Sox10-GFP/tdTom double-transgenic mice of either sex have further corroborated the PDGFRα-independent oligodendrocyte lineage. This study provides additional missing genetic evidence for PDGFRα-independent oligodendrocyte lineage in the developing hindbrain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; This is the first report of a subpopulation of oligodendrocyte lineage in the developing mouse cortex independent of PDGFRα signaling.

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Visuomotor Correlates of Conflict Expectation in the Context of Motor Decisions</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/44/9486?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Many behaviors require choosing between conflicting options competing against each other in visuomotor areas. Such choices can benefit from top-down control processes engaging frontal areas in advance of conflict when it is anticipated. Yet, very little is known about how this proactive control system shapes the visuomotor competition. Here, we used electroencephalography in human subjects (male and female) to identify the visual and motor correlates of conflict expectation in a version of the Eriksen Flanker task that required left or right responses according to the direction of a central target arrow surrounded by congruent or incongruent (conflicting) flankers. Visual conflict was either highly expected (it occurred in 80% of trials; mostly incongruent blocks) or very unlikely (20% of trials; mostly congruent blocks). We evaluated selective attention in the visual cortex by recording target- and flanker-related steady-state visual-evoked potentials (SSVEPs) and probed action selection by measuring response-locked potentials (RLPs) in the motor cortex. Conflict expectation enhanced accuracy in incongruent trials, but this improvement occurred at the cost of speed in congruent trials. Intriguingly, this behavioral adjustment occurred while visuomotor activity was less finely tuned: target-related SSVEPs were smaller while flanker-related SSVEPs were higher in mostly incongruent blocks than in mostly congruent blocks, and incongruent trials were associated with larger RLPs in the ipsilateral (nonselected) motor cortex. Hence, our data suggest that conflict expectation recruits control processes that augment the tolerance for inappropriate visuomotor activations (rather than processes that downregulate their amplitude), allowing for overflow activity to occur without having it turn into the selection of an incorrect response.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Motor choices made in front of discordant visual information are more accurate when conflict can be anticipated, probably due to the engagement of top-down control from frontal areas. How this control system modulates activity within visual and motor areas is unknown. Here, we show that, when control processes are recruited in anticipation of conflict, as evidenced by higher midfrontal theta activity, visuomotor activity is less finely tuned: visual processing of the goal-relevant location was reduced and the motor cortex displayed more inappropriate activations, compared with when conflict was unlikely. We argue that conflict expectation is associated with an expansion of the distance-to-selection threshold, improving accuracy while the need for online control of visuomotor activity is reduced.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Attractor-like Dynamics in Belief Updating in Schizophrenia</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/44/9471?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Subjects with a diagnosis of schizophrenia (Scz) overweight unexpected evidence in probabilistic inference: such evidence becomes &quot;aberrantly salient.&quot; A neurobiological explanation for this effect is that diminished synaptic gain (e.g., hypofunction of cortical NMDARs) in Scz destabilizes quasi-stable neuronal network states (or &quot;attractors&quot;). This attractor instability account predicts that (1) Scz would overweight unexpected evidence but underweight consistent evidence, (2) belief updating would be more vulnerable to stochastic fluctuations in neural activity, and (3) these effects would correlate. Hierarchical Bayesian belief updating models were tested in two independent datasets (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 80 male and &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 167 female) comprising human subjects with Scz, and both clinical and nonclinical controls (some tested when unwell and on recovery) performing the &quot;probability estimates&quot; version of the beads task (a probabilistic inference task). Models with a standard learning rate, or including a parameter increasing updating to &quot;disconfirmatory evidence,&quot; or a parameter encoding belief instability were formally compared. The &quot;belief instability&quot; model (based on the principles of attractor dynamics) had most evidence in all groups in both datasets. Two of four parameters differed between Scz and nonclinical controls in each dataset: belief instability and response stochasticity. These parameters correlated in both datasets. Furthermore, the clinical controls showed similar parameter distributions to Scz when unwell, but were no different from controls once recovered. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that attractor network instability contributes to belief updating abnormalities in Scz, and suggest that similar changes may exist during acute illness in other psychiatric conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Subjects with a diagnosis of schizophrenia (Scz) make large adjustments to their beliefs following unexpected evidence, but also smaller adjustments than controls following consistent evidence. This has previously been construed as a bias toward &quot;disconfirmatory&quot; information, but a more mechanistic explanation may be that in Scz, neural firing patterns (&quot;attractor states&quot;) are less stable and hence easily altered in response to both new evidence and stochastic neural firing. We model belief updating in Scz and controls in two independent datasets using a hierarchical Bayesian model, and show that all subjects are best fit by a model containing a belief instability parameter. Both this and a response stochasticity parameter are consistently altered in Scz, as the unstable attractor hypothesis predicts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Skillful storytelling helps listeners understand the essence of complex concepts and ideas in meaningful and often personal ways. For this reason, storytelling is being embraced by scientists who not only want to connect more authentically with their audiences, but also want to understand how the brain processes this powerful form of communication. Here we present part of a conversation between a group of scientists actively engaged with the practice and/or the science of storytelling. We highlight the brain networks involved in the telling and hearing of stories and show how storytelling is being used well beyond the realm of public communication to add a deeper dimension to communication with our students and colleagues, as well as helping to make our profession more inclusive.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: New observations in neuroscience using superresolution microscopy</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/44/9459?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Superresolution microscopy (SM) techniques are among the revolutionary methods for molecular and cellular observations in the 21&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; century. SM techniques overcome optical limitations, and several new observations using SM lead us to expect these techniques to have a large impact on neuroscience in the near future. Several types of SM have been developed, including structured illumination microscopy (SIM), stimulated emission depletion microscopy (STED), and photoactivated localization microscopy (PALM)/stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (STORM), each with special features. In this Minisymposium, experts in these different types of SM discuss the new structural and functional information about specific important molecules in neuroscience that has been gained with SM. Using these techniques, we have revealed novel mechanisms of endocytosis in nerve growth, fusion pore dynamics, and described quantitative new properties of excitatory and inhibitory synapses. Additional powerful techniques, including single molecule-guided Bayesian localization SM (SIMBA) and expansion microscopy (ExM), alone or combined with super-resolution observation, are also introduced in this session.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Specific Basal Forebrain-Cortical Cholinergic Circuits Coordinate Cognitive Operations</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/44/9446?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Based on recent molecular genetics, as well as functional and quantitative anatomical studies, the basal forebrain (BF) cholinergic projections, once viewed as a diffuse system, are emerging as being remarkably specific in connectivity. Acetylcholine (ACh) can rapidly and selectively modulate activity of specific circuits and ACh release can be coordinated in multiple areas that are related to particular aspects of cognitive processing. This review discusses how a combination of multiple new approaches with more established techniques are being used to finally reveal how cholinergic neurons, together with other BF neurons, provide temporal structure for behavior, contribute to local cortical state regulation, and coordinate activity between different functionally related cortical circuits. ACh selectively modulates dynamics for encoding and attention within individual cortical circuits, allows for important transitions during sleep, and shapes the fidelity of sensory processing by changing the correlation structure of neural firing. The importance of this system for integrated and fluid behavioral function is underscored by its disease-modifying role; the demise of BF cholinergic neurons has long been established in Alzheimer's disease and recent studies have revealed the involvement of the cholinergic system in modulation of anxiety-related circuits. Therefore, the BF cholinergic system plays a pivotal role in modulating the dynamics of the brain during sleep and behavior, as foretold by the intricacies of its anatomical map.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The ability to anticipate and respond appropriately to the challenges and opportunities present in our environments is critical for adaptive behavior. Recent methodological innovations have led to substantial advances in our understanding of the neurocircuitry supporting such motivated behavior in adulthood. However, the neural circuits and cognitive processes that enable threat- and reward-motivated behavior undergo substantive changes over the course of development, and these changes are less well understood. In this article, we highlight recent research in human and animal models demonstrating how developmental changes in prefrontal-subcortical neural circuits give rise to corresponding changes in the processing of threats and rewards from infancy to adulthood. We discuss how these developmental trajectories are altered by experiential factors, such as early-life stress, and highlight the relevance of this research for understanding the developmental onset and treatment of psychiatric disorders characterized by dysregulation of motivated behavior.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Risk for stress-sensitive psychopathologies differs in men and women, yet little is known about sex-dependent effects of stress on cellular structure and function in corticolimbic regions implicated in these disorders. Determining how stress influences these regions in males and females will deepen our understanding of the mechanisms underlying sex-biased psychopathology. Here, we discuss sex differences in CRF regulation of arousal and cognition, glucocorticoid modulation of amygdalar physiology and alcohol consumption, the age-dependent impact of social stress on prefrontal pyramidal cell excitability, stress effects on the prefrontal parvalbumin system in relation to emotional behaviors, contributions of stress and gonadal hormones to stress effects on prefrontal glia, and alterations in corticolimbic structure and function after cessation of chronic stress. These studies demonstrate that, while sex differences in stress effects may be nuanced, nonuniform, and nonlinear, investigations of these differences are nonetheless critical for developing effective, sex-specific treatments for psychological disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The gut microbiota has emerged as a critical player in shaping and modulating brain function and has been shown to influence numerous behaviors, including anxiety and depression-like behaviors, sociability, and cognition. However, the effects of the gut microbiota on specific disorders associated with thalamo-cortico-basal ganglia circuits, ranging from compulsive behavior and addiction to altered sensation and motor output, are only recently being explored. Wholesale depletion and alteration of gut microbial communities in rodent models of disorders, such as Parkinson's disease, autism, and addiction, robustly affect movement and motivated behavior. A new frontier therefore lies in identifying specific microbial alterations that affect these behaviors and understanding the underlying mechanisms of action. Comparing alterations in gut microbiota across multiple basal-ganglia associated disease states allows for identification of common mechanistic pathways that may interact with distinct environmental and genetic risk factors to produce disease-specific outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/44/9402?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Motor and premotor cortices are crucial for the control of movements. However, we still know little about how these areas contribute to higher-order motor control, such as deciding which movements to make and when to make them. Here we focus on rodent studies and review recent findings, which suggest that—in addition to motor control—neurons in motor cortices play a role in sensory integration, behavioral strategizing, working memory, and decision-making. We suggest that these seemingly disparate functions may subserve an evolutionarily conserved role in sensorimotor cognition and that further study of rodent motor cortices could make a major contribution to our understanding of the evolution and function of the mammalian frontal cortex.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/44/9390?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In the 1960s, Evarts first recorded the activity of single neurons in motor cortex of behaving monkeys (Evarts, 1968). In the 50 years since, great effort has been devoted to understanding how single neuron activity relates to movement. Yet these single neurons exist within a vast network, the nature of which has been largely inaccessible. With advances in recording technologies, algorithms, and computational power, the ability to study these networks is increasing exponentially. Recent experimental results suggest that the dynamical properties of these networks are critical to movement planning and execution. Here we discuss this dynamical systems perspective and how it is reshaping our understanding of the motor cortices. Following an overview of key studies in motor cortex, we discuss techniques to uncover the &quot;latent factors&quot; underlying observed neural population activity. Finally, we discuss efforts to use these factors to improve the performance of brain–machine interfaces, promising to make these findings broadly relevant to neuroengineering as well as systems neuroscience.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Localizing the sources of stimuli is essential. Most organisms cannot eat, mate, or escape without knowing where the relevant stimuli originate. For many, if not most, animals, olfaction plays an essential role in search. While microorganismal chemotaxis is relatively well understood, in larger animals the algorithms and mechanisms of olfactory search remain mysterious. In this symposium, we will present recent advances in our understanding of olfactory search in flies and rodents. Despite their different sizes and behaviors, both species must solve similar problems, including meeting the challenges of turbulent airflow, sampling the environment to optimize olfactory information, and incorporating odor information into broader navigational systems.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The greatest unmet therapeutic need in Parkinson's disease (PD) is a treatment that slows the relentless progression of the symptoms and the neurodegenerative process. This review highlights the utility of genetics to understand the pathogenic mechanisms and develop novel therapeutic approaches for PD. The focus is on strategies provided by genetic studies: notably via the reduction and clearance of α-synuclein, inhibition of LRRK2 kinase activity, and modulation of glucocerebrosidase-related substrates. In addition, the critical role of precompetitive public-private partnerships in supporting trial design optimization, overall drug development, and regulatory approvals is illustrated. With these great advances, the promise of developing transformative therapies that halt or slow disease progression is a tangible goal.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: A neural field model for color perception unifying assimilation and contrast. (arXiv:1810.12898v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1810.12898</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;We propose a neural field model of color perception in context, for the
visual area V1 in the cortex. This model reconciles into a common framework two
opposing perceptual phenomena, simultaneous contrast and chromatic
assimilation. Previous works showed that they act simultaneously, and can
produce larger shifts in color matching when acting in synergy with a spatial
pattern. At some point in an image,the color perceptually seems more similar to
that of the adjacent locations, while being more dissimilar from that of remote
neighbors. The influence of neighbors hence reverses its nature above some
characteristic scale. Our model fully exploits the balance between attraction
and repulsion in color space, combined at small or large scales in physical
space. For that purpose we rely on the opponent color theory introduced by
Hering, and suppose a hypercolumnar structure coding for colors. At some neural
mass, the pointwise influence of neighbors is spatially integrated to obtain
the final effect that we call a color sensation. Alongside this neural field
model, we describe the search for a color match in asymmetric matching
experiments as a mathematical projector. We validate it by fitting the
parameters of the model to data from (Monnier and Shevell, 2004) and (Monnier,
2008) and our own data. All the results show that we are able to explain the
nonlinear behavior of the observed shifts along one or two dimensions in color
space, which cannot be done using a simple linear model.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Modelling visual-vestibular integration and behavioural adaptation in the driving simulator. (arXiv:1810.12441v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1810.12441</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;It is well established that not only vision but also other sensory modalities
affect drivers' control of their vehicles, and that drivers adapt over time to
persistent changes in sensory cues, for example in driving simulators, but the
mechanisms underlying these behavioural phenomena are poorly understood. Here,
we consider the existing literature on how driver steering in slalom tasks is
affected by down-scaling of vestibular cues, and propose a driver model that
can explain the empirically observed effects: Initially decreased task
performance and increased steering effort, and partial reversal of these
effects with prolonged task exposure. Unexpectedly, the model also reproduced
another empirical finding: A local optimum for motion down-scaling, where
path-tracking is better than with one-to-one motion cues. Overall, the results
imply that: (1) Drivers make direct use of vestibular information as part of
determining appropriate steering, and (2) motion down-scaling causes a yaw rate
underestimation phenomenon, where drivers behave as if they perceive the
simulated vehicle to rotate more slowly than it is. However, (3) in the slalom
task, limited such underestimation brings a path-tracking benefit. Furthermore,
(4) behavioural adaptation, as empirically observed in slalom tasks, may occur
due to (a) down-weighting of vestibular cues, and/or (b) increased sensitivity
to control errors, in determining when to adjust steering and by how much, but
(c) seemingly not in the form of a full compensatory rescaling of the
down-scaled vestibular input. The analyses presented here provide new insights
and hypotheses about simulator driving, and the developed models can be used to
support research on multisensory integration and behavioural adaptation in both
driving and other task domains.

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Suboptimal community growth mediated through metabolite crossfeeding promotes species diversity in the gut microbiota</title>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Michael A. Henson, Poonam Phalak&lt;/p&gt;

The gut microbiota represent a highly complex ecosystem comprised of approximately 1000 species that forms a mutualistic relationship with the human host. A critical attribute of the microbiota is high species diversity, which provides system robustness through overlapping and redundant metabolic capabilities. The gradual loss of bacterial diversity has been associated with a broad array of gut pathologies and diseases including malnutrition, obesity, diabetes and inflammatory bowel disease. We formulated an &lt;i&gt;in silico&lt;/i&gt; community model of the gut microbiota by combining genome-scale metabolic reconstructions of 28 representative species to explore the relationship between species diversity and community growth. While the individual species offered a broad range of metabolic capabilities, communities optimized for maximal growth on simulated Western and high-fiber diets had low diversities and imbalances in short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) synthesis characterized by acetate overproduction. Community flux variability analysis performed with the 28-species model and a reduced 20-species model suggested that enhanced species diversity and more balanced SCFA production were achievable at suboptimal growth rates. We developed a simple method for constraining species abundances to sample the growth-diversity tradeoff and used the 20-species model to show that tradeoff curves for Western and high-fiber diets resembled Pareto-optimal surfaces. Compared to maximal growth solutions, suboptimal growth solutions were characterized by higher species diversity, more balanced SCFA synthesis and lower exchange rates of crossfed metabolites between more species. We hypothesized that modulation of crossfeeding relationships through host-microbiota interactions could be an important means for maintaining species diversity and suggest that community metabolic modeling approaches that allow multiobjective optimization of growth and diversity are needed for more realistic simulation of complex communities.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/qMZUBPeCbPA&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

K-Ras, one of the most common small GTPases of the cell, still presents many riddles, despite the intense efforts to unveil its mysteries. Such is the case of its interaction with Calmodulin, a small acidic protein known for its role as a calcium ion sensor. Although the interaction between these two proteins and its biological implications have been widely studied, a model of their interaction has not been performed. In the present work we analyse this intriguing interaction by computational means. To do so, both conventional molecular dynamics and scaled molecular dynamics have been used. Our simulations suggest a model in which Calmodulin would interact with both the hypervariable region and the globular domain of K-Ras, using a lobe to interact with each of them. According to the presented model, the interface of helixes α4 and α5 of the globular domain of K-Ras would be relevant for the interaction with a lobe of Calmodulin. These results were also obtained when bringing the proteins together in a step wise manner with the umbrella sampling methodology. The computational results have been validated using SPR to determine the relevance of certain residues. Our results demonstrate that, when mutating residues of the α4-α5 interface described to be relevant for the interaction with Calmodulin, the interaction of the globular domain of K-Ras with Calmodulin diminishes. However, it is to be considered that our simulations indicate that the bulk of the interaction would fall on the hypervariable region of K-Ras, as many more interactions are identified in said region. All in all our simulations present a suitable model in which K-Ras could interact with Calmodulin at membrane level using both its globular domain and its hypervariable region to stablish an interaction that leads to an altered signalling.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/YNTThHF3Yu8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Gebre, Hamid Safizadeh, Reika Okamoto, Mami Yoshimura, Michael Costanzo, Yoko Yashiroda, Yoshikazu Ohya, Hiroyuki Osada, Minoru Yoshida, Charles Boone, Chad L. Myers&lt;/p&gt;

Chemical-genetic interactions–observed when the treatment of mutant cells with chemical compounds reveals unexpected phenotypes–contain rich functional information linking compounds to their cellular modes of action. To systematically identify these interactions, an array of mutants is challenged with a compound and monitored for fitness defects, generating a chemical-genetic interaction profile that provides a quantitative, unbiased description of the cellular function(s) perturbed by the compound. Genetic interactions, obtained from genome-wide double-mutant screens, provide a key for interpreting the functional information contained in chemical-genetic interaction profiles. Despite the utility of this approach, integrative analyses of genetic and chemical-genetic interaction networks have not been systematically evaluated. We developed a method, called CG-TARGET (Chemical Genetic Translation via A Reference Genetic nETwork), that integrates large-scale chemical-genetic interaction screening data with a genetic interaction network to predict the biological processes perturbed by compounds. In a recent publication, we applied CG-TARGET to a screen of nearly 14,000 chemical compounds in &lt;i&gt;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&lt;/i&gt;, integrating this dataset with the global &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;cerevisiae&lt;/i&gt; genetic interaction network to prioritize over 1500 compounds with high-confidence biological process predictions for further study. We present here a formal description and rigorous benchmarking of the CG-TARGET method, showing that, compared to alternative enrichment-based approaches, it achieves similar or better accuracy while substantially improving the ability to control the false discovery rate of biological process predictions. Additional investigation of the compatibility of chemical-genetic and genetic interaction profiles revealed that one-third of observed chemical-genetic interactions contributed to the highest-confidence biological process predictions and that negative chemical-genetic interactions overwhelmingly formed the basis of these predictions. We also present experimental validations of CG-TARGET-predicted tubulin polymerization and cell cycle progression inhibitors. Our approach successfully demonstrates the use of genetic interaction networks in the high-throughput functional annotation of compounds to biological processes.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/FCTXqDf9Vmg&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1810.12016</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Graphene has the potential to make a very significant impact on society, with
important applications in the biomedical field. The possibility to engineer
graphene-based medical devices at the neuronal interface is of particular
interest, making it imperative to determine the biocompatibility of graphene
materials with neuronal cells. Here we conducted a comprehensive analysis of
the effects of chronic and acute exposure of rat primary cortical neurons to
few-layers pristine graphene (GR) and monolayer graphene oxide (GO) flakes. By
combining a range of cell biology, microscopy, electrophysiology and omics
approaches we characterized the graphene neuron interaction from the first
steps of membrane contact and internalization to the long-term effects on cell
viability, synaptic transmission and cell metabolism. GR/GO flakes are found in
contact with the neuronal membrane, free in the cytoplasm and internalized
through the endolysosomal pathway, with no significant impact on neuron
viability. However, GO exposure selectively caused the inhibition of excitatory
transmission, paralleled by a reduction in the number of excitatory synaptic
contacts, and a concomitant enhancement of the inhibitory activity. This was
accompanied by induction of autophagy, altered Ca2+ dynamics and by a
downregulation of some of the main players in the regulation of Ca2+
homeostasis in both excitatory and inhibitory neurons. Our results show that,
although graphene exposure does not impact on neuron viability, it does
nevertheless have important effects on neuronal transmission and network
functionality, thus warranting caution when planning to employ this material
for neuro-biological applications.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1810.11891</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a complex neurodevelopmental syndrome.
Early diagnosis and precise treatment are essential for ASD patients. Although
researchers have built many analytical models, there has been limited progress
in accurate predictive models for early diagnosis. In this project, we aim to
build an accurate model to predict treatment outcome and ASD severity from
early stage functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scans. The difficulty
in building large databases of patients who have received specific treatments
and the high dimensionality of medical image analysis problems are challenges
in this work. We propose a generic and accurate two-level approach for
high-dimensional regression problems in medical image analysis. First, we
perform region-level feature selection using a predefined brain parcellation.
Based on the assumption that voxels within one region in the brain have similar
values, for each region we use the bootstrapped mean of voxels within it as a
feature. In this way, the dimension of data is reduced from number of voxels to
number of regions. Then we detect predictive regions by various feature
selection methods. Second, we extract voxels within selected regions, and
perform voxel-level feature selection. To use this model in both linear and
non-linear cases with limited training examples, we apply two-level elastic net
regression and random forest (RF) models respectively. To validate accuracy and
robustness of this approach, we perform experiments on both task-fMRI and
resting state fMRI datasets. Furthermore, we visualize the influence of each
region, and show that the results match well with other findings.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1810.11769</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Various neurophysiological and cognitive functions are based on transferring
information between spiking neurons via a complex system of synaptic
connections. In particular, the capacity of presynaptic inputs to influence the
postsynaptic outputs---the efficacy of the synapses---plays a principal role in
all aspects of hippocampal neurophysiology. However, a direct link between the
information processed at the level of individual synapses and the animal's
ability to form memories at the organismal level has not yet been fully
understood. Here, we investigate the effect of synaptic transmission
probabilities on the ability of the hippocampal place cell ensembles to produce
a cognitive map of the environment. Using methods from algebraic topology, we
find that weakening synaptic connections increase spatial learning times,
produce topological defects in the large-scale representation of the ambient
space and restrict the range of parameters for which place cell ensembles are
capable of producing a map with correct topological structure. On the other
hand, the results indicate a possibility of compensatory phenomena, namely that
spatial learning deficiencies may be mitigated through enhancement of neuronal
activity.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Automated segmentation of brain tumors from 3D magnetic resonance images
(MRIs) is necessary for the diagnosis, monitoring, and treatment planning of
the disease. Manual delineation practices require anatomical knowledge, are

describe a semantic segmentation network for tumor subregion segmentation from
3D MRIs based on encoder-decoder architecture. Due to a limited training
dataset size, a variational auto-encoder branch is added to reconstruct the
input image itself in order to regularize the shared decoder and impose
additional constraints on its layers. The current approach won 1st place in the
BraTS 2018 challenge.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1810.11594</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have had great success in many
real-world applications and have also been used to model visual processing in
the brain. However, these networks are quite brittle - small changes in the
input image can dramatically change a network's output prediction. In contrast
to what is known from biology, these networks largely rely on feedforward
connections, ignoring the influence of recurrent connections. They also focus
on supervised rather than unsupervised learning. To address these issues, we
combine traditional supervised learning via backpropagation with a specialized
unsupervised learning rule to learn lateral connections between neurons within
a convolutional neural network. These connections have been shown to optimally
integrate information from the surround, generating extra-classical receptive
fields for the neurons in our new proposed model (CNNEx). Models with optimal
lateral connections are more robust to noise and achieve better performance on
noisy versions of the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets. Resistance to noise can be
further improved by combining our model with additional regularization
techniques such as dropout and weight decay. Although the image statistics of
MNIST and CIFAR-10 differ greatly, the same unsupervised learning rule
generalized to both datasets. Our results demonstrate the potential usefulness
of combining supervised and unsupervised learning techniques and suggest that
the integration of lateral connections into convolutional neural networks is an
important area of future research.

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/40630</link>
	<content:encoded>Physiology’s role in speciation is poorly understood. Motor systems, for example, are widely thought to shape this process because they can potentiate or constrain the evolution of key traits that help mediate speciation. Previously, we found that Neotropical manakin birds have evolved one of the fastest limb muscles on record to support innovations in acrobatic courtship display (Fuxjager et al., 2016a). Here, we show how this modification played an instrumental role in the sympatric speciation of a manakin genus, illustrating that muscle specializations fostered divergence in courtship display speed, which may generate assortative mating. However, innovations in contraction-relaxation cycling kinetics that underlie rapid muscle performance are also punctuated by a severe speed-endurance trade-off, blocking further exaggeration of display speed. Sexual selection therefore potentiated phenotypic displacement in a trait critical to mate choice, all during an extraordinarily fast species radiation—and in doing so, pushed muscle performance to a new boundary altogether.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/40048</link>
	<content:encoded>ApoE4 genotype is the most prevalent and also clinically most important risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD). Available evidence suggests that the root cause for this increased risk is a trafficking defect at the level of the early endosome. ApoE4 differs from the most common ApoE3 isoform by a single amino acid that increases its isoelectric point and promotes unfolding of ApoE4 upon endosomal vesicle acidification. We found that pharmacological and genetic inhibition of NHE6, the primary proton leak channel in the early endosome, in rodents completely reverses the ApoE4 induced recycling block of the ApoE receptor Apoer2/Lrp8 and the AMPA- and NMDA-type glutamate receptors that are regulated by and co-endocytosed in a complex with Apoer2. Moreover, NHE6 inhibition restores the Reelin-mediated modulation of excitatory synapses that is impaired by ApoE4. Our findings suggest a novel potential approach for the prevention of late-onset AD.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/39945</link>
	<content:encoded>The dopamine (DA) hypothesis posits the increase of mesolimbic dopamine levels as a defining commonality of addictive drugs, initially causing reinforcement, eventually leading to compulsive consumption. While much experimental evidence from psychostimulants supports this hypothesis, it has been challenged for opioid reinforcement. Here, we monitor genetically encoded DA and calcium indicators as well as cFos in mice to reveal that heroin activates DA neurons located in the medial part of the VTA, preferentially projecting to the medial shell of the nucleus accumbens (NAc). Chemogenetic and optogenetic manipulations of VTA DA or GABA neurons establish a causal link to heroin reinforcement. Inhibition of DA neurons blocked heroin self-administration, while heroin inhibited optogenetic self-stimulation of DA neurons. Likewise, heroin occluded the self-inhibition of VTA GABA neurons. Together, these experiments support a model of disinhibition of a subset of VTA DA neurons in opioid reinforcement.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Reduced cardiac contractility during heart failure (HF) is linked to impaired Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; release from Ryanodine Receptors (RyRs). We investigated whether this deficit can be traced to nanoscale RyR reorganization. Using super-resolution imaging, we observed dispersion of RyR clusters in cardiomyocytes from post-infarction HF rats, resulting in more numerous, smaller clusters. Functional groupings of RyR clusters which produce Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; sparks (Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; release units, CRUs) also became less solid. An increased fraction of small CRUs in HF was linked to augmented 'silent' Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; leak, not visible as sparks. Larger multi-cluster CRUs common in HF also exhibited low fidelity spark generation. When successfully triggered, sparks in failing cells displayed slow kinetics as Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; spread across dispersed CRUs. During the action potential, these slow sparks protracted and desynchronized the overall Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; transient. Thus, nanoscale RyR reorganization during HF augments Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; leak and slows Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; release kinetics, leading to weakened contraction in this disease.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>The first-wave of transcriptional activation occurs after fertilisation in species-specific patterns. Despite its importance to initial embryonic development, the characteristics of transcription following fertilisation are poorly understood in Aves. Herein, we report detailed insights into the onset of genome activation in chickens. We established that two waves of transcriptional activation occurred after fertilisation and at Eyal-Giladi and Kochav Stage V. We found 1,544 single-nucleotide polymorphisms across 424 transcripts derived from parents in offspring during the early embryonic stages. Surprisingly, only the maternal genome was activated in the zygote, and the paternal genome remained silent until the second-wave, regardless of the presence of a paternal pronucleus or supernumerary sperm in the egg. The identified maternal genes involved in cleavage were replaced by bi-allelic expression. The results demonstrate that only maternal alleles are activated in the chicken zygote upon fertilisation, which could be essential for early embryogenesis and evolutionary outcomes in birds.</content:encoded>

One clade (termed Central Asian outbreak, CAO) dating back to 1974 (95% HPD 1969–1982) subsequently acquired resistance mediating mutations to eight anti-TB drugs. Introduction of standardized WHO-endorsed directly observed treatment, short-course in Karakalpakstan in 1998 likely selected for CAO-strains, comprising 75% of sampled MDR-TB isolates in 2005/2006. CAO-isolates were also identified in a published cohort from Russia (2008–2010). Similarly, the presence of mutations supposed to compensate bacterial fitness deficits was associated with transmission success and higher drug resistance rates. The genetic make-up of these MDR-strains threatens the success of both empirical and standardized MDR-TB therapies, including the newly WHO-endorsed short MDR-TB regimen in Uzbekistan.</content:encoded>

Protein signaling networks are static views of dynamic processes where proteins go through many biochemical modifications such as ubiquitination and phosphorylation to propagate signals that regulate cells and can act as feed-back systems. Understanding the precise mechanisms underlying protein interactions can elucidate how signaling and cell cycle progression occur within cells in different diseases such as cancer. Large-scale protein signaling networks contain an important number of experimentally verified protein relations but lack the capability to predict the outcomes of the system, and therefore to be trained with respect to experimental measurements. Boolean Networks (BNs) are a simple yet powerful framework to study and model the dynamics of the protein signaling networks. While many BN approaches exist to model biological systems, they focus mainly on system properties, and few exist to integrate experimental data in them. In this work, we show an application of a method conceived to integrate time series phosphoproteomic data into protein signaling networks. We use a large-scale real case study from the HPN-DREAM Breast Cancer challenge. Our efficient and parameter-free method combines logic programming and model-checking to infer a family of BNs from multiple perturbation time series data of four breast cancer cell lines given a prior protein signaling network. Because each predicted BN family is cell line specific, our method highlights commonalities and discrepancies between the four cell lines. Our models have a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 0.31 with respect to the testing data, while the best performant method of this HPN-DREAM challenge had a RMSE of 0.47. To further validate our results, BNs are compared with the canonical mTOR pathway showing a comparable AUROC score (0.77) to the top performing HPN-DREAM teams.

	<title>RSS PAP: Inhibitory projections from the inferior colliculus to the medial geniculate body originate from four subtypes of GABAergic cells</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0406-18.2018v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;GABAergic cells constitute 20-40% of the cells that project from the inferior colliculus (IC, a midbrain auditory hub) to the medial geniculate body (MG, the main auditory nucleus of the thalamus). Four subtypes of GABAergic IC cells have been identified based on their association with perineuronal nets (PNs) and dense rings of axosomatic terminals expressing vesicular glutamate transporter 2 (VGLUT2 rings). These subtypes differ in their soma size and distribution within the IC. Based on previous work emphasizing large GABAergic cells as the origin of GABAergic IC-MG projections, we hypothesized that GABAergic IC cells surrounded by PNs and VGLUT2 rings, which tend to have larger somas, were more likely to project to the MG than smaller cells lacking these extracellular markers. Here, we injected retrograde tract tracers into the MG of guinea pigs of either sex and analyzed retrogradely labeled GABAergic cells in the ipsilateral IC for soma size and association with PNs and/or VGLUT2 rings. We found a range of GABAergic soma sizes present within the IC-MG pathway, which were reflective of the full range of GABAergic soma sizes present within the IC. Further, we found that all four subtypes of GABAergic IC cells participate in the IC-MG pathway, and that GABAergic cells lacking PNs and VGLUT2 rings were more prevalent within the pathway than would be expected based on their overall prevalence in the IC. These results may provide an anatomical substrate for the multiple roles of inhibition in the IC-MG pathway which have emerged in electrophysiological studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; GABAergic cells constitute a substantial proportion (20-40%) of the cells that project from the inferior colliculus to the auditory thalamus. Previous studies highlight a single subtype of GABAergic colliculothalamic cell characterized by a large soma and dense perisomatic input from glutamatergic boutons. In response to a sound, these cells could provide an inhibitory signal to the thalamus that precedes excitation. Here, we demonstrate that colliculothalamic projections arise from four GABAergic cell subtypes. The predominant subtype has a small soma, suggesting slower inhibition that presumably overlaps the arrival of excitatory inputs to the thalamus. The results suggest extensive opportunity for temporal integration of inhibitory and excitatory inputs, and a wider diversity of functions than previously suggested for inhibitory colliculothalamic projections.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>RSS PAP: nNOS-expressing neurons in the ventral tegmental area and substantia nigra pars compacta</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0381-18.2018v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;GABA neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and substantia nigra pars compact (SNc) play key roles in reward and aversion through their local inhibitory control of dopamine neuron activity and through long-range projections to several target regions including the nucleus accumbens. It is not clear if some of these GABA neurons are dedicated local interneurons or if they all collateralize and send projections externally as well as making local synaptic connections. Testing between these possibilities has been challenging in the absence of interneuron-specific molecular markers. We hypothesised that one potential candidate might be neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS), a common interneuronal marker in other brain regions. To test this, we used a combination of immunolabelling (including antibodies for nNOS that we validated in tissue from nNOS-deficient mice) and cell-type-specific virus-based anterograde tracing in mice. We found that nNOS-expressing neurons, in the parabrachial pigmented (PBP) part of the VTA and the SNc were GABAergic and did not make detectable projections, suggesting they may be interneurons. In contrast, nNOS-expressing neurons in the Rostral Linear Nucleus (RLi) were mostly glutamatergic and projected to a number of regions, including the lateral hypothalamus, the ventral pallidum, and the median raphe nucleus. Taken together, these findings indicate that nNOS is expressed by neurochemically- and anatomically-distinct neuronal sub-groups in a sub-region-specific manner in the VTA and SNc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; GABA neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) play important roles in reward and aversion through their local control of dopamine neuron activity and long-range projections to regions such as the nucleus accumbens. It is not clear if some of these neurons are dedicated interneurons, or if they all project externally and synapse locally. We find that nNOS is expressed by some GABAergic neurons that do not make detectable projections, suggesting that they may be interneurons. In addition, nNOS is expressed by a subgroup of glutamatergic neurons that project to regions including the ventral pallidum and median raphe nucleus. Our study paves the way for future investigation of the function of these molecularly-defined populations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>RSS PAP: Contribution of CD137L to sensory hypersensitivity in a murine model of neuropathic pain</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0218-18.2018v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;CD137L (4-1BBL) is a co-stimulatory molecule whose signaling can promote monocyte/macrophage functions; however, CD137L-mediated microglial response and its role in neuropathic pain remain unknown. We investigated CD137L following peripheral nerve injury-induced neuropathic pain using a spinal nerve L5 transection (L5Tx) murine model in both sexes. First, C57BL/6_CD137L knockout (KO) mice displayed decreased mechanical and diminished heat hypersensitivity compared to wild type (WT) controls, beginning on day 3 to up to day 35 post-L5Tx. Purified anti-mouse CD137L neutralizing monoclonal antibody (0.1 or 0.5 µg) was also used to identify CD137L’s window of action in BALB/c mice. Anti-CD137L antibody was intrathecally administered either from day 0 (before surgery) to day 7 (early treatment), or from day 6 to 13 post-L5Tx (late treatment), and nociceptive thresholds were assessed before surgery to up to day 35 post-surgery. Early treatment with anti-CD137L reduced L5Tx-induced mechanical but not heat hypersensitivity, while later treatment did not alter either sensitivity. Pro- vs. anti-inflammatory responses within the lumbar spinal cord following L5Tx were further evaluated via &lt;i&gt;quantitative real-time&lt;/i&gt; PCR and immunohistochemistry in time-course studies. Following L5Tx, female CD137L KO mice did not show increased iNOS mRNA and had reduced numbers of IL-1β&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cells compared to WT. At 21 days post-surgery, CD137L KO mice had higher total numbers of arginase-1&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cells and arginase-1&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; microglia. Altogether, results indicate that spinal cord CD137L contributes to the development of peripheral nerve injury-induced neuropathic pain, which may be in part mediated through CD137L’s modulation of the pro- and anti-inflammatory balance within the spinal cord.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; To our knowledge, this is the first study investigating the role of CD137L in the development of neuropathic pain. Our results indicate a contributory role of CD137L in the development of peripheral nerve injury-induced sensory hypersensitivity and its modulatory effects on the balance between pro- and anti-inflammatory responses within the spinal cord and microglia. Further investigation of CD137L’s pro-nociceptive effects may result in novel drug targets for neuropathic pain treatment.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1810.11393</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Deep learning has seen remarkable developments over the last years, many of
them inspired by neuroscience. However, the main learning mechanism behind
these advances - error backpropagation - appears to be at odds with
neurobiology. Here, we introduce a multilayer neuronal network model with
simplified dendritic compartments in which error-driven synaptic plasticity
adapts the network towards a global desired output. In contrast to previous
work our model does not require separate phases and synaptic learning is driven
by local dendritic prediction errors continuously in time. Such errors
originate at apical dendrites and occur due to a mismatch between predictive
input from lateral interneurons and activity from actual top-down feedback.
Through the use of simple dendritic compartments and different cell-types our
model can represent both error and normal activity within a pyramidal neuron.
We demonstrate the learning capabilities of the model in regression and
classification tasks, and show analytically that it approximates the error
backpropagation algorithm. Moreover, our framework is consistent with recent
observations of learning between brain areas and the architecture of cortical
microcircuits. Overall, we introduce a novel view of learning on dendritic
cortical circuits and on how the brain may solve the long-standing synaptic
credit assignment problem.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1810.11362</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Epilepsy creates a persistent increase in the probability of spontaneous
seizures. An ictal episode evolves due to acute disturbance of the fine-tuned
balance between excitatory vs. inhibitory inputs within a neural network in
favor of excitation. The current literature that proposes the
activity-dependent disinhibition as a valid mechanism of chronic epilepsy, does
not provide clues on why this mechanism emerges only in epileptic patients and
how the vicious circle resulting of an activity-dependent disinhibition in
over-active ictogenic network would end. A new model, which presents chronic
epilepsy as a disease of faulty architecture of the neural circuit, is
discussed. Wherein; variable genetic or acquired predisposing factors drive
abnormalities in the construction of multiple neural circuits resulting in an
activity-dependent positive feedback excitatory loops which transform normal
neural circuits into ictal foci. Such new mechanism, for igniting an
activity-dependent unstable excitation with subsequent relatively stable
disinhibition, leads to an ictal escape rhythm. The propagation of such
bursting activity occurs either electrochemically via synaptic communication to
remote susceptible circuits, or chemically via a trigger wave which recruits
the non-connected proximal neurons. Termination occurs abruptly when the
inhibitory interneurons functionally recover and reimpose their inhibitory
effect on the ictogenic circuit to transform the escape rhythm into a normal,
under-control output. The proposed model elucidates various enigmatic features
of the disease; and illustrates both the end-result ictogenic mechanism arising
from the wide variety of etiologies of human spontaneous and acquired epilepsy,
and the timing of episodic transitions from normal activity to seizures.

	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Behavioral change is paramount to adaptive behavior. Two ways to achieve alterations in previously established behavior are extinction and overexpectation. The infralimbic (IL) portion of the medial prefrontal cortex controls the inhibition of previously established aversive behavioral responses in extinction. The role of the IL cortex in behavioral modification in appetitive Pavlovian associations remains poorly understood. Here, we seek to determine if the IL cortex modulates overexpectation and extinction of reward learning. Using overexpectation or extinction to achieve a reduction in behavior, the present findings uncover a dissociable role for the IL cortex in these paradigms. Pharmacologically inactivating the IL cortex left overexpectation intact. In contrast, pre-training manipulations in the IL cortex prior to extinction facilitated the reduction in conditioned responding but led to a disrupted extinction retrieval on test drug-free. Additional studies confirmed that this effect is restricted to the IL and not dependent on the dorsally-located prelimbic cortex. Together, these results show that the IL cortex underlies extinction but not overexpectation-driven reduction in behavior, which may be due to regulating the expression of conditioned responses influenced by stimulus–response associations rather than stimulus–stimulus associations.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

Recent studies suggest that deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models show higher representational similarity, compared to any other existing object recognition models, with macaque inferior temporal (IT) cortical responses, human ventral stream fMRI activations and human object recognition. These studies employed natural images of objects. A long research tradition employed abstract shapes to probe the selectivity of IT neurons. If CNN models provide a realistic model of IT responses, then they should capture the IT selectivity for such shapes. Here, we compare the activations of CNN units to a stimulus set of 2D regular and irregular shapes with the response selectivity of macaque IT neurons and with human similarity judgements. The shape set consisted of regular shapes that differed in nonaccidental properties, and irregular, asymmetrical shapes with curved or straight boundaries. We found that deep CNNs (Alexnet, VGG-16 and VGG-19) that were trained to classify natural images show response modulations to these shapes that were similar to those of IT neurons. Untrained CNNs with the same architecture than trained CNNs, but with random weights, demonstrated a poorer similarity than CNNs trained in classification. The difference between the trained and untrained CNNs emerged at the deep convolutional layers, where the similarity between the shape-related response modulations of IT neurons and the trained CNNs was high. Unlike IT neurons, human similarity judgements of the same shapes correlated best with the last layers of the trained CNNs. In particular, these deepest layers showed an enhanced sensitivity for straight versus curved irregular shapes, similar to that shown in human shape judgments. In conclusion, the representations of abstract shape similarity are highly comparable between macaque IT neurons and deep convolutional layers of CNNs that were trained to classify natural images, while human shape similarity judgments correlate better with the deepest layers.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Y2OMH4zdfKQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Structural and dynamic basis of substrate permissiveness in hydroxycinnamoyltransferase (HCT)</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/eW8COxnrm9o/article</link>

Substrate permissiveness has long been regarded as the raw materials for the evolution of new enzymatic functions. In land plants, hydroxycinnamoyltransferase (HCT) is an essential enzyme of the phenylpropanoid metabolism. Although essential enzymes are normally associated with high substrate specificity, HCT can utilize a variety of non-native substrates. To examine the structural and dynamic basis of substrate permissiveness in this enzyme, we report the crystal structure of HCT from Selaginella moellendorffii and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations performed on five orthologous HCTs from several major lineages of land plants. Through altogether 17-&lt;i&gt;μ&lt;/i&gt;s MD simulations, we demonstrate the prevalent swing motion of an arginine handle on a submicrosecond timescale across all five HCTs, which plays a key role in native substrate recognition by these intrinsically promiscuous enzymes. Our simulations further reveal how a non-native substrate of HCT engages a binding site different from that of the native substrate and diffuses to reach the catalytic center and its co-substrate. By numerically solving the Smoluchowski equation, we show that the presence of such an alternative binding site, even when it is distant from the catalytic center, always increases the reaction rate of a given substrate. However, this increase is only significant for enzyme-substrate reactions heavily influenced by diffusion. In these cases, binding non-native substrates ‘off-center’ provides an effective rationale to develop substrate permissiveness while maintaining the native functions of promiscuous enzymes.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/eW8COxnrm9o&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Sex Differences in the Rapid Cell Signaling Mechanisms Underlying the Memory-Enhancing Effects of 17{beta}-Estradiol</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/5/5/ENEURO.0267-18.2018?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Little is known about how 17β-estradiol (E&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) mediates memory formation in males. In ovariectomized (OVX) mice, bilateral dorsal hippocampal (DH) infusion of E&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; enhances memory consolidation in object recognition (OR) and object placement (OP) tasks in a manner dependent on activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and Akt signaling. Here, bilateral DH E&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; infusion enhanced memory consolidation in both tasks among OVX female, gonadally-intact male, and castrated male mice, suggesting comparable facilitation of memory consolidation in both sexes, independent of testicular hormones in males. Contrary to previous reports in OVX mice, E&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; did not increase DH ERK or Akt phosphorylation in males, nor did the ERK inhibitor U0126 [1,4-diamino-2,3-dicyano-1,4-bis (o-aminophenylmercapto) butadiene] prevent E&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; from enhancing memory consolidation among intact and castrated males. These data suggest that ERK activation is not necessary for E&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to enhance memory consolidation in males, and compared with previous reports in females, reveal novel sex differences in the cell-signaling pathways through which E&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; facilitates memory consolidation. To explore the mechanisms underlying E&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-induced memory enhancements in males, phosphorylation of the transcription factor cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) in the DH was assessed. E&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; increased phospho-CREB levels in both sexes, yet U0126 did not block these increases in castrated or intact males, indicating that E&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; regulates CREB phosphorylation in males via an ERK-independent mechanism. Collectively, these findings suggest that the beneficial effects of hippocampal E&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; on memory consolidation in males and females are mediated by different molecular mechanisms, which has important implications for the development of treatments to reduce memory dysfunction in men and women.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Idiosyncratic, Retinotopic Bias in Face Identification Modulated by Familiarity</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/5/5/ENEURO.0054-18.2018?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;The perception of gender and age of unfamiliar faces is reported to vary idiosyncratically across retinal locations such that, for example, the same androgynous face may appear to be male at one location but female at another. Here, we test spatial heterogeneity for the recognition of the &lt;i&gt;identity&lt;/i&gt; of personally familiar faces in human participants. We found idiosyncratic biases that were stable within participants and that varied more across locations for low as compared to high familiar faces. These data suggest that like face gender and age, face identity is processed, in part, by independent populations of neurons monitoring restricted spatial regions and that the recognition responses vary for the same face across these different locations. Moreover, repeated and varied social interactions appear to lead to adjustments of these independent face recognition neurons so that the same familiar face is eventually more likely to elicit the same recognition response across widely separated visual field locations. We provide a mechanistic account of this reduced retinotopic bias based on computational simulations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Although a standard reinforcement learning model can capture many aspects of reward-seeking behaviors, it may not be practical for modeling human natural behaviors because of the richness of dynamic environments and limitations in cognitive resources. We propose a modular reinforcement learning model that addresses these factors. Based on this model, a modular inverse reinforcement learning algorithm is developed to estimate both the rewards and discount factors from human behavioral data, which allows predictions of human navigation behaviors in virtual reality with high accuracy across different subjects and with different tasks. Complex human navigation trajectories in novel environments can be reproduced by an artificial agent that is based on the modular model. This model provides a strategy for estimating the subjective value of actions and how they influence sensory-motor decisions in natural behavior.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/c92ynP6WQ2o&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>RSS PAP: Electrical microstimulation of visual cerebral cortex elevates psychophysical detection thresholds</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0311-18.2018v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Sensory prostheses can restore aspects of natural sensation by delivering electrical current directly into sensory circuits. An effective sensory prosthetic should be capable of generating reliable real-time perceptual signals for hours each day over many years. However, we still know little regarding the stability of percepts produced by electrical microstimulation of cerebral sensory cortex when stimulation is delivered repeatedly over long periods. Developing methods that yield highly sensitive and reliable assessments of a subject’s sensitivity to stimulation is important for developing prosthetic devices that can mimic the constant stream of information inherent in daily experience. Here, we trained rhesus monkeys to report electrical microstimulation of their primary visual cortex (V1) and measured how repeated stimulation affected the minimal electrical current needed to generate a percept (behavioral detection threshold). Using adaptive staircase procedures with a two-alternative forced-choice detection task, we obtained highly reliable detection threshold measures with as few as 100 trials. Using either chronically implanted or acutely inserted microelectrodes, we found that repeated electrical microstimulation elevated detection thresholds, with effects persisting between daily testing sessions. Our results demonstrate task designs that can support rapid and reliable measurements of detection thresholds, and point to the need for validation that detection thresholds in targeted structures will be sufficiently stable in the face of the amount of chronic stimulation that will be required for effective sensory prosthetics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Delivering electrical current into sensory brain areas could enable those with compromised sensory systems to partially recover lost senses. Whether repeated stimulation of central sites in the brain changes the ability of the stimulated site to support perception remains unresolved. We present methods for rapid, bias-free and repeatable measures of behavioral thresholds for detecting microstimulation and show that repeated electrical stimulation of visual cortex impairs the ability of monkeys to perceive that stimulation. The results have important implications for the development and use of sensory prosthetics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>RSS PAP: Orexinergic modulation of spinal motor activity in the neonatal mouse spinal cord</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0226-18.2018v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>ABSTRACT&lt;p&gt;The role of orexin during development, and especially in terms of spinal cord function, is not well understood. It is for this reason that we focused on the network actions of orexin during the first week of development. We found that orexinergic fibres were present in the lumbar spinal cord of P0-3 mice. The fibres were expressed mainly in the dorsal horn, but occasional fibres were observed in the ventral horn. Both Orexin A (OXA) and Orexin B (OXB) increased the motoneurons (MNs) tonic neurogram discharge. However, only OXA was found to significantly increase spontaneous bursting activity and the frequency of fictive locomotor bursts. We show that OXA is able to act directly onto MNs. To test the contribution of the recurrent MN collaterals we blocked the nicotinic cholinergic drive and observed that OXA retained its ability to increase fictive locomotor activity. Additionally, we recorded neurograms from ventral lateral funiculi (VLF), where OXA had no effect on population discharge. These effects were also confirmed by recording from descending commissural interneurons via patch recordings. The loci of OXA’s effects were further investigated in a dorsal horn removed preparation where OXA also shows an increase in the discharge from ventral root neurograms but no increase in frequency of spontaneous or fictive locomotion burst activity. In summary, multiple lines of evidence from our work demonstrate the robust effects of orexins on spinal cord networks and MNs at the time of birth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Orexinergic cell recordings show that the cell population is highly active during locomotion. In this study, we show that during the first neonatal week, orexin fibres and receptors are present within the spinal cord and that orexins can affect spinal locomotor circuitry. We examine their effects on motoneuron firing and commissural interneurons. Overall, our work establishes that the orexin family contributes to the control of spinal motor function.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Adaptation and Inhibition Control Pathological Synchronization in a Model of Focal Epileptic Seizure</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/5/5/ENEURO.0019-18.2018?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Pharmacoresistant epilepsy is a common neurological disorder in which increased neuronal intrinsic excitability and synaptic excitation lead to pathologically synchronous behavior in the brain. In the majority of experimental and theoretical epilepsy models, epilepsy is associated with reduced inhibition in the pathological neural circuits, yet effects of intrinsic excitability are usually not explicitly analyzed. Here we present a novel neural mass model that includes intrinsic excitability in the form of spike-frequency adaptation in the excitatory population. We validated our model using local field potential (LFP) data recorded from human hippocampal/subicular slices. We found that synaptic conductances and slow adaptation in the excitatory population both play essential roles for generating seizures and pre-ictal oscillations. Using bifurcation analysis, we found that transitions towards seizure and back to the resting state take place via Andronov–Hopf bifurcations. These simulations therefore suggest that single neuron adaptation as well as synaptic inhibition are responsible for orchestrating seizure dynamics and transition towards the epileptic state.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>RSS PAP: Evolution of the muscarinic acetylcholine receptors in vertebrates</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0340-18.2018v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;The family of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChR) consists of five members in mammals, encoded by the &lt;i&gt;CHRM1&lt;/i&gt;-5 genes. The mAChRs are G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) which can be divided into two subfamilies: M2 and M4 receptors coupling to G&lt;sub&gt;i/o&lt;/sub&gt; and M1, M3 and M5 receptors coupling to G&lt;sub&gt;q/11&lt;/sub&gt;. However, despite the fundamental roles played by these receptors their evolution in vertebrates has not yet been fully described. We have combined sequence-based phylogenetic analyses with comparisons of exon-intron organization and conserved synteny in order to deduce the evolution of the mAChR receptors. Our analyses verify the existence of two ancestral genes prior to the two vertebrate tetraploidizations (1R and 2R). After these events, one gene had duplicated resulting in &lt;i&gt;CHRM2&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;CHRM4&lt;/i&gt; and the other had triplicated forming the &lt;i&gt;CHRM1, CHRM3&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;CHRM5&lt;/i&gt; subfamily. All five genes are still present in all vertebrate groups investigated except the &lt;i&gt;CHRM1&lt;/i&gt; gene which has not been identified in some of the teleosts or in chicken or any other birds. Interestingly, the third tetraploidization (3R) that took place in the teleost predecessor resulted in duplicates of all five mAChR genes of which all ten are present in zebrafish. One of the copies of the &lt;i&gt;CHRM2&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;CHRM3&lt;/i&gt; genes and both &lt;i&gt;CHRM4&lt;/i&gt; copies have gained introns in teleosts. Not a single separate (non-tetraploidization) duplicate has been identified in any vertebrate species. These results clarify the evolution of the vertebrate mAChR family and reveal a doubled repertoire in zebrafish, inviting studies of gene neo- and sub-functionalization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance statement&lt;/b&gt; Despite their pivotal physiological role, the evolution of the muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChR) has not yet been resolved. By investigating the genomes of a broad selection of vertebrate species and combining three different types of data, namely sequence based phylogeny, conserved synteny and intron organization, we have deduced the evolution of the mAChR genes in relation to the major vertebrate tetraploidizations (1R, 2R and 3R). Our analyses show that all vertebrate mAChR gene duplications resulted from the tetraploidizations. Interestingly, following 3R, zebrafish doubled its gene number, resulting in the ten mAChR genes present. By knowing how and when the mAChR genes arose, studies of receptor subtype specialization and possible neo- or sub-functionalization can follow.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Neural Dynamics of Reward-Induced Response Activation and Inhibition</title>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy275/5144877?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Reward-predictive stimuli can increase an automatic response tendency, which needs to be counteracted by effortful response inhibition when this tendency is inappropriate for the current task. Here we investigated how the human brain implements this dynamic process by adopting a reward-modulated Simon task while acquiring EEG and fMRI data in separate sessions. In the Simon task, a lateral target stimulus triggers an automatic response tendency of the spatially corresponding hand, which needs to be overcome if the activated hand is opposite to what the task requires, thereby delaying the response. We associated high or low reward with different targets, the location of which could be congruent or incongruent with the correct response hand. High-reward targets elicited larger Simon effects than low-reward targets, suggesting an increase in the automatic response tendency induced by the stimulus location. This tendency was accompanied by modulations of the lateralized readiness potential over the motor cortex, and was inhibited soon after if the high-reward targets were incongruent with the correct response hand. Moreover, this process was accompanied by enhanced theta oscillations in medial frontal cortex and enhanced activity in a frontobasal ganglia network. With dynamical causal modeling, we further demonstrated that the connection from presupplementary motor area (pre-SMA) to right inferior frontal cortex (rIFC) played a crucial role in modulating the reward-modulated response inhibition. Our results support a dynamic neural model of reward-induced response activation and inhibition, and shed light on the neural communication between reward and cognitive control in generating adaptive behaviors.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Transient and Sustained Control Mechanisms Supporting Novel Instructed Behavior</title>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy273/5144876?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;The success of humans in novel environments is partially supported by our ability to implement new task procedures via instructions. This complex skill has been associated with the activity of control-related brain areas. Current models link fronto-parietal and cingulo-opercular networks with transient and sustained modes of cognitive control, based on observations during repetitive task settings or rest. The current study extends this dual model to novel instructed tasks. We employed a mixed design and an instruction-following task to extract phasic and tonic brain signals associated with the encoding and implementation of novel verbal rules. We also performed a representation similarity analysis to capture consistency in task-set encoding within trial epochs. Our findings show that both networks are involved while following novel instructions: transiently, during the implementation of the instruction, and in a sustained fashion, across novel trials blocks. Moreover, the multivariate results showed that task representations in the cingulo-opercular network were more stable than in the fronto-parietal one. Our data extend the dual model of cognitive control to novel demanding situations, highlighting the high flexibility of control-related regions in adopting different temporal profiles.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Visual and Vestibular Selectivity for Self-Motion in Macaque Posterior Parietal Area 7a</title>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy272/5144874?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;We examined the responses of neurons in posterior parietal area 7a to passive rotational and translational self-motion stimuli, while systematically varying the speed of visually simulated (optic flow cues) or actual (vestibular cues) self-motion. Contrary to a general belief that responses in area 7a are predominantly visual, we found evidence for a vestibular dominance in self-motion processing. Only a small fraction of neurons showed multisensory convergence of visual/vestibular and linear/angular self-motion cues. These findings suggest possibly independent neuronal population codes for visual versus vestibular and linear versus angular self-motion. Neural responses scaled with self-motion magnitude (i.e., speed) but temporal dynamics were diverse across the population. Analyses of laminar recordings showed a strong distance-dependent decrease for correlations in stimulus-induced (signal correlation) and stimulus-independent (noise correlation) components of spike-count variability, supporting the notion that neurons are spatially clustered with respect to their sensory representation of motion. Single-unit and multiunit response patterns were also correlated, but no other systematic dependencies on cortical layers or columns were observed. These findings describe a likely independent multimodal neural code for linear and angular self-motion in a posterior parietal area of the macaque brain that is connected to the hippocampal formation.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Cultural variation in the gray matter volume of the prefrontal cortex is moderated by the dopamine D4 receptor gene (DRD4)</title>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy271/5144872?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Recent evidence suggests a systematic cultural difference in the volume/thickness of prefrontal regions of the brain. However, origins of this difference remain unclear. Here, we addressed this gap by adopting a unique genetic approach. People who carry the 7- or 2-repeat (7/2-R) allele of the dopamine D4 receptor gene (&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;DRD4&lt;/span&gt;) are more sensitive to environmental influences, including cultural influences. Therefore, if the difference in brain structure is due to cultural influences, it should be moderated by &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;DRD4&lt;/span&gt;. We recruited 132 young adults (both European Americans and Asian-born East Asians). Voxel-based morphometry showed that gray matter (GM) volume of the medial prefrontal cortex and the orbitofrontal cortex was significantly greater among European Americans than among East Asians. Moreover, the difference in GM volume was significantly more pronounced among carriers of the 7/2-R allele of &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;DRD4&lt;/span&gt; than among non-carriers. This pattern was robust in an alternative measure assessing cortical thickness. A further exploratory analysis showed that among East Asian carriers, the number of years spent in the U.S. predicted increased GM volume in the orbitofrontal cortex. The present evidence is consistent with a view that culture shapes the brain by mobilizing epigenetic pathways that are gradually established through socialization and enculturation.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Precision Inhibitory Stimulation of Individual-Specific Cortical Hubs Disrupts Information Processing in Humans</title>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy270/5144871?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Noninvasive brain stimulation (NIBS) is a promising treatment for psychiatric and neurologic conditions, but outcomes are variable across treated individuals. In principle, precise targeting of individual-specific features of functional brain networks could improve the efficacy of NIBS interventions. Network theory predicts that the role of a node in a network can be inferred from its connections; as such, we hypothesized that targeting individual-specific “hub” brain areas with NIBS should impact cognition more than nonhub brain areas. Here, we first demonstrate that the spatial positioning of hubs is variable across individuals but reproducible within individuals upon repeated imaging. We then tested our hypothesis in healthy individuals using a prospective, within-subject, double-blind design. Inhibition of a hub with continuous theta burst stimulation disrupted information processing during working-memory more than inhibition of a nonhub area, despite targets being separated by only a few centimeters on the right middle frontal gyrus of each subject. Based upon these findings, we conclude that individual-specific brain network features are functionally relevant and could leveraged as stimulation sites in future NIBS interventions.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Use-Dependent Plasticity in Human Primary Motor Hand Area: Synergistic Interplay Between Training and Immobilization</title>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy226/5144868?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Training and immobilization are powerful drivers of use-dependent plasticity in human primary motor hand area (M1&lt;sub&gt;HAND&lt;/sub&gt;). In young right-handed volunteers, corticomotor representations of the left first dorsal interosseus and abductor digiti minimi muscles were mapped with neuronavigated transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to elucidate how finger-specific training and immobilization interact within M1&lt;sub&gt;HAND&lt;/sub&gt;. A first group of volunteers trained to track a moving target on a smartphone with the left index or little finger for one week. Linear sulcus shape-informed TMS mapping revealed that the tracking skill acquired with the trained finger was transferred to the nontrained finger of the same hand. The cortical representations of the trained and nontrained finger muscle converged in proportion with skill transfer. In a second group, the index or little finger were immobilized for one week. Immobilization alone attenuated the corticomotor representation and pre-existing tracking skill of the immobilized finger. In a third group, the detrimental effects of finger immobilization were blocked by concurrent training of the nonimmobilized finger. Conversely, immobilization of the nontrained fingers accelerated learning in the adjacent trained finger during the first 2 days of training. Together, the results provide novel insight into use-dependent cortical plasticity, revealing synergistic rather than competitive interaction patterns within M1&lt;sub&gt;HAND&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Trust pervades nearly every social aspect of our daily lives, and its disruption is a significant factor in mental illness. Research in the field of neuroeconomics has gained a deeper understanding of the neuropsychoeconomic (NPE) underpinnings of trust by combining complementary methodologies from neuroscience, psychology, and economics. However, a coherent model of trust that integrates separate findings under a conceptual framework is still lacking. Here, we sketch out an integrative NPE model that explains how the interactions of psychoeconomic components engage domain-general large-scale brain networks in shaping trust behavior over time.</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Dilution and titration of cell-cycle regulators may control cell size in budding yeast</title>

The size of a cell sets the scale for all biochemical processes within it, thereby affecting cellular fitness and survival. Hence, cell size needs to be kept within certain limits and relatively constant over multiple generations. However, how cells measure their size and use this information to regulate growth and division remains controversial. Here, we present two mechanistic mathematical models of the budding yeast (&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;cerevisiae&lt;/i&gt;) cell cycle to investigate competing hypotheses on size control: inhibitor dilution and titration of nuclear sites. Our results suggest that an inhibitor-dilution mechanism, in which cell growth dilutes the transcriptional inhibitor Whi5 against the constant activator Cln3, can facilitate size homeostasis. This is achieved by utilising a positive feedback loop to establish a fixed size threshold for the Start transition, which efficiently couples cell growth to cell cycle progression. Yet, we show that inhibitor dilution cannot reproduce the size of mutants that alter the cell’s overall ploidy and &lt;i&gt;WHI5&lt;/i&gt; gene copy number. By contrast, size control through titration of Cln3 against a constant number of genomic binding sites for the transcription factor SBF recapitulates both size homeostasis and the size of these mutant strains. Moreover, this model produces an imperfect ‘sizer’ behaviour in G1 and a ‘timer’ in S/G2/M, which combine to yield an ‘adder’ over the whole cell cycle; an observation recently made in experiments. Hence, our model connects these phenomenological data with the molecular details of the cell cycle, providing a systems-level perspective of budding yeast size control.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/96FIxHm1CYc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Thermodynamics dictates the structure and function of metabolism. Redox reactions drive cellular energy and material flow. Hence, accurately quantifying the thermodynamics of redox reactions should reveal design principles that shape cellular metabolism. However, only few redox potentials have been measured, and mostly with inconsistent experimental setups. Here, we develop a quantum chemistry approach to calculate redox potentials of biochemical reactions and demonstrate our method predicts experimentally measured potentials with unparalleled accuracy. We then calculate the potentials of all redox pairs that can be generated from biochemically relevant compounds and highlight fundamental trends in redox biochemistry. We further address the question of why NAD/NADP are used as primary electron carriers, demonstrating how their physiological potential range fits the reactions of central metabolism and minimizes the concentration of reactive carbonyls. The use of quantum chemistry can revolutionize our understanding of biochemical phenomena by enabling fast and accurate calculation of thermodynamic values.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/fxBdh4lAOFc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Connectome of the Suprachiasmatic Nucleus: New Evidence of the Core-Shell Relationship</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/5/5/ENEURO.0205-18.2018?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A brain clock, constituted of ~20,000 peptidergically heterogeneous neurons, is located in the hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN). While many peptidergic cell types have been identified, little is known about the connections among these neurons in mice. We first sought to identify contacts among major peptidergic cell types in the SCN using triple-label fluorescent immunocytochemistry (ICC). To this end, contacts among vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP), gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP), and calretinin (CALR) cells of the core, and arginine vasopressin (AVP) and met-enkephalin (ENK) cells of the shell were analyzed. Some core-to-shell and shell-to-core communications are specialized. We found that in wild-type (WT) mice, AVP fibers make extremely sparse contacts onto VIP neurons but contacts in the reverse direction are numerous. In contrast, AVP fibers make more contacts onto GRP neurons than conversely. For the other cell types tested, largely reciprocal connections are made. These results point to peptidergic cell type-specific communications between core and shell SCN neurons. To further understand the impact of VIP-to-AVP communication, we next explored the SCN in VIP-deficient mice (VIP-KO). In these animals, AVP expression is markedly reduced in the SCN, but it is not altered in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) and supraoptic nucleus (SON). Surprisingly, in VIP-KO mice, the number of AVP appositions onto other peptidergic cell types is not different from controls. Colchicine administration, which blocks AVP transport, restored the numbers of AVP neurons in VIP-KO to that of WT littermates. The results indicate that VIP has an important role in modulating AVP expression levels in the SCN in this mouse.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Zic4-Lineage Cells Increase Their Contribution to Visual Thalamic Nuclei during Murine Embryogenesis If They Are Homozygous or Heterozygous for Loss of Pax6 Function</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/5/5/ENEURO.0367-18.2018?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Our aim was to study the mechanisms that contribute to the development of discrete thalamic nuclei during mouse embryogenesis (both sexes included). We characterized the expression of the transcription factor coding gene &lt;i&gt;Zic4&lt;/i&gt; and the distribution of cells that expressed &lt;i&gt;Zic4&lt;/i&gt; in their lineage. We used genetic fate mapping to show that &lt;i&gt;Zic4&lt;/i&gt;-lineage cells mainly contribute to a subset of thalamic nuclei, in particular the lateral geniculate nuclei (LGNs), which are crucial components of the visual pathway. We observed that almost all &lt;i&gt;Zic4&lt;/i&gt;-lineage diencephalic progenitors express the transcription factor Pax6 at variable location-dependent levels. We used conditional mutagenesis to delete either one or both copies of &lt;i&gt;Pax6&lt;/i&gt; from &lt;i&gt;Zic4&lt;/i&gt;-lineage cells. We found that &lt;i&gt;Zic4&lt;/i&gt;-lineage cells carrying either homozygous or heterozygous loss of &lt;i&gt;Pax6&lt;/i&gt; contributed in abnormally high numbers to one or both of the main lateral geniculate nuclei (LGNs). This could not be attributed to a change in cell production and was likely due to altered sorting of thalamic cells. Our results indicate that positional information encoded by the levels of Pax6 in diencephalic progenitors is an important determinant of the eventual locations of their daughter cells.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: As Soon as You Taste It: Evidence for Sequential and Parallel Processing of Gustatory Information</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/5/5/ENEURO.0269-18.2018?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;The quick and reliable detection and identification of a tastant in the mouth regulate nutrient uptake and toxin expulsion. Consistent with the pivotal role of the gustatory system, taste category information (e.g., sweet, salty) is represented during the earliest phase of the taste-evoked cortical response (Crouzet et al., 2015), and different tastes are perceived and responded to within only a few hundred milliseconds, in rodents (Perez et al., 2013) and humans (Bujas, 1935). Currently, it is unknown whether taste detection and discrimination are sequential or parallel processes, i.e., whether you know what it is as soon as you taste it. To investigate the sequence of processing steps involved in taste perceptual decisions, participants tasted sour, salty, bitter, and sweet solutions and performed a taste-detection and a taste-discrimination task. We measured response times (RTs) and 64-channel scalp electrophysiological recordings and tested the link between the timing of behavioral decisions and the timing of neural taste representations determined with multivariate pattern analyses. Irrespective of taste and task, neural decoding onset and behavioral RTs were strongly related, demonstrating that differences between taste judgments are reflected early during chemosensory encoding. Neural and behavioral detection times were faster for the iso-hedonic salty and sour tastes than their discrimination time. No such latency difference was observed for sweet and bitter, which differ hedonically. Together, these results indicate that the human gustatory system detects a taste faster than it discriminates between tastes, yet hedonic computations may run in parallel (Perez et al., 2013) and facilitate taste identification.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Role of the K+-Cl- Cotransporter KCC2a Isoform in Mammalian Respiration at Birth</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/5/5/ENEURO.0264-18.2018?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;In central respiratory circuitry, synaptic excitation is responsible for synchronizing neuronal activity in the different respiratory rhythm phases, whereas chloride-mediated inhibition is important for shaping the respiratory pattern itself. The potassium chloride cotransporter KCC2, which serves to maintain low intraneuronal Cl&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt; concentration and thus render chloride-mediated synaptic signaling inhibitory, exists in two isoforms, KCC2a and KCC2b. KCC2 is essential for functional breathing motor control at birth, but the specific contribution of the KCC2a isoform remains unknown. Here, to address this issue, we investigated the respiratory phenotype of mice deficient for KCC2a. &lt;i&gt;In vivo&lt;/i&gt; plethysmographic recordings revealed that KCC2a-deficient pups at P0 transiently express an abnormally low breathing rate and a high occurrence of apneas. Immunostainings confirmed that KCC2a is normally expressed in the brainstem neuronal groups involved in breathing (pre-Bötzinger complex, parafacial respiratory group, hypoglossus nucleus) and is absent in these regions in the KCC2a&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt; mutant. However, in variously reduced &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; medullary preparations, spontaneous rhythmic respiratory activity is similar to that expressed in wild-type preparations, as is hypoglossal motor output, and no respiratory pauses are detected, suggesting that the rhythm-generating networks are not intrinsically affected in mutants at P0. In contrast, inhibitory neuromodulatory influences exerted by the pons on respiratory rhythmogenesis are stronger in the mutant, thereby explaining the breathing anomalies observed &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. Thus, our results indicate that the KCC2a isoform is important for establishing proper breathing behavior at the time of birth, but by acting at sites that are extrinsic to the central respiratory networks themselves.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: High-Expanding Regions in Primate Cortical Brain Evolution Support Supramodal Cognitive Flexibility</title>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy268/5144240?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Primate cortical evolution has been characterized by massive and disproportionate expansion of a set of specific regions in the neocortex. The associated increase in neocortical neurons comes with a high metabolic cost, thus the functions served by these regions must have conferred significant evolutionary advantage. In the present series of analyses, we show that evolutionary high-expanding cortex – as estimated from patterns of surface growth from several primate species – shares functional connections with different brain networks in a context-dependent manner. Specifically, we demonstrate that high-expanding cortex is characterized by high internetwork functional connectivity; is recruited flexibly over many different cognitive tasks; and changes its functional coupling pattern between rest and a multimodal task-state. The capacity of high-expanding cortex to connect flexibly with various specialized brain networks depending on particular cognitive requirements suggests that its selective growth and sustainment in evolution may have been linked to an involvement in supramodal cognition. In accordance with an evolutionary-developmental view, we find that this observed ability of high-expanding regions – to flexibly modulate functional connections as a function of cognitive state – emerges gradually through childhood, with a prolonged developmental trajectory plateauing in young adulthood.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Is Human Auditory Cortex Organization Compatible With the Monkey Model? Contrary Evidence From Ultra-High-Field Functional and Structural MRI</title>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy267/5144239?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;It is commonly assumed that the human auditory cortex is organized similarly to that of macaque monkeys, where the primary region, or “core,” is elongated parallel to the tonotopic axis (main direction of tonotopic gradients), and subdivided across this axis into up to 3 distinct areas (A1, R, and RT), with separate, mirror-symmetric tonotopic gradients. This assumption, however, has not been tested until now. Here, we used high-resolution ultra-high-field (7 T) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to delineate the human core and map tonotopy in 24 individual hemispheres. In each hemisphere, we assessed tonotopic gradients using principled, quantitative analysis methods, and delineated the core using 2 independent (functional and structural) MRI criteria. Our results indicate that, contrary to macaques, the human core is elongated perpendicular rather than parallel to the main tonotopic axis, and that this axis contains no more than 2 mirror-reversed gradients within the core region. Previously suggested homologies between these gradients and areas A1 and R in macaques were not supported. Our findings suggest fundamental differences in auditory cortex organization between humans and macaques.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy266/5144216?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;The human cerebral cortex is highly regionalized, and this feature emerges from morphometric gradients in the cerebral vesicles during embryonic development. We tested if this principle of regionalization could be traced from the embryonic development to the human life span. Data-driven fuzzy clustering was used to identify regions of coordinated longitudinal development of cortical surface area (SA) and thickness (CT) (&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;n&lt;/span&gt; = 301, 4–12 years). The principal divide for the developmental SA clusters extended from the inferior–posterior to the superior–anterior cortex, corresponding to the major embryonic morphometric anterior–posterior (AP) gradient. Embryonic factors showing a clear AP gradient were identified, and we found significant differences in gene expression of these factors between the anterior and posterior clusters. Further, each identified developmental SA and CT clusters showed distinguishable life span trajectories in a larger longitudinal dataset (4–88 years, 1633 observations), and the SA and CT clusters showed differential relationships to cognitive functions. This means that regions that developed together in childhood also changed together throughout life, demonstrating continuity in regionalization of cortical changes. The AP divide in SA development also characterized genetic patterning obtained in an adult twin sample. In conclusion, the development of cortical regionalization is a continuous process from the embryonic stage throughout life.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Dopamine Signaling Modulates the Stability and Integration of Intrinsic Brain Networks</title>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy264/5144207?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Dopaminergic projections are hypothesized to stabilize neural signaling and neural representations, but how they shape regional information processing and large-scale network interactions remains unclear. Here we investigated effects of lowered dopamine levels on within-region temporal signal variability (measured by sample entropy) and between-region functional connectivity (measured by pairwise temporal correlations) in the healthy brain at rest. The acute phenylalanine and tyrosine depletion (APTD) method was used to decrease dopamine synthesis in 51 healthy participants who underwent resting-state functional MRI (fMRI) scanning. Functional connectivity and regional signal variability were estimated for each participant. Multivariate partial least squares (PLS) analysis was used to statistically assess changes in signal variability following APTD as compared with the balanced control treatment. The analysis captured a pattern of increased regional signal variability following dopamine depletion. Changes in hemodynamic signal variability were concomitant with changes in functional connectivity, such that nodes with greatest increase in signal variability following dopamine depletion also experienced greatest decrease in functional connectivity. Our results suggest that dopamine may act to stabilize neural signaling, particularly in networks related to motor function and orienting attention towards behaviorally-relevant stimuli. Moreover, dopamine-dependent signal variability is critically associated with functional embedding of individual areas in large-scale networks.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Neuronal Distribution Across the Cerebral Cortex of the Marmoset Monkey (Callithrix jacchus)</title>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy263/5144206?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Using stereological analysis of NeuN-stained sections, we investigated neuronal density and number of neurons per column throughout the marmoset cortex. Estimates of mean neuronal density encompassed a greater than 3-fold range, from &amp;gt;150 000 neurons/mm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; in the primary visual cortex to ~50 000 neurons/mm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; in the piriform complex. There was a trend for density to decrease from posterior to anterior cortex, but also local gradients, which resulted in a complex pattern; for example, in frontal, auditory, and somatosensory cortex neuronal density tended to increase towards anterior areas. Anterior cingulate, motor, premotor, insular, and ventral temporal areas were characterized by relatively low neuronal densities. Analysis across the depth of the cortex revealed greater laminar variation of neuronal density in occipital, parietal, and inferior temporal areas, in comparison with other regions. Moreover, differences between areas were more pronounced in the supragranular layers than in infragranular layers. Calculations of the number of neurons per unit column revealed a pattern that was distinct from that of neuronal density, including local peaks in the posterior parietal, superior temporal, precuneate, frontopolar, and temporopolar regions. These results suggest that neuronal distribution in adult cortex result from a complex interaction of developmental/ evolutionary determinants and functional requirements.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Parcellation of the Human Cerebral Cortex Based on Molecular Targets in the Serotonin System Quantified by Positron Emission Tomography In vivo</title>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy249/5144195?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Parcellation of distinct areas in the cerebral cortex has a long history in neuroscience and is of great value for the study of brain function, specialization, and alterations in neuropsychiatric disorders. Analysis of cytoarchitectonical features has revealed their close association with molecular profiles based on protein density. This provides a rationale for the use of &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;in vivo&lt;/span&gt; molecular imaging data for parcellation of the cortex with the advantage of whole-brain coverage. In the current work, parcellation was based on expression of key players of the serotonin neurotransmitter system. Positron emission tomography was carried out for the quantification of serotonin 1A (5-HT&lt;sub&gt;1A&lt;/sub&gt;, &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;n&lt;/span&gt; = 30) and 5-HT&lt;sub&gt;2A&lt;/sub&gt; receptors (&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;n&lt;/span&gt; = 22), the serotonin-degrading enzyme monoamine oxidase A (MAO-A, &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;n&lt;/span&gt; = 32) and the serotonin transporter (5-HTT, &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;n&lt;/span&gt; = 24) in healthy participants. Cortical protein distribution maps were obtained using surface-based quantification. Based on k-means clustering, silhouette criterion and bootstrapping, five distinct clusters were identified as the optimal solution. The defined clusters proved of high explanatory value for the effects of psychotropic drugs acting on the serotonin system, such as antidepressants and psychedelics. Therefore, the proposed method constitutes a sensible approach towards integration of multimodal imaging data for research and development in neuropharmacology and psychiatry.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>The trade-off between reward and effort is at the heart of most behavioral theories, from ecology to economics. Compared to reward, however, effort remains poorly understood, both at the behavioral and neurophysiological levels. This is important because unwillingness to overcome effort to gain reward is a common feature of many neuropsychiatric and neurological disorders. A recent surge in interest in the neurobiological basis of effort has led to seemingly conflicting results regarding the role of dopamine.</content:encoded>

	<title>RSS PAP: Enlarged Optic Nerve Axons and Reduced Visual Function in Mice with Defective Microfibrils</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0260-18.2018v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Glaucoma is a leading cause of irreversible vision loss due to retinal ganglion cell (RGC) degeneration that develops slowly with age. Elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) is a significant risk factor, though many patients develop glaucoma with IOP in the normal range. Mutations in microfibril-associated genes cause glaucoma in animal models, suggesting the hypothesis that microfibril defects contribute to glaucoma. To test this hypothesis, we investigated IOP and functional/structural correlates of RGC degeneration in mice of either sex with abnormal microfibrils due to heterozygous &lt;i&gt;Tsk&lt;/i&gt; mutation of the fibrilin-1 gene (&lt;i&gt;Fbn1&lt;sup&gt;Tsk&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt; &lt;sup&gt;/+&lt;/sup&gt;). Although IOP was not affected, &lt;i&gt;Fbn1&lt;sup&gt;Tsk&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt; &lt;sup&gt;/+&lt;/sup&gt; mice developed functional deficits at advanced age consistent with glaucoma, including reduced RGC responses in electroretinogram (ERG) experiments. While RGC density in the retina was not affected, the density of RGC axons in the optic nerve was significantly reduced in &lt;i&gt;Fbn1&lt;sup&gt;Tsk&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt; &lt;sup&gt;/+&lt;/sup&gt; mice. However, reduced axon density correlated with expanded optic nerves, resulting in similar numbers of axons in &lt;i&gt;Fbn1&lt;sup&gt;Tsk&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt; &lt;sup&gt;/+&lt;/sup&gt; and control nerves. Axons in the optic nerves of &lt;i&gt;Fbn1&lt;sup&gt;Tsk&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt; &lt;sup&gt;/+&lt;/sup&gt; mice were significantly enlarged and axon diameter was strongly correlated with optic nerve area, as has been reported in early pathogenesis of the DBA/2J mouse model of glaucoma. Our results suggest that microfibril abnormalities can lead to phenotypes found in early-stage glaucomatous neurodegeneration. Thinning of the elastic fiber-rich pia mater was found in &lt;i&gt;Fbn1&lt;sup&gt;Tsk&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt; &lt;sup&gt;/+&lt;/sup&gt; mice, suggesting mechanisms allowing for optic nerve expansion and a possible biomechanical contribution to determination of axon caliber.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Glaucoma is a neurodegenerative disease of the optic nerve that causes vision loss and blindness in tens of millions of people worldwide. Similar to other neurodegenerations, glaucoma onset typically occurs with advanced age. Recent genetic evidence has implicated genes associated with microfibril structure and function as causative for glaucoma. Microfibrils are structures in the extracellular matrix that contribute to tissue biomechanics and regulate signal transduction &lt;i&gt;via&lt;/i&gt; transforming growth factor beta. This study tested the hypothesis that microfibril deficiencies contribute to glaucoma by investigating glaucoma phenotypes in mice known to have defective microfibrils. The results suggest that abnormal microfibrils can cause accelerated expansion of optic nerve axons, potentially resulting in increased susceptibility to pressure-induced damage.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>RSS PAP: Changes in GABAergic transmission to and intrinsic excitability of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) neuron during the estrous cycle in mice: Estrous-cycle dependent changes in GnRH neurons</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0171-18.2018v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons form the final common central output pathway controlling fertility and are regulated by steroid feedback. In females, estradiol feedback action varies between negative and positive; negative feedback typically regulates episodic GnRH release whereas positive feedback initiates a surge of GnRH, and subsequently LH, release ultimately triggering ovulation. During the estrous cycle, changes between estradiol negative and positive feedback occur with cycle stage and time of day, with positive feedback in the late afternoon of proestrus in nocturnal species. To test the hypotheses that synaptic and intrinsic properties of GnRH neurons are regulated by cycle stage and time of day, we performed whole-cell patch-clamp studies of GnRH neurons in brain slices from mice at two times considered negative feedback (diestrous PM and proestrous AM) and during positive feedback (proestrous PM). GABAergic transmission can excite GnRH neurons and was higher in cells from proestrous PM mice than cells from proestrous AM mice and approached traditional significance levels relative to cells from diestrous PM mice. Action potential response to current injection was also greater in cells from proestrous PM mice than the other two groups. Interestingly, the hormonal milieu of proestrous AM provided stronger negative feedback on both GnRH neuron excitability and GABAergic postsynaptic current amplitude than diestrous PM. These observations demonstrate elements of both synaptic and intrinsic properties of GnRH neurons are regulated in a cycle-dependent manner and provide insight into the neurobiological mechanisms underlying cyclic changes in neuroendocrine function among states of estradiol negative and positive feedback.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance statement&lt;/b&gt; Infertility affects 15-20% of couples; failure to ovulate is a common cause. Understanding how the brain controls ovulation is critical for new developments in both infertility treatment and contraception. GnRH neurons are the final output pathway for central control of fertility and produce a signal that ultimately initiates ovulation in response to estradiol positive feedback. We studied how the reproductive cycle regulates both synaptic transmission to GnRH neurons and excitability of these cells. Both GABAergic transmission to GnRH neurons and GnRH neuron excitability are decreased during stages the estrous cycle characterized by negative feedback by gonadal steroids, compared to the late afternoon of proestrus, when positive feedback and ovulation occur.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>RSS PAP: LOTUS inhibits neuronal apoptosis and promotes tract regeneration in contusive spinal cord injury model mice</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0303-18.2018v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Nogo receptor-1 signaling is involved in the limitation of axonal regeneration following spinal cord injury (SCI) through collapsing the growth cone and inhibiting neurite outgrowth. Lateral olfactory tract usher substance (LOTUS), a Nogo receptor antagonist, suppresses these pathological conditions. A previous report demonstrated the positive effects of LOTUS expression on motor function through raphespinal tract regeneration using pan-neuronally LOTUS-overexpressing transgenic mice. However, this report used a hemi-section model, which does not represent the majority of clinical SCI cases, and lacked a detailed histological analysis of other descending tracts. To determine the true therapeutic effects of LOTUS, we used a more clinically relevant contusive SCI model in female transgenic mice. Definitive tracing analyses revealed that LOTUS promoted the extensive regeneration of the reticulospinal tract across the lesion site and suppressed axonal dieback of corticospinal tract (CST). A significant increase in raphespinal tract fibers was seen from the subacute to the chronic phase after the injury, strongly suggesting that LOTUS promoted translesional elongation of this tract. Furthermore, histological analyses revealed that LOTUS had a neuroprotective effect on the injured spinal cord through suppressing cellular apoptosis during the acute phase. These neuroprotective and regenerative effects contributed to significant motor functional recovery and restoration of the motor evoked potential. Therefore, LOTUS application could prove beneficial in the treatment of SCI by promoting axonal regeneration of some descending fibers, reducing axonal dieback of CST fibers and encouraging motor function recovery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Axonal regeneration following spinal cord injury (SCI) is extremely limited due to Nogo receptor (NgR) signaling, which inhibits neurite outgrowth and collapses growth cones. Lateral olfactory tract usher substance (LOTUS), a NgR antagonist, suppresses this inhibition by NgR. Here, we evaluated the therapeutic effects of LOTUS using a clinically relevant contusive SCI model. Our data revealed that LOTUS promoted extensive translesional regeneration of the reticulospinal and raphespinal tracts and rostral regeneration of the corticospinal tract. Furthermore, LOTUS suppressed cellular apoptosis during the acute phase, and these neuroprotective and regenerative effects contributed to significant recovery of motor function and nerve conduction. Therefore, this study suggested that LOTUS could aid the treatment of SCI by promoting axonal regeneration and motor function recovery.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>RSS PAP: Exogenous Neural Precursor Cell Transplantation Results in Structural and Functional Recovery in a Hypoxic-Ischemic Hemiplegic Mouse Model</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0369-18.2018v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>ABSTRACT&lt;p&gt;Cerebral palsy (CP) is a common pediatric neurodevelopmental disorder, frequently resulting in motor and developmental deficits and often accompanied by cognitive impairments. A regular pathobiological hallmark of CP is oligodendrocyte maturation impairment resulting in white matter (WM) injury and reduced axonal myelination. Regeneration therapies based on cell replacement are currently limited, but neural precursor cells (NPCs), as cellular support for myelination, represent a promising regeneration strategy to treat CP, although the transplantation parameters (e.g. timing, dosage, mechanisms) remain to be determined.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We optimised a hemiplegic mouse model of neonatal hypoxia-ischemia that mirrors the pathobiological hallmarks of CP and transplanted NPCs into the corpus callosum (CC), a major white matter structure impacted in CP patients. The NPCs survived, engrafted and differentiated morphologically in male and female mice. Histology and MRI showed repair of lesioned structures. Furthermore, electrophysiology revealed functional myelination of the CC (e.g. restoration of conduction velocity), while Cylinder and CatWalk tests demonstrated motor recovery of the affected forelimb. Endogenous oligodendrocytes, recruited in the CC following transplantation of exogenous NPCs, are the principal actors in this recovery process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lack of differentiation of the transplanted NPCs is consistent with enhanced recovery due to an indirect mechanism, such as a trophic and/or a &quot;bio-bridge&quot; support mediated by endogenous oligodendrocytes. Our work establishes that transplantation of NPCs represents a viable therapeutic strategy for CP treatment, and that the enhanced recovery is mediated by endogenous oligodendrocytes. This will further our understanding and contribute to the improvement of cellular therapeutic strategies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Cerebral palsy (CP) is one of the most common pediatric neurodevelopmental disorders, affecting more than 17 million people worldwide. Current treatment options for CP are largely restricted to rehabilitative approaches that alleviate and mitigate symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Prioritized memory access explains planning and hippocampal replay&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prioritized memory access explains planning and hippocampal replay, Published online: 22 October 2018; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-018-0232-z&quot;&gt;doi:10.1038/s41593-018-0232-z&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;Mattar and Daw propose a normative theory predicting which memories should be accessed at each moment to optimize future decisions. This theory offers a simple explanation for numerous findings about hippocampal replay, bridging planning and learning.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/neuro/rss/current/~4/EtO2pfNefzo&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Trends in Neurosciences: Towards Combinatorial Approaches for Preserving Cognitive Fitness in Aging</title>
	<link>https://www.cell.com/trends/neurosciences/fulltext/S0166-2236(18)30255-8?rss=yes</link>
	<content:encoded>Aging-related cognitive decline represents a critical risk factor for the development of dementia and is associated with global neurophysiological changes. It is imperative to act early, while the neural reserve is still sufficient, to prevent or postpone cognitive decline. Given that no significant modifying pharmacological intervention is available, a focus on pharmacological agents alone seems insufficient. We argue that combinations of different approaches are most effective in stimulating long-lasting molecular changes that restore, promote, and preserve cognition through the modulation of cognitively relevant neurotransmitter systems that ultimately converge in driving neurotrophic signaling.</content:encoded>
