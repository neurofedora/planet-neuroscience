	<title>Annals of Neurology: Outcomes after diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment in a large autopsy series</title>
	<link>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.24903</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h3&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;em&gt;Objective&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/b&gt;: Determine clinical and neuropathological outcomes following a clinical diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment (MCI).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;em&gt;Methods&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/b&gt;: Data were drawn from a large autopsy series (N=1,337) of individuals followed longitudinally from normal or MCI status to death, derived from four Alzheimer's Disease (AD) Centers in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;em&gt;Results&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/b&gt;: Mean follow-up was 7.9 years. Of the 874 individuals ever diagnosed with MCI, final clinical diagnoses were varied: 39.2% died with an MCI diagnosis, 46.8% with a dementia diagnosis, and 13.9% died with a diagnosis of intact cognition. The latter group had pathological features resembling those with a final clinical diagnosis of MCI. In terms of non-AD pathologies, both primary age-related tauopathy (p&amp;lt;0.05) and brain arteriolosclerosis pathology (p&amp;lt;0.001) were more severe in MCI than cognitively intact controls. Among the group that remained MCI until death, Mixed AD neuropathologic changes (ADNC) (≥1 comorbid pathology) was more frequent than Pure ADNC pathology (55% vs. 22%); “suspected non-Alzheimer's pathology” (SNAP) comprised the remaining 22% of cases. A majority (74%) of subjects who died with MCI were without “high” level ADNC, Lewy body disease, or hippocampal sclerosis pathologies; this group was enriched in cerebrovascular pathologies. Subjects who died with dementia and were without severe neurodegenerative pathologies tended to have cerebrovascular pathology and carry the MCI diagnosis for a longer interval.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;em&gt;Interpretation&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/b&gt;: MCI diagnosis usually was associated with comorbid neuropathologies; less than one-quarter of MCI cases showed “pure” AD at autopsy.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Pathogenic role of anti-SRP and anti-HMGCR antibodies in necrotizing myopathies: Myofiber atrophy and impairment of muscle regeneration in necrotizing autoimmune myopathies</title>
	<link>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.24902</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h3&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Objective. Immune mediated necrotizing myopathies (IMNM) may be associated with either anti-SRP or anti-HMGCR antibodies (Abs) and the titer of these Abs is correlated with the disease activity. We investigated if anti-SRP and anti-HMGCR Abs could be involved in muscle damages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods. Muscle biopsies of patients were analyzed for atrophy and regeneration, by measuring the fibers size and by performing immunostaining of neonatal myosin heavy chain. To further understand the role of the Abs in the pathology, we performed muscle cell co-culture with the Abs. Atrophy and regeneration were evaluated based on the myotube surface area as well as gene and cytokine profiles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results. In muscle biopsies of patients with anti-SRP&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and anti-HMGCR&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; Abs, a large number of small fibers corresponding to both atrophic and regenerating fibers were observed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In vitro&lt;/em&gt;, anti-SRP and anti-HMGCR Abs induced muscle fiber atrophy and increased the transcription of &lt;em&gt;MAFbx&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Trim63&lt;/em&gt;. In addition, the muscle fiber atrophy was associated with high levels of inflammatory cytokines: TNF, IL-6 and reactive oxygen species.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the presence of anti-SRP or anti-HMGCR Abs, mechanisms involved in muscle regeneration were also impaired due to a defect of myoblast fusion. This defect was associated with a decreased production of IL-4 and IL-13. The addition of IL-4 and/or IL-13 totally rescued fusion capacity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interpretation. These data show that molecular mechanisms of atrophy and regeneration are affected and contribute to loss of muscle function occurring in IMNM. This emphasizes the potential interest of targeted therapies addressing these mechanisms. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Cusps Enable Line Attractors for Neural Computation. (arXiv:1702.06513v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.06513</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Line attractors in neural networks have been suggested to be the basis of
many brain functions, such as working memory, oculomotor control, head
direction, locomotion, and sensory processing. In recent work, we incorporated
pulse gating into feedforward neural networks and showed that the transmission
of graded information can be viewed as a line attractor in the firing rate of
transiently synchronous populations. While this was revealed in an analysis
using rate models, graded information transfer persisted in spiking neural
networks and was robust to intrinsic and extrinsic noise. Here, using a
Fokker-Planck approach, we show that the gradedness of rate amplitude
information transmission in pulse-gated networks is associated with the
existence of a cusp catastrophe, and that the slow dynamics near the fold of
the cusp underlies the robustness of the line attractor. Understanding the
dynamical aspects of this cusp catastrophe allows us to show how line
attractors can persist in biologically realistic neuronal networks and how the
interplay of pulse gating, synaptic coupling and neuronal stochasticity can be
used to enable attracting one-dimensional manifolds and thus, dynamically
control graded information processing.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Predicting non-linear dynamics: a stable local learning scheme for recurrent spiking neural networks. (arXiv:1702.06463v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.06463</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Brains need to predict how our muscles and body react to motor commands. How
networks of spiking neurons can learn to reproduce these non-linear dynamics,
using local, online and stable learning rules, is an important, open question.
Here, we present a supervised learning scheme for the feedforward and recurrent
connections in a network of heterogeneous spiking neurons. The error in the
output is fed back through fixed random connections with a negative gain,
causing the network to follow the desired dynamics, while an online and local
rule changes the weights; hence we call the scheme FOLLOW (Feedback-based
Online Local Learning Of Weights) The rule is local in the sense that weight
changes depend on the presynaptic activity and the error signal projected onto
the post-synaptic neuron. We provide examples of learning linear, non-linear
and chaotic dynamics, as well as the dynamics of a two-link arm. Using the
Lyapunov method, and under reasonable assumptions and approximations, we show
that FOLLOW learning is uniformly stable, with the error going to zero
asymptotically.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Interactive Web Application for Exploring Matrices of Neural Connectivity. (arXiv:1702.06405v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.06405</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;We present here a browser-based application for visualizing patterns of
connectivity in 3D stacked data matrices with large numbers of pairwise
relations. Visualizing a connectivity matrix, looking for trends and patterns,
and dynamically manipulating these values is a challenge for scientists from
diverse fields, including neuroscience and genomics. In particular,
high-dimensional neural data include those acquired via electroencephalography
(EEG), electrocorticography (ECoG), magnetoencephalography (MEG), and
functional MRI. Neural connectivity data contains multivariate attributes for
each edge between different brain regions, which motivated our lightweight,
open source, easy-to-use visualization tool for the exploration of these
connectivity matrices to highlight connections of interest. Here we present a
client-side, mobile-compatible visualization tool written entirely in
HTML5/JavaScript that allows in-browser manipulation of user-defined files for
exploration of brain connectivity. Visualizations can highlight different
aspects of the data simultaneously across different dimensions. Input files are
in JSON format, and custom Python scripts have been written to parse MATLAB or
Python data files into JSON-loadable format. We demonstrate the analysis of
connectivity data acquired via human ECoG recordings as a domain-specific
implementation of our application. We envision applications for this
interactive tool in fields seeking to visualize pairwise connectivity.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: The network concept of creativity and deep thinking. Applications to social opinion formation and talent support. (arXiv:1702.06342v1 [physics.soc-ph])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.06342</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Our century has unprecedented new challenges, which need creative solutions
and deep thinking. Contemplative, deep thinking became an &quot;endangered species&quot;
in our rushing world of Tweets, elevator pitches and fast decisions. Here we
describe that important aspects of both creativity and deep thinking can be
understood as network phenomena of conceptual and social networks. &quot;Creative
nodes&quot; occupy highly dynamic, boundary spanning positions in social networks.
Creative thinking requires alternating plasticity-dominated and
rigidity-dominated mindsets, which can be helped by dynamically changing social
network structures. In the closing section we present three case studies which
demonstrate the applications of the concept in the Hungarian research student
movement, the Hungarian Templeton Program and the Youth Platform of the
European Talent Support Network. These examples show how talent support
programs can mobilize the power of social networks to enhance creative,
deliberative, deep thinking of talented young minds, influencing social
opinion, leading to community action, and developing charismatic leadership
skills.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.06251</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Identification of intended movement type and movement phase of hand grasp
shaping are critical features for the control of volitional neuroprosthetics.
We demonstrate that neural dynamics during visually-guided imagined grasp
shaping can encode intended movement. We apply Procrustes analysis and LASSO
regression to achieve 72% accuracy (chance = 25%) in distinguishing between
visually-guided imagined grasp trajectories. Further, we can predict the stage
of grasp shaping in the form of elapsed time from start of trial (R2=0.4). Our
approach contributes to more accurate single-trial decoding of higher-level
movement goals and the phase of grasping movements in individuals not trained
with brain-computer interfaces. We also find that the overall time-varying
trajectory structure of imagined movements tend to be consistent within
individuals, and that transient trajectory deviations within trials return to
the task-dependent trajectory mean. These overall findings may contribute to

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.00865</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A major obstacle to understanding neural coding and computation is the fact
that experimental recordings typically sample only a small fraction of the
neurons in a circuit. Measured neural properties are skewed by interactions
between recorded neurons and the &quot;hidden&quot; portion of the network. To properly
interpret neural data, we thus need a better understanding of the relationships
between measured effective neural properties and the true underlying
physiological properties. Here, we focus on how the effective spatiotemporal
dynamics of the synaptic interactions between neurons are reshaped by coupling
to unobserved neurons. We find that the effective interactions from a
pre-synaptic neuron $r'$ to a post-synaptic neuron $r$ can be decomposed into a
sum of the true interaction from $r'$ to $r$ plus corrections from every
directed path from $r'$ to $r$ through unobserved neurons. Importantly, the
resulting formula reveals when the hidden units have---or do not have---major
effects on reshaping the interactions among observed neurons. As a prominent
example, we derive a formula for strong impact of hidden units in random
networks with connection weights that scale with $1/\sqrt{N}$, where $N$ is the
network size---precisely the scaling observed in recent experiments.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1612.07183</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;We revisit the problem of deriving the mean-field values of avalanche
critical exponents in systems with absorbing states. These are well-known to
coincide with those of an un-biased branching process. Here, we show that for
at least 4 different universality classes (directed percolation, dynamical
percolation, the voter model or compact directed percolation class, and the
Manna class of stochastic sandpiles) this common result can be obtained by
mapping the corresponding Langevin equations describing each of these classes
into a random walker confined close to the origin by a logarithmic potential.
Many of the results derived here appear in the literature as independently
derived for individual universality classes or for the branching process.
However, the emergence of non-universal continuously-varying exponent values
--which, as shown here, stems fro the presence of small external driving, that
might induce avalanche merging-- has not been noticed (or emphasized) in the
past. We believe that a simple an unified perspective as the one presented here
can (i) help to clarify the overall picture, (ii) underline the
super-universality of the behavior as well as the dependence on external
driving, and (iii) help avoiding the common existing confusion between
un-biased branching processes (equivalent to a random walker in a balanced
logarithmic potential) and standard (un-confined) random walkers.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.00309</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Critical branching is a theoretical interaction in-between simple units, such
as neuronal elements of the human brain. Zhigalov, Kaplan, and Palva (2016,
Clin. Neurophysiol., 127(8), 2882-2889) revealed that neurofeedback flash
stimulation locked to the phase of high-amplitude occipital alpha influences
stimulus-locked occipital averages in the alpha-band. This feedback also
influences the power scaling of long-range temporal correlations in alpha-band
amplitude fluctuations. Seemingly, neurofeedback influences critical branching
alongside there being an interaction between ongoing neuronal activity and
evoked responses. However, the causal relations between these neuronal
long-range temporal correlations, sustained attention, and any avalanche
dynamics are called into question. Further, uncorrected concerns include false
discovery rate and an objective mathematical error in the precedent (Palva et
al., 2013, Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. U.S.A., 110(9), 3585-3590). An alternative set
of illustrative mathematical principles offers a preliminary fit to the effects
in the data. That is, neurofeedback influences the deterministic contribution
to the single-trial event-related potentials, which each flash evokes,
separately from the oscillatory alpha gain that those flashes cause.
Accordingly, distinct principles of this neurofeedback-related exponential
occipital oscillatory alpha gain and deterministic event-related potential
generation produce micro-behaviours with macroscale consequences: neurofeedback
causally influences power-scaling of long-range temporal correlations without
critical branching.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1507.03730</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Inferring processes or constructs from performance data is a major hallmark
of cognitive psychometrics. Particularly diffusion modeling of response times
(RTs) from correct and erroneous responses using the Wiener distribution has
become a popular measurement tool because it provides a set of psychologically
interpretable parameters. However, an important precondition to identify all of
these parameters, is a sufficient number of RTs from erroneous responses. In
the present article, we show by simulation that the parameters of the Wiener
distribution can be recovered even from tasks yielding very high or even
perfect response accuracies using the shifted Wald distribution. Specifically,
we argue that error RTs can be modeled as correct RTs that have undergone
censoring using techniques from parametric survival analysis. We illustrate our
reasoning by fitting the Wiener and (censored) shifted Wald distribution to RTs
from 6 participants who completed a Go/No-go task. In accordance with our
simulations, diffusion modeling using the Wiener and the shifted Wald
distribution yielded identical parameter estimates when the number of erroneous
responses was predicted to be low. Moreover, the modeling of error RTs as
censored correct RTs substantially improved the recovery of these diffusion
parameters when premature trial timeout was introduced to increase the number
of omission errors. Thus, the censored shifted Wald distribution provides a
suitable means for diffusion modeling in situations when the Wiener
distribution cannot be fitted without parametric constraints.

	<content:encoded>Assessing and analysing individual differences in change over time is of central scientific importance to developmental neuroscience. However, the extant literature is based largely on cross-sectional comparisons, which reflect a variety of influences and cannot directly represent change. We advocate using latent change score (LCS) models in longitudinal samples as a statistical framework to tease apart the complex processes underlying lifespan development in brain and behaviour using longitudinal data. LCS models provide a flexible framework that naturally accommodates key developmental questions as model parameters and can even be used, with some limitations, in cases with only two measurement occasions. We illustrate the use of LCS models with two empirical examples. In a lifespan cognitive training study (COGITO, N=204, two waves) we observe correlated change in brain and behaviour in the context of a high-intensity training intervention. In an adolescent development cohort (NSPN, N=176, two waves) we find greater variability in cortical thinning in males than in females. To facilitate the adoption of LCS by the developmental community, we provide analysis code that can be adapted by other researchers and basic primers in two freely available SEM software packages (lavaan and {Omega}nyx).</content:encoded>

Community-level data, the type generated by an increasing number of metabarcoding studies, is often graphed as stacked bar charts or pie graphs that use color to represent taxa. These graph types do not convey the hierarchical structure of taxonomic classifications and are limited by the use of color for categories. As an alternative, we developed &lt;i&gt;metacoder&lt;/i&gt;, an R package for easily parsing, manipulating, and graphing publication-ready plots of hierarchical data. &lt;i&gt;Metacoder&lt;/i&gt; includes a dynamic and flexible function that can parse most text-based formats that contain taxonomic classifications, taxon names, taxon identifiers, or sequence identifiers. &lt;i&gt;Metacoder&lt;/i&gt; can then subset, sample, and order this parsed data using a set of intuitive functions that take into account the hierarchical nature of the data. Finally, an extremely flexible plotting function enables quantitative representation of up to 4 arbitrary statistics simultaneously in a tree format by mapping statistics to the color and size of tree nodes and edges. &lt;i&gt;Metacoder&lt;/i&gt; also allows exploration of barcode primer bias by integrating functions to run digital PCR. Although it has been designed for data from metabarcoding research, &lt;i&gt;metacoder&lt;/i&gt; can easily be applied to any data that has a hierarchical component such as gene ontology or geographic location data. Our package complements currently available tools for community analysis and is provided open source with an extensive online user manual.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/zgIxP0C4ytU&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Two dynamic regimes in the human gut microbiome</title>

The gut microbiome is a dynamic system that changes with host development, health, behavior, diet, and microbe-microbe interactions. Prior work on gut microbial time series has largely focused on autoregressive models (e.g. Lotka-Volterra). However, we show that most of the variance in microbial time series is non-autoregressive. In addition, we show how community state-clustering is flawed when it comes to characterizing within-host dynamics and that more continuous methods are required. Most organisms exhibited stable, mean-reverting behavior suggestive of fixed carrying capacities and abundant taxa were largely shared across individuals. This mean-reverting behavior allowed us to apply sparse vector autoregression (sVAR)—a multivariate method developed for econometrics—to model the autoregressive component of gut community dynamics. We find a strong phylogenetic signal in the non-autoregressive co-variance from our sVAR model residuals, which suggests niche filtering. We show how changes in diet are also non-autoregressive and that Operational Taxonomic Units strongly correlated with dietary variables have much less of an autoregressive component to their variance, which suggests that diet is a major driver of microbial dynamics. Autoregressive variance appears to be driven by multi-day recovery from frequent facultative anaerobe blooms, which may be driven by fluctuations in luminal redox. Overall, we identify two dynamic regimes within the human gut microbiota: one likely driven by external environmental fluctuations, and the other by internal processes.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/7-KBWx0ACYs&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;h3&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Almost half the cells and 1% of the unique genes found in our bodies are human, the rest are from microbes; predominantly bacteria, archaea, fungi, and viruses. These microorganisms collectively form the human microbiota, with most colonizing the gut. Recent technological advances, open access data-libraries, and application of high throughput sequencing have allowed these microbes to be identified and their contribution to neurological health examined. Emerging evidence links perturbations in the gut microbiota to neurological disease, including disease risk, activity, and progression. This review provides an overview of the recent advances in microbiome research in relation to neuro(auto)immune and neurodegenerative conditions affecting humans such as multiple sclerosis, neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders, Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, Huntington's, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Study design and terminology used in this rapidly evolving, highly multi-disciplinary field are summarized to empower and engage the neurology community in this ‘newly discovered organ.'

	<link>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.24899</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h3&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Objective:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Presurgical language assessment can help minimize damage to eloquent cortex during resective epilepsy surgery. Two methods for presurgical language mapping are functional MRI (fMRI) and direct cortical stimulation (DCS) of implanted subdural electrodes. We compared fMRI results to DCS to help optimize non-invasive language localization and assess its validity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;We studied 19 patients referred for presurgical evaluation of drug-resistant epilepsy. Patients completed 4 language tasks during preoperative fMRI. After subdural electrode implantation, we used DCS to localize language areas. For each stimulation site, we determined whether language positive electrode pairs intersected with significant fMRI activity clusters for language tasks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sensitivity and specificity depended on electrode ROI radii and statistical thresholding. For patients with at least one language positive stimulation site, an auditory description decision task provided the best tradeoff between sensitivity and specificity. For patients with no language positive stimulation sites, fMRI was a dependable method of excluding eloquent language processing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interpretation:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Language fMRI is an effective tool for determining language lateralization prior to electrode implantation, and is especially useful for excluding unexpected critical language areas. It can help guide subdural electrode implantation and narrow the search for eloquent cortical areas via DCS. This article is protected by copyright.

	<content:encoded>&lt;h3&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Congenital myopathies are phenotypically and genetically heterogeneous. We describe homozygous truncating mutations in &lt;em&gt;MYPN&lt;/em&gt; in 2 unrelated families with a slowly progressive congenital cap myopathy. &lt;em&gt;MYPN&lt;/em&gt; encodes the Z-line protein myopalladin implicated in sarcomere integrity. Functional experiments demonstrate that the mutations lead to mRNA defects and to a strong reduction in full-length protein expression. Myopalladin signals accumulate in the caps together with alpha-actinin. Dominant &lt;em&gt;MYPN&lt;/em&gt; mutations were previously reported in cardiomyopathies. Our data uncover that mutations in &lt;em&gt;MYPN&lt;/em&gt; cause either a cardiac or a congenital skeletal muscle disorder through different modes of inheritance.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: An Efficient Method for online Detection of Polychronous Patterns in Spiking Neural Network. (arXiv:1702.05939v1 [cs.NE])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.05939</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Polychronous neural groups are effective structures for the recognition of
precise spike-timing patterns but the detection method is an inefficient
multi-stage brute force process that works off-line on pre-recorded simulation
data. This work presents a new model of polychronous patterns that can capture
precise sequences of spikes directly in the neural simulation. In this scheme,
each neuron is assigned a randomized code that is used to tag the post-synaptic
neurons whenever a spike is transmitted. This creates a polychronous code that
preserves the order of pre-synaptic activity and can be registered in a hash
table when the post-synaptic neuron spikes. A polychronous code is a
sub-component of a polychronous group that will occur, along with others, when
the group is active. We demonstrate the representational and pattern
recognition ability of polychronous codes on a direction selective visual task
involving moving bars that is typical of a computation performed by simple
cells in the cortex. The computational efficiency of the proposed algorithm far
exceeds existing polychronous group detection methods and is well suited for
online detection.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In the present work we analyzed the pupil size behavior of forty subjects
while they read well defined sentences with different contextual predictability
(i.e., regular sentences and proverbs). In general, pupil size increased when
reading regular sentences, but when readers realized that they were reading
proverbs their pupils strongly increase until finishing proverbs' reading. Our
results suggest that an increased pupil size is not limited to cognitive load
(i.e., relative difficulty in processing) because when participants accurately
recognized words during reading proverbs, theirs pupil size increased too. Our
results show that pupil size dynamics may be a reliable measure to investigate
the cognitive processes involved in sentence processing and memory functioning.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: A simple mathematical model inspired by the Purkinje cells: from delayed travelling waves to fractional diffusion. (arXiv:1702.05553v1 [math.AP])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.05553</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Recently, several experiments have demonstrated the existence of fractional
diffusion in the neuronal transmission occurring in the Purkinje cells, whose
malfunctioning is known to be related to the lack of voluntary coordination and
the appearance of tremors.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, a classical mathematical feature is that (fractional) parabolic
equations possess smoothing effects, in contrast with the case of hyperbolic
equations, which typically exhibit shocks and discontinuities.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this paper, we show how a simple toy-model of a highly ramified structure,
somehow inspired by that of the Purkinje cells, may produce a fractional
diffusion via the superposition of travelling waves that solve a hyperbolic
equation.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This could suggest that the high ramification of the Purkinje cells might
have provided an evolutionary advantage of &quot;smoothing&quot; the transmission of
signals and avoiding shock propagations (at the price of slowing a bit such
transmission). Though an experimental confirmation of the possibility of such
evolutionary advantage goes well beyond the goals of this paper, we think that
is intriguing, as a mathematical counterpart, to consider the time fractional
diffusion as arising from the superposition of delayed travelling waves in
highly ramified transmission media.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new link that we propose between time fractional diffusion and hyperbolic
equation also provides a novelty with respect to the usual paradigm relating
time fractional diffusion with parabolic equations in the limit.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The paper is written in such a way to be usable by both the communities of
biologists and mathematicians: to this aim, full explanations of the object
considered and detailed lists of references are provided.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: The Partial Entropy Decomposition: Decomposing multivariate entropy and mutual information via pointwise common surprisal. (arXiv:1702.01591v2 [cs.IT] UPDATED)</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.01591</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Obtaining meaningful quantitative descriptions of the statistical dependence
within multivariate systems is a difficult open problem. Recently, the Partial
Information Decomposition (PID) was proposed to decompose mutual information
(MI) about a target variable into components which are redundant, unique and
synergistic within different subsets of predictor variables. Here, we propose
to apply the elegant formalism of the PID to multivariate entropy, resulting in
a Partial Entropy Decomposition (PED). We implement the PED with an entropy
redundancy measure based on pointwise common surprisal; a natural definition
which is closely related to the definition of MI. We show how this approach can
reveal the dyadic vs triadic generative structure of multivariate systems that
are indistinguishable with classical Shannon measures. The entropy perspective
also shows that misinformation is synergistic entropy and hence that MI itself
includes both redundant and synergistic effects. We show the relationships
between the PED and MI in two predictors, and derive two alternative
information decompositions which we illustrate on several example systems. This
reveals that in entropy terms, univariate predictor MI is not a proper subset
of the joint MI, and we suggest this previously unrecognised fact explains in
part why obtaining a consistent PID has proven difficult. The PED also allows
separate quantification of mechanistic redundancy (related to the function of
the system) versus source redundancy (arising from dependencies between
inputs); an important distinction which no existing methods can address. The
new perspective provided by the PED helps to clarify some of the difficulties
encountered with the PID approach and the resulting decompositions provide
useful tools for practical data analysis across a wide range of application
areas.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In the present work, we develop a deep-learning approach for differentiating
the eye-movement behavior of people with neurodegenerative diseases over

probable Alzheimer's disease when reading a set of well-defined, previously

Using this information we train a set of denoising sparse-autoencoders and
build a deep neural network with these and a softmax classifier. Our results
are very promising and show that these models may help to understand the
dynamics of eye movement behavior and its relationship with underlying
neuropsychological correlates.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1108.2407</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In this manuscript we analyze the collective behavior of mean-field limits of
large-scale, spatially extended stochastic neuronal networks with delays.
Rigorously, the asymptotic regime of such systems is characterized by a very
intricate stochastic delayed integro-differential McKean-Vlasov equation that
remain impenetrable, leaving the stochastic collective dynamics of such
networks poorly understood. In order to study these macroscopic dynamics, we
analyze networks of firing-rate neurons, i.e. with linear intrinsic dynamics
and sigmoidal interactions. In that case, we prove that the solution of the
mean-field equation is Gaussian, hence characterized by its two first moments,
and that these two quantities satisfy a set of coupled delayed
integro-differential equations. These equations are similar to usual neural
field equations, and incorporate noise levels as a parameter, allowing analysis
of noise-induced transitions. We identify through bifurcation analysis several
qualitative transitions due to noise in the mean-field limit. In particular,
stabilization of spatially homogeneous solutions, synchronized oscillations,
bumps, chaotic dynamics, wave or bump splitting are exhibited and arise from
static or dynamic Turing-Hopf bifurcations. These surprising phenomena allow
further exploring the role of noise in the nervous system.

	<content:encoded>While autism and ADHD are considered distinct conditions from a diagnostic perspective, they share some phenotypic features and have high comorbidity. Taking a dual-condition approach might help elucidate shared and distinct neural characteristics. Graph theory was used to analyse properties of cortical thickness structural covariance networks across both conditions and relative to a neurotypical (NT; n=87) group using data from the ABIDE (autism; n=62) and ADHD-200 datasets (ADHD; n=69). This was analysed in a theoretical framework examining potential differences in long and short range connectivity. We found convergence between autism and ADHD, where both conditions show an overall decrease in CT covariance with increased Euclidean distance compared to a neurotypical population. The two conditions also show divergence: less modular overlap between the two conditions than there is between each condition and the neurotypical group. Lastly, the ADHD group also showed reduced wiring costs compared to the autism groups. Our results indicate a need for taking an integrated approach when considering highly comorbid conditions such as autism and ADHD. Both groups show a distance-covariance relation that more strongly favours short-range over long-range. Thus, on some network features the groups seem to converge, yet on others there is divergence.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/110569v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>The ratio between AMPA and NMDA receptors is a key factor governing integrative and plastic properties of excitatory glutamatergic synapses. To determine whether the respective proportions of AMPA and NMDA receptors are similar or vary across a neuron's synapse, we analyzed the variability of NMDA and AMPA currents in quantal responses recorded from neurons located in the nucleus tractus solitarii. We found that the average NMDA to AMPA current ratio strongly differed between recorded neurons and that most of the intra-neuronal current ratio variability was attributable to fluctuations in NMDA current. We next performed computer simulations with a Monte Carlo model of a glutamatergic synapse to estimate the part of AMPA and NMDA currents fluctuations induced by stochastic factors. We found that NMDA current variability mainly resulted from strong channel noise with few influence of release variations. On the contrary, partly because of the presence of subconductance states, AMPA receptor channel noise was low and AMPA current fluctuations tightly reflected changes in the amount of glutamate released. We next showed that these two factors, channel noise and fluctuations in glutamate release, were sufficient to explain the observed variability of the NMDA to AMPA current ratio in quantal events recorded from the same neuron. We therefore concluded that the proportion of AMPA and NMDA receptors was similar, or roughly similar, across synapses onto the same target cell.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/110072v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>The basal ganglia play a major role in directing learned action sequences such as reaching and pressing, particularly in cases where precise timing plays an important role, as shown in experiments on rodents performing delayed lever press tasks. A comprehensive understanding of the relative roles of cortex and basal ganglia in learning and performing such behaviors, however, is still lacking. Inspired by recent experimental results showing that motor cortex is necessary for learning certain types of motor sequences but not for performing them once learned, we develop a model of the striatum, the major input structure of the basal ganglia, in which recurrently connected inhibitory neurons receive cortical input. An anti-Hebbian plasticity rule at the recurrent synapses in the striatum allows our model to learn a sparse, sequential pattern of neural activity similar to the patterns observed in experimental population recordings. After learning, the network can reproduce the same dynamics autonomously without patterned cortical input, and can further speed up or slow down the activity pattern simply by adjusting the level of tonic external input. The general mechanisms used in this model can also be applied to circuits with both excitatory and inhibitory populations, and hence may underlie sequential neural activity patterns that have been observed throughout other brain areas in addition to basal ganglia.</content:encoded>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Measures of spike train synchrony for data with multiple time-scales. (arXiv:1702.05394v1 [physics.data-an])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.05394</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Background: Measures of spike train synchrony are widely used in both
experimental and computational neuroscience. Time-scale independent and
parameter-free measures, such as the ISI-distance, the SPIKE-distance and
SPIKE-synchronization, are preferable to time-scale parametric measures, since
by adapting to the local firing rate they take into account all the time-scales
of a given dataset.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New Method: In data containing multiple time-scales (e.g. regular spiking and
bursts) one is typically less interested in the smallest time-scales and a more
adaptive approach is needed. Here we propose the A-ISI-distance, the
A-SPIKE-distance and A-SPIKE-synchronization, which generalize the original
measures by considering the local relative to the global time-scales. For the
A-SPIKE-distance we also introduce a rate-independent extension called the
RIA-SPIKE-distance, which focuses specifically on spike timing.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Results: The adaptive generalizations A-ISI-distance and A-SPIKE-distance
allow to disregard spike time differences that are not relevant on a more
global scale. A-SPIKE-synchronization does not any longer demand an
unreasonably high accuracy for spike doublets and coinciding bursts. Finally,
the RIA-SPIKE-distance proves to be independent of rate ratios between spike
trains.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Comparison with Existing Methods: We find that compared to the original
versions the A-ISI-distance and the A-SPIKE-distance yield improvements for
spike trains containing different time-scales without exhibiting any unwanted
side effects in other examples. A-SPIKE-synchronization matches spikes more
efficiently than SPIKE-Synchronization.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: With these proposals we have completed the picture, since we now
provide adaptive generalized measures that are sensitive to rate only
(A-ISI-distance), to timing only (ARI-SPIKE-distance), and to both at the same
time (A-SPIKE-distance).

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;We propose an extension of the cable equation by introducing a Caputo time
fractional derivative. The fundamental solutions of the most common boundary
problems are derived analitically via Laplace Transform, and result be written
in terms of known special functions. This generalization could be useful to
describe anomalous diffusion phenomena with leakage as signal conduction in
spiny dendrites. The presented solutions are computed in Matlab and plotted.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Fractional Cable Model for Signal Conduction in Spiny Neuronal Dendrites. (arXiv:1702.05325v1 [physics.bio-ph])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.05325</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The cable model is widely used in several fields of science to describe the
propagation of signals. A relevant medical and biological example is the
anomalous subdiffusion in spiny neuronal dendrites observed in several studies
of the last decade. Anomalous subdiffusion can be modelled in several ways
introducing some fractional component into the classical cable model. The
Chauchy problem associated to these kind of models has been investigated by
many authors, but up to our knowledge an explicit solution for the signalling
problem has not yet been published. Here we propose how this solution can be
derived applying the generalized convolution theorem (known as Efros theorem)
for Laplace transforms. The fractional cable model considered in this paper is
defined by replacing the first order time derivative with a fractional
derivative of order $\alpha\in(0,1)$ of Caputo type. The signalling problem is
solved for any input function applied to the accessible end of a semi-infinite
cable, which satisfies the requirements of the Efros theorem. The solutions
corresponding to the simple cases of impulsive and step inputs are explicitly
calculated in integral form containing Wright functions. Thanks to the
variability of the parameter $\alpha$, the corresponding solutions are expected
to adapt to the qualitative behaviour of the membrane potential observed in
experiments better than in the standard case $\alpha=1$.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: A reaction-diffusion model for the progression of Parkinson's disease. (arXiv:1702.05259v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.05259</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The temporal and spatial development of Parkinson's disease has been
characterised as the progressive formation of {\alpha}-synuclein aggregations
through susceptible neuronal pathways. This article describes a new model for
this progression mechanism in which Parkinsonian damage moves over time through
the nervous system by the combined effect of the reaction kinetics of
pathogenesis and molecular diffusion. In the reaction-diffusion model, the
change from a healthy state to the disease state advances through the nervous
system as a wave front of Parkinsonian damage, marking its path by
accumulations of damaged {\alpha}-synuclein and neurotoxic levels of oxidative
species. Progression according to this model follows the most vulnerable routes
through the nervous system as described by Braak's staging theory and predicts
that damage will advance at differing speeds depending upon the level and
number of risk factors, in a manner that gives new insights into the variations
with which Parkinson's disease develops.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: A Biased Look at Phase Locking: Brief Critical Review and Proposed Remedy. (arXiv:1702.05254v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.05254</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A number of popular measures of dependence between pairs of band-limited
signals rely on analytic phase. A common misconception is that the dependence
revealed by these measures must be specific to the spectral range of the
filtered input signals. Implicitly or explicitly, obtaining analytic phase
involves normalizing the signal by its own envelope, which is a nonlinear
operation that introduces broad spectral leakage. We review how this generates
bias and complicates the interpretation of commonly used measures of phase
locking. A specific example of this effect may create spurious phase locking as
a consequence of nonzero circular mean in the phase of input signals, which can
be viewed as spectral leakage to 0 Hz. Corrections for this problem which
recenter or uniformize the distribution of phase may fail when the amplitudes
of the compared signals are correlated. To address the more general problem of
spectral bias, a novel measure of phase locking is proposed, the
amplitude-weighted phase locking value (awPLV). This measure is closely related
to coherence, but it removes ambiguities of interpretation that detract from
the latter.

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Effective connectivity inferred from fMRI transition dynamics during movie viewing points to a balanced reconfiguration of cortical interactions</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/110015v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Our behavior entails a flexible and context-sensitive interplay between brain areas to integrate information according to goal-directed requirements. However, the neural mechanisms governing the entrainment of functionally specialized brain areas remain poorly understood. In particular, the question arises whether observed changes in the activity for different cognitive conditions are explained by modifications of the (intrinsic) inputs or (extrinsic) recurrent connectivity? Here, we show that fMRI transitions over successive time points - a new version of dynamic functional connectivity compared to usual definitions - convey information about the task performed by 19 subjects, namely watching a movie versus a black screen (rest). We use a theoretical framework that extracts this information to characterize the mechanisms underlying cortical coordination at the whole brain level. Our approach relies on our recent network model that was introduced for resting-state fMRI and estimates both the amplitude of input fluctuating activity to each of the 66 cortical regions and the strengths of cortico-cortical interactions between them. In our model, the change of condition does modify the (extrinsic) recurrent connectivity as much as the (intrinsic) inputs, which are putatively related to the movie stimulus. However, detailed changes in connectivity preserve a balance in the propagation of fluctuating activity and select specific pathways that integrate sensory information from the visual and auditory systems to high-level regions of the brain. These findings speak to a dynamic functional integration that underlies the hierarchical processing in the brain.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/109892v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Motivation: The automatic reconstruction of single neuron cells is essential to enable large-scale data-driven investigations in computational neuroscience. However, few previous methods were able to generate satisfactory results automatically from 3D microscopic images without human intervention. Results: We developed a new algorithm for automatic 3D neuron reconstruction. The main idea of the proposed algorithm is to iteratively track backwards from the potential neuronal termini to the soma centre. The traced areas are labelled to avoid duplicated tracing. An online confidence score is computed to decide if a tracing iteration should be stopped and discarded from the final reconstruction. The performance improvements comparing to the previous methods are mainly introduced by a more accurate estimation of the traced area and a novel confidence controlled back-tracking algorithm. The proposed algorithm supports large-scale batch-processing by requiring only a background threshold. We bench-tested the proposed algorithm on the datasets of the BigNeuron project. We show it outperformed several state-of-the-art methods regarding the reconstruction accuracy. It was also able to generate topologically acceptable neuronal models in a majority of cases without human intervention. Availability: The python implementation of this algorithm has been released as a PyPI package (https://github.com/lsqshr/rivuletpy). It is also implemented in Vaa3D as a neuron tracing plugin (https://github.com/Vaa3D).</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Model-based spike sorting with a mixture of drifting t-distributions</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/109850v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Chronic extracellular recordings are a powerful tool for systems neuroscience, but spike sorting remains a challenge. A common approach is to fit a generative model, such as a mixture of Gaussians, to the observed spike data. Even if non-parametric methods are used for spike sorting, such generative models provide a quantitative measure of unit isolation quality, which is crucial for subsequent interpretation of the sorted spike trains. We present a spike sorting strategy that models the data as a mixture of drifting t-distributions. This model captures two important features of chronic extracellular recordings--cluster drift over time and heavy tails in the distribution of spikes--and offers improved robustness to outliers. We evaluate this model on several thousand hours of chronic tetrode recordings and show that it fits the empirical data substantially better than a mixture of Gaussians. We also provide a software implementation that can re-fit long datasets (several hours, millions of spikes) in a few seconds, enabling interactive clustering of chronic recordings. Using experimental data, we identify three common failure modes of spike sorting methods that assume stationarity. We also characterize the limitations of several popular unit isolation metrics in the presence of empirically-observed variations in cluster size and scale. We find that the mixture of drifting t-distributions model enables efficient spike sorting of long datasets and provides an accurate measure of unit isolation quality over a wide range of conditions.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/109819v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>In the classic gain/loss framing effect, describing a gamble as a potential gain or loss biases people to make risk-averse or risk-seeking decisions, respectively. The canonical explanation for this effect is that frames differentially modulate emotional processes -- which in turn leads to irrational choice behavior. Here, we evaluate the source of framing biases by integrating functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data from 143 human participants performing a gain/loss framing task with meta-analytic data from over 8000 neuroimaging studies. We found that activation during choices consistent with the framing effect were most correlated with activation associated with the resting or default brain, while activation during choices inconsistent with the framing effect most correlated with the task-engaged brain. Our findings argue against the common interpretation of gain/loss framing as a competition between emotion and control. Instead, our study indicates that this effect results from differential cognitive engagement across decision frames.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Do Candidate Genes Affect the Brain's White Matter Microstructure?Large-Scale Evaluation of 6,165 Diffusion MRI Scans</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/107987v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Susceptibility genes for psychiatric and neurological disorders - including APOE, BDNF, CLU, CNTNAP2, COMT, DISC1, DTNBP1, ErbB4, HFE, NRG1, NTKR3, and ZNF804A - have been reported to affect white matter (WM) microstructure in the healthy human brain, as assessed through diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). However, effects of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in these genes explain only a small fraction of the overall variance and are challenging to detect reliably in single cohort studies. To date, few studies have evaluated the reproducibility of these results. As part of the ENIGMA-DTI consortium, we pooled regional fractional anisotropy (FA) measures for 6,165 subjects (CEU ancestry N=4,458) from 11 cohorts worldwide to evaluate effects of 15 candidate SNPs by examining their associations with WM microstructure. Additive association tests were conducted for each SNP. We used several meta-analytic and mega-analytic designs, and we evaluated regions of interest at multiple granularity levels. The ENIGMA-DTI protocol was able to detect single-cohort findings as originally reported. Even so, in this very large sample, no significant associations remained after multiple-testing correction for the 15 SNPs investigated. Suggestive associations (1.3x10-4 &amp;lt; p &amp;lt; 0.05, uncorrected) were found for BDNF, COMT, and ZNF804A in specific tracts. Meta- and mega-analyses revealed similar findings. Regardless of the approach, the previously reported candidate SNPs did not show significant associations with WM microstructure in this largest genetic study of DTI to date; the negative findings are likely not due to insufficient power. Genome-wide studies, involving large-scale meta-analyses, may help to discover SNPs robustly influencing WM microstructure.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/109736v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Brain computations depend on how neurons transform inputs to spike outputs. Because sensory stimuli change activity in many interconnected brain areas, it has been challenging to control neuronal inputs to measure input-output transformations in vivo. To overcome that difficulty, here we paired optogenetic stimuli with a constant sensory stimulus and measured spiking of visual cortical neurons in awake mice. We found that neurons' average responses were surprisingly linear. We then used a recurrent cortical network model to determine if these data and past observations of sublinearity could be described by a common circuit architecture. The model showed the input-output transformation could be changed from linear to sublinear with moderate (~20%) strengthening of connections between inhibitory neurons, but this change depends on the presence of feedforward inhibition. Thus, feedforward inhibition, a common feature of cortical circuitry, enables networks to flexibly change their spiking responses via changes in recurrent connectivity.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/109710v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>The non-specific neuromodulation of the forebrain by the noradrenergic locus coeruleus (LC) is a foundation of wide-ranging theories of cognitive and systems neuroscience. The non-specificity is assumed because of the diffuse projections of the nucleus as well as the synchronous spiking of its neurons. Synchrony, however, has never been assessed in a large population of LC cells, i.e. single units, nor has it been systematically related to specificity of their projection targets. Here, we recorded up to 52 single units simultaneously (3164 unit pairs) in the rat LC, and characterized forebrain projection patterns using antidromic stimulation. Two novel unit types were characterized; they differed by waveform shape, firing rate, and propensity for synchronization. Cross-correlation analysis revealed a surprisingly poor correlation between unit spiking; only 13% of unit pairs had response profiles reflecting synchronization due to common synaptic input or gap junctions. While LC unit spikes were phase locked to cortical slow oscillations (&amp;lt; 2 Hz), they did so intermittently, yielding poor population synchronization. A novel infra-slow (0.01-1 Hz) spiking fluctuation was observed in LC units, yet this too was asynchronous across unit pairs. A highly synchronized minority had a stronger tendency for targeted forebrain neuromodulation. Our findings demonstrate that the LC may convey a more complex and differentiated neuromodulatory signal than is widely assumed.</content:encoded>

Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified tens of thousands of genetic variants associated with hundreds of phenotypes and diseases, which have provided clinical and medical benefits to patients with novel biomarkers and therapeutic targets. However, identification of risk variants associated with complex diseases remains challenging as they are often affected by many genetic variants with small or moderate effects. There has been accumulating evidence suggesting that different complex traits share common risk basis, namely pleiotropy. Recently, several statistical methods have been developed to improve statistical power to identify risk variants for complex traits through a joint analysis of multiple GWAS datasets by leveraging pleiotropy. While these methods were shown to improve statistical power for association mapping compared to separate analyses, they are still limited in the number of phenotypes that can be integrated. In order to address this challenge, in this paper, we propose a novel statistical framework, graph-GPA, to integrate a large number of GWAS datasets for multiple phenotypes using a hidden Markov random field approach. Application of graph-GPA to a joint analysis of GWAS datasets for 12 phenotypes shows that graph-GPA improves statistical power to identify risk variants compared to statistical methods based on smaller number of GWAS datasets. In addition, graph-GPA also promotes better understanding of genetic mechanisms shared among phenotypes, which can potentially be useful for the development of improved diagnosis and therapeutics. The R implementation of graph-GPA is currently available at https://github.com/dongjunchung/GGPA/.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/IZeOfXwIBw0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

A precise and rapid adjustment of fluxes through metabolic pathways is crucial for organisms to prevail in changing environmental conditions. Based on this reasoning, many guiding principles that govern the evolution of metabolic networks and their regulation have been uncovered. To this end, methods from dynamic optimization are ideally suited since they allow to uncover optimality principles behind the regulation of metabolic networks. We used dynamic optimization to investigate the influence of toxic intermediates in connection with the efficiency of enzymes on the regulation of a linear metabolic pathway. Our results predict that transcriptional regulation favors the control of highly efficient enzymes with less toxic upstream intermediates to reduce accumulation of toxic downstream intermediates. We show that the derived optimality principles hold by the analysis of the interplay between intermediate toxicity and pathway regulation in the metabolic pathways of over 5000 sequenced prokaryotes. Moreover, using the lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis in &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; as an example, we show how knowledge about the relation of regulation, kinetic efficiency and intermediate toxicity can be used to identify drug targets, which control endogenous toxic metabolites and prevent microbial growth. Beyond prokaryotes, we discuss the potential of our findings for the development of antifungal drugs.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/J9iJyxhh9xU&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Therapeutic strategies in the pipeline are appraised, ranging from &lt;em&gt;SMN1&lt;/em&gt; gene replacement to modulation of &lt;em&gt;SMN2&lt;/em&gt; encoded transcripts, to neuroprotection, to an expanding repertoire of peripheral targets, including muscle. With the advent of preliminary trial data, it can be reasonably anticipated that the SMA treatment landscape will transform significantly. Advancement in presymptomatic diagnosis and screening programs will be critical, with pilot newborn screening studies underway to facilitate preclinical diagnosis. The development of disease-modifying therapies will necessitate monitoring programs to determine the long-term impact, careful evaluation of combined treatments, and further acceleration of improvements in supportive care. In advance of upcoming clinical trial results, we consider the challenges and controversies related to the implementation of novel therapies for all patients and set the scene as the field prepares to enter an era of novel therapies.

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/109405v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Humans resolve the spatial alignment between two visual stimuli at a resolution that is substantially finer than the spacing between the foveal cones. In this paper, we analyze the factors that limit the information at the cone photoreceptors that is available to make these acuity judgments (Vernier acuity). We use open-source software, ISETBIO1 to quantify the stimulus and encoding stages in the front-end of the human visual system, starting with a description of the stimulus spectral radiance and a computational model that includes the physiological optics, inert ocular pigments, eye movements, photoreceptor sampling and absorptions. The simulations suggest that the visual system extracts the information available within the spatiotemporal pattern of photoreceptor absorptions within a small spatial (0.12 deg) and temporal (200 ms) regime. At typical display luminance levels, the variance arising from the Poisson absorptions and small eye movements (tremors and microsaccades) both appear to be critical limiting factors for Vernier acuity.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/109355v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Sanborn and Chater propose an interesting theory of cognitive and brain function based on Bayesian sampling instead of asymptotic Bayesian inference. Their proposal unifies many current observations and models and, in spite of focusing primarily on cognitive phenomena, their work provides a springboard for unifying several proposed theories of brain function. It has the potential to serve as a bridge between three influential overarching current theories of cognitive and brain function: Bayesian models, Friston's theory of cortical responses based on the free-energy principle, and attractor-basin dynamics. Specifically, their proposal suggests a high-level perspective on Friston's theory, which in turn proposes a sampling procedure including appropriate handling of autocorrelation as well as a plausible neurobiological implementation. In turn, these two theories together link into attractor-basin dynamics at the level of networks (via Friston) as well at the level of behavior (via the relationship between the modes of prior and posterior distributions, as discussed by Sanborn and Chater). We will argue here that, by linking Sanborn and Chater's approach to neurobiological models based on the free-energy principle on the one hand and attractor-basin dynamics on the other, the scope of their proposal can be broadened considerably. Moreover, a unified perspective along these lines provides an elegant solution to several of Sanborn and Chater's Outstanding Questions relating to the neural implementation of sampling.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/109181v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Development and aging are associated with functional changes in the brain across the lifespan. These changes can be detected in spatial and temporal features of resting state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) data. Independent vector analysis (IVA) is a whole-brain multivariate approach that can be used to comprehensively assess these changes in spatial and temporal features. We present a multi-dimensional approach to assessing age-related changes in spatial and temporal features of statistically independent components identified by IVA in a cross-sectional lifespan sample (ages 6-85 years). We show that while large-scale brain network configurations remain consistent throughout the lifespan, changes continue to occur in both local organization and in the spectral composition of these functional networks. We show that the spatial extent of functional networks decreases with age, but with no significant change in the peak functional loci of these networks. Additionally, we show differential age-related patterns across the frequency spectrum; lower frequency correlations decrease across the lifespan whereas higher-frequency correlations increase. These changes indicate an increasing stability of networks with age. In addition to replicating results from previous studies, the current results uncover new aspects of functional brain network changes across the lifespan that are frequency band-dependent.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: The Stochastic Early Reaction, Inhibition, and Late Action (SERIA) Model for Antisaccades SERIA - A model for errors and reaction times in the antisaccade task</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/109090v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>The antisaccade task is a classic paradigm used to study the voluntary control of eye movements. It requires participants to suppress a reactive eye movement to a visual target and to concurrently initiate a saccade in the opposite direction. Although several models have been proposed to explain error rates and reaction times in this task, no formal model comparison has yet been performed. Here, we describe a Bayesian modeling approach for the antisaccade task that allows us to formally compare different models on the basis of their model evidence. First, we provide a formal likelihood function of actions (prosaccades or antisaccades) and reactions times based on a recently published model. Second, we introduce the Stochastic Early Reaction, Inhibition, and late Action model (SERIA), a novel model that postulates two different types of mechanisms that interact in the antisaccade task: a race-to-threshold decision process and a binary, time-insensitive decision process. Third, we apply these models to a data set from an experiment with three mixed blocks of pro- and antisaccade trials. Bayesian model comparison demonstrates that the SERIA model explains the data better than competing models that are based only on race-to-threshold processes. Moreover, we show that the race-to-threshold decision processes postulated by the SERIA model are, to a large extent, insensitive to the cue presented on a single trial. Finally, we use the same inversion technique to infer upon model parameters and demonstrate that changes in reaction time and error rate due to the probability of a trial type (prosaccade or antisaccade) are explained mostly by faster or slower inhibition and the probability of generating late voluntary prosaccades.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Distinct neural systems for the production of communicative vocal behaviors</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/107441v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Vocalizations are the production of sounds by the coordinated activity of up to eighty respiratory and laryngeal muscles. Whilst voiced acts, modified by the upper vocal tract (tongue, jaw, lip and palate) are central to the production of human speech, they are also central to the production of emotional vocalizations such as sounds of disgust, anger, laughter and crying. Evidence suggests that the speech and emotional vocalizations may comprise distinct classes of vocal movements: patients with speech production deficits are often able to produce emotional vocalizations. In addition to this, the ontogeny of the two articulations is largely distinct, with some culturally universal emotional vocalizations emerging soon after birth and human speech being a culture specific, highly learnt motor act, which must develop to some degree before a critical period in development. Here we investigate the motor pathways underlying these two classes of vocal movements for the first time by directly comparing BOLD responses during production of speech and non-speech vocal movements. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we report distinct patterns of activity in both subcortical and cortical regions (putamen and bilateral inferior frontal and parietal cortices) during the production of emotional vocalizations compared to speech production. In contrast we show that responses in primary sensorimotor regions do not differ during the production of speech and emotional vocalizations, suggesting partially overlapping, and partially non-overlapping neural structures for the motor control of these two classes of movement. In addition to this we report that responses in auditory cortices are distinct during the production of speech and non-speech vocalizations, suggesting that feedback control of speech and emotional vocalizations are distinct. These data provide novel evidence for the presence of dual pathways for the neural control of complex articulatory movements in humans. These findings are discussed in relation to the clinical and primate literature of vocal motor control.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/102525v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Neurons in the hippocampus and adjacent brain areas show a large diversity in their tuning to location and head direction. The underlying circuit mechanisms are not fully resolved. In particular, it is unclear why certain cell types are selective to one spatial variable, but invariant to another. For example, a place cell is highly selective to location, but typically invariant to head direction. Here, we propose that all observed spatial tuning patterns -- in both their selectivity and their invariance -- are a consequence of the same mechanism: Excitatory and inhibitory synaptic plasticity that is driven by the spatial tuning statistics of synaptic inputs. Using simulations and a mathematical analysis, we show that combined excitatory and inhibitory plasticity can lead to localized, grid-like or invariant activity. Combinations of different input statistics along different spatial dimensions reproduce all major spatial tuning patterns observed in rodents. The model is robust to changes in parameters, develops patterns on behavioral time scales and makes distinctive experimental predictions. Our results suggest that the interaction of excitatory and inhibitory plasticity is a general principle for the formation of neural representations.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>The visual system plays a major role in food/prey recognition in diurnal animals, and food intake is regulated by the hypothalamus. However, whether and how visual information about prey is conveyed to the hypothalamic feeding centre is largely unknown. Here we perform real-time imaging of neuronal activity in freely behaving or constrained zebrafish larvae and demonstrate that prey or prey-like visual stimuli activate the hypothalamic feeding centre. Furthermore, we identify prey detector neurons in the pretectal area that project to the hypothalamic feeding centre. Ablation of the pretecto-hypothalamic circuit abolishes prey capture behaviour. Taken together, these results suggest that the pretecto-hypothalamic pathway plays a crucial role in conveying visual information to the feeding centre. Thus, this pathway possibly converts visual food detection into feeding motivation in zebrafish.</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Testing the limits of gradient sensing</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/GCVK4m6DgHs/article</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Vinal Lakhani, Timothy C. Elston&lt;/p&gt;

The ability to detect a chemical gradient is fundamental to many cellular processes. In multicellular organisms gradient sensing plays an important role in many physiological processes such as wound healing and development. Unicellular organisms use gradient sensing to move (chemotaxis) or grow (chemotropism) towards a favorable environment. Some cells are capable of detecting extremely shallow gradients, even in the presence of significant molecular-level noise. For example, yeast have been reported to detect pheromone gradients as shallow as 0.1 nM/μm. Noise reduction mechanisms, such as time-averaging and the internalization of pheromone molecules, have been proposed to explain how yeast cells filter fluctuations and detect shallow gradients. Here, we use a Particle-Based Reaction-Diffusion model of ligand-receptor dynamics to test the effectiveness of these mechanisms and to determine the limits of gradient sensing. In particular, we develop novel simulation methods for establishing chemical gradients that not only allow us to study gradient sensing under steady-state conditions, but also take into account transient effects as the gradient forms. Based on reported measurements of reaction rates, our results indicate neither time-averaging nor receptor endocytosis significantly improves the cell’s accuracy in detecting gradients over time scales associated with the initiation of polarized growth. Additionally, our results demonstrate the physical barrier of the cell membrane sharpens chemical gradients across the cell. While our studies are motivated by the mating response of yeast, we believe our results and simulation methods will find applications in many different contexts.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/GCVK4m6DgHs&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Foot-and-mouth disease outbreaks in non-endemic countries can lead to large economic costs and livestock losses but the use of vaccination has been contentious, partly due to uncertainty about emergency FMD vaccination. Value of information methods can be applied to disease outbreak problems such as FMD in order to investigate the performance improvement from resolving uncertainties. Here we calculate the expected value of resolving uncertainty about vaccine efficacy, time delay to immunity after vaccination and daily vaccination capacity for a hypothetical FMD outbreak in the UK. If it were possible to resolve all uncertainty prior to the introduction of control, we could expect savings of £55 million in outbreak cost, 221,900 livestock culled and 4.3 days of outbreak duration. All vaccination strategies were found to be preferable to a culling only strategy. However, the optimal vaccination radius was found to be highly dependent upon vaccination capacity for all management objectives. We calculate that by resolving the uncertainty surrounding vaccination capacity we would expect to return over 85% of the above savings, regardless of management objective. It may be possible to resolve uncertainty about daily vaccination capacity before an outbreak, and this would enable decision makers to select the optimal control action via careful contingency planning.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/CAB6na4ZfpU&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: A Causal Inference Model Explains Perception of the McGurk Effect and Other Incongruent Audiovisual Speech</title>

Audiovisual speech integration combines information from auditory speech (talker’s voice) and visual speech (talker’s mouth movements) to improve perceptual accuracy. However, if the auditory and visual speech emanate from different talkers, integration decreases accuracy. Therefore, a key step in audiovisual speech perception is deciding whether auditory and visual speech have the same source, a process known as causal inference. A well-known illusion, the McGurk Effect, consists of incongruent audiovisual syllables, such as auditory “ba” + visual “ga” (AbaVga), that are integrated to produce a fused percept (“da”). This illusion raises two fundamental questions: first, given the incongruence between the auditory and visual syllables in the McGurk stimulus, why are they integrated; and second, why does the McGurk effect not occur for other, very similar syllables (&lt;i&gt;e&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt;., AgaVba). We describe a simplified model of causal inference in multisensory speech perception (CIMS) that predicts the perception of arbitrary combinations of auditory and visual speech. We applied this model to behavioral data collected from 60 subjects perceiving both McGurk and non-McGurk incongruent speech stimuli. The CIMS model successfully predicted both the audiovisual integration observed for McGurk stimuli and the lack of integration observed for non-McGurk stimuli. An identical model without causal inference failed to accurately predict perception for either form of incongruent speech. The CIMS model uses causal inference to provide a computational framework for studying how the brain performs one of its most important tasks, integrating auditory and visual speech cues to allow us to communicate with others.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/drRET3-k1YQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: A mathematical model of calcium dynamics in HSY cells</title>

Saliva is an essential part of activities such as speaking, masticating and swallowing. Enzymes in salivary fluid protect teeth and gums from infectious diseases, and also initiate the digestion process. Intracellular calcium (Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;) plays a critical role in saliva secretion and regulation. Experimental measurements of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and inositol trisphosphate (IP&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) concentrations in HSY cells, a human salivary duct cell line, show that when the cells are stimulated with adenosine triphosphate (ATP) or carbachol (CCh), they exhibit coupled oscillations with Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; spike peaks preceding IP&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; spike peaks. Based on these data, we construct a mathematical model of coupled Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and IP&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; oscillations in HSY cells and perform model simulations of three different experimental settings to forecast Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; responses. The model predicts that when Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; influx from the extracellular space is removed, oscillations gradually slow down until they stop. The model simulation of applying a pulse of IP&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; predicts that photolysis of caged IP&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; causes a transient increase in the frequency of the Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; oscillations. Lastly, when Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-dependent activation of PLC is inhibited, we see an increase in the oscillation frequency and a decrease in the amplitude. These model predictions are confirmed by experimental data. We conclude that, although concentrations of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and IP&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; oscillate, Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; oscillations in HSY cells are the result of modulation of the IP&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; receptor by intracellular Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, and that the period is modulated by the accompanying IP&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; oscillations.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/0BYBNxuLnug&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Differential Regulation of NMDA Receptor-Mediated Transmission by SK Channels Underlies Dorsal-Ventral Differences in Dynamics of Schaffer Collateral Synaptic Function</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/7/1950?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Behavioral, physiological, and anatomical evidence indicates that the dorsal and ventral zones of the hippocampus have distinct roles in cognition. How the unique functions of these zones might depend on differences in synaptic and neuronal function arising from the strikingly different gene expression profiles exhibited by dorsal and ventral CA1 pyramidal cells is unclear. To begin to address this question, we investigated the mechanisms underlying differences in synaptic transmission and plasticity at dorsal and ventral Schaffer collateral (SC) synapses in the mouse hippocampus. We find that, although basal synaptic transmission is similar, SC synapses in the dorsal and ventral hippocampus exhibit markedly different responses to  frequency patterns of stimulation. In contrast to dorsal hippocampus,  frequency stimulation fails to elicit postsynaptic complex-spike bursting and does not induce LTP at ventral SC synapses. Moreover, EPSP-spike coupling, a process that strongly influences information transfer at synapses, is weaker in ventral pyramidal cells. Our results indicate that all these differences in postsynaptic function are due to an enhanced activation of SK-type K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channels that suppresses NMDAR-dependent EPSP amplification at ventral SC synapses. Consistent with this, mRNA levels for the SK3 subunit of SK channels are significantly higher in ventral CA1 pyramidal cells. Together, our findings indicate that a dorsal-ventral difference in SK channel regulation of NMDAR activation has a profound effect on the transmission, processing, and storage of information at SC synapses and thus likely contributes to the distinct roles of the dorsal and ventral hippocampus in different behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Differences in short- and long-term plasticity at Schaffer collateral (SC) synapses in the dorsal and ventral hippocampus likely contribute importantly to the distinct roles of these regions in cognition and behavior. Although dorsal and ventral CA1 pyramidal cells exhibit markedly different gene expression profiles, how these differences influence plasticity at SC synapses is unclear. Here we report that increased mRNA levels for the SK3 subunit of SK-type K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channels in ventral pyramidal cells is associated with an enhanced activation of SK channels that strongly suppresses NMDAR activation at ventral SC synapses. This leads to striking differences in multiple aspects of synaptic transmission at dorsal and ventral SC synapses and underlies the reduced ability of ventral SC synapses to undergo LTP.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Paired Stimulation for Spike-Timing-Dependent Plasticity in Primate Sensorimotor Cortex</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/7/1935?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Classic &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; studies have described spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) at a synapse: the connection from neuron A to neuron B is strengthened (or weakened) when A fires before (or after) B within an optimal time window. Accordingly, more recent &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; works have demonstrated behavioral effects consistent with an STDP mechanism; however, many relied on single-unit recordings. The ability to modify cortical connections becomes useful in the context of injury, when connectivity and associated behavior are compromised. To avoid the need for long-term, stable isolation of single units, one could control timed activation of two cortical sites with paired electrical stimulation. We tested the hypothesis that STDP could be induced via prolonged paired stimulation as quantified by cortical evoked potentials (EPs) in the sensorimotor cortex of awake, behaving monkeys. Paired simulation between two interconnected sites produced robust effects in EPs consistent with STDP, but only at 2/15 tested pairs. The stimulation protocol often produced increases in global network excitability or depression of the conditioned pair. Together, these results suggest that paired stimulation &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; is a viable method to induce STDP between cortical populations, but that factors beyond activation timing must be considered to produce conditioning effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Plasticity of neural connections is important for development, learning, memory, and recovery from injury. Cellular mechanisms underlying spike-timing-dependent plasticity have been studied extensively &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;. Recent &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; work has demonstrated results consistent with the previously defined cellular mechanisms; however, the output measure in these studies was typically an indirect assessment of plasticity at the neural level. Here, we show direct plasticity in recordings of neuronal populations in awake, behaving nonhuman primates induced by paired electrical stimulation. In contrast to &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; studies, we found that plastic effects were only produced between specific cortical areas. These findings suggest that similar mechanisms drive plasticity &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;, but that cortical architecture may contribute significantly to site-dependent effects.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Hippocampal Contribution to Context Encoding across Development Is Disrupted following Early-Life Adversity</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/7/1925?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Context can drastically influence responses to environmental stimuli. For example, a gunshot should provoke a different response at a public park than a shooting range. Little is known about how contextual processing and neural correlates change across human development or about individual differences related to early environmental experiences. Children (&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt; = 60; 8–19 years, 24 exposed to interpersonal violence) completed a context encoding task during fMRI scanning using a delayed match-to-sample design with neutral, happy, and angry facial cues embedded in realistic background scenes. Outside the scanner, participants completed a memory test for context-face pairings. Context memory and neural correlates of context encoding did not vary with age. Larger hippocampal volume was associated with better context memory. Posterior hippocampus was recruited during context encoding, and greater activation in this region predicted better memory for contexts paired with angry faces. Children exposed to violence had poor memory of contexts paired with angry faces, reduced hippocampal volume, and atypical neural recruitment on encoding trials with angry faces, including reduced hippocampal activation and greater functional connectivity between hippocampus and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (vlPFC). Greater hippocampus-vlPFC connectivity was associated with worse memory for contexts paired with angry faces. Posterior hippocampus appears to support context encoding, a process that does not exhibit age-related variation from middle childhood to late adolescence. Exposure to dangerous environments in childhood is associated with poor context encoding in the presence of threat, likely due to greater vlPFC-dependent attentional narrowing on threat cues at the expense of hippocampus-dependent processing of the broader context.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The ability to use context to guide reactions to environmental stimuli promotes flexible behavior. Remarkably little research has examined how contextual processing changes across development or about influences of the early environment. We provide evidence for posterior hippocampus involvement in context encoding in youth and lack of age-related variation from middle childhood to late adolescence. Children exposed to interpersonal violence exhibited poor memory of contexts paired with angry faces and atypical neural recruitment during context encoding in the presence of threatening facial cues. Heightened attention to threat following violence exposure may come at the expense of encoding contextual information, which may ultimately contribute to pathological fear expressed in safe contexts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Target Cell Type-Dependent Differences in Ca2+ Channel Function Underlie Distinct Release Probabilities at Hippocampal Glutamatergic Terminals</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/7/1910?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Target cell type-dependent differences in presynaptic release probability (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/i&gt;) and short-term plasticity are intriguing features of cortical microcircuits that increase the computational power of neuronal networks. Here, we tested the hypothesis that different voltage-gated Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; channel densities in presynaptic active zones (AZs) underlie different &lt;i&gt;P&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/i&gt; values. Two-photon Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; imaging, triple immunofluorescent labeling, and 3D electron microscopic (EM) reconstruction of rat CA3 pyramidal cell axon terminals revealed ~1.7–1.9 times higher Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; inflow per AZ area in high &lt;i&gt;P&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/i&gt; boutons synapsing onto parvalbumin-positive interneurons (INs) than in low &lt;i&gt;P&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/i&gt; boutons synapsing onto mGluR1α-positive INs. EM replica immunogold labeling, however, demonstrated only 1.15 times larger Cav2.1 and Cav2.2 subunit densities in high &lt;i&gt;P&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/i&gt; AZs. Our results indicate target cell type-specific modulation of voltage-gated Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; channel function or different subunit composition as possible mechanisms underlying the functional differences. In addition, high &lt;i&gt;P&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/i&gt; synapses are also characterized by a higher density of docked vesicles, suggesting that a concerted action of these mechanisms underlies the functional differences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Target cell type-dependent variability in presynaptic properties is an intriguing feature of cortical synapses. When a single cortical pyramidal cell establishes a synapse onto a somatostatin-expressing interneuron (IN), the synapse releases glutamate with low probability, whereas the next bouton of the same axon has high release probability when its postsynaptic target is a parvalbumin-expressing IN. Here, we used combined molecular, imaging, and anatomical approaches to investigate the mechanisms underlying these differences. Our functional experiments implied an approximately twofold larger Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; channel density in high release probability boutons, whereas freeze–fracture immunolocalization demonstrated only a 15% difference in Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; channel subunit densities. Our results point toward a postsynaptic target cell type-dependent regulation of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; channel function or different subunit composition as the underlying mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Circadian Kinetics of Cell Cycle Progression in Adult Neurogenic Niches of a Diurnal Vertebrate</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/7/1900?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The circadian system may regulate adult neurogenesis via intracellular molecular clock mechanisms or by modifying the environment of neurogenic niches, with daily variation in growth factors or nutrients depending on the animal's diurnal or nocturnal lifestyle. In a diurnal vertebrate, zebrafish, we studied circadian distribution of immunohistochemical markers of the cell division cycle (CDC) in 5 of the 16 neurogenic niches of adult brain, the dorsal telencephalon, habenula, preoptic area, hypothalamus, and cerebellum. We find that common to all niches is the morning initiation of G&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;/S transition and daytime S-phase progression, overnight increase in G&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/M, and cycle completion by late night. This is supported by the timing of gene expression for critical cell cycle regulators cyclins D, A2, and B2 and cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p20 in brain tissue. The early-night peak in &lt;i&gt;p20&lt;/i&gt;, limiting G&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;/S transition, and its phase angle with the expression of core clock genes, &lt;i&gt;Clock1&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Per1&lt;/i&gt;, are preserved in constant darkness, suggesting intrinsic circadian patterns of cell cycle progression. The statistical modeling of CDC kinetics reveals the significant circadian variation in cell proliferation rates across all of the examined niches, but interniche differences in the magnitude of circadian variation in CDC, S-phase length, phase angle of entrainment to light or clock, and its dispersion. We conclude that, in neurogenic niches of an adult diurnal vertebrate, the circadian modulation of cell cycle progression involves both systemic and niche-specific factors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; This study establishes that in neurogenic niches of an adult diurnal vertebrate, the cell cycle progression displays a robust circadian pattern. Common to neurogenic niches located in diverse brain regions is daytime progression of DNA replication and nighttime mitosis, suggesting systemic regulation. Differences between neurogenic niches in the phase and degree of S-phase entrainment to the clock suggest additional roles for niche-specific regulatory mechanisms. Understanding the circadian regulation of adult neurogenesis can help optimize the timing of therapeutic approaches in patients with brain traumas or neurodegenerative disorders and preserve neural stem cells during cytostatic cancer therapies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Differential Presynaptic ATP Supply for Basal and High-Demand Transmission</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/7/1888?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The relative contributions of glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation to neuronal presynaptic energy demands are unclear. In rat hippocampal neurons, ATP production by either glycolysis or oxidative phosphorylation alone sustained basal evoked synaptic transmission for up to 20 min. However, combined inhibition of both ATP sources abolished evoked transmission. Neither action potential propagation failure nor depressed Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; influx explained loss of evoked synaptic transmission. Rather, inhibition of ATP synthesis caused massive spontaneous vesicle exocytosis, followed by arrested endocytosis, accounting for the disappearance of evoked postsynaptic currents. In contrast to its weak effects on basal transmission, inhibition of oxidative phosphorylation alone depressed recovery from vesicle depletion. Local astrocytic lactate shuttling was not required. Instead, either ambient monocarboxylates or neuronal glycolysis was sufficient to supply requisite substrate. In summary, basal transmission can be sustained by glycolysis, but strong presynaptic demands are met preferentially by oxidative phosphorylation, which can be maintained by bulk but not local monocarboxylates or by neuronal glycolysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Neuronal energy levels are critical for proper CNS function, but the relative roles for the two main sources of ATP production, glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation, in fueling presynaptic function in unclear. Either glycolysis or oxidative phosphorylation can fuel low-frequency synaptic function and inhibiting both underlies loss of synaptic transmission via massive vesicle release and subsequent failure to endocytose lost vesicles. Oxidative phosphorylation, fueled by either glycolysis or endogenously released monocarboxylates, can fuel more metabolically demanding tasks such as vesicle recovery after depletion. Our work demonstrates the flexible nature of fueling presynaptic function to maintain synaptic function.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Muscarinic Acetylcholine Receptors and M-Currents Underlie Efferent-Mediated Slow Excitation in Calyx-Bearing Vestibular Afferents</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/7/1873?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Stimulation of vestibular efferent neurons excites calyx and dimorphic (CD) afferents. This excitation consists of fast and slow components that differ &amp;gt;100-fold in activation kinetics and response duration. In the turtle, efferent-mediated fast excitation arises in CD afferents when the predominant efferent neurotransmitter acetylcholine (ACh) activates calyceal nicotinic ACh receptors (nAChRs); however, it is unclear whether the accompanying efferent-mediated slow excitation is also attributed to cholinergic mechanisms. To identify synaptic processes underlying efferent-mediated slow excitation, we recorded from CD afferents innervating the turtle posterior crista during electrical stimulation of efferent neurons, in combination with pharmacological probes and mechanical stimulation. Efferent-mediated slow excitation was unaffected by nAChR compounds that block efferent-mediated fast excitation, but were mimicked by muscarine and antagonized by atropine, indicating that it requires ACh and muscarinic ACh receptor (mAChR) activation. Efferent-mediated slow excitation or muscarine application enhanced the sensitivity of CD afferents to mechanical stimulation, suggesting that mAChR activation increases afferent input impedance by closing calyceal potassium channels. These observations were consistent with suppression of a muscarinic-sensitive K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-current, or M-current. Immunohistochemistry for putative M-current candidates suggested that turtle CD afferents express KCNQ3, KCNQ4, and ERG1–3 potassium channel subunits. KCNQ channels were favored as application of the selective antagonist XE991 mimicked and occluded efferent-mediated slow excitation in CD afferents. These data highlight an efferent-mediated mechanism for enhancing afferent sensitivity. They further suggest that the clinical effectiveness of mAChR antagonists in treating balance disorders may also target synaptic mechanisms in the vestibular periphery, and that KCNQ channel modulators might offer similar therapeutic value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Targeting the efferent vestibular system (EVS) pharmacologically might prove useful in ameliorating some forms of vestibular dysfunction by modifying ongoing primary vestibular input. EVS activation engages several kinetically distinct synaptic processes that profoundly alter the discharge rate and sensitivity of first-order vestibular neurons. Efferent-mediated slow excitation of vestibular afferents is of considerable interest given its ability to elevate afferent activity over an extended time course. We demonstrate for the first time that efferent-mediated slow excitation of vestibular afferents is mediated by muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (mAChR) activation and the subsequent closure of KCNQ potassium channels. The clinical effectiveness of some anti-mAChR drugs in treating motion sickness suggest that we may, in fact, already be targeting the peripheral EVS.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Accumulation of Polyribosomes in Dendritic Spine Heads, But Not Bases and Necks, during Memory Consolidation Depends on Cap-Dependent Translation Initiation</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/7/1862?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Translation in dendrites is believed to support synaptic changes during memory consolidation. Although translational control mechanisms are fundamental mediators of memory, little is known about their role in local translation. We previously found that polyribosomes accumulate in dendritic spines of the adult rat lateral amygdala (LA) during consolidation of aversive pavlovian conditioning and that this memory requires cap-dependent initiation, a primary point of translational control in eukaryotic cells. Here we used serial electron microscopy reconstructions to quantify polyribosomes in LA dendrites when consolidation was blocked by the cap-dependent initiation inhibitor 4EGI-1. We found that 4EGI-1 depleted polyribosomes in dendritic shafts and selectively prevented their upregulation in spine heads, but not bases and necks, during consolidation. Cap-independent upregulation was specific to spines with small, astrocyte-associated synapses. Our results reveal that cap-dependent initiation is involved in local translation during learning and that local translational control varies with synapse type.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Translation initiation is a central regulator of long-term memory formation. Local translation in dendrites supports memory by providing necessary proteins at synaptic sites, but it is unknown whether this requires initiation or bypasses it. We used serial electron microscopy reconstructions to examine polyribosomes in dendrites when memory formation was blocked by an inhibitor of translation initiation. This revealed two major pools of polyribosomes that were upregulated during memory formation: one pool in dendritic spine heads that was initiation dependent and another pool in the bases and necks of small spines that was initiation independent. Thus, translation regulation differs between spine types and locations, and translation that occurs closest to individual synapses during memory formation is initiation dependent.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Dysregulated Glycine Signaling Contributes to Increased Impulsivity during Protracted Alcohol Abstinence</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/7/1853?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Persons with alcoholism who are abstinent exhibit persistent impairments in the capacity for response inhibition, and this form of impulsivity is significantly associated with heightened relapse risk. Brain-imaging studies implicate aberrant prefrontal cortical function in this behavioral pathology, although the underlying mechanisms are not understood. Here we present evidence that deficient activation of glycine and serine release in the ventral medial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) contributes to increased motor impulsivity during protracted abstinence from long-term alcohol exposure. Levels of 12 neurotransmitters were monitored in the rat vmPFC during the performance of a challenging variant of the five-choice serial reaction time task (5-CSRTT) in which alcohol-exposed rats exhibit excessive premature responding. Following long-term ethanol exposure, rats showed blunted task-related recruitment of vmPFC glycine and serine release, and the loss of an inverse relationship between levels of these neurotransmitters and premature responding normally evident in alcohol-naive subjects. Intra-vmPFC administration of the glycine transport inhibitor ALX5407 prevented excessive premature responding by alcohol-exposed rats, and this was reliant on NMDA glycine site availability. Alcohol-exposed rats and controls did not differ in their premature responding and glycine and serine levels in vmPFC during the performance of the standard 5-CSRTT. Collectively, these findings provide novel insight into cortical neurochemical mechanisms contributing to increased impulsivity following long-term alcohol exposure and highlight the NMDA receptor coagonist site as a potential therapeutic target for increased impulsivity that may contribute to relapse risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Persons with alcoholism demonstrate increased motor impulsivity during abstinence; however, the neuronal mechanisms underlying these behavioral effects remain unknown. Here, we took advantage of an animal model that shows deficiencies in inhibitory control following prolonged alcohol exposure to investigate the neurotransmitters that are potentially responsible for dysregulated motor impulsivity following long-term alcohol exposure. We found that increased motor impulsivity is associated with reduced recruitment of glycine and serine neurotransmitters in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) cortex in rats following long-term alcohol exposure. Administration of glycine transport inhibitor ALX5407 in the vmPFC alleviated deficits in impulse control.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Behavioral Status Influences the Dependence of Odorant-Induced Change in Firing on Prestimulus Firing Rate</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/7/1835?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The firing rate of the mitral/tufted cells in the olfactory bulb is known to undergo significant trial-to-trial variability and is affected by anesthesia. Here we ask whether odorant-elicited changes in firing rate depend on the rate before application of the stimulus in the awake and anesthetized mouse. We find that prestimulus firing rate varies widely on a trial-to-trial basis and that the stimulus-induced change in firing rate decreases with increasing prestimulus firing rate. Interestingly, this prestimulus firing rate dependence was different when the behavioral task did not involve detecting the valence of the stimulus. Finally, when the animal was learning to associate the odor with reward, the prestimulus firing rate was smaller for false alarms compared with correct rejections, suggesting that intrinsic activity reflects the anticipatory status of the animal. Thus, in this sensory modality, changes in behavioral status alter the intrinsic prestimulus activity, leading to a change in the responsiveness of the second-order neurons. We speculate that this trial-to-trial variability in odorant responses reflects sampling of the massive parallel input by subsets of mitral cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The olfactory bulb must deal with processing massive parallel input from ~1200 distinct olfactory receptors. In contrast, the visual system receives input from a small number of photoreceptors and achieves recognition of complex stimuli by allocating processing for distinct spatial locations to different brain areas. Here we find that the change in firing rate elicited by the odorant in second-order mitral cells depends on the intrinsic activity leading to a change of magnitude in the responsiveness of these neurons relative to this prestimulus activity. Further, we find that prestimulus firing rate is influenced by behavioral status. This suggests that there is top-down modulation allowing downstream brain processing areas to perform dynamic readout of olfactory information.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;We previously reported that embryonic motor cortical neurons transplanted immediately after lesions in the adult mouse motor cortex restored damaged motor cortical pathways. A critical barrier hindering the application of transplantation strategies for a wide range of traumatic injuries is the determination of a suitable time window for therapeutic intervention.

More importantly, the delay dramatically increases the density of projections developed by grafted neurons and improves functional repair and recovery as assessed by intravital dynamic imaging and behavioral tests. These findings open new avenues in cell transplantation strategies as they indicate successful brain repair may occur following delayed transplantation.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Activity of Tachykinin1-Expressing Pet1 Raphe Neurons Modulates the Respiratory Chemoreflex</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/7/1807?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Homeostatic control of breathing, heart rate, and body temperature relies on circuits within the brainstem modulated by the neurotransmitter serotonin (5-HT). Mounting evidence points to specialized neuronal subtypes within the serotonergic neuronal system, borne out in functional studies, for the modulation of distinct facets of homeostasis. Such functional differences, read out at the organismal level, are likely subserved by differences among 5-HT neuron subtypes at the cellular and molecular levels, including differences in the capacity to coexpress other neurotransmitters such as glutamate, GABA, thyrotropin releasing hormone, and substance P encoded by the &lt;i&gt;Tachykinin-1&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;Tac1&lt;/i&gt;) gene. Here, we characterize in mice a 5-HT neuron subtype identified by expression of &lt;i&gt;Tac1&lt;/i&gt; and the serotonergic transcription factor gene &lt;i&gt;Pet1&lt;/i&gt;, referred to as the &lt;i&gt;Tac1-Pet1&lt;/i&gt; neuron subtype. Transgenic cell labeling showed &lt;i&gt;Tac1-Pet1&lt;/i&gt; soma resident largely in the caudal medulla. Chemogenetic [clozapine&lt;i&gt;-N-&lt;/i&gt;oxide (CNO)-hM4Di] perturbation of &lt;i&gt;Tac1-Pet1&lt;/i&gt; neuron activity blunted the ventilatory response of the respiratory CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; chemoreflex, which normally augments ventilation in response to hypercapnic acidosis to restore normal pH and PCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. &lt;i&gt;Tac1-Pet1&lt;/i&gt; axonal boutons were found localized to brainstem areas implicated in respiratory modulation, with highest density in motor regions. These findings demonstrate that the activity of a &lt;i&gt;Pet1&lt;/i&gt; neuron subtype with the potential to release both 5-HT and substance P is necessary for normal respiratory dynamics, perhaps via motor outputs that engage muscles of respiration and maintain airway patency. These &lt;i&gt;Tac1-Pet1&lt;/i&gt; neurons may act downstream of &lt;i&gt;Egr2-Pet1&lt;/i&gt; serotonergic neurons, which were previously established in respiratory chemoreception, but do not innervate respiratory motor nuclei.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Serotonin (5-HT) neurons modulate physiological processes and behaviors as diverse as body temperature, respiration, aggression, and mood. Using genetic tools, we characterize a 5-HT neuron subtype defined by expression of &lt;i&gt;Tachykinin1&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Pet1&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;Tac1-Pet1&lt;/i&gt; neurons), mapping soma localization to the caudal medulla primarily and axonal projections to brainstem motor nuclei most prominently, and, when silenced, observed blunting of the ventilatory response to inhaled CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. &lt;i&gt;Tac1-Pet1&lt;/i&gt; neurons thus appear distinct from and contrast previously described &lt;i&gt;Egr2-Pet1&lt;/i&gt; neurons, which project primarily to chemosensory integration centers and are themselves chemosensitive.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Long Noncoding RNA Malat1 Regulates Cerebrovascular Pathologies in Ischemic Stroke</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/7/1797?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The study was designed to determine the role of long noncoding RNA (lncRNA), metastasis-associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1 (Malat1), in ischemic stroke outcome. Primary mouse brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMECs) were cultured and treated with Malat1 GapmeR before 16 h oxygen and glucose depravation (OGD). Cell death was assayed by LDH and MTT methods. Malat1 knock-out and wild-type mice were subjected to 1 h of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) and 24–72 h of reperfusion. To explore the underlying mechanism, apoptotic and inflammatory factors were measured by qPCR, ELISA, and Western blotting. The physical interaction between Malat1 and apoptotic or inflammatory factors was measured by RNA immunoprecipitation. Increased Malat1 levels were found in cultured mouse BMECs after OGD as well as in isolated cerebral microvessels in mice after MCAO. Silencing of Malat1 by Malat1 GapmeR significantly increased OGD-induced cell death and Caspase 3 activity in BMECs. Silencing of Malat1 also significantly aggravated OGD-induced expression of the proapoptotic factor Bim and proinflammatory cytokines MCP-1, IL-6, and E-selectin. Moreover, Malat1 KO mice presented larger brain infarct size, worsened neurological scores, and reduced sensorimotor functions. Consistent with &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; findings, significantly increased expression of proapoptotic and proinflammatory factors was also found in the cerebral cortex of Malat1 KO mice after ischemic stroke compared with WT controls. Finally, we demonstrated that Malat1 binds to Bim and E-selectin both &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. Our study suggests that Malat1 plays critical protective roles in ischemic stroke.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Accumulative studies have demonstrated the important regulatory roles of microRNAs in vascular and neural damage after ischemic stroke. However, the functional significance and mechanisms of other classes of noncoding RNAs in cerebrovascular pathophysiology after stroke are less studied. Here we demonstrate a novel role of Malat1, a long noncoding RNA that has been originally identified as a prognostic marker for non-small cell lung cancer, in cerebrovascular pathogenesis of ischemic stroke. Our experiments have provided the first evidence that Malat1 plays anti-apoptotic and anti-inflammatory roles in brain microvasculature to reduce ischemic cerebral vascular and parenchymal damages. Our studies also suggest that lncRNAs can be therapeutically targeted to minimize poststroke brain damage.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Control of Amygdala Circuits by 5-HT Neurons via 5-HT and Glutamate Cotransmission</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/7/1785?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The serotonin (5-HT) system and the amygdala are key regulators of emotional behavior. Several lines of evidence suggest that 5-HT transmission in the amygdala is implicated in the susceptibility and drug treatment of mood disorders. Therefore, elucidating the physiological mechanisms through which midbrain 5-HT neurons modulate amygdala circuits could be pivotal in understanding emotional regulation in health and disease. To shed light on these mechanisms, we performed patch-clamp recordings from basal amygdala (BA) neurons in brain slices from mice with channelrhodopsin genetically targeted to 5-HT neurons. Optical stimulation of 5-HT terminals at low frequencies (≤1 Hz) evoked a short-latency excitation of BA interneurons (INs) that was depressed at higher frequencies. Pharmacological analysis revealed that this effect was mediated by glutamate and not 5-HT because it was abolished by ionotropic glutamate receptor antagonists. Optical stimulation of 5-HT terminals at higher frequencies (10–20 Hz) evoked both slow excitation and slow inhibition of INs. These effects were mediated by 5-HT because they were blocked by antagonists of 5-HT&lt;sub&gt;2A&lt;/sub&gt; and 5-HT&lt;sub&gt;1A&lt;/sub&gt; receptors, respectively. These fast glutamate- and slow 5-HT-mediated responses often coexisted in the same neuron. Interestingly, fast-spiking and non-fast-spiking INs displayed differential modulation by glutamate and 5-HT. Furthermore, optical stimulation of 5-HT terminals did not evoke glutamate release onto BA principal neurons, but inhibited these cells directly via activation of 5-HT&lt;sub&gt;1A&lt;/sub&gt; receptors and indirectly via enhanced GABA release. Collectively, these findings suggest that 5-HT neurons exert a frequency-dependent, cell-type-specific control over BA circuitry via 5-HT and glutamate co-release to inhibit the BA output.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The modulation of the amygdala by serotonin (5-HT) is important for emotional regulation and is implicated in the pathogenesis and treatment of affective disorders. Therefore, it is essential to determine the physiological mechanisms through which 5-HT neurons in the dorsal raphe nuclei modulate amygdala circuits. Here, we combined optogenetic, electrophysiological, and pharmacological approaches to study the effects of activation of 5-HT axons in the basal nucleus of the amygdala (BA). We found that 5-HT neurons co-release 5-HT and glutamate onto BA neurons in a cell-type-specific and frequency-dependent manner. Therefore, we suggest that theories on the contribution of 5-HT neurons to amygdala function should be revised to incorporate the concept of 5-HT/glutamate cotransmission.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: TREM2 Promotes Microglial Survival by Activating Wnt/{beta}-Catenin Pathway</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/7/1772?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Triggering Receptor Expressed on Myeloid cells 2 (TREM2), which is expressed on myeloid cells including microglia in the CNS, has recently been identified as a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD). TREM2 transmits intracellular signals through its transmembrane binding partner DNAX-activating protein 12 (DAP12). Homozygous mutations inactivating TREM2 or DAP12 lead to Nasu–Hakola disease; however, how AD risk-conferring variants increase AD risk is not clear. To elucidate the signaling pathways underlying reduced TREM2 expression or loss of function in microglia, we respectively knocked down and knocked out the expression of TREM2 in &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; models. We found that TREM2 deficiency reduced the viability and proliferation of primary microglia, reduced microgliosis in &lt;i&gt;Trem2&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt; mouse brains, induced cell cycle arrest at the G&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;/S checkpoint, and decreased the stability of β-catenin, a key component of the canonical Wnt signaling pathway responsible for maintaining many biological processes, including cell survival. TREM2 stabilized β-catenin by inhibiting its degradation via the Akt/GSK3β signaling pathway. More importantly, treatment with Wnt3a, LiCl, or TDZD-8, which activates the β-catenin-mediated Wnt signaling pathway, rescued microglia survival and microgliosis in &lt;i&gt;Trem2&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt; microglia and/or in &lt;i&gt;Trem2&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt; mouse brain. Together, our studies demonstrate a critical role of TREM2-mediated Wnt/β-catenin pathway in microglial viability and suggest that modulating this pathway therapeutically may help to combat the impaired microglial survival and microgliosis associated with AD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Mutations in the &lt;i&gt;TREM2&lt;/i&gt; (Triggering Receptor Expressed on Myeloid cells 2) gene are associated with increased risk for Alzheimer's disease (AD) with effective sizes comparable to that of the apolipoprotein E (&lt;i&gt;APOE&lt;/i&gt;) 4 allele, making it imperative to understand the molecular pathway(s) underlying TREM2 function in microglia. Our findings shed new light on the relationship between TREM2/DNAX-activating protein 12 (DAP12) signaling and Wnt/β-catenin signaling and provide clues as to how reduced TREM2 function might impair microglial survival in AD pathogenesis. We demonstrate that TREM2 promotes microglial survival by activating the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway and that it is possible to restore Wnt/β-catenin signaling when TREM2 activity is disrupted or reduced. Therefore, we demonstrate the potential for manipulating the TREM2/β-catenin signaling pathway for the treatment of AD.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Synapsin II Regulation of GABAergic Synaptic Transmission Is Dependent on Interneuron Subtype</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/7/1757?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Synapsins are epilepsy susceptibility genes that encode phosphoproteins reversibly associated with synaptic vesicles. Synapsin II (SynII) gene deletion produces a deficit in inhibitory synaptic transmission, and this defect is thought to cause epileptic activity. We systematically investigated how SynII affects synchronous and asynchronous release components of inhibitory transmission in the CA1 region of the mouse hippocampus. We found that the asynchronous GABAergic release component is diminished in SynII-deleted (SynII(–)) slices. To investigate this defect at different interneuron subtypes, we selectively blocked either N-type or P/Q-type Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; channels. SynII deletion suppressed the asynchronous release component at synapses dependent on N-type Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; channels but not at synapses dependent on P/Q-type Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; channels. We then performed paired double-patch recordings from inhibitory basket interneurons connected to pyramidal neurons and used cluster analysis to classify interneurons according to their spiking and synaptic parameters. We identified two cell subtypes, presumably parvalbumin (PV) and cholecystokinin (CCK) expressing basket interneurons. To validate our interneuron classification, we took advantage of transgenic animals with fluorescently labeled PV interneurons and confirmed that their spiking and synaptic parameters matched the parameters of presumed PV cells identified by the cluster analysis. The analysis of the release time course at the two interneuron subtypes demonstrated that the asynchronous release component was selectively reduced at SynII(–) CCK interneurons. In contrast, the transmission was desynchronized at SynII(–) PV interneurons. Together, our results demonstrate that SynII regulates the time course of GABAergic release, and that this SynII function is dependent on the interneuron subtype.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Deletion of the neuronal protein synapsin II (SynII) leads to the development of epilepsy, probably due to impairments in inhibitory synaptic transmission. We systematically investigated SynII function at different subtypes of inhibitory neurons in the hippocampus. We discovered that SynII affects the time course of GABA release, and that this effect is interneuron subtype specific. Within one of the subtypes, SynII deficiency synchronizes the release and suppresses the asynchronous release component, while at the other subtype SynII deficiency suppresses the synchronous release component. These results reveal a new SynII function in the regulation of the time course of GABA release and demonstrate that this function is dependent on the interneuron subtype.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Nanoscale Molecular Reorganization of the Inhibitory Postsynaptic Density Is a Determinant of GABAergic Synaptic Potentiation</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/7/1747?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Gephyrin is a key scaffold protein mediating the anchoring of GABAA receptors at inhibitory synapses. Here, we exploited superresolution techniques combined with proximity-based clustering analysis and model simulations to investigate the single-molecule gephyrin reorganization during plasticity of inhibitory synapses in mouse hippocampal cultured neurons. This approach revealed that, during the expression of inhibitory LTP, the increase of gephyrin density at postsynaptic sites is associated with the promoted formation of gephyrin nanodomains. We demonstrate that the gephyrin rearrangement in nanodomains stabilizes the amplitude of postsynaptic currents, indicating that, in addition to the number of synaptic GABAA receptors, the nanoscale distribution of GABAA receptors in the postsynaptic area is a crucial determinant for the expression of inhibitory synaptic plasticity. In addition, the methodology implemented here clears the way to the application of the graph-based theory to single-molecule data for the description and quantification of the spatial organization of the synapse at the single-molecule level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The mechanisms of inhibitory synaptic plasticity are poorly understood, mainly because the size of the synapse is below the diffraction limit, thus reducing the effectiveness of conventional optical and imaging techniques. Here, we exploited superresolution approaches combined with clustering analysis to study at unprecedented resolution the distribution of the inhibitory scaffold protein gephyrin in response to protocols inducing LTP of inhibitory synaptic responses (iLTP). We found that, during the expression of iLTP, the increase of synaptic gephyrin is associated with the fragmentation of gephyrin in subsynaptic nanodomains. We demonstrate that such synaptic gephyrin nanodomains stabilize the amplitude of inhibitory postsynaptic responses, thus identifying the nanoscale gephyrin rearrangement as a key determinant for inhibitory synaptic plasticity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Encoding of Both Reaching and Grasping Kinematics in Dorsal and Ventral Premotor Cortices</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/7/1733?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Classically, it has been hypothesized that reach-to-grasp movements arise from two discrete parietofrontal cortical networks. As part of these networks, the dorsal premotor cortex (PMd) has been implicated in the control of reaching movements of the arm, whereas the ventral premotor cortex (PMv) has been associated with the control of grasping movements of the hand. Recent studies have shown that such a strict delineation of function along anatomical boundaries is unlikely, partly because reaching to different locations can alter distal hand kinematics and grasping different objects can affect kinematics of the proximal arm. Here, we used chronically implanted multielectrode arrays to record unit-spiking activity in both PMd and PMv simultaneously while rhesus macaques engaged in a reach-to-grasp task. Generalized linear models were used to predict the spiking activity of cells in both areas as a function of different kinematic parameters, as well as spike history. To account for the influence of reaching on hand kinematics and vice versa, we applied demixed principal components analysis to define kinematics synergies that maximized variance across either different object locations or grip types. We found that single cells in both PMd and PMv encode the kinematics of both reaching and grasping synergies, suggesting that this classical division of reach and grasp in PMd and PMv, respectively, does not accurately reflect the encoding preferences of cells in those areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; For reach-to-grasp movements, the dorsal premotor cortex (PMd) has been implicated in the control of reaching movements of the arm, whereas the ventral premotor cortex (PMv) has been associated with the control of grasping movements of the hand. We recorded unit-spiking activity in PMd and PMv simultaneously while macaques performed a reach-to-grasp task. We modeled the spiking activity of neurons as a function of kinematic parameters and spike history. We applied demixed principal components analysis to define kinematics synergies. We found that single units in both PMd and PMv encode the kinematics of both reaching and grasping synergies, suggesting that the division of reach and grasp in PMd and PMv, respectively, cannot be made based on their encoding properties.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Trial-by-Trial Motor Cortical Correlates of a Rapidly Adapting Visuomotor Internal Model</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/37/7/1721?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Accurate motor control is mediated by internal models of how neural activity generates movement. We examined neural correlates of an adapting internal model of visuomotor gain in motor cortex while two macaques performed a reaching task in which the gain scaling between the hand and a presented cursor was varied. Previous studies of cortical changes during visuomotor adaptation focused on preparatory and perimovement epochs and analyzed trial-averaged neural data. Here, we recorded simultaneous neural population activity using multielectrode arrays and focused our analysis on neural differences in the period before the target appeared. We found that we could estimate the monkey's internal model of the gain using the neural population state during this pretarget epoch. This neural correlate depended on the gain experienced during recent trials and it predicted the speed of the subsequent reach. To explore the utility of this internal model estimate for brain–machine interfaces, we performed an offline analysis showing that it can be used to compensate for upcoming reach extent errors. Together, these results demonstrate that pretarget neural activity in motor cortex reflects the monkey's internal model of visuomotor gain on single trials and can potentially be used to improve neural prostheses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; When generating movement commands, the brain is believed to use internal models of the relationship between neural activity and the body's movement. Visuomotor adaptation tasks have revealed neural correlates of these computations in multiple brain areas during movement preparation and execution. Here, we describe motor cortical changes in a visuomotor gain change task even before a specific movement is cued. We were able to estimate the gain internal model from these pretarget neural correlates and relate it to single-trial behavior. This is an important step toward understanding the sensorimotor system's algorithms for updating its internal models after specific movements and errors. Furthermore, the ability to estimate the internal model before movement could improve motor neural prostheses being developed for people with paralysis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The United States carries a substantial fiscal burden resulting from the nearly 100 million Americans with neurological disease. The combined annual costs of Alzheimer's and other dementias, low back pain, stroke, traumatic brain injury, migraine, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, spinal cord injury and Parkinson's disease totals nearly 800 billion dollars and is rapidly rising due to the aging of the U.S. population. We provide a summary overview of the substantial current and future economic impact of neurological disease, and provide an action plan for reducing this burden through neurological research and enhanced clinical management of neurological disorders in the United States.

A better knowledge of the flow and pressure distribution in realistic microvascular networks is needed for improving our understanding of neurovascular coupling mechanisms and the related measurement techniques. Here, numerical simulations with discrete tracking of red blood cells (RBCs) are performed in three realistic microvascular networks from the mouse cerebral cortex. Our analysis is based on trajectories of individual RBCs and focuses on layer-specific flow phenomena until a cortical depth of 1 mm. The individual RBC trajectories reveal that in the capillary bed RBCs preferentially move in plane. Hence, the capillary flow field shows laminar patterns and a layer-specific analysis is valid. We demonstrate that for RBCs entering the capillary bed close to the cortical surface (&amp;lt; 400 μm) the largest pressure drop takes place in the capillaries (37%), while for deeper regions arterioles are responsible for 61% of the total pressure drop. Further flow characteristics, such as capillary transit time or RBC velocity, also vary significantly over cortical depth. Comparison of purely topological characteristics with flow-based ones shows that a combined interpretation of topology and flow is indispensable. Our results provide evidence that it is crucial to consider layer-specific differences for all investigations related to the flow and pressure distribution in the cortical vasculature. These findings support the hypothesis that for an efficient oxygen up-regulation at least two regulation mechanisms must be playing hand in hand, namely cerebral blood flow increase and microvascular flow homogenization. However, the contribution of both regulation mechanisms to oxygen up-regulation likely varies over depth.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/IVRfueS8eW0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Mathematical models of tissue stem and transit target cell divisions and the risk of radiation- or smoking-associated cancer</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/4OwAkAkyDh8/article</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Mark P. Little, Jolyon H. Hendry&lt;/p&gt;

There is compelling biological data to suggest that cancer arises from a series of mutations in single target cells, resulting in defects in cell renewal and differentiation processes which lead to malignancy. Because much mutagenic damage is expressed following cell division, more-rapidly renewing tissues could be at higher risk because of the larger number of cell replications. Cairns suggested that renewing tissues may reduce cancer risk by partitioning the dividing cell populations into lineages comprising infrequently-dividing long-lived stem cells and frequently-dividing short-lived daughter transit cells. We develop generalizations of three recent cancer-induction models that account for the joint maintenance and renewal of stem and transit cells, also competing processes of partially transformed cell proliferation and differentiation/apoptosis. We are particularly interested in using these models to separately assess the probabilities of mutation and development of cancer associated with “spontaneous” processes and with those linked to a specific environmental mutagen, specifically ionizing radiation or cigarette smoking. All three models demonstrate substantial variation in cancer risks, by at least 20 orders of magnitude, depending on the assumed number of critical mutations required for cancer, and the stem-cell and transition-cell mutation rates. However, in most cases the conditional probabilities of cancer being mutagen-induced range between 7–96%. The relative risks associated with mutagen exposure compared to background rates are also stable, ranging from 1.0–16.0. Very few cancers, generally &amp;lt;0.5%, arise from mutations occurring solely in stem cells rather than in a combination of stem and transit cells. However, for cancers with 2 or 3 critical mutations, a substantial proportion of cancers, in some cases 100%, have at least one mutation derived from a mutated stem cell. Little difference is made to relative risks if competing processes of proliferation and differentiation in the partially transformed stem and transit cell population are allowed for, nor is any difference made if one assumes that transit cells require an extra mutation to confer malignancy from the number required by stem cells. The probability of a cancer being mutagen-induced correlates across cancer sites with the estimated cumulative number of stem cell divisions in the associated tissue (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.05), although in some cases there is sensitivity of findings to removal of high-leverage outliers and in some cases only modest variation in probability, but these issues do not affect the validity of the findings. There are no significant correlations (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;gt;0.3) between lifetime cancer-site specific radiation risk and the probability of that cancer being mutagen-induced. These results do not depend on the assumed critical number of mutations leading to cancer, or on the assumed mutagen-associated mutation rate, within the generally-accepted ranges tested. However, there are borderline significant negative correlations (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.08) between the smoking-associated mortality rate difference (current vs former smokers) and the probability of cancer being mutagen-induced. This is only the case where values of the critical number of mutations leading to cancer, &lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt;, is 3 or 4 and not for smaller values (1 or 2), but does not strongly depend on the assumed mutagen-associated mutation rate.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/4OwAkAkyDh8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Memories for recent experiences are rich in incidental detail, but with time the brain is thought to extract latent rules and structures common across past experiences. We show that over weeks following the acquisition of two distinct associative memories, neuron firing in the rat prelimbic prefrontal cortex (mPFC) became less selective for perceptual features unique to each association and, with an apparently different time-course, became more selective for common relational features. We further found that during exposure to a novel experimental context, memory expression and neuron selectivity for relational features immediately generalized to the new situation. These neural patterns offer a window into the network-level processes by which the mPFC develops a knowledge structure of the world that can be adaptively applied to new experiences.&lt;/p&gt;

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Flexible neural networks, such as the interconnected spinal neurons that control distinct motor actions, can switch their activity to produce different behaviors. Both excitatory (E) and inhibitory (I) spinal neurons are necessary for motor behavior, but the influence of recruiting different ratios of E-to-I cells remains unclear. We constructed synthetic microphysical neural networks, called circuitoids, using precise combinations of spinal neuron subtypes derived from mouse stem cells. Circuitoids of purified excitatory interneurons were sufficient to generate oscillatory bursts with properties similar to in vivo central pattern generators. Inhibitory V1 neurons provided dual layers of regulation within excitatory rhythmogenic networks - they increased the rhythmic burst frequency of excitatory V3 neurons, and segmented excitatory motor neuron activity into sub-networks. Accordingly, the speed and pattern of spinal circuits that underlie complex motor behaviors may be regulated by quantitatively gating the intra-network cellular activity ratio of E-to-I neurons.&lt;/p&gt;

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The human ubiquitin ligase HUWE1 has key roles in tumorigenesis, yet it is unkown how its activity is regulated. We present the crystal structure of a C-terminal part of HUWE1, including the catalytic domain, and reveal an asymmetric auto-inhibited dimer. We show that HUWE1 dimerizes in solution and self-associates in cells, and that both occurs through the crystallographic dimer interface. We demonstrate that HUWE1 is inhibited in cells and that it can be activated by disruption of the dimer interface. We identify a conserved segment in HUWE1 that counteracts dimer formation by associating with the dimerization region intramolecularly. Our studies reveal, intriguingly, that the tumor suppressor p14ARF binds to this segment and may thus shift the conformational equilibrium of HUWE1 toward the inactive state. We propose a model, in which the activity of HUWE1 underlies conformational control in response to physiological cues—a mechanism that may be exploited for cancer therapy.&lt;/p&gt;

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/content/6/e20975</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Serotonin (5-HT) is associated with mood and motivation but the function of endogenous 5-HT remains controversial. Here, we studied the impact of phasic optogenetic activation of 5-HT neurons in mice over time scales from seconds to weeks. We found that activating dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) 5-HT neurons induced a strong suppression of spontaneous locomotor behavior in the open field with rapid kinetics (onset ≤1 s). Inhibition of locomotion was independent of measures of anxiety or motor impairment and could be overcome by strong motivational drive. Repetitive place-contingent pairing of activation caused neither place preference nor aversion. However, repeated 15 min daily stimulation caused a persistent increase in spontaneous locomotion to emerge over three weeks. These results show that 5-HT transients have strong and opposing short and long-term effects on motor behavior that appear to arise from effects on the underlying factors that motivate actions.&lt;/p&gt;

Protein motions are a key feature to understand biological function. Recently, a large-scale analysis of protein conformational diversity showed a positively skewed distribution with a peak at 0.5 Å C-alpha root-mean-square-deviation (RMSD). To understand this distribution in terms of structure-function relationships, we studied a well curated and large dataset of ~5,000 proteins with experimentally determined conformational diversity. We searched for global behaviour patterns studying how structure-based features change among the available conformer population for each protein. This procedure allowed us to describe the RMSD distribution in terms of three main protein classes sharing given properties. The largest of these protein subsets (~60%), which we call “rigid” (average RMSD = 0.83 Å), has no disordered regions, shows low conformational diversity, the largest tunnels and smaller and buried cavities. The two additional subsets contain disordered regions, but with differential sequence composition and behaviour. Partially disordered proteins have on average 67% of their conformers with disordered regions, average RMSD = 1.1 Å, the highest number of hinges and the longest disordered regions. In contrast, malleable proteins have on average only 25% of disordered conformers and average RMSD = 1.3 Å, flexible cavities affected in size by the presence of disordered regions and show the highest diversity of cognate ligands. Proteins in each set are mostly non-homologous to each other, share no given fold class, nor functional similarity but do share features derived from their conformer population. These shared features could represent conformational mechanisms related with biological functions.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/_HoBMRKlJf4&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

The coordinated behaviour of populations of cells plays a central role in tissue growth and renewal. Cells react to their microenvironment by modulating processes such as movement, growth and proliferation, and signalling. Alongside experimental studies, computational models offer a useful means by which to investigate these processes. To this end a variety of cell-based modelling approaches have been developed, ranging from lattice-based cellular automata to lattice-free models that treat cells as point-like particles or extended shapes. However, it remains unclear how these approaches compare when applied to the same biological problem, and what differences in behaviour are due to different model assumptions and abstractions. Here, we exploit the availability of an implementation of five popular cell-based modelling approaches within a consistent computational framework, Chaste (http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/chaste). This framework allows one to easily change constitutive assumptions within these models. In each case we provide full details of all technical aspects of our model implementations. We compare model implementations using four case studies, chosen to reflect the key cellular processes of proliferation, adhesion, and short- and long-range signalling. These case studies demonstrate the applicability of each model and provide a guide for model usage.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/aC_4z6Wo2U8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Dong-Ping Yang, Hai-Jun Zhou, Changsong Zhou&lt;/p&gt;

The brain is highly energy consuming, therefore is under strong selective pressure to achieve cost-efficiency in both cortical connectivities and activities. However, cost-efficiency as a design principle for cortical activities has been rarely studied. Especially it is not clear how cost-efficiency is related to ubiquitously observed multi-scale properties: irregular firing, oscillations and neuronal avalanches. Here we demonstrate that these prominent properties can be simultaneously observed in a generic, biologically plausible neural circuit model that captures excitation-inhibition balance and realistic dynamics of synaptic conductance. Their co-emergence achieves minimal energy cost as well as maximal energy efficiency on information capacity, when neuronal firing are coordinated and shaped by moderate synchrony to reduce otherwise redundant spikes, and the dynamical clusterings are maintained in the form of neuronal avalanches. Such cost-efficient neural dynamics can be employed as a foundation for further efficient information processing under energy constraint.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/JKS1_70ZB20&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Didac Santesmasses, Marco Mariotti, Roderic Guigó&lt;/p&gt;

Selenocysteine (Sec) is known as the 21st amino acid, a cysteine analogue with selenium replacing sulphur. Sec is inserted co-translationally in a small fraction of proteins called selenoproteins. In selenoprotein genes, the Sec specific tRNA (tRNA&lt;sup&gt;Sec&lt;/sup&gt;) drives the recoding of highly specific UGA codons from stop signals to Sec. Although found in organisms from the three domains of life, Sec is not universal. Many species are completely devoid of selenoprotein genes and lack the ability to synthesize Sec. Since tRNA&lt;sup&gt;Sec&lt;/sup&gt; is a key component in selenoprotein biosynthesis, its efficient identification in genomes is instrumental to characterize the utilization of Sec across lineages. Available tRNA prediction methods fail to accurately predict tRNA&lt;sup&gt;Sec&lt;/sup&gt;, due to its unusual structural fold. Here, we present Secmarker, a method based on manually curated covariance models capturing the specific tRNA&lt;sup&gt;Sec&lt;/sup&gt; structure in archaea, bacteria and eukaryotes. We exploited the non-universality of Sec to build a proper benchmark set for tRNA&lt;sup&gt;Sec&lt;/sup&gt; predictions, which is not possible for the predictions of other tRNAs. We show that Secmarker greatly improves the accuracy of previously existing methods constituting a valuable tool to identify tRNA&lt;sup&gt;Sec&lt;/sup&gt; genes, and to efficiently determine whether a genome contains selenoproteins. We used Secmarker to analyze a large set of fully sequenced genomes, and the results revealed new insights in the biology of tRNA&lt;sup&gt;Sec&lt;/sup&gt;, led to the discovery of a novel bacterial selenoprotein family, and shed additional light on the phylogenetic distribution of selenoprotein containing genomes. Secmarker is freely accessible for download, or online analysis through a web server at http://secmarker.crg.cat.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/rGii86KmsZg&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Spatial separation of two different pathways accounting for the generation of calcium signals in astrocytes</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/CHZDUz5wGrg/article</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Franziska Oschmann, Konstantin Mergenthaler, Evelyn Jungnickel, Klaus Obermayer&lt;/p&gt;

Astrocytes integrate and process synaptic information and exhibit calcium (Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;) signals in response to incoming information from neighboring synapses. The generation of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; signals is mostly attributed to Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; release from internal Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; stores evoked by an elevated metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR) activity. Different experimental results associated the generation of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; signals to the activity of the glutamate transporter (GluT). The GluT itself does not influence the intracellular Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; concentration, but it indirectly activates Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; entry over the membrane. A closer look into Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; signaling in different astrocytic compartments revealed a spatial separation of those two pathways. Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; signals in the soma are mainly generated by Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; release from internal Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; stores (mGluR-dependent pathway). In astrocytic compartments close to the synapse most Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; signals are evoked by Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; entry over the plasma membrane (GluT-dependent pathway). This assumption is supported by the finding, that the volume ratio between the internal Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; store and the intracellular space decreases from the soma towards the synapse. We extended a model for mGluR-dependent Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; signals in astrocytes with the GluT-dependent pathway. Additionally, we included the volume ratio between the internal Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; store and the intracellular compartment into the model in order to analyze Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; signals either in the soma or close to the synapse. Our model results confirm the spatial separation of the mGluR- and GluT-dependent pathways along the astrocytic process. The model allows to study the binary Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; response during a block of either of both pathways. Moreover, the model contributes to a better understanding of the impact of channel densities on the interaction of both pathways and on the Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; signal.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/CHZDUz5wGrg&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Overall cellular responses to biologically-relevant stimuli are mediated by networks of simpler lower-level processes. Although information about some of these processes can now be obtained by visualizing and recording events at the molecular level, this is still possible only in especially favorable cases. Therefore the development of methods to extract the dynamics and relationships between the different lower-level (microscopic) processes from the overall (macroscopic) response remains a crucial challenge in the understanding of many aspects of physiology. Here we have devised a hybrid computational-analytical method to accomplish this task, the SYStems-based MOLecular kinetic scheme Extractor (SYSMOLE). SYSMOLE utilizes system-identification input-output analysis to obtain a transfer function between the stimulus and the overall cellular response in the Laplace-transformed domain. It then derives a Markov-chain state molecular kinetic scheme uniquely associated with the transfer function by means of a classification procedure and an analytical step that imposes general biological constraints. We first tested SYSMOLE with synthetic data and evaluated its performance in terms of its rate of convergence to the correct molecular kinetic scheme and its robustness to noise. We then examined its performance on real experimental traces by analyzing macroscopic calcium-current traces elicited by membrane depolarization. SYSMOLE derived the correct, previously known molecular kinetic scheme describing the activation and inactivation of the underlying calcium channels and correctly identified the accepted mechanism of action of nifedipine, a calcium-channel blocker clinically used in patients with cardiovascular disease. Finally, we applied SYSMOLE to study the pharmacology of a new class of glutamate antipsychotic drugs and their crosstalk mechanism through a heteromeric complex of G protein-coupled receptors. Our results indicate that our methodology can be successfully applied to accurately derive molecular kinetic schemes from experimental macroscopic traces, and we anticipate that it may be useful in the study of a wide variety of biological systems.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/pH320dHrfwU&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Blood-Brain Barrier Breakdown in Reversible Cerebral Vasoconstriction Syndrome: implications for pathophysiology and diagnosis</title>
	<link>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.24891</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h3&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Objective: Diagnosis of reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome (RCVS) is currently based on luminographic findings of vasoconstriction. In addition to vasoconstriction, the blood-brain barrier (BBB) breakdown has been postulated as a central mechanism of RCVS. Our aim was to document BBB breakdown in patients with RCVS and its role for the pathophysiology-based diagnosis of RCVS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: We prospectively recruited 72 consecutive patients with thunderclap headache who did not have aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage from April 2015 to July 2016 at the Samsung Medical Center. Based on the International Classification of Headache Disorder-3 beta criteria and neuroimaging, patients were classified as having RCVS (n=41;‘definite' in 29 imaging-proven patients and ‘probable' in 12 imaging-negative patients), other secondary causes (n=7), and thunderclap headache of undetermined cause (n=24). BBB breakdown was evaluated using contrast-enhanced fluid-attenuated inversion recovery magnetic resonance (FLAIR) imaging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: BBB breakdown was documented in 20 (69.0%) patients with definite RCVS, 3 (25.0%) patients with probable RCVS, and none with other secondary causes. BBB breakdown was present in RCVS patients with (n=4) and without (n=19) concomitant PRES. In patients with RCVS, the extent of BBB breakdown was independently associated with neurological complications (multivariable OR, 1.48 per one territorial increase; 95% CI, 1.04–2.12; adjusted p=0.032). Three (12.5%) patients with thunderclap headache of undetermined cause were newly classified as having RCVS by the presence of BBB breakdown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interpretation: This is the first study to show BBB breakdown in patients with RCVS. This finding might broaden our understanding of the pathophysiology and clinical spectrum of RCVS. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>: Distinct modes of SMAD2 chromatin binding and remodeling shape the transcriptional response to NODAL/Activin signaling</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/content/6/e22474</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;NODAL/Activin signaling orchestrates key processes during embryonic development via SMAD2. How SMAD2 activates programs of gene expression that are modulated over time however, is not known. Here we delineate the sequence of events that occur from SMAD2 binding to transcriptional activation, and the mechanisms underlying them. NODAL/Activin signaling induces dramatic chromatin landscape changes, and a dynamic transcriptional network regulated by SMAD2, acting via multiple mechanisms. Crucially we have discovered two modes of SMAD2 binding. SMAD2 can bind pre-acetylated nucleosome-depleted sites. However, it also binds to unacetylated, closed chromatin, independently of pioneer factors, where it induces nucleosome displacement and histone acetylation. For a subset of genes, this requires SMARCA4. We find that long term modulation of the transcriptional responses requires continued NODAL/Activin signaling. Thus SMAD2 binding does not linearly equate with transcriptional kinetics, and our data suggest that SMAD2 recruits multiple co-factors during sustained signaling to shape the downstream transcriptional program.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>: Aberrant corticosteroid metabolism in tumor cells enables GR takeover in enzalutamide resistant prostate cancer</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/content/6/e20183</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Prostate cancer is driven by androgen stimulation of the androgen receptor (AR). The next-generation AR antagonist, enzalutamide, prolongs survival, but resistance and lethal disease eventually prevail. Emerging data suggest that the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) is upregulated in this context, stimulating expression of AR-target genes that permit continued growth despite AR blockade. However, countering this mechanism by administration of GR antagonists is problematic because GR is essential for life. We show that enzalutamide treatment in human models of prostate cancer and patient tissues is accompanied by a ubiquitin E3-ligase, AMFR, mediating loss of 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase-2 (11β-HSD2), which otherwise inactivates cortisol, sustaining tumor cortisol concentrations to stimulate GR and enzalutamide resistance. Remarkably, reinstatement of 11β-HSD2 expression, or AMFR loss, reverses enzalutamide resistance in mouse xenograft tumors. Together, these findings reveal a surprising metabolic mechanism of enzalutamide resistance that may be targeted with a strategy that circumvents a requirement for systemic GR ablation.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Metabolic regulation is sufficient for global and robust coordination of glucose uptake, catabolism, energy production and growth in &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt;</title>

The metabolism of microorganisms is regulated through two main mechanisms: changes of enzyme capacities as a consequence of gene expression modulation (“hierarchical control”) and changes of enzyme activities through metabolite-enzyme interactions. An increasing body of evidence indicates that hierarchical control is insufficient to explain metabolic behaviors, but the system-wide impact of metabolic regulation remains largely uncharacterized. To clarify its role, we developed and validated a detailed kinetic model of &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; central metabolism that links growth to environment. Metabolic control analyses confirm that the control is widely distributed across the network and highlight strong interconnections between all the pathways. Exploration of the model solution space reveals that several robust properties emerge from metabolic regulation, from the molecular level (&lt;i&gt;e&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt;. homeostasis of total metabolite pool) to the overall cellular physiology (&lt;i&gt;e&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt;. coordination of carbon uptake, catabolism, energy and redox production, and growth), while allowing a large degree of flexibility at most individual metabolic steps. These properties have important physiological implications for &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt; and significantly expand the self-regulating capacities of its metabolism.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/pRZDDITnOus&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Seasonal influenza epidemics offer unique opportunities to study the invasion and re-invasion waves of a pathogen in a partially immune population. Detailed patterns of spread remain elusive, however, due to lack of granular disease data. Here we model high-volume city-level medical claims data and human mobility proxies to explore the drivers of influenza spread in the US during 2002–2010. Although the speed and pathways of spread varied across seasons, seven of eight epidemics likely originated in the Southern US. Each epidemic was associated with 1–5 early long-range transmission events, half of which sparked onward transmission. Gravity model estimates indicate a sharp decay in influenza transmission with the distance between infectious and susceptible cities, consistent with spread dominated by work commutes rather than air traffic. Two early-onset seasons associated with antigenic novelty had particularly localized modes of spread, suggesting that novel strains may spread in a more localized fashion than previously anticipated.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/9OF3aAuqm4U&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>: Spontaneous activation of visual pigments in relation to openness/closedness of chromophore-binding pocket</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/content/6/e18492</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Visual pigments can be spontaneously activated by internal thermal energy, generating noise that interferes with real-light detection. Recently, we developed a physicochemical theory that successfully predicts the rate of spontaneous activity of representative rod and cone pigments from their peak-absorption wavelength (λ&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;), with pigments having longer λ&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; being noisier. Interestingly, cone pigments may generally be ~25 fold noisier than rod pigments of the same λ&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;, possibly ascribed to an ‘open’ chromophore-binding pocket in cone pigments defined by the capability of chromophore-exchange in darkness. Here, we show in mice that the λ&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;-dependence of pigment noise could be extended even to a mutant pigment, E122Q-rhodopsin. Moreover, although E122Q-rhodopsin shows some cone-pigment-like characteristics, its noise remained quantitatively predictable by the ‘non-open’ nature of its chromophore-binding pocket as in wild-type rhodopsin. The openness/closedness of the chromophore-binding pocket is potentially a useful indicator of whether a pigment is intended for detecting dim or bright light.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chronic use of opioid analgesics can cause analgesic tolerance and opioid-induced hyperalgesia (OIH), contributing to dose escalation in patients. Corder et al. here provide evidence that, in mice, these unwanted effects, and the underlying altered circuit plasticity, are mediated by μ opioid receptors (MORs) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The neural circuitry mediating the ability to produce learned responses to social cues is unknown. Here, 'observer' rats watched 'demonstrator' rats that received footshocks paired with a tone; with social learning, observers learned to freeze in response to the tone.

&lt;p&gt;Individuals with Alzheimer disease (AD) often have difficulties with spatial navigation, which depends on the entorhinal cortex (EC), but whether tau aggregates affect the EC in AD is unclear. Fu et al. studied mice expressing aggregable human tau in the hippocampal formation (EC-tau mice). Compared &lt;/p&gt;

	<content:encoded>Neurons affected in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) experience mitochondrial dysfunction and a bioenergetic deficit that occurs early and promotes the disease-defining amyloid beta peptide (Aβ) and Tau pathologies. Emerging findings suggest that the autophagy/lysosome pathway that removes damaged mitochondria (mitophagy) is also compromised in AD, resulting in the accumulation of dysfunctional mitochondria. Results in animal and cellular models of AD and in patients with sporadic late-onset AD suggest that impaired mitophagy contributes to synaptic dysfunction and cognitive deficits by triggering Aβ and Tau accumulation through increases in oxidative damage and cellular energy deficits; these, in turn, impair mitophagy.</content:encoded>

	<title>: Cap-proximal nucleotides via differential eIF4E binding and alternative promoter usage mediate translational response to energy stress</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/content/6/e21907</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Transcription start-site (TSS) selection and alternative promoter (AP) usage contribute to gene expression complexity but little is known about their impact on translation. Here we performed TSS mapping of the translatome following energy stress. Assessing the contribution of cap-proximal TSS nucleotides, we found dramatic effect on translation only upon stress. As eIF4E levels were reduced, we determined its binding to capped-RNAs with different initiating nucleotides and found the lowest affinity to 5'cytidine in correlation with the translational stress-response. In addition, the number of differentially translated APs was elevated following stress. These include novel glucose starvation-induced downstream transcripts for the translation regulators eIF4A and Pabp, which are also translationally-induced despite general translational inhibition. The resultant eIF4A protein is N-terminally truncated and acts as eIF4A inhibitor. The induced Pabp isoform has shorter 5'UTR removing an auto-inhibitory element. Our findings uncovered several levels of coordination of transcription and translation responses to energy stress.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>: ERG-28 controls BK channel trafficking in the ER to regulate synaptic function and alcohol response in C. elegans</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/content/6/e24733</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Voltage- and calcium-dependent BK channels regulate calcium-dependent cellular events such as neurotransmitter release by limiting calcium influx. Their plasma membrane abundance is an important factor in determining BK current and thus regulation of calcium-dependent events. In &lt;em&gt;C. elegans&lt;/em&gt;, we show that ERG-28, an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane protein, promotes the trafficking of SLO-1 BK channels from the ER to the plasma membrane by shielding them from premature degradation. In the absence of ERG-28, SLO-1 channels undergo aspartic protease DDI-1-dependent degradation, resulting in markedly reduced expression at presynaptic terminals. Loss of &lt;em&gt;erg-28&lt;/em&gt; suppressed phenotypic defects of &lt;em&gt;slo-1&lt;/em&gt; gain-of-function mutants in locomotion, neurotransmitter release, and calcium-mediated asymmetric differentiation of the AWC olfactory neuron pair, and conferred significant ethanol-resistant locomotory behavior, resembling &lt;em&gt;slo-1&lt;/em&gt; loss-of-function mutants, albeit to a lesser extent. Our study thus indicates that the control of BK channel trafficking is a critical regulatory mechanism for synaptic transmission and neural function.&lt;/p&gt;

Here, we now extend these findings by showing that these interactions between &lt;em&gt;daf-7&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;tph-1&lt;/em&gt; regulate redundancy and synergy among neurons in food encoding through coordinated control of circuit-level signal and noise properties. Our analysis further shows that &lt;em&gt;daf-7&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;tph-1&lt;/em&gt; contribute to most of the food-responsiveness in the modulation of lifespan. We applied a computational model to capture the general coding features of this system. This model agrees with our previous genetic analysis and highlights the consequences of redundancy and synergy during information transmission, suggesting a rationale for the regulation of these information processing features.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>: The golden mimicry complex uses a wide spectrum of defence to deter a community of predators</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/content/6/e22089</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Mimicry complexes typically consist of multiple species that deter predators using similar anti-predatory signals. Mimics in these complexes are assumed to vary in their level of defence from highly defended through to moderately defended, or not defended at all. Here, we report a new multi-order mimicry complex that includes at least 140 different putative mimics from four arthropod orders including ants, wasps, bugs, tree hoppers and spiders. All members of this mimicry complex are characterised by a conspicuous golden body and an ant &lt;em&gt;Gestalt&lt;/em&gt;, but vary substantially in their defensive traits. However, they were similarly effective at deterring predators - even mildly defended mimics were rarely eaten by a community of invertebrate and vertebrate predators both in the wild and during staged trials. We propose that despite the predominance of less defended mimics the three predatory guilds avoid the mimics because of the additive influence of the various defensive traits.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>: Functional double dissociation within the entorhinal cortex for visual scene-dependent choice behavior</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/content/6/e21543</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;How visual scene memory is processed differentially by the upstream structures of the hippocampus is largely unknown. We sought to dissociate functionally the lateral and medial subdivisions of the entorhinal cortex (LEC and MEC, respectively) in visual scene-dependent tasks by temporarily inactivating the LEC and MEC in the same rat. When the rat made spatial choices in a T-maze using visual scenes displayed on LCD screens, the inactivation of the MEC but not the LEC produced severe deficits in performance. However, when the task required the animal to push a jar or to dig in the sand in the jar using the same scene stimuli, the LEC but not the MEC became important. Our findings suggest that the entorhinal cortex is critical for scene-dependent mnemonic behavior, and the response modality may interact with a sensory modality to determine the involvement of the LEC and MEC in scene-based memory tasks.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>: Generation of shape complexity through tissue conflict resolution</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/content/6/e20156</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Out-of-plane tissue deformations are key morphogenetic events during plant and animal development that generate 3D shapes, such as flowers or limbs. However, the mechanisms by which spatiotemporal patterns of gene expression modify cellular behaviours to generate such deformations remain to be established. We use the Snapdragon flower as a model system to address this problem. Combining cellular analysis with tissue-level modelling, we show that an orthogonal pattern of growth orientations plays a key role in generating out-of-plane deformations. This growth pattern is most likely oriented by a polarity field, highlighted by PIN1 protein localisation, and is modulated by dorsoventral gene activity. The orthogonal growth pattern interacts with other patterns of differential growth to create tissue conflicts that shape the flower. Similar shape changes can be generated by contraction as well as growth, suggesting tissue conflict resolution provides a flexible morphogenetic mechanism for generating shape diversity in plants and animals.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>: A long-term epigenetic memory switch controls bacterial virulence bimodality</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/content/6/e19599</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;When pathogens enter the host, sensing of environmental cues activates the expression of virulence genes. Opposite transition of pathogens from activating to non-activating conditions is poorly understood. Interestingly, variability in the expression of virulence genes upon infection enhances colonization. In order to systematically detect the role of phenotypic variability in enteropathogenic &lt;em&gt;E. coli&lt;/em&gt; (EPEC), an important human pathogen, both in virulence activating and non-activating conditions, we employed the ScanLag methodology. The analysis revealed a bimodal growth rate. Mathematical modeling combined with experimental analysis showed that this bimodality is mediated by a hysteretic memory-switch that results in the stable co-existence of non-virulent and hyper-virulent subpopulations, even after many generations of growth in non-activating conditions. We identified the &lt;em&gt;per&lt;/em&gt; operon as the key component of the hysteretic switch. This unique hysteretic memory switch may result in persistent infection and enhanced host-to-host spreading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Objective&lt;/b&gt;: Determine if common polymorphisms in CACNA1G, CACNA1H, CACNA1I, and ABCB1 are associated with differential short term seizure outcome in Childhood Absence Epilepsy (CAE).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Methods&lt;/b&gt;: 446 CAE children in a randomized double blind trial of ethosuximide, lamotrigine and valproate had short term seizure outcome determined. Associations between polymorphisms (minor allele frequency ≥15%) in four genes and seizure outcomes were assessed. &lt;em&gt;In vitro&lt;/em&gt; electrophysiology on transfected CACNA1H channels determined impact of one variant on T-type calcium channel responsiveness to ethosuximide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Results&lt;/b&gt;: 80% (357/446) of subjects had informative short term seizure status (242 seizure free, 115 not seizure free). In ethosuximide subjects, two polymorphisms (CACNA1H rs61734410/P640L, CACNA1I rs3747178) appeared more commonly among not seizure free participants (p=0.011; Odds Ratio (OR):2.63; 95% Confidence limits (CL):1.25-5.56, p=0.026; OR:2.38; 95%CL:1.11-5.00). In lamotrigine subjects, one ABCB1 missense polymorphism (rs2032582/S893A, p=0.015; OR:2.22; 95%CL:1.16-4.17) was more common in not seizure free participants, two CACNA1H polymorphisms (rs2753326, rs2753325) were more common in seizure free participants (p=0.038; OR:0.52; 95%CL:0.28-0.96). In valproate subjects, no common polymorphisms associated with seizure status. &lt;em&gt;In vitro&lt;/em&gt; electrophysiological studies showed no effect of the P640L polymorphism on channel physiology in ethosuximide's absence. Ethosuximide's effect on rate of decay of Ca&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;3.2 was significantly less for P640L channel compared to wild type channel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Interpretation&lt;/b&gt;: Four T-type calcium channel variants and one ABCB1 transporter variant were associated with differential drug response in CAE. The &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt; P640L variant's ethosuximide effect was confirmed by &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt; electrophysiological studies. This suggests genetic variation plays a role in differential CAE drug response. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>: Role of Tim17 in coupling the import motor to the translocation channel of the mitochondrial presequence translocase</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/content/6/e22696</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The majority of mitochondrial proteins use N-terminal presequences for targeting to mitochondria and are translocated by the presequence translocase. During translocation, proteins, threaded through the channel in the inner membrane, are handed over to the import motor at the matrix face. Tim17 is an essential, membrane-embedded subunit of the translocase; however, its function is only poorly understood. Here, we functionally dissected its four predicted transmembrane (TM) segments. Mutations in TM1 and TM2 impaired the interaction of Tim17 with Tim23, component of the translocation channel, whereas mutations in TM3 compromised binding of the import motor. We identified residues in the matrix-facing region of Tim17 involved in binding of the import motor. Our results reveal functionally distinct roles of different regions of Tim17 and suggest how they may be involved in handing over the proteins, during their translocation into mitochondria, from the channel to the import motor of the presequence translocase.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>: Elucidation of a four-site allosteric network in fibroblast growth factor receptor tyrosine kinases</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/content/6/e21137</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) signaling is tightly regulated by protein allostery within the intracellular tyrosine kinase domains. Yet the molecular determinants of allosteric connectivity in tyrosine kinase domain are incompletely understood. By means of structural (X-ray and NMR) and functional characterization of pathogenic gain-of-function mutations affecting the FGF receptor (FGFR) tyrosine kinase domain, we elucidated a long-distance allosteric network composed of four interconnected sites termed the ‘molecular brake’, ‘DFG latch’, ‘A-loop plug’, and ‘αC tether’. The first three sites repress the kinase from adopting an active conformation, whereas the αC tether promotes the active conformation. The skewed design of this four-site allosteric network imposes tight autoinhibition and accounts for the incomplete mimicry of the activated conformation by pathogenic mutations targeting a single site. Based on the structural similarity shared among RTKs, we propose that this allosteric model for FGFR kinases is applicable to other RTKs.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>: Disordered clusters of Bak dimers rupture mitochondria during apoptosis</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/content/6/e19944</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;During apoptosis, Bak and Bax undergo major conformational change and form symmetric dimers that coalesce to perforate the mitochondrial outer membrane via an unknown mechanism. We have employed cysteine labelling and linkage analysis to the full length of Bak in mitochondria. This comprehensive survey showed that in each Bak dimer the N-termini are fully solvent-exposed and mobile, the core is highly structured, and the C-termini are flexible but restrained by their contact with the membrane. Dimer-dimer interactions were more labile than the BH3:groove interaction within dimers, suggesting there is no extensive protein interface between dimers. In addition, linkage in the mobile Bak N-terminus (V61C) specifically quantified association between dimers, allowing mathematical simulations of dimer arrangement. Together, our data show that Bak dimers form disordered clusters to generate lipidic pores. These findings provide a molecular explanation for the observed structural heterogeneity of the apoptotic pore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Defining the organizational principles of neuronal networks at the cellular scale, or micro-connectomics, is a key challenge of modern neuroscience. In this Review, we focus on graph theoretical parameters of micro-connectome topology, often informed by economical principles that conceptually originated with Ramón y Cajal's conservation &lt;/p&gt;

	<title>: Epigenetic regulation of lateralized fetal spinal gene expression underlies hemispheric asymmetries</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/content/6/e22784</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Lateralization is a fundamental principle of nervous system organization but its molecular determinants are mostly unknown. In humans, asymmetric gene expression in the fetal cortex has been suggested as the molecular basis of handedness. However, human fetuses already show considerable asymmetries in arm movements before the motor cortex is functionally linked to the spinal cord, making it more likely that spinal gene expression asymmetries form the molecular basis of handedness. We analyzed genome-wide mRNA expression and DNA methylation in cervical and anterior thoracal spinal cord segments of five human fetuses and show development-dependent gene expression asymmetries. These gene expression asymmetries were epigenetically regulated by miRNA expression asymmetries in the TGF-β signaling pathway and lateralized methylation of CpG islands. Our findings suggest that molecular mechanisms for epigenetic regulation within the spinal cord constitute the starting point for handedness, implying a fundamental shift in our understanding of the ontogenesis of hemispheric asymmetries in humans.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>: KEAP1 loss modulates sensitivity to kinase targeted therapy in lung cancer</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/content/6/e18970</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Inhibitors that target the receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK)/Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway have led to clinical responses in lung and other cancers, but some patients fail to respond and in those that do resistance inevitably occurs (&lt;a class=&quot;xref-bibr&quot; href=&quot;https://elifesciences.org/#bib2&quot;&gt;Balak et al., 2006&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a class=&quot;xref-bibr&quot; href=&quot;https://elifesciences.org/#bib30&quot;&gt;Kosaka et al., 2006&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a class=&quot;xref-bibr&quot; href=&quot;https://elifesciences.org/#bib37&quot;&gt;Rudin et al., 2013&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a class=&quot;xref-bibr&quot; href=&quot;https://elifesciences.org/#bib45&quot;&gt;Wagle et al., 2011&lt;/a&gt;). To understand intrinsic and acquired resistance to inhibition of MAPK signaling, we performed CRISPR-Cas9 gene deletion screens in the setting of BRAF, MEK, EGFR, and ALK inhibition. Loss of &lt;em&gt;KEAP1&lt;/em&gt;, a negative regulator of NFE2L2/NRF2, modulated the response to BRAF, MEK, EGFR, and ALK inhibition in BRAF-, NRAS-, KRAS-, EGFR-, and ALK-mutant lung cancer cells. Treatment with inhibitors targeting the RTK/MAPK pathway increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) in cells with intact KEAP1, and loss of KEAP1 abrogated this increase. In addition, loss of KEAP1 altered cell metabolism to allow cells to proliferate in the absence of MAPK signaling. These observations suggest that alterations in the KEAP1/NRF2 pathway may promote survival in the presence of multiple inhibitors targeting the RTK/Ras/MAPK pathway.&lt;/p&gt;

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/content/6/e21481</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Optimal decision-making requires balancing fast but error-prone and more accurate but slower decisions through adjustments of decision thresholds. Here, we demonstrate two distinct correlates of such speed-accuracy adjustments by recording subthalamic nucleus (STN) activity and electroencephalography in 11 Parkinson’s disease patients during a perceptual decision-making task; STN low-frequency oscillatory (LFO) activity (2–8 Hz), coupled to activity at prefrontal electrode Fz, and STN beta activity (13–30 Hz) coupled to electrodes C3/C4 close to motor cortex. These two correlates differed not only in their cortical topography and spectral characteristics but also in the relative timing of recruitment and in their precise relationship with decision thresholds. Increases of STN LFO power preceding the response predicted increased thresholds only after accuracy instructions, while cue-induced reductions of STN beta power decreased thresholds irrespective of instructions. These findings indicate that distinct neural mechanisms determine whether a decision will be made in haste or with caution.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>: The LIM protein complex establishes a retinal circuitry of visual adaptation by regulating Pax6 α-enhancer activity</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/content/6/e21303</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The visual responses of vertebrates are sensitive to the overall composition of retinal interneurons including amacrine cells, which tune the activity of the retinal circuitry. The expression of &lt;em&gt;Paired-homeobox 6 (PAX6)&lt;/em&gt; is regulated by multiple cis-DNA elements including the intronic α-enhancer, which is active in GABAergic amacrine cell subsets. Here, we report that the transforming growth factor ß1-induced transcript 1 protein (Tgfb1i1) interacts with the LIM domain transcription factors Lhx3 and Isl1 to inhibit the α-enhancer in the post-natal mouse retina. &lt;em&gt;Tgfb1i1&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; mice show elevated α-enhancer activity leading to overproduction of Pax6ΔPD isoform that supports the GABAergic amacrine cell fate maintenance. Consequently, the &lt;em&gt;Tgfb1i1&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; mouse retinas show a sustained light response, which becomes more transient in mice with the auto-stimulation-defective &lt;em&gt;Pax6&lt;sup&gt;ΔPBS/ΔPBS&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt; mutation. Together, we show the antagonistic regulation of the α-enhancer activity by Pax6 and the LIM protein complex is necessary for the establishment of an inner retinal circuitry, which controls visual adaptation.&lt;/p&gt;

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/content/6/e21221</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Pharmacological targeting of transcription factors holds great promise for the development of new therapeutics, but strategies based on blockade of DNA binding, nuclear shuttling, or individual protein partner recruitment have yielded limited success to date. Transcription factors typically engage in complex interaction networks, likely masking the effects of specifically inhibiting single protein-protein interactions. Here, we used a combination of genomic, proteomic and biophysical methods to discover a suite of protein-protein interactions involving the SOX18 transcription factor, a known regulator of vascular development and disease. We describe a small-molecule that is able to disrupt a discrete subset of SOX18-dependent interactions. This compound selectively suppressed SOX18 transcriptional outputs in vitro and interfered with vascular development in zebrafish larvae. In a mouse pre-clinical model of breast cancer, treatment with this inhibitor significantly improved survival by reducing tumour vascular density and metastatic spread. Our studies validate an interactome-based molecular strategy to interfere with transcription factor activity, for the development of novel disease therapeutics.&lt;/p&gt;

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Desmoplasia, a fibrotic mass including cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) and self-sustaining extracellular matrix (D-ECM), is a puzzling feature of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDACs). Conflicting studies have identified tumor-restricting and tumor-promoting roles of PDAC-associated desmoplasia, suggesting that individual CAF/D-ECM protein constituents have distinguishable tumorigenic and tumor-repressive functions. Using 3D culture of normal pancreatic versus PDAC-associated human fibroblasts, we identified a CAF/D-ECM phenotype that correlates with improved patient outcomes, and that includes CAFs enriched in plasma membrane-localized, active α&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;β&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-integrin. Mechanistically, we established that TGFβ is required for D-ECM production but dispensable for D-ECM-induced naïve fibroblast-to-CAF activation, which depends on α&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;β&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;-integrin redistribution of pFAK-independent active α&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;β&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-integrin to assorted endosomes. Importantly, the development of a simultaneous multi-channel immunofluorescence approach and new algorithms for computational batch-analysis and their application to a human PDAC panel, indicated that stromal localization and levels of active SMAD2/3 and α&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;β&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-integrin distinguish patient-protective from patient-detrimental desmoplasia and foretell tumor recurrences, suggesting a useful new prognostic tool.&lt;/p&gt;

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/content/6/e19505</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;For group-living animals traveling through heterogeneous landscapes, collective movement can be influenced by both habitat structure and social interactions. Yet research in collective behavior has largely neglected habitat influences on movement. Here we integrate simultaneous, high-resolution, tracking of wild baboons within a troop with a 3-dimensional reconstruction of their habitat to identify key drivers of baboon movement. A previously unexplored social influence – baboons’ preference for locations that other troop members have recently traversed – is the most important predictor of individual movement decisions. Habitat is shown to influence movement over multiple spatial scales, from long-range attraction and repulsion from the troop’s sleeping site, to relatively local influences including road-following and a short-range avoidance of dense vegetation. Scaling to the collective level reveals a clear association between habitat features and the emergent structure of the group, highlighting the importance of habitat heterogeneity in shaping group coordination.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>: Oxytocin improves behavioral and electrophysiological deficits in a novel Shank3-deficient rat</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/content/6/e18904</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Mutations in the synaptic gene &lt;em&gt;SHANK3&lt;/em&gt; lead to a neurodevelopmental disorder known as Phelan-McDermid syndrome (PMS). PMS is a relatively common monogenic and highly penetrant cause of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and intellectual disability (ID), and frequently presents with attention deficits. The underlying neurobiology of PMS is not fully known and pharmacological treatments for core symptoms do not exist. Here, we report the production and characterization of a &lt;em&gt;Shank3&lt;/em&gt;-deficient rat model of PMS, with a genetic alteration similar to a human SHANK3 mutation. We show that &lt;em&gt;Shank3&lt;/em&gt;-deficient rats exhibit impaired long-term social recognition memory and attention, and reduced synaptic plasticity in the hippocampal-medial prefrontal cortex pathway. These deficits were attenuated with oxytocin treatment. The effect of oxytocin on reversing non-social attention deficits is a particularly novel finding, and the results implicate an oxytocinergic contribution in this genetically defined subtype of ASD and ID, suggesting an individualized therapeutic approach for PMS.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Typical and atypical pathology in primary progressive aphasia variants</title>
	<link>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.24885</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h3&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Objective.&lt;/b&gt; To characterize &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt; signatures of pathological diagnosis in a large cohort of patients with primary progressive aphasia (PPA) variants defined by current diagnostic classification.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Methods.&lt;/b&gt; Extensive clinical, cognitive, neuroimaging, and neuropathological data were collected from 69 patients with sporadic PPA, divided into 29 semantic (svPPA), 25 non-fluent (nfvPPA), 11 logopenic (lvPPA), and 4 mixed PPA. Patterns of grey matter (GM) and white matter (WM) atrophy at presentation were assessed and tested as predictors of pathological diagnosis using support vector machine (SVM) algorithms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Results.&lt;/b&gt; A clinical diagnosis of PPA was associated with frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) with TDP inclusions in 40.5%, FTLD-tau in 40.5%, and Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology in 19% of cases. Each variant was associated with one typical pathology: 24/29 (83%) svPPA showed FTLD-TDP type C, 22/25 (88%) nfvPPA showed FTLD-tau, and all 11 lvPPA had AD. Within FTLD-tau, 4R-tau pathology was commonly associated with nfvPPA, whereas Pick's disease was observed in a minority of subjects across all variants except for lvPPA. Compared with pathologically typical cases, svPPA-tau showed significant extrapyramidal signs, greater executive impairment, and severe striatal and frontal GM and WM atrophy. nfvPPA-TDP patients lacked general motor symptoms or significant WM atrophy. Combining GM and WM volumes, SVM analysis showed 92.7% accuracy to distinguish FTLD-tau and FTLD-TDP pathologies across variants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Interpretation.&lt;/b&gt; Each PPA clinical variant is associated with a typical and most frequent cognitive, neuroimaging, and neuropathological profile. Specific clinical and early anatomical features may suggest rare and atypical pathological diagnosis &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt;. This article is protected by copyright.

	<title>: The paranodal cytoskeleton clusters Na+ channels at nodes of Ranvier</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/content/6/e21392</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A high density of Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channels at nodes of Ranvier is necessary for rapid and efficient action potential propagation in myelinated axons. Na+ channel clustering is thought to depend on two axonal cell adhesion molecules that mediate interactions between the axon and myelinating glia at the nodal gap (i.e., NF186) and the paranodal junction (i.e., Caspr). Here we show that while Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channels cluster at nodes in the absence of NF186, they fail to do so in double conditional knockout mice lacking both NF186 and the paranodal cell adhesion molecule Caspr, demonstrating that a paranodal junction-dependent mechanism can cluster Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channels at nodes. Furthermore, we show that paranode-dependent clustering of nodal Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channels requires axonal βII spectrin which is concentrated at paranodes. Our results reveal that the paranodal junction-dependent mechanism of Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;channel clustering is mediated by the spectrin-based paranodal axonal cytoskeleton.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>: Direct measurement of TRPV4 and PIEZO1 activity reveals multiple mechanotransduction pathways in chondrocytes</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/content/6/e21074</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The joints of mammals are lined with cartilage, comprised of individual chondrocytes embedded in a specialized extracellular matrix. Chondrocytes experience a complex mechanical environment and respond to changing mechanical loads in order to maintain cartilage homeostasis. It has been proposed that mechanically gated ion channels are of functional importance in chondrocyte mechanotransduction; however, direct evidence of mechanical current activation in these cells has been lacking. We have used high-speed pressure clamp and elastomeric pillar arrays to apply distinct mechanical stimuli to primary murine chondrocytes, stretch of the membrane and deflection of cell-substrate contacts points, respectively. Both TRPV4 and PIEZO1 channels contribute to currents activated by stimuli applied at cell-substrate contacts but only PIEZO1 mediates stretch-activated currents. These data demonstrate that there are separate, but overlapping, mechanoelectrical transduction pathways in chondrocytes.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>: Adult-born neurons modify excitatory synaptic transmission to existing neurons</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/content/6/e19886</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Adult-born neurons are continually produced in the dentate gyrus but it is unclear whether synaptic integration of new neurons affects the pre-existing circuit. Here we investigated how manipulating neurogenesis in adult mice alters excitatory synaptic transmission to mature dentate neurons. Enhancing neurogenesis by conditional deletion of the pro-apoptotic gene &lt;em&gt;Bax&lt;/em&gt; in stem cells reduced excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) and spine density in mature neurons, whereas genetic ablation of neurogenesis increased EPSCs in mature neurons. Unexpectedly, we found that &lt;em&gt;Bax&lt;/em&gt; deletion in developing and mature dentate neurons increased EPSCs and prevented neurogenesis-induced synaptic suppression. Together these results show that neurogenesis modifies synaptic transmission to mature neurons in a manner consistent with a redistribution of pre-existing synapses to newly integrating neurons and that a non-apoptotic function of the Bax signaling pathway contributes to ongoing synaptic refinement within the dentate circuit.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>: Pathogenic PS1 phosphorylation at Ser367</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/content/6/e19720</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The high levels of serine (S) and threonine (T) residues within the Presenilin 1 (PS1) N-terminus and in the large hydrophilic loop region suggest that the enzymatic function of PS1/γ-secretase can be modulated by its ‘phosphorylated’ and ‘dephosphorylated’ states. However, the functional outcome of PS1 phosphorylation and its significance for Alzheimer’s disease (AD) pathogenesis is poorly understood. Here, comprehensive analysis using FRET-based imaging reveals that activity-driven and Protein Kinase A-mediated PS1 phosphorylation at three domains (domain 1: T74, domain 2: S310 and S313, domain 3: S365, S366, and S367), with S367 being critical, is responsible for the PS1 pathogenic ‘closed’ conformation, and resulting increase in the Aβ42/40 ratio. Moreover, we have established novel imaging assays for monitoring PS1 conformation in vivo, and report that PS1 phosphorylation induces the pathogenic conformational shift in the living mouse brain. These phosphorylation sites represent potential new targets for AD treatment.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>: Modeling susceptibility to drug-induced long QT with a panel of subject-specific induced pluripotent stem cells</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/content/6/e19406</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A large number of drugs can induce prolongation of cardiac repolarization and life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias. The prediction of this side effect is however challenging as it usually develops in some genetically predisposed individuals with normal cardiac repolarization at baseline. Here, we describe a platform based on a genetically diverse panel of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) that reproduces susceptibility to develop a cardiotoxic drug response. We generated iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes from patients presenting in vivo with extremely low or high changes in cardiac repolarization in response to a pharmacological challenge with sotalol. In vitro, the responses to sotalol were highly variable but strongly correlated to the inter-individual differences observed in vivo. Transcriptomic profiling identified dysregulation of genes (&lt;em&gt;DLG2, KCNE4, PTRF, HTR2C&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;CAMKV&lt;/em&gt;) involved in downstream regulation of cardiac repolarization machinery as underlying high sensitivity to sotalol. Our findings offer novel insights for the development of iPSC-based screening assays for testing individual drug reactions.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>: Stimulus relevance modulates contrast adaptation in visual cortex</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/content/6/e21589</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A general principle of sensory processing is that neurons adapt to sustained stimuli by reducing their response over time. Most of our knowledge on adaptation in single cells is based on experiments in anesthetized animals. How responses adapt in awake animals, when stimuli may be behaviorally relevant or not, remains unclear. Here we show that contrast adaptation in mouse primary visual cortex depends on the behavioral relevance of the stimulus. Cells that adapted to contrast under anesthesia maintained or even increased their activity in awake naïve mice. When engaged in a visually guided task, contrast adaptation re-occurred for stimuli that were irrelevant for solving the task. However, contrast adaptation was reversed when stimuli acquired behavioral relevance. Regulation of cortical adaptation by task demand may allow dynamic control of sensory-evoked signal flow in the neocortex.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>: YAP/TAZ initiate and maintain Schwann cell myelination</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/content/6/e20982</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Nuclear exclusion of the transcriptional regulators and potent oncoproteins, YAP/TAZ, is considered necessary for adult tissue homeostasis. Here we show that nuclear YAP/TAZ are essential regulators of peripheral nerve development and myelin maintenance. To proliferate, developing Schwann cells (SCs) require YAP/TAZ to enter S-phase and, without them, fail to generate sufficient SCs for timely axon sorting. To differentiate, SCs require YAP/TAZ to upregulate Krox20 and, without them, completely fail to myelinate, resulting in severe peripheral neuropathy. Remarkably, in adulthood, nuclear YAP/TAZ are selectively expressed by myelinating SCs, and conditional ablation results in severe peripheral demyelination and mouse death. YAP/TAZ regulate both developmental and adult myelination by driving TEAD1 to activate Krox20. Therefore, YAP/TAZ are crucial for SCs to myelinate developing nerve and to maintain myelinated nerve in adulthood. Our study also provides a new insight into the role of nuclear YAP/TAZ in homeostatic maintenance of an adult tissue.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>: Mapping cell type-specific transcriptional enhancers using high affinity, lineage-specific Ep300 bioChIP-seq</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/content/6/e22039</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Understanding the mechanisms that regulate cell type-specific transcriptional programs requires developing a lexicon of their genomic regulatory elements. We developed a lineage-selective method to map transcriptional enhancers, regulatory genomic regions that activate transcription, in mice. Since most tissue-specific enhancers are bound by the transcriptional co-activator Ep300, we used Cre-directed, lineage-specific Ep300 biotinylation and pulldown on immobilized streptavidin followed by next generation sequencing of co-precipitated DNA to identify lineage-specific enhancers. By driving this system with lineage-specific Cre transgenes, we mapped enhancers active in embryonic endothelial cells/blood or skeletal muscle. Analysis of these enhancers identified new transcription factor heterodimer motifs that likely regulate transcription in these lineages. Furthermore, we identified candidate enhancers that regulate adult heart- or lung- specific endothelial cell specialization. Our strategy for tissue-specific protein biotinylation opens new avenues for studying lineage-specific protein-DNA and protein-protein interactions.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>: A general method for determining secondary active transporter substrate stoichiometry</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/content/6/e21016</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The number of ions required to drive substrate transport through a secondary active transporter determines the protein’s ability to create a substrate gradient, a feature essential to its physiological function, and places fundamental constraints on the transporter’s mechanism. Stoichiometry is known for a wide array of mammalian transporters, but, due to a lack of readily available tools, not for most of the prokaryotic transporters for which high-resolution structures are available. Here, we describe a general method for using radiolabeled substrate flux assays to determine coupling stoichiometries of electrogenic secondary active transporters reconstituted in proteoliposomes by measuring transporter equilibrium potentials. We demonstrate the utility of this method by determining the coupling stoichiometry of VcINDY, a bacterial Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-coupled succinate transporter, and further validate it by confirming the coupling stoichiometry of vSGLT, a bacterial sugar transporter. This robust thermodynamic method should be especially useful in probing the mechanisms of transporters with available structures.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>: Frontal beta-theta network during REM sleep</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/content/6/e18894</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;We lack detailed knowledge about the spatio-temporal physiological signatures of REM sleep, especially in humans. By analyzing intracranial electrode data from humans, we demonstrate for the first time that there are prominent beta (15–35 Hz) and theta (4–8 Hz) oscillations in both the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and the DLPFC during REM sleep. We further show that these theta and beta activities in the ACC and the DLPFC, two relatively distant but reciprocally connected regions, are coherent. These findings suggest that, counter to current prevailing thought, the DLPFC is active during REM sleep and likely interacting with other areas. Since the DLPFC and the ACC are implicated in memory and emotional regulation, and the ACC has motor areas and is thought to be important for error detection, the dialogue between these two areas could play a role in the regulation of emotions and in procedural motor and emotional memory consolidation.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>: Multivariate cross-frequency coupling via generalized eigendecomposition</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/content/6/e21792</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;This paper presents a new framework for analyzing cross-frequency coupling in multichannel electrophysiological recordings. The generalized eigendecomposition-based cross-frequency coupling framework (gedCFC) is inspired by source-separation algorithms combined with dynamics of mesoscopic neurophysiological processes. It is unaffected by factors that confound traditional CFC methods—such as non-stationarities, non-sinusoidality, and non-uniform phase angle distributions—attractive properties considering that brain activity is neither stationary nor perfectly sinusoidal. The gedCFC framework opens new opportunities for conceptualizing CFC as network interactions with diverse spatial/topographical distributions. Five specific methods within the gedCFC framework are detailed, these are validated in simulated data and applied in several empirical datasets. gedCFC accurately recovers physiologically plausible CFC patterns embedded in noise that causes traditional CFC methods to perform poorly. The paper also demonstrates that spike-field coherence in multichannel local field potential data can be analyzed using the gedCFC framework, which provides significant advantages over traditional spike-field coherence analyses. Null-hypothesis testing is also discussed.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>: Extensive cargo identification reveals distinct biological roles of the 12 importin pathways</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/content/6/e21184</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Vast numbers of proteins are transported into and out of the nuclei by approximately 20 species of importin-β family nucleocytoplasmic transport receptors. However, the significance of the multiple parallel transport pathways that the receptors constitute is poorly understood because only limited numbers of cargo proteins have been reported. Here, we identified cargo proteins specific to the 12 species of human import receptors with a high-throughput method that employs stable isotope labeling with amino acids in cell culture, an in vitro reconstituted transport system, and quantitative mass spectrometry. The identified cargoes illuminated the manner of cargo allocation to the receptors. The redundancies of the receptors vary widely depending on the cargo protein. Cargoes of the same receptor are functionally related to one another, and the predominant protein groups in the cargo cohorts differ among the receptors. Thus, the receptors are linked to distinct biological processes by the nature of their cargoes.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>: Sexually dimorphic control of gene expression in sensory neurons regulates decision-making behavior in C. elegans</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/content/6/e21166</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Animal behavior is directed by the integration of sensory information from internal states and the environment. Neuroendocrine regulation of diverse behaviors of &lt;em&gt;Caenorhabditis elegans&lt;/em&gt; is under the control of the DAF-7/TGF-β ligand that is secreted from sensory neurons. Here, we show that &lt;em&gt;C. elegans&lt;/em&gt; males exhibit an altered, male-specific expression pattern of &lt;em&gt;daf-7&lt;/em&gt; in the ASJ sensory neuron pair with the onset of reproductive maturity, which functions to promote male-specific mate-searching behavior. Molecular genetic analysis of the switch-like regulation of &lt;em&gt;daf-7&lt;/em&gt; expression in the ASJ neuron pair reveals a hierarchy of regulation among multiple inputs—sex, age, nutritional status, and microbial environment—which function in the modulation of behavior. Our results suggest that regulation of gene expression in sensory neurons can function in the integration of a wide array of sensory information and facilitate decision-making behaviors in &lt;em&gt;C. elegans&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Simultaneous stimulation of the antennal lobes (ALs) and the ascending fibers of the ventral nerve cord (AFV), two sensory inputs to the mushroom bodies (MBs), induces long-term enhancement (LTE) of subsequent AL-evoked MB responses. LTE induction requires activation of at least three signaling pathways to the MBs, mediated by nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs), NMDA receptors (NRs), and D1 dopamine receptors (D1Rs). Here, we demonstrate that inputs from the AL are transmitted to the MBs through nAChRs, and inputs from the AFV are transmitted by NRs. Dopamine signaling occurs downstream of both nAChR and NR activation, and requires simultaneous stimulation of both pathways. Dopamine release requires the activity of the rutabaga adenylyl cyclase in postsynaptic MB neurons, and release is restricted to MB neurons that receive coincident stimulation. Our results indicate that postsynaptic activity can gate presynaptic dopamine release to regulate plasticity.&lt;/p&gt;

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/content/6/e20707</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Crude oil spills are a worldwide ocean conservation threat. Fish are particularly vulnerable to the oiling of spawning habitats, and crude oil causes severe abnormalities in embryos and larvae. However, the underlying mechanisms for these developmental defects are not well understood. Here, we explore the transcriptional basis for four discrete crude oil injury phenotypes in the early life stages of the commercially important Atlantic haddock (&lt;em&gt;Melanogrammus aeglefinus&lt;/em&gt;). These include defects in (1) cardiac form and function, (2) craniofacial development, (3) ionoregulation and fluid balance, and (4) cholesterol synthesis and homeostasis. Our findings suggest a key role for intracellular calcium cycling and excitation-transcription coupling in the dysregulation of heart and jaw morphogenesis. Moreover, the disruption of ionoregulatory pathways sheds new light on buoyancy control in marine fish embryos. Overall, our chemical-genetic approach identifies initiating events for distinct adverse outcome pathways and novel roles for individual genes in fundamental developmental processes.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>: Dyslexics’ faster decay of implicit memory for sounds and words is manifested in their shorter neural adaptation</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/content/6/e20557</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Dyslexia is a prevalent reading disability whose underlying mechanisms are still disputed. We studied the neural mechanisms underlying dyslexia using a simple frequency-discrimination task. Though participants were asked to compare the two tones in each trial, implicit memory of previous trials affected their responses. We hypothesized that implicit memory decays faster among dyslexics. We tested this by increasing the temporal intervals between consecutive trials, and by measuring the behavioral impact and ERP responses from the auditory cortex. Dyslexics showed a faster decay of implicit memory effects on both measures, with similar time constants. Finally, faster decay of implicit memory also characterized the impact of sound regularities in benefitting dyslexics' oral reading rate. Their benefit decreased faster as a function of the time interval from the previous reading of the same non-word. We propose that dyslexics’ shorter neural adaptation paradoxically accounts for their longer reading times, since it reduces their temporal window of integration of past stimuli, resulting in noisier and less reliable predictions for both simple and complex stimuli. Less reliable predictions limit their acquisition of reading expertise.&lt;/p&gt;

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The Neurotransmitter:Sodium Symporters (NSSs) represent an important class of proteins mediating sodium-dependent uptake of neurotransmitters from the extracellular space. The substrate binding stoichiometry of the bacterial NSS protein, LeuT, and thus the principal transport mechanism, has been heavily debated. Here we used solid state NMR to specifically characterize the bound leucine ligand and probe the number of binding sites in LeuT. We were able to produce high-quality NMR spectra of substrate bound to microcrystalline LeuT samples and identify one set of sodium-dependent substrate-specific chemical shifts. Furthermore, our data show that the binding site mutants F253A and L400S, which probe the major S1 binding site and the proposed S2 binding site, respectively, retain sodium-dependent substrate binding in the S1 site similar to the wild-type protein. We conclude that under our experimental conditions there is only one detectable leucine molecule bound to LeuT.&lt;/p&gt;

We found that a thrombospondin-repeat containing sporozoite-specific protein named thrombospondin-releated protein 1 (TRP1) is important for oocyst egress and salivary gland invasion, and hence for the transmission of malaria. We imaged the release of sporozoites from oocysts in situ, which was preceded by active motility. Parasites lacking TRP1 failed to migrate within oocysts and did not egress, suggesting that TRP1 is a vital component of the events that precede intra-oocyst motility and subsequently sporozoite egress and salivary gland invasion.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Trends in Neurosciences: The Neurobiology of Postpartum Anxiety and Depression</title>
	<link>http://www.cell.com/trends/neurosciences/fulltext/S0166-2236(16)30177-1?rss=yes</link>
	<content:encoded>Ten to twenty percent of postpartum women experience anxiety or depressive disorders, which can have detrimental effects on the mother, child, and family. Little is known about the neural correlates of these affective disorders when they occur in mothers, but they do have unique neural profiles during the postpartum period compared with when they occur at other times in a woman's life. Given that the neural systems affected by postpartum anxiety and depression overlap and interact with the systems involved in maternal caregiving behaviors, mother–infant interactions are highly susceptible to disruption.</content:encoded>
