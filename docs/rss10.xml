	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Ten simple rules for supporting a temporary online pivot in higher education</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/e9Z_LqD26FY/article</link>

As continued COVID-19 disruption looks likely across the world, perhaps until 2021, contingency plans are evolving in case of further disruption in the 2020–2021 academic year. This includes delivering face-to-face programs fully online for at least part of the upcoming academic year for new and continuing cohorts. This temporary pivot will necessitate distance teaching and learning across almost every conceivable pedagogy, from fundamental degrees to professionally accredited ones. Each institution, program, and course will have its own myriad of individualized needs; however, there is a common question that unites us all: how do we provide teaching and assessment to students in a manner that is accessible, fair, equitable, and provides the best learning whilst acknowledging the temporary nature of the pivot? No “one size fits all” solution exists, and many of the choices that need to be made will be far from simple; however, this paper provides a starting point and basic principles to facilitate discussions taking place around the globe by balancing what we know from the pedagogy of online learning with the practicalities imposed by this crisis and any future crises.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/e9Z_LqD26FY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Models of SIV rebound after treatment interruption that involve multiple reactivation events</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/cZno1WDWtqo/article</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Christiaan H. van Dorp, Jessica M. Conway, Dan H. Barouch, James B. Whitney, Alan S. Perelson&lt;/p&gt;

In order to assess the efficacy of novel HIV-1 treatments leading to a functional cure, the time to viral rebound is frequently used as a surrogate endpoint. The longer the time to viral rebound, the more efficacious the therapy. In support of such an approach, mathematical models serve as a connection between the size of the latent reservoir and the time to HIV-1 rebound after treatment interruption. The simplest of such models assumes that a single successful latent cell reactivation event leads to observable viremia after a period of exponential viral growth. Here we consider a generalization developed by Pinkevych &lt;i&gt;et al&lt;/i&gt;. and Hill &lt;i&gt;et al&lt;/i&gt;. of this simple model in which multiple reactivation events can occur, each contributing to the exponential growth of the viral load. We formalize and improve the previous derivation of the dynamics predicted by this model, and use the model to estimate relevant biological parameters from SIV rebound data. We confirm a previously described effect of very early antiretroviral therapy (ART) initiation on the rate of recrudescence and the viral load growth rate after treatment interruption. We find that every day ART initiation is delayed results in a 39% increase in the recrudescence rate (95% credible interval: [18%, 62%]), and a 11% decrease of the viral growth rate (95% credible interval: [4%, 20%]). We show that when viral rebound occurs early relative to the viral load doubling time, a model with multiple successful reactivation events fits the data better than a model with only a single successful reactivation event.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/cZno1WDWtqo&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Ten simple rules for partnering with K–12 teachers to support broader impact goals</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/r-dFiGtlm1Y/article</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Alexa R. Warwick, Angela Kolonich, Kristin M. Bass, Louise S. Mead, Frieda Reichsman&lt;/p&gt;

Contributing to broader impacts is an important aspect of scientific research. Engaging practicing K–12 teachers as part of a research project can be an effective approach for addressing broader impacts requirements of grants, while also advancing researcher and teacher professional growth. Our focus is on leveraging teachers’ professional expertise to develop science education materials grounded in emerging scientific research. In this paper, we describe ten simple rules for planning, implementing, and evaluating teacher engagement to support the broader impact goals of your research project. These collaborations can lead to the development of instructional materials or activities for students in the classroom or provide science research opportunities for teachers. We share our successes and lessons learned while collaborating with high school biology teachers to create technology-based, instructional materials developed from basic biological research. The rules we describe are applicable across teacher partnerships at any grade level in that they emphasize eliciting and respecting teachers’ professionalism and expertise.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/r-dFiGtlm1Y&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Ten simple rules for building an antiracist lab</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/hkcDpMKWOWY/article</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by V. Bala Chaudhary, Asmeret Asefaw Berhe&lt;/p&gt;

Demographics of the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) workforce and student body in the US and Europe continue to show severe underrepresentation of Black, Indigenous, and people of color (BIPOC). Among the documented causes of the persistent lack of diversity in STEM are bias, discrimination, and harassment of members of underrepresented minority groups (URMs). These issues persist due to continued marginalization, power imbalances, and lack of adequate policies against misconduct in academic and other scientific institutions. All scientists can play important roles in reversing this trend by shifting the culture of academic workplaces to intentionally implement equitable and inclusive policies, set norms for acceptable workplace conduct, and provide opportunities for mentorship and networking. As scientists are increasingly acknowledging the lack of racial and ethnic diversity in science, there is a need for clear direction on how to take antiracist action. Here we present 10 rules to help labs develop antiracists policies and action in an effort to promote racial and ethnic diversity, equity, and inclusion in science.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/hkcDpMKWOWY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: A genotype imputation method for de-identified haplotype reference information by using recurrent neural network</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/evfPJ-IpVhw/article</link>

Genotype imputation estimates the genotypes of unobserved variants using the genotype data of other observed variants based on a collection of haplotypes for thousands of individuals, which is known as a haplotype reference panel. In general, more accurate imputation results were obtained using a larger size of haplotype reference panel. Most of the existing genotype imputation methods explicitly require the haplotype reference panel in precise form, but the accessibility of haplotype data is often limited, due to the requirement of agreements from the donors. Since de-identified information such as summary statistics or model parameters can be used publicly, imputation methods using de-identified haplotype reference information might be useful to enhance the quality of imputation results under the condition where the access of the haplotype data is limited. In this study, we proposed a novel imputation method that handles the reference panel as its model parameters by using bidirectional recurrent neural network (RNN). The model parameters are presented in the form of de-identified information from which the restoration of the genotype data at the individual-level is almost impossible. We demonstrated that the proposed method provides comparable imputation accuracy when compared with the existing imputation methods using haplotype datasets from the 1000 Genomes Project (1KGP) and the Haplotype Reference Consortium. We also considered a scenario where a subset of haplotypes is made available only in de-identified form for the haplotype reference panel. In the evaluation using the 1KGP dataset under the scenario, the imputation accuracy of the proposed method is much higher than that of the existing imputation methods. We therefore conclude that our RNN-based method is quite promising to further promote the data-sharing of sensitive genome data under the recent movement for the protection of individuals’ privacy.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/evfPJ-IpVhw&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Metabolic inference from genomic sequence information is a necessary step in determining the capacity of cells to make a living in the world at different levels of biological organization. A common method for determining the metabolic potential encoded in genomes is to map conceptually translated open reading frames onto a database containing known product descriptions. Such gene-centric methods are limited in their capacity to predict pathway presence or absence and do not support standardized rule sets for automated and reproducible research. Pathway-centric methods based on defined rule sets or machine learning algorithms provide an adjunct or alternative inference method that supports hypothesis generation and testing of metabolic relationships within and between cells. Here, we present mlLGPR, &lt;i&gt;m&lt;/i&gt;ulti-&lt;i&gt;l&lt;/i&gt;abel based on &lt;i&gt;l&lt;/i&gt;ogistic re&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt;ression for &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;athway p&lt;i&gt;r&lt;/i&gt;ediction, a software package that uses supervised multi-label classification and rich pathway features to infer metabolic networks in organismal and multi-organismal datasets. We evaluated mlLGPR performance using a corpora of 12 experimental datasets manifesting diverse multi-label properties, including manually curated organismal genomes, synthetic microbial communities and low complexity microbial communities. Resulting performance metrics equaled or exceeded previous reports for organismal genomes and identify specific challenges associated with features engineering and training data for community-level metabolic inference.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/fVk9wRrKtV8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Biology: tACS entrains neural activity while somatosensory input is blocked</title>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Pedro G. Vieira, Matthew R. Krause, Christopher C. Pack&lt;/p&gt;

Transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) modulates brain activity by passing electrical current through electrodes that are attached to the scalp. Because it is safe and noninvasive, tACS holds great promise as a tool for basic research and clinical treatment. However, little is known about how tACS ultimately influences neural activity. One hypothesis is that tACS affects neural responses directly, by producing electrical fields that interact with the brain’s endogenous electrical activity. By controlling the shape and location of these electric fields, one could target brain regions associated with particular behaviors or symptoms. However, an alternative hypothesis is that tACS affects neural activity indirectly, via peripheral sensory afferents. In particular, it has often been hypothesized that tACS acts on sensory fibers in the skin, which in turn provide rhythmic input to central neurons. In this case, there would be little possibility of targeted brain stimulation, as the regions modulated by tACS would depend entirely on the somatosensory pathways originating in the skin around the stimulating electrodes. Here, we directly test these competing hypotheses by recording single-unit activity in the hippocampus and visual cortex of alert monkeys receiving tACS. We find that tACS entrains neuronal activity in both regions, so that cells fire synchronously with the stimulation. Blocking somatosensory input with a topical anesthetic does not significantly alter these neural entrainment effects. These data are therefore consistent with the direct stimulation hypothesis and suggest that peripheral somatosensory stimulation is not required for tACS to entrain neurons.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/VtB0bViwC7g&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Since around 2000, it has been considered that elitist evolutionary
multi-objective optimization algorithms (EMOAs) always outperform non-elitist
EMOAs. This paper revisits the performance of non-elitist EMOAs for

This paper examines the performance of EMOAs with two elitist and one
non-elitist environmental selections. The performance of EMOAs is evaluated on
the bi-objective BBOB problem suite provided by the COCO platform. In contrast
to conventional wisdom, results show that non-elitist EMOAs with particular
crossover methods perform significantly well on the bi-objective BBOB problems
with many decision variables when using the unbounded external archive. This
paper also analyzes the properties of the non-elitist selection.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Multi-modal multi-objective optimization is to locate (almost) equivalent
Pareto optimal solutions as many as possible. While decomposition-based
evolutionary algorithms have good performance for multi-objective optimization,
they are likely to perform poorly for multi-modal multi-objective optimization
due to the lack of mechanisms to maintain the solution space diversity. To
address this issue, this paper proposes a framework to improve the performance
of decomposition-based evolutionary algorithms for multi-modal multi-objective
optimization. Our framework is based on three operations: assignment, deletion,
and addition operations. One or more individuals can be assigned to the same
subproblem to handle multiple equivalent solutions. In each iteration, a child
is assigned to a subproblem based on its objective vector, i.e., its location
in the objective space. The child is compared with its neighbors in the
solution space assigned to the same subproblem. The performance of improved
versions of six decomposition-based evolutionary algorithms by our framework is
evaluated on various test problems regarding the number of objectives, decision
variables, and equivalent Pareto optimal solution sets. Results show that the
improved versions perform clearly better than their original algorithms.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.14695</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Ensemble approaches introduced in the Extreme Learning Machine (ELM)
literature mainly come from methods that relies on data sampling procedures,
under the assumption that the training data are heterogeneously enough to set
up diverse base learners. To overcome this assumption, it was proposed an ELM
ensemble method based on the Negative Correlation Learning (NCL) framework,
called Negative Correlation Extreme Learning Machine (NCELM). This model works
in two stages: i) different ELMs are generated as base learners with random
weights in the hidden layer, and ii) a NCL penalty term with the information of
the ensemble prediction is introduced in each ELM minimization problem,
updating the base learners, iii) second step is iterated until the ensemble
converges.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although this NCL ensemble method was validated by an experimental study with
multiple benchmark datasets, no information was given on the conditions about
this convergence. This paper mathematically presents the sufficient conditions
to guarantee the global convergence of NCELM. The update of the ensemble in
each iteration is defined as a contraction mapping function, and through Banach
theorem, global convergence of the ensemble is proved.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;General fuzzy min-max neural network (GFMMNN) is one of the efficient
neuro-fuzzy systems for data classification. However, one of the downsides of
its original learning algorithms is the inability to handle and learn from the
mixed-attribute data. While categorical features encoding methods can be used
with the GFMMNN learning algorithms, they exhibit a lot of shortcomings. Other
approaches proposed in the literature are not suitable for on-line learning as
they require entire training data available in the learning phase. With the
rapid change in the volume and velocity of streaming data in many application
areas, it is increasingly required that the constructed models can learn and
adapt to the continuous data changes in real-time without the need for their
full retraining or access to the historical data. This paper proposes an
extended online learning algorithm for the GFMMNN. The proposed method can
handle the datasets with both continuous and categorical features. The
extensive experiments confirmed superior and stable classification performance
of the proposed approach in comparison to other relevant learning algorithms

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.14506</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Automated per-instance algorithm selection and configuration have shown
promising performances for a number of classic optimization problems, including
satisfiability, AI planning, and TSP. The techniques often rely on a set of
features that measure some characteristics of the problem instance at hand. In
the context of black-box optimization, these features have to be derived from a
set of $(x,f(x))$ samples. A number of different features have been proposed in
the literature, measuring, for example, the modality, the separability, or the
ruggedness of the instance at hand. Several of the commonly used features,
however, are highly correlated. While state-of-the-art machine learning
techniques can routinely filter such correlations, they hinder explainability
of the derived algorithm design techniques.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We therefore propose in this work to pre-process the measured (raw) landscape
features through representation learning. More precisely, we show that a linear
dimensionality reduction via matrix factorization significantly contributes
towards a better detection of correlation between different problem instances
-- a key prerequisite for successful automated algorithm design.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The main goal of the multitasking optimization paradigm is to solve multiple

process. For attaining promising results, potential complementarities and
synergies between tasks are properly exploited, helping each other by virtue of
the exchange of genetic material. This paper is focused on Evolutionary
Multitasking, which is a perspective for dealing with multitasking optimization
scenarios by embracing concepts from Evolutionary Computation. This work
contributes to this field by presenting a new multitasking approach named as
Coevolutionary Variable Neighborhood Search Algorithm, which finds its
inspiration on both the Variable Neighborhood Search metaheuristic and
coevolutionary strategies. The second contribution of this paper is the
application field, which is the optimal partitioning of graph instances whose
connections among nodes are directed and weighted. This paper pioneers on the
simultaneous solving of this kind of tasks. Two different multitasking
scenarios are considered, each comprising 11 graph instances. Results obtained
by our method are compared to those issued by a parallel Variable Neighborhood
Search and independent executions of the basic Variable Neighborhood Search.
The discussion on such results support our hypothesis that the proposed method
is a promising scheme for simultaneous solving community detection problems
over graphs.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Spiking neural networks (SNNs) have great potential for energy-efficient
implementation of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) on dedicated neuromorphic

The present work focuses on using SNNs in combination with deep reinforcement
learning in ATARI games, which involves additional complexity as compared to
image classification. We review the theory of converting DNNs to SNNs and
extending the conversion to Deep Q-Networks (DQNs). We propose a robust
representation of the firing rate to reduce the error during the conversion
process. In addition, we introduce a new metric to evaluate the conversion
process by comparing the decisions made by the DQN and SNN, respectively. We
also analyze how the simulation time and parameter normalization influence the
performance of converted SNNs. We achieve competitive scores on 17
top-performing Atari games. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first
to achieve state-of-the-art performance on multiple Atari games with SNNs. Our
work serves as a benchmark for the conversion of DQNs to SNNs and paves the way

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;An implanted device for brain-responsive neurostimulation (RNS System) is
approved as an effective treatment to reduce seizures in adults with
medically-refractory focal epilepsy. Clinical trials of the RNS System
demonstrate population-level reduction in average seizure frequency, but
therapeutic response is highly variable. Recent evidence links seizures to
cyclical fluctuations in underlying risk. We tested the hypothesis that
effectiveness of responsive neurostimulation varies based on current state
within cyclical risk fluctuations. We analyzed retrospective data from 25
adults with medically-refractory focal epilepsy implanted with the RNS System.
Chronic electrocorticography was used to record electrographic seizures, and
hidden Markov models decoded seizures into fluctuations in underlying risk.
State-dependent associations of RNS System stimulation parameters with changes
in risk were estimated. Higher charge density was associated with improved
outcomes, both for remaining in a low seizure risk state and for transitioning
from a high to a low seizure risk state. The effect of stimulation frequency
depended on initial seizure risk state: when starting in a low risk state,
higher stimulation frequencies were associated with remaining in a low risk
state, but when starting in a high risk state, lower stimulation frequencies
were associated with transition to a low risk state. Findings were consistent
across bipolar and monopolar stimulation configurations. The impact of RNS on
seizure frequency exhibits state-dependence, such that stimulation parameters
which are effective in one seizure risk state may not be effective in another.
These findings represent conceptual advances in understanding the therapeutic
mechanism of RNS, and directly inform current practices of RNS tuning and the
development of next-generation neurostimulation systems.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.14283</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Widefield calcium imaging has recently emerged as a powerful experimental
technique to record coordinated large-scale brain activity. Because of the
spatial and temporal resolution of these measurements, they present a unique
opportunity to characterize spatiotemporally coherent structures that underlie
neural activity across many regions of the brain. In this work, we leverage
analytic techniques from fluid dynamics to develop a visualization framework
that highlights features of flow across the cortex, mapping time-varying
sources and wave fronts that may be correlated with behavioral events. First,
we transform the time series of widefield calcium images into time-varying
vector fields using optic flow. Next, we extract concise diagrams summarizing
the dynamics, which we refer to as FLOW (flow lines in optical widefield
imaging) portraits. These FLOW portraits provide an intuitive map of dynamic
calcium activity, including sources, sinks, and traveling fronts in the data,
using the finite-time Lyapunov exponent (FTLE) technique developed to analyze
time-varying manifolds in unsteady fluids. Importantly, our approach captures
coherent structures that are poorly represented by traditional modal
decomposition techniques. We demonstrate the application of FLOW portraits on
two widefield calcium imaging datasets: activity of the developing mouse cortex
during the first 8 postnatal days, and spontaneous cortical activity in an
adult mouse.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.14280</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Fish swim by undulating their bodies. These propulsive motions require
coordinated shape changes of a body that interacts with its fluid environment,
but the specific shape coordination that leads to robust turning and swimming
motions remains unclear. We propose a simple model of a three-link fish
swimming in a potential flow environment and we use model-free reinforcement
learning to arrive at optimal shape changes for two swimming tasks: swimming in
a desired direction and swimming towards a known target. This fish model
belongs to a class of problems in geometric mechanics, known as driftless
dynamical systems, which allow us to analyze the swimming behavior in terms of
geometric phases over the shape space of the fish. These geometric methods are
less intuitive in the presence of drift. Here, we use the shape space analysis
as a tool for assessing, visualizing, and interpreting the control policies
obtained via reinforcement learning in the absence of drift. We then examine
the robustness of these policies to drift-related perturbations. Although the
fish has no direct control over the drift itself, it learns to take advantage
of the presence of moderate drift to reach its target.

	<title>arXiv: Quantitative Biology: Neurons and Cognition: Reduced neural activity during volatile anesthesia compared to TIVA: evidence from a novel EEG signal processing analysis through a randomized controlled trial. (arXiv:2009.14264v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.14264</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Background: General anesthesia can be accomplished by inhalation-based
(volatile) or total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA). While their effects on
post-operative symptoms have been investigated, little is known about their
influence on brain functionalities during the surgery itself. Objective: To
assess differences in brain activity between volatile and TIVA anesthetics
during surgery. Participants: Seventeen patients who were electively admitted
for laparoscopic cholecystectomy in Galilee Medical Center, Nahariya, gave
written consent to participate in the study, and were randomly divided to
receive either volatile anesthesia (9), or TIVA (8). An additional 17 healthy
volunteers were used as an awake control group. Outcome measures: A single
bipolar EEG electrode was placed on the participants foreheads and collected
their electroencephalographic data during the surgery. The signal was analyzed
in two different methods. First, extracting real-time amplitudes of the
classical qEEG frequency bands and second applying novel harmonic signal
processing that created three novel biomarkers. Results: All surgeries were
uneventful, and all patients showed less than 60 bispectral index BIS score.
Brain activity under volatile anesthesia showed significantly decreased delta
and beta frequencies and significant decrease in activity of two biomarkers of
the novel analysis with a difference in decrease between volatile and TIVA
anesthesia. These two novel biomarkers exhibited significantly higher
activation in the awake control group compared to the anesthetized patients.
Conclusions: Both EEG frequency bands and novel brain activity biomarkers
provide evidence that volatile anesthesia reduces brain activity to a much
lower extent compared to TIVA anesthesia.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.14260</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are commonly used for image
classification. Saliency methods are examples of approaches that can be used to
interpret CNNs post hoc, identifying the most relevant pixels for a prediction
following the gradients flow. Even though CNNs can correctly classify images,
the underlying saliency maps could be erroneous in many cases. This can result
in skepticism as to the validity of the model or its interpretation. We propose
a novel approach for training trustworthy CNNs by penalizing parameter choices
that result in inaccurate saliency maps generated during training. We add a
penalty term for inaccurate saliency maps produced when the predicted label is
correct, a penalty term for accurate saliency maps produced when the predicted
label is incorrect, and a regularization term penalizing overly confident
saliency maps. Experiments show increased classification performance, user
engagement, and trust.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;We consider neural networks with rational activation functions. The choice of
the nonlinear activation function in deep learning architectures is crucial and
heavily impacts the performance of a neural network. We establish optimal
bounds in terms of network complexity and prove that rational neural networks
approximate smooth functions more efficiently than ReLU networks with
exponentially smaller depth. The flexibility and smoothness of rational
activation functions make them an attractive alternative to ReLU, as we

	<title>arXiv: Computer Science: Neural and Evolutionary Computing: Structural plasticity on an accelerated analog neuromorphic hardware system. (arXiv:1912.12047v2 [q-bio.NC] UPDATED)</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1912.12047</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In computational neuroscience, as well as in machine learning, neuromorphic
devices promise an accelerated and scalable alternative to neural network
simulations. Their neural connectivity and synaptic capacity depends on their
specific design choices, but is always intrinsically limited. Here, we present
a strategy to achieve structural plasticity that optimizes resource allocation
under these constraints by constantly rewiring the pre- and gpostsynaptic
partners while keeping the neuronal fan-in constant and the connectome sparse.
In particular, we implemented this algorithm on the analog neuromorphic system
BrainScaleS-2. It was executed on a custom embedded digital processor located
on chip, accompanying the mixed-signal substrate of spiking neurons and synapse
circuits. We evaluated our implementation in a simple supervised learning
scenario, showing its ability to optimize the network topology with respect to
the nature of its training data, as well as its overall computational
efficiency.

Here, the authors show that hyperproduction of the β-lactamase driving this resistance occurs due to excision and reinsertion of a translocatable unit containing blaTEM-1B, creating a tandem array.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ncomms/rss/current/~4/_NVk0-Mk9g4&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;PSEN1&lt;/em&gt; gene is considered to be the most common gene, which is responsible for the development of an autosomal dominant Alzheimer disease with early onset and sometimes broad phenotype. We present a patient with a spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA)-like phenotype who was found to carry an M233V mutation. General and neurological exam was carried out. Brain MRI as well as genetic testing for SCAs 1, 2, 3, 6, and 17 were performed. The patient was then referred for a next-generation sequencing-based gene panel test with 723 genes included. A 26-year-old man of an Azerbaijani origin presented with a progressive impairment of coordination followed by memory impairment. Family history was positive for a similar disorder suggesting autosomal dominant inheritance. Brain MRI showed bilateral hippocampal atrophy (more pronounced in the left), as well as mild atrophy of the left temporoparietal cortex. Tests for SCAs 1, 2, 3, 6, and 17 came negative. Gene panel test showed c.697A &amp;gt; G heterozygous variant in the &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;PSEN1&lt;/em&gt; gene leading to a M233V amino acid change, which was validated by a Sanger sequencing. So far, M233V mutation has not been associated with a combination of cerebellar and cognitive features at onset. Our case contributes to a better characterization of the &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;PSEN1&lt;/em&gt; mutations and expands the phenotype of the M233V carriers. We propose to consider &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;PSEN1&lt;/em&gt; mutations in patients presenting with an SCA-like phenotype but negative for common types of SCA.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Herein, we report prodromal transient neurological symptoms that should raise clinical suspicion of CA with GAD-Abs. We initially identified a 70-year-old man who presented a first acute episode of vertigo, diplopia, and ataxia lasting 2 weeks. Two months later, he experienced a similar episode along with new-onset gaze-evoked nystagmus. After 4 months, downbeat nystagmus, left limb dysmetria, and gait ataxia progressively appeared, and an autoimmune CA was diagnosed based on the positivity of GAD-Abs in serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). We searched retrospectively for similar presentations in a cohort of 31 patients diagnosed with CA and GAD-Abs. We found 11 (35.4%) patients (all women, median age 62 years; 8/11 [72.7%] with autoimmune comorbidities) with transient neurological symptoms antedating CA onset by a median of 3 months, including vertigo in 9 (81.8%; described as paroxysmal in 8) and fluctuating diplopia in 3 (27.3%) patients. The identification of transient neurological symptoms of unknown etiology, such as paroxysmal vertigo and fluctuating diplopia, should lead to GAD-Abs testing in serum and CSF, especially in patients with autoimmune comorbidities.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Niemann-Pick type C (NPC) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by storage of unesterified glycolipids and cholesterol in lysosome. NPC’s clinical presentation is highly heterogeneous, depending on the time of onset. It encompasses visceral, neurological, and/or psychiatric manifestations. As the motor findings are so important and devastating in this disease, there is a lack of description about non-motor symptoms, even though they play important role in quality of life of NPC patients. We described the most common non-motor findings in NPC like cognitive dysfunction, neuroimaging, psychiatric symptoms, sleep disorders, seizures, hearing problems, respiratory and other systemic features, bladder and fecal dysfunction, hypersalivation, and malnutrition. In this review, we highlighted the importance of these undervalued symptoms and their management. Specific measures of all aforementioned clinical features may work as relevant biomarkers in order to evaluate successful therapies in future clinical trials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>The Cerebellum: Upward Gaze Palsy: a Valuable Sign to Distinguish Spinocerebellar Ataxias</title>

	<content:encoded>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) represent a large group of heredodegenerative diseases, with great phenotypic and genotypic heterogeneity. However, in the clinical neurological practice, some symptoms and signs might help differentiate the SCAs. This study’s aims were to evaluate the frequency of upward gaze palsy (UGP) and investigate its role in assisting in the clinical differentiation of SCAs. We included 419 patients with SCAs (248 with SCA3, 95 with SCA10, 38 with SCA2, 22 with SCA1, 12 with SCA7, and 4 with SCA6). This study compared UGP with other known markers of disease severity—age of onset, disease duration, SARA score, and size of CAG expansion, and also other semiologic features, as bulging eyes. This sign was significantly more prevalent in SCA3 (64.11%), compared with SCA10 (3.16%; &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001) and other SCAs (SCA1, SCA2, SCA7–11.84%; &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001). UGP showed very high sensibility ins SCA3 (92.9), although lacking of specificity (64.1%). The odds ratio (OR) of UGP were also very high, 23.52 (95% CI 12.38–44.69), and was significantly correlated with larger CAG expansions, age, and disease duration in SCA3 patients, but not with age of onset or severity of the ataxic syndrome. This study showed that UGP is highly suggestive of SCA3 and has high sensitivity for the differential diagnosis among SCAs, and it could be of great value for bedside semiologic tool.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Communication difficulties have considerable impact on people with progressive ataxia, yet there are currently no evidence-based treatments. LSVT LOUD® focuses on the production of healthy vocal loudness whilst also improving breath support, vocal quality, loudness and articulation in participating patients. This study aimed to investigate whether Lee Silverman Voice Treatment (LSVT LOUD®) can improve communication effectiveness in these patients. We performed a rater-blinded, single-arm study investigating LSVT LOUD® treatment in a population of patients with progressive ataxia including Friedreich’s ataxia (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 18), spinocerebellar ataxia type 6 (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 1), idiopathic cerebellar ataxia (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 1), and spastic paraplegia 7 (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 1). Twenty-one patients were recruited to the study, with 19 completing treatment. Sessions were administered via Skype in the LSVT-X format, meaning two sessions per week over a period of 8 weeks. Assessments included two baseline and two post-treatment measures and focused on outcome measures covering aspects ranging from physiological function to impact and participation. Results indicate improvements in patient-perceived outcomes for 14 of the 19 participants, in both speech and psychosocial domains. Speech data furthermore demonstrate significant improvements in prolonged vowel duration, and voice quality measures. Intelligibility and naturalness evaluations showed no change post-treatment. Patients reported high acceptability of the treatment itself, as well as administration by Skype. This is the largest treatment study for people with progressive ataxia published to date. It provides an indication that LSVT LOUD® can have a positive impact on communication in this patient group and could form the basis for larger-scale trials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>The Cerebellum: Treatment of Primary Autoimmune Cerebellar Ataxia with Mycophenolate</title>
	<link>http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s12311-020-01152-4</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Immune-mediated ataxias account for a substantial number of sporadic otherwise idiopathic ataxias. Despite some well-characterised entities such as paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration where diagnostic markers exist, the majority of immune ataxias remained undiagnosed and untreated. We present here our experience in the treatment of suspected primary autoimmune cerebellar ataxia (PACA) using mycophenolate. All patients reported attend the Sheffield Ataxia Centre on a regular basis and had undergone extensive investigations, including genetic testing using next-generation sequencing, with other causes of ataxia excluded. The diagnosis of PACA was strongly suspected based on investigations, pattern of disease progression, and cerebellar involvement. Patients were treated with mycophenolate and monitored using MR spectroscopy of the cerebellar vermis. Thirty patients with PACA are reported here. Of these, 22 received mycophenolate (group 1). The remaining 8 were not on treatment (group 2-control group). Out of the 22 treated patients, 4 underwent serial MR spectroscopy prior to starting treatment and thus were used as controls making the total number of patients in the control group 12. The mean change of the MRS within the vermis (NAA/Cr area ratio) in the treatment group was + 0.144 ± 0.09 (improved) and in the untreated group − 0.155 ± 0.06 (deteriorated). The difference was significant. We also demonstrated a strong correlation between the spectroscopy and the SARA score. We have demonstrated the effectiveness of mycophenolate in the treatment of PACA. The results suggest that immune-mediated ataxias are potentially treatable, and that there is a need for early diagnosis to prevent permanent neurological deficit. The recently published diagnostic criteria for PACA would hopefully aid the diagnosis and treatment of this entity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>The Cerebellum: Acoustic Speech Analytics Are Predictive of Cerebellar Dysfunction in Multiple Sclerosis</title>

                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Speech production relies on motor control and cognitive processing and is linked to cerebellar function. In diseases where the cerebellum is impaired, such as multiple sclerosis (MS), speech abnormalities are common and can be detected by instrumental assessments. However, the potential of speech assessments to be used to monitor cerebellar impairment in MS remains unexplored. The aim of this study is to build an objectively measured speech score that reflects cerebellar function, pathology and quality of life in MS. Eighty-five people with MS and 21 controls participated in the study. Speech was independently assessed through objective acoustic analysis and blind expert listener ratings. Cerebellar function and overall disease disability were measured through validated clinical scores; cerebellar pathology was assessed via magnetic resonance imaging, and validated questionnaires informed quality of life. Selected speech variables were entered in a regression model to predict cerebellar function. The resulting model was condensed into one composite speech score and tested for prediction of abnormal 9-hole peg test (9HPT), and for correlations with the remaining cerebellar scores, imaging measurements and self-assessed quality of life. Slow rate of syllable repetition and increased free speech pause percentage were the strongest predictors of cerebellar impairment, complemented by phonatory instability. Those variables formed the acoustic composite score that accounted for 54% of variation in cerebellar function, correlated with cerebellar white matter volume (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;r&lt;/em&gt; = 0.3, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p =&lt;/em&gt; 0.017), quality of life (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;r&lt;/em&gt; = 0.5, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001) and predicted an abnormal 9HPT with 85% accuracy. An objective multi-feature speech metric was highly representative of motor cerebellar impairment in MS.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Machado-Joseph disease (MJD) is relatively prevalent among the Yemenite Jewish subpopulation living in Israel. Currently, there is no treatment able to modify the disease progression. Trehalose is a disaccharide with protein-stabilizing and autophagy-enhancing properties. In animal models of MJD, trehalose showed reduction of cerebellar lesion size and improved motor function. This study was designed to be a proof-of-concept, phase 2 study lasting 6 to 12 months, to determine the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of weekly IV administration of 15 g or 30 g 10% trehalose solution in 14 MJD patients. Primary endpoints were safety and tolerability, which were assessed by various clinical and laboratory tests. Secondary endpoints were changes in the Scale for Assessment and Rating of Ataxia (SARA) score, Neurological Examination Score for Spinocerebellar Ataxia (NESSCA), time to do 9-hole peg test (9HPT), time to do 8-meter walk (8MW), and quality of life assessed by the World Health Organization Quality-of-Life Questionnaire-BREF (WHOQoL-BREF). Trehalose was well tolerated, and no serious drug-related adverse events were noted. The average SARA score, NESSCA, and time to do 9HPT and 8MW and the WHOQoL-BREF for all patients remained stable at 6 months. Six patients received treatment for as long as 12 months and continued to remain stable on all the above tests. IV trehalose seems to be safe in humans and probably effective to stabilize neurological impairment in MJD.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>The Cerebellum: EMG Rectification Is Detrimental for Identifying Abnormalities in Corticomuscular and Intermuscular Coherence in Spinocerebellar Ataxia Type 2</title>

                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Corticomuscular and intermuscular coherence (CMC, IMC) reflect connectivity between neuronal activity in the motor cortex measured by electroencephalography (EEG) and muscular activity measured by electromyography (EMG), or between activity in different muscles, respectively. There is an ongoing debate on the appropriateness of EMG rectification prior to coherence estimation. This work examines the effects of EMG rectification in CMC and IMC estimation in 20 spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (SCA2) patients, 16 prodromal SCA2 gene mutation carriers, and 26 healthy controls during a repetitive upper or lower limb motor task. Coherence estimations were performed using the non-rectified raw EMG signal vs. the rectified EMG signal. EMG rectification decreases the level of significance of lower beta-frequency band CMC and IMC values in SCA2 patients and prodromal SCA2 mutation carriers vs. healthy controls, and also results in overall lower coherence values. EMG rectification is detrimental for beta-frequency band CMC and IMC estimation. One likely reason for this effect is distortion of coherence estimation in high-frequency signals, where the level of amplitude cancelation is high.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;The cerebellum plays a critical role in promoting learning of new motor tasks, which is an essential function for motor recovery. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) of the cerebellum can be used to enhance learning. In this study, we investigated the effects of cerebellar intermittent theta burst stimulation (c-iTBS), a high-frequency rTMS protocol, on visuo-motor learning in a sample of hemiparetic patients due to recent stroke in the territory of the contralateral middle cerebral artery. Eight stroke patients were enrolled for the purposes of the study in the chronic stage of recovery (i.e., at least 6 months after stroke). In two sessions, Patients were randomly assigned to treatment with real or sham c-iTBS applied over the cerebellar hemisphere ipsilateral to the affected body side. c-iTBS was applied immediately before the learning phase of a visuo-motor adaptation task. Real, but not sham, c-iTBS improved visuo-motor learning as revealed by an increased performance in of the learning phase of the visuo-moto adaptation task. Moreover, we also found that real but not sham c-iTBS induced a sustained improvement in the re-adaptation of the recently learned skill (i.e., when patients were re-tested after 30 min). Taken together, these data point to c-iTBS as a potential novel strategy to promote motor learning in patients with stroke.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Chromosomal microarray analysis is commonly used as screening test for children with neurodevelopmental issues, also in case of complex neurological phenotypes. Developmental delay/intellectual disability is a common presentation sign in pediatric ataxias, diseases with high clinical and genetic heterogeneity. In order to determine the diagnostic yield of Array-CGH in such conditions, all the tests performed in the last 10-year activity of a single referral center in children who present, besides the neurodevelopmental impairment, cerebellar abnormalities have been systematically gathered. The study demonstrates that, except for Dandy-Walker malformation or poly-malformative phenotypes, chromosomal microarray analysis should be discouraged as first-line diagnostic test in pediatric ataxias with neurodevelopmental disability.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;We sought to assess structural and functional patterns of cerebellum in multiple system atrophy (cerebellar type), and investigate the associations of structural and functional cerebellar gray matter abnormalities. We collected magnetic resonance imaging data of 18 patients with multiple system atrophy (cerebellar type) and 18 health control subjects. The gray matter loss across the motor and cognitive cerebellar territories in patients was assessed using voxel-based morphometry. And change in the connectivity between the cerebellum and large-scale cortical networks was assessed using resting-state functional MRI analysis. Furthermore, we assessed the relationship between the extent of cerebellar atrophy and reduced-activation in the cerebellar-cortical and subthalamo-cerebellar functional connectivities. We confirmed the gray matter loss across the motor and cognitive cerebellar territories in patients and found that the extent of cerebellar atrophy was correlated with decreased connectivity between the cerebellum and large-scale cortical networks, including the default, frontal parietal, and sensorimotor networks. The volume reduction in the motor cerebellum was closely associated with the clinical motor severity. A post hoc analysis showed reduced-activation in the subthalamo-cerebellar functional connectivity without the subthalamic nucleus atrophy. These results emphasized significant atrophy in the cerebellar subsystem and its association with the large-scale cortical networks in multiple system atrophy (cerebellar type), which may improve our understanding of the neural pathophysiology mechanisms of disease.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Cerebellar volume, in particular vermal lobule areas VI–VII, have been extensively researched in individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), although findings are often unclear. The aim of the present study is to consolidate all existing cerebellar and age data of individuals with ASD, and compare this data to typically developing (TD) controls. Raw data, or the means and standard deviations of cerebellar volume and age, were obtained from 17 studies (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;N&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Cerebellum&lt;/sub&gt;: 421 ASD and 370 TD participants; &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;N&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sub class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;VI–VII&lt;/sub&gt;: 506 ASD and 290 TD participants). Total cerebellar volume, or VI–VII area, was plotted against age and lines of fit of ASD and TD data were compared. Mean differences in cerebellar volume and VI–VII area between participants with ASD and TD participants were then compared via ANCOVA analyses. Findings revealed multiple differences in VI–VII area between participants with ASD and TD participants below 18 years of age. Additionally, cerebellar volume was greater in males with ASD than TD males between 2 and 4 years. In the present study, cerebellar volume and VI–VII area show different rates of change across age for those with autism compared with those without. These morphological differences provide a neurobiological justification to investigate related behavioural correlates.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>The Cerebellum: Shh-Mediated Increase in β-Catenin Levels Maintains Cerebellar Granule Neuron Progenitors in Proliferation</title>

	<content:encoded>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Cerebellar granule neuron progenitors (CGNPs) give rise to the cerebellar granule neurons in the developing cerebellum. Generation of large number of these neurons is made possible by the high proliferation rate of CGNPs in the external granule layer (EGL) in the dorsal cerebellum. Here, we show that upregulation of β-catenin can maintain murine CGNPs in a state of proliferation. Further, we show that β-catenin mRNA and protein levels can be regulated by the mitogen Sonic hedgehog (Shh). Shh signaling led to an increase in the level of the transcription factor N-myc. N-myc was found to bind the β-catenin promoter, and the increase in β-catenin mRNA and protein levels could be prevented by blocking N-myc upregulation downstream of Shh signaling. Furthermore, blocking Wingless-type MMTV integration site (Wnt) signaling by Wnt signaling pathway inhibitor Dickkopf 1 (Dkk-1) in the presence of Shh did not prevent the upregulation of β-catenin. We propose that in culture, Shh signaling regulates β-catenin expression through N-myc and results in increased CGNP proliferation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Alzheimer’s disease (AD) represents one of the main forms of dementia that afflicts our society. The expression of several genes has been associated with disease development. Despite this, the number of genes known to be capable of discriminating between AD patients according to sex remains deficient. In our study, we performed a transcriptomes meta-analysis on a large court of brains of healthy control subjects (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 2139) (NDHC) and brains of AD patients (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 1170). Our aim was to verify the brain expression levels of CHI3L2 and its correlation with genes associated with microglia-mediated neuroinflammation (IBA1), alteration of the blood–brain barrier (PECAM1), and neuronal damage (CALB1). We showed that the CHI3L2, IBA1, PECAM1, and CALB1 expression levels were modulated in the brains of patients with AD compared to NDHC subjects. Furthermore, both in NDHC and in AD patient’s brains, the CHI3L2 expression levels were directly correlated with IBA1 and PECAM1 and inversely with CALB1. Additionally, the expression levels of CHI3L2, PECAM1, and CALB1 but not of IBA1 were sex-depended. By stratifying the samples according to age and sex, correlation differences emerged between the expression levels of CHI3L2, IBA1, PECAM1, and CALB1 and the age of NDHC subjects and AD patients. CHI3L2 represents a promising gene potentially involved in the key processes underlying Alzheimer’s disease. Its expression in the brains of sex-conditioned AD patients opens up new possible sex therapeutic strategies aimed at controlling imbalance in disease progression.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;To explore plasma protein panels as potential biomarkers to screen for mild cognitive impairment (MCI) among elderly Chinese individuals with different educational backgrounds. Forty-four illiterate, 36 lower education (1–6 years), and 55 higher education (7 years or more) elderly individuals were included in the present study. Among all subjects, 67 were healthy individuals and 68 were diagnosed with MCI. Fifty plasma proteins in blood samples collected from these subjects were analyzed via the Luminex assay. Binary logistic regression was utilized to explore diagnostic models for MCI among the three educational subgroups. Then, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were conducted for the clinical validity of the MCI models. Among the analyzed proteins, clusterin was used in the model of MCI among the total sample with a sensitivity (se) of 67.6%, a specificity (sp) of 59.7%, and a classification rate of 63.68%. The MCI model for the illiterate group included cystatin C, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, and apolipoprotein A-I (se: 71.4%, sp.: 82.6%, accuracy: 77.25%). The sensitivity, specificity, and classification rate of the diagnostic model of MCI in elderly adults with lower education (human serum albumin) were each 75.0%. Additionally, the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy rate of the diagnostic model for MCI elderly individuals with higher education (alpha-acid glycoprotein + soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1 + pancreatic polypeptide) were 77.8%, 89.3%, and 83.60%, respectively. The performance of diagnostic models for MCI based on different educational levels is superior to that of diagnostic models for MCI without grouping by educational level.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Recent studies have shown contribution of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in the pathogenesis of immune-related disorders including multiple sclerosis (MS). Based on the role of these transcripts in the regulation of immune response, peripheral levels of lncRNAs can reflect the level of immune activation. In the present study, we quantified expression of four lncRNAs namely &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;SPRY4-IT1&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;HOXA-AS2&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;LINC-ROR&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;MEG3&lt;/em&gt; in venous blood of MS patients and controls using quantitative real-time PCR method. Relative expressions of &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;SPRY4-IT1&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;HOXA-AS2&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;LINC-ROR&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;MEG3&lt;/em&gt; were significantly lower in female MS patients compared with female healthy subjects. For &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;MEG3&lt;/em&gt;, this pattern of expression was also observed in male subjects. However, for other lncRNAs, no significant difference was detected between male patients and male controls. Expression of &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;HOXA-AS2&lt;/em&gt; was correlated with progression index (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;r&lt;/em&gt; = 0.36, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001). Besides, there was a significant correlation between expression of this lncRNA and expression of &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;LINC-ROR&lt;/em&gt; in MS patients (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;r&lt;/em&gt; = 0.44, &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.0001). There was no other correlation between expression of lncRNAs and clinical data in MS patients. In control group, expressions of none of lncRNAs were correlated with age of persons. Notably, significant correlations were demonstrated between expression levels of all lncRNAs in healthy subjects with &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;r&lt;/em&gt; values ranging from 0.23 to 0.42. The current investigation shows dysregulation of lncRNAs in MS patients in a sex-specific manner and warrants further studies to unravel the clinical and therapeutic implications of such dysregulation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most serious brain tumor and shows a high rate of drug resistance. Wnt signaling is a very important pathway in GBM that can activate/inhibit other pathways, such as apoptosis and autophagy. In this study, we evaluated the efficacy of a combination of temozolomide (TMZ) plus curcumin or nanomicellar-curcumin on the inhibition of GBM growth in vitro, via effects on autophagy, apoptosis, and the Wnt signaling pathway. Two concentrations of curcumin and nanomicellar-curcumin (i.e., 20 μM and 50 μM) alone, and in combination with TMZ (50 μM) were used to induce cytotoxicity in the U87 GBM cell line. Wnt signaling–, autophagy-, and apoptosis-related genes were assessed by quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and Western blots. All treatments (except 20 μM curcumin alone) significantly decreased the viability of U87 cells compared to controls. Curcumin (50 μM), nanomicellar-curcumin alone and in combination with TMZ significantly decreased the invasion and migration of U87 cells. Autophagy-related proteins (Beclin 1, LC3-I, LC3-II) were significantly increased. Apoptosis-related proteins (Bcl-2 and caspase 8) were also significantly increased, while Bax protein was significantly decreased. The expression levels of Wnt pathway–associated genes (β-catenin, cyclin D1, Twist, and ZEB1) were significantly reduced.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Serine Incorporator 2 (SERINC2) is a transmembrane protein that incorporates serine into membrane lipids. The function of SERINC2 in tumors has been reported, but the role of SERINC2 in gliomas is not fully understood. RNA-sequencing data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) (530 cases of low-grade glioma (LGG) and 173 cases of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM)) and microarray data from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) (Accession No. GSE16011, 284 cases gliomas were included) were acquired. Bioinformatics analysis was performed as the primary method to examine the function of SERINC2 and its correlated genes in glioma. SERINC2 was highly expressed in GBM compared with LGG and normal brain tissues. Elevated SERINC2 expression predicted shorter 5-, 10-, and 15-year overall survival (OS) of LGG patients and isocitrate dehydrogenase-1 (IDH-1) mutation-type LGG patients but had no effect on the OS of GBM patients. Cox regression analysis showed that SERINC2 was an independent factor in LGG OS. Methylation analysis found that 13 CpG methylation sites (methylation450k) correlated with SERINC2 expression in LGG. The mRNA expression level of SERINC2 was significant lower in the DNA deletion group than in the intact and amplification groups. A total of 390 copositive and 244 conegative correlation genes with SERINC2 were obtained from LGG in TCGA-LGG and GSE16011. Gene ontology (GO) category and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analyses showed that the copositive correlation genes were primarily enriched in the mitotic process and cell cycle. Combining the results from the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network of SERINC2 correlation genes and CytoHubba led to the selection of 10 hub genes (CDC20, FN1, AURKB, AURKA, KIF2C, BIRC5, CCNB2, UBE2C, CCNA2, and CENPE). OncoLnc analysis confirmed that high expression levels of these hub genes were associated with poor OS in LGG. Our results suggested that aberrant SERINC2 expression existed in glioma and that its expression might be a potential prognostic marker in LGG patients. CDC20, FN1, AURKB, AURKA, KIF2C, BIRC5, CCNB2, UBE2C, CCNA2, and CENPE may be potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets for LGG.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Pancreatic cancer-induced visceral pain is very common and is generally presented among the initial symptoms in patients; such pain is strongly associated with poor quality of life, impaired functional activity, and decreased survival. However, the principal neurobiological mechanisms of pain caused by pancreatic cancer have not been fully elucidated. Accumulating studies have shown that miRNAs play a major role in chronic pain by suppressing key molecules involved in nociception. In the present study, we report that microRNA (miR)-330 is highly expressed in the spinal dorsal horn (SDH) of nude mice with pancreatic cancer pain. Mimicking pancreatic carcinoma-induced SDH miR-330 upregulation by microinjection of miR-330 mimic into the SDH significantly induced abdominal mechanical allodynia in normal nude mice. Additionally, we found that the expression of GABA&lt;sub class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;R2 was significantly decreased in the SDH of nude mice with pancreatic cancer pain and was regulated directly by miR-330 both in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, inhibition of miR-330 rescued the expression of GABA&lt;sub class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;R2 and alleviated pancreatic carcinoma-induced abdominal pain hypersensitivity in nude mice with pancreatic carcinoma. These results show that miR-330 participates in the genesis of pancreatic carcinoma-induced pain hypersensitivity by inhibiting GABA&lt;sub class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;R2 expression in the SDH and might be a potential therapeutic target for pancreatic cancer pain.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Alzheimer’s disease (AD), the most prevalent representation of dementia, is a neurodegenerative disease resulting from the degenerative disturbance of the central nervous system. Previous studies have indicated that miR-107 is reduced in the brain neocortex of patients with AD; however, its underlying mechanism is not clear. Therefore, the objective of this study was to explore the question of whether miR-107 participates in AD development. The study confirmed that the miR-107 expression levels were dramatically decreased in patients with AD and in beta-amyloid (Aβ) (Aβ)-treated SH-SY5Y cells compared with control groups. Upregulation of miR-107 reversed the inhibitory role of Aβ on cell proliferation and viability. In addition, miR-107 upregulation also ameliorated the Aβ-induced inflammation and apoptosis of SH-SY5Y cells. Furthermore, using bioinformatic prediction, dual-luciferase reporter assay (DLRA), quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), and Western blot (WB), miR-107 was confirmed to reduce the expression level of FGF7, and it subsequently deactivated the FGFR2/PI3K/Akt pathway. Moreover, FGF7 overexpression counteracted the role of miR-107 in the viability, proliferation, inflammation, and apoptosis of Aβ-induced SH-SY5Y cells.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Vascular cognitive impairment (VCI) is the second most common type of dementia that accounts for 15 to 30%. To date, VCI still lacks an effective therapeutic strategy and an objective diagnostic tool. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of small non-coding RNAs that control gene expression at the post-translational level, playing an essential role in the pathogenesis of VCI. Moreover, accumulating evidence has indicated that miRNAs could be used as therapeutic strategies and diagnostic biomarkers of diseases. In this review, we summarize various mechanisms of miRNA-based therapeutics and candidate miRNAs for clinical diagnosis in VCI. Results showed that miRNAs participate in VCI via different mechanisms, including neuronal death, inflammation, oxidative stress, blood-brain barrier permeability, and synaptic translation. Circulating miRNAs of VCI have been detected in serum, plasma, and cerebrospinal fluid with various diagnostic power. Taking together, miRNAs are a potential biomarker for being a therapeutic agent and a diagnostic tool of VCI.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00871</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The advent of preclinical research scanners for in vivo imaging of small animals has added confidence into the multi-step decision-making process of radiotracer discovery and development. Furthermore, it has expanded the utility of imaging techniques available to dissect clinical questions, fostering a cyclic interaction between the clinical and the preclinical worlds. Significant efforts from medicinal chemistry have also made available several high-affinity and selective compounds amenable for radiolabeling, that target different receptors, transporters and enzymes in vivo. This substantially increased the range of applications of molecular imaging using positron emission tomography (PET) or single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). However, the process of developing novel radiotracers for in vivo imaging of the human brain is a multi-step process that has several inherent pitfalls and technical difficulties, which often hampers the successful translation of novel imaging agents from preclinical research into clinical use. In this paper, the process of radiotracer development and its relevance in brain research is discussed; as well as, its pitfalls, technical challenges and future promises. Examples of successful and unsuccessful translation of brain radiotracers will be presented.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.560176</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;It has long been hypothesized that pretend play is beneficial to social and cognitive development. However, there is little evidence regarding the neural regions that are active while children engage in pretend play. We examined the activation of prefrontal and posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS) regions using near-infrared spectroscopy while 42 4- to 8-year-old children freely played with dolls or tablet games with a social partner or by themselves. Social play activated right prefrontal regions more than solo play. Children engaged the pSTS during solo doll play but not during solo tablet play, suggesting they were rehearsing social cognitive skills more with dolls. These findings suggest social play utilizes multiple neural regions and highlight how doll play can achieve similar patterns of activation, even when children play by themselves. Doll play may provide a unique opportunity for children to practice social interactions important for developing social-emotional skills, such as empathy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Methodological Problems With Online Concussion Testing</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.509091</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Reaction time testing is widely used in online computerized concussion assessments, and most concussion studies utilizing the metric have demonstrated varying degrees of difference between concussed and non-concussed individuals. The problem with most of these online concussion assessments is that they predominantly rely on consumer grade technology. Typical administration of these reaction time tests involves presenting a visual stimulus on a computer monitor and prompting the test subject to respond as quickly as possible via keypad or computer mouse. However, inherent delays and variabilities are introduced to the reaction time measure by both computer and associated operating systems that the concussion assessment tool is installed on. The authors hypothesized systems that are typically used to collect concussion reaction time data would demonstrate significant errors in reaction time measurements. To remove human bias, a series of experiments was conducted robotically to assess timing errors introduced by reaction time tests under four different conditions. In the first condition, a visual reaction time test was conducted by flashing a visual stimulus on a computer monitor. Detection was via photodiode and mechanical response was delivered via computer mouse. The second condition employed a mobile device for the visual stimulus, and the mechanical response was delivered to the mobile device's touchscreen. The third condition simulated a tactile reaction time test, and mechanical response was delivered via computer mouse. The fourth condition also simulated a tactile reaction time test, but response was delivered to a dedicated device designed to store the interval between stimulus delivery and response, thus bypassing any problems hypothesized to be introduced by computer and/or computer software. There were significant differences in the range of responses recorded from the four different conditions with the reaction time collected from visual stimulus on a mobile device being the worst and the device with dedicated hardware designed for the task being the best. The results suggest that some of the commonly used visual tasks on consumer grade computers could be (and have been) introducing significant errors for reaction time testing and that dedicated hardware designed for the reaction time task is needed to minimize testing errors.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: Vicarious reward unblocks associative learning about novel cues in male rats</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/60755</link>
	<content:encoded>Many species, including rats, are sensitive to social signals and their valuation is important in social learning. Here we introduce a task that investigates if mutual reward delivery in male rats can drive associative learning. We found that when actor rats have fully learned a stimulus-self-reward association, adding a cue that predicted additional reward to a partner unblocked associative learning about this cue. By contrast, additional cues that did not predict partner reward remained blocked from acquiring positive associative value. Importantly, this social unblocking effect was still present when controlling for secondary reinforcement but absent when social information exchange was impeded, when mutual reward outcomes were disadvantageously unequal to the actor or when the added cue predicted reward delivery to an empty chamber. Taken together, these results suggest that mutual rewards can drive associative learning in rats and is dependent on vicariously experienced social and food-related cues.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: Myogenin is an essential regulator of adult myofibre growth and muscle stem cell homeostasis</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/60445</link>
	<content:encoded>Growth and maintenance of skeletal muscle fibres depend on coordinated activation and return to quiescence of resident muscle stem cells (MuSCs). The transcription factor Myogenin (Myog) regulates myocyte fusion during development, but its role in adult myogenesis remains unclear. In contrast to mice, &lt;i&gt;myog&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt; zebrafish are viable, but have hypotrophic muscles. By isolating adult myofibres with associated MuSCs we found that &lt;i&gt;myog&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt; myofibres have severely reduced nuclear number, but increased myonuclear domain size. Expression of fusogenic genes is decreased, Pax7 upregulated, MuSCs are fivefold more numerous and mis-positioned throughout the length of &lt;i&gt;myog&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt; myofibres instead of localising at myofibre ends as in wild-type. Loss of Myog dysregulates mTORC1 signalling, resulting in an 'alerted' state of MuSCs, which display precocious activation and faster cell cycle entry ex vivo, concomitant with &lt;i&gt;myod&lt;/i&gt; upregulation. Thus, beyond controlling myocyte fusion, Myog influences the MuSC:niche relationship, demonstrating a multi-level contribution to muscle homeostasis throughout life.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/59633</link>
	<content:encoded>Understanding the emergence of novel viruses requires an accurate and comprehensive annotation of their genomes. Overlapping genes (OLGs) are common in viruses and have been associated with pandemics, but are still widely overlooked. We identify and characterize &lt;i&gt;ORF3d&lt;/i&gt;, a novel OLG in SARS-CoV-2 that is also present in Guangxi pangolin-CoVs but not other closely related pangolin-CoVs or bat-CoVs. We then document evidence of &lt;i&gt;ORF3d&lt;/i&gt; translation, characterize its protein sequence, and conduct an evolutionary analysis at three levels: between taxa (21 members of &lt;i&gt;Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus&lt;/i&gt;), between human hosts (3978 SARS-CoV-2 consensus sequences), and within human hosts (401 deeply sequenced SARS-CoV-2 samples). &lt;i&gt;ORF3d&lt;/i&gt; has been independently identified and shown to elicit a strong antibody response in COVID-19 patients. However, it has been misclassified as the unrelated gene &lt;i&gt;ORF3b&lt;/i&gt;, leading to confusion. Our results liken &lt;i&gt;ORF3d&lt;/i&gt; to other accessory genes in emerging viruses and highlight the importance of OLGs.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: Establishment and maintenance of motor neuron identity via temporal modularity in terminal selector function</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/59464</link>
	<content:encoded>Terminal selectors are transcription factors (TFs) that establish during development and maintain throughout life post-mitotic neuronal identity. We previously showed that UNC-3/Ebf, the terminal selector of &lt;i&gt;C. elegans&lt;/i&gt; cholinergic motor neurons (MNs), acts indirectly to prevent alternative neuronal identities (Feng et al., 2020). Here, we globally identify the direct targets of UNC-3. Unexpectedly, we find that the suite of UNC-3 targets in MNs is modified across different life stages, revealing ‘temporal modularity’ in terminal selector function. In all larval and adult stages examined, UNC-3 is required for continuous expression of various protein classes (e.g. receptors, transporters) critical for MN function. However, only in late larvae and adults, UNC-3 is required to maintain expression of MN-specific TFs. Minimal disruption of UNC-3’s temporal modularity via genome engineering affects locomotion. Another &lt;i&gt;C. elegans&lt;/i&gt; terminal selector (UNC-30/Pitx) also exhibits temporal modularity, supporting the potential generality of this mechanism for the control of neuronal identity.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: Dopamine promotes instrumental motivation, but reduces reward-related vigour</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/58321</link>
	<content:encoded>We can be motivated when reward depends on performance, or merely by the prospect of a guaranteed reward. Performance-dependent (contingent) reward is instrumental, relying on an internal action-outcome model, whereas motivation by guaranteed reward may minimise opportunity cost in reward-rich environments. Competing theories propose that each type of motivation should be dependent on dopaminergic activity. We contrasted these two types of motivation with a rewarded saccade task, in patients with Parkinson’s disease (PD). When PD patients were ON dopamine, they had greater response vigour (peak saccadic velocity residuals) for &lt;i&gt;contingent&lt;/i&gt; rewards, whereas when PD patients were OFF medication, they had greater vigour for &lt;i&gt;guaranteed&lt;/i&gt; rewards. These results support the view that reward expectation and contingency drive distinct motivational processes, and can be dissociated by manipulating dopaminergic activity. We posit that dopamine promotes goal-directed motivation, but dampens reward-driven vigour, contradictory to the prediction that increased tonic dopamine amplifies reward expectation</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/57858</link>
	<content:encoded>Aberrant &lt;i&gt;HOXA9&lt;/i&gt; expression is a hallmark of most aggressive acute leukemias, notably those with KMT2A (MLL) gene rearrangements. &lt;i&gt;HOXA9&lt;/i&gt; overexpression not only predicts poor diagnosis and outcome but also plays a critical role in leukemia transformation and maintenance. However, our current understanding of &lt;i&gt;HOXA9&lt;/i&gt; regulation in leukemia is limited, hindering development of therapeutic strategies. Here, we generated the &lt;i&gt;HOXA9-mCherry&lt;/i&gt; knock-in reporter cell lines to dissect &lt;i&gt;HOXA9&lt;/i&gt; regulation. By utilizing the reporter and CRISPR/Cas9 screens, we identified transcription factors controlling &lt;i&gt;HOXA9&lt;/i&gt; expression, including a novel regulator, USF2, whose depletion significantly down-regulated &lt;i&gt;HOXA9&lt;/i&gt; expression and impaired MLLr leukemia cell proliferation. Ectopic expression of Hoxa9 rescued impaired leukemia cell proliferation upon USF2 loss. Cut&amp;amp;Run analysis revealed the direct occupancy of USF2 at &lt;i&gt;HOXA9&lt;/i&gt; promoter in MLLr leukemia cells. Collectively, the &lt;i&gt;HOXA9&lt;/i&gt; reporter facilitated the functional interrogation of the &lt;i&gt;HOXA9&lt;/i&gt; regulome and has advanced our understanding of the molecular regulation network in &lt;i&gt;HOXA9&lt;/i&gt;-driven leukemia.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: Cadherins regulate nuclear topography and function of developing ocular motor circuitry</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/56725</link>
	<content:encoded>In the vertebrate central nervous system, groups of functionally-related neurons, including cranial motor neurons of the brainstem, are frequently organised as nuclei. The molecular mechanisms governing the emergence of nuclear topography and circuit function are poorly understood. Here we investigate the role of cadherin-mediated adhesion in the development of zebrafish ocular motor (sub)nuclei. We find that developing ocular motor (sub)nuclei differentially express classical cadherins. Perturbing cadherin function in these neurons results in distinct defects in neuronal positioning, including scattering of dorsal cells and defective contralateral migration of ventral subnuclei. In addition, we show that cadherin-mediated interactions between adjacent subnuclei are critical for subnucleus position. We also find that disrupting cadherin adhesivity in dorsal oculomotor neurons impairs the larval optokinetic reflex, suggesting that neuronal clustering is important for co-ordinating circuit function. Our findings reveal that cadherins regulate distinct aspects of cranial motor neuron positioning and establish subnuclear topography and motor function.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.01.319574v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Type 2 dopamine receptor-expressing, or indirect pathway striatal projection (iSPNs), neurons comprise one of two major pathways through the basal ganglia, and are a major drug target for treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders. The function of iSPNs is unclear with proposed roles in suppression of unwanted actions and in refining selection actions or their kinematics. Here, we show that iSPNs can simultaneously suppress and facilitate conflicting motor actions in a lateralized licking task. Activation of iSPNs suppresses contraversive while promoting ipsiversive licking, allowing mice to rapidly switch between alternative motor programs. iSPN activity is prokinetic even when mice are not cued to perform an action. Activity in lateral superior colliculus (lSC), a basal ganglia target, is necessary for performing the task and predicts action. Furthermore, iSPN activation suppresses ipsilateral lSC , but surprisingly, excites contralateral lSC. iSPN activity has neuron specific effects that, at the population level, steers the neural trajectory towards that associated with ipsiversive licking. Thus, our results reveal a previously unknown specificity of iSPNs effects on downstream brain regions, including the ability to excite contralateral regions and trigger motor programs. These results suggest a general circuit mechanism for flexible action switching during competitive selection of lateralized actions.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.30.321752v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Task-trained artificial recurrent neural networks (RNNs) provide a computational modeling framework of increasing interest and application in computational, systems, and cognitive neuroscience. RNNs can be trained, using deep learning methods, to perform cognitive tasks used in animal and human experiments, and can be studied to investigate potential neural representations and circuit mechanisms underlying cognitive computations and behavior. Widespread application of these approaches within neuroscience has been limited by technical barriers in use of deep learning software packages to train network models. Here we introduce PsychRNN, an accessible, flexible, and extensible Python package for training RNNs on cognitive tasks. Our package is designed for accessibility, for researchers to define tasks and train RNN models using only Python and NumPy without requiring knowledge of deep learning software. The training backend is based on TensorFlow and is readily extensible for researchers with TensorFlow knowledge to develop projects with additional customization. PsychRNN implements a number of specialized features to support applications in systems and cognitive neuroscience. Users can impose neurobiologically relevant constraints on synaptic connectivity patterns. Furthermore, specification of cognitive tasks has a modular structure, which facilitates parametric variation of task demands to examine their impact on model solutions. PsychRNN also enables task shaping during training, or curriculum learning, in which tasks are adjusted in closed-loop based on performance. Shaping is ubiquitous in training of animals in cognitive tasks, and PsychRNN allows investigation of how shaping trajectories impact learning and model solutions. Overall, the PsychRNN framework facilitates application of trained RNNs in neuroscience research.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.30.321687v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>To derive meaning from natural sounds, the brain must integrate information across tens to hundreds of milliseconds. But it is unknown how different regions and hemispheres of human auditory cortex collectively integrate across multiple timescales. To answer this question, we developed a novel method to estimate integration periods and applied this method to intracranial recordings. We show that human auditory cortex integrates across time hierarchically, with three-fold longer integration periods in non-primary vs. primary regions, but no difference between hemispheres. Moreover, we show that selectivity for categories, such as speech and music, is restricted to electrodes with long integration periods. These findings suggest that short-term structure in natural sounds is analyzed by general-purpose acoustic mechanisms in primary auditory cortex, and then integrated over long timescales to form category-specific representations in non-primary regions. Our study thus reveals how the human brain constructs abstract representations of sound by integrating across multiple timescales.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Both the choroid plexus (CP) and the cortex are derived from the rostral neural tube during early embryonic development. In addition to producing CSF, the CP secretes essential factors that orchestrate cortical development and later neurogenesis. Previous brain modeling efforts with human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) generated either cortical or CP tissues in 3D culture. Here, we used hPSC-derived neuroectodermal cells, the building blocks of the anterior body, to simultaneously generate CP that forms ventricles and cortical cells in organoids (CVCOs), which can be maintained as 3D organoid cultures. Large scale culture revealed reproducibility of the protocol independent of cell lines, clones or batches. CVCOs contain mature and functional CP that projects multiple cilia into the ventricle-like fluid filled cysts and is in direct contact with appropriately patterned cortical cells. CVCOs thus recapitulate key features of developing forebrain structures observed in in vivo and constitute a useful for dissecting the role of CP in human forebrain development in health and disease.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Differential effects of emotional valence on mnemonic performance with greater hippocampal maturity</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.30.319178v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>The hippocampal formation (HF) facilitates the creation of declarative memories, with subfields providing unique contributions to the discriminability and generalizability of events. The HF itself and its connections with other structures exhibit a protracted development. Maturational differences across subfields facilitate a shift towards memory specificity, with peri-puberty sitting at the inflection point. Peri-puberty also happens to be a sensitive period in the development of anxiety disorders. Taken together, we believe HF development is critical to negative overgeneralization, a common feature of anxiety disorders. To investigate the role of the HF in behavioral discrimination and generalization we examined the relation between behavior and cross-sectional indices of HF maturity derived from subfield volume. Participants aged 9-14 years, recruited from clinical and community sources, performed a recognition task with emotionally valent (positive, negative) and neutral images. T1-weighted and diffusion-weighted structural scans were collected. Partial least squares correlations were used to derive a singular metric of maturity for both HF volume and structural connectivity. We found our volumetric HF maturity index was positively associated with discrimination for neutral images and generalization for negative images. Hippocampal-medial prefrontal cortex structural connectivity maturity metric evidenced a similar trend with behavior as the HF volumetric approach. These findings are important because they reflect a novel developmentally related balance between discrimination and generalization behavior supported by the hippocampus and its connections with other regions. Maturational shifts in this balance may contribute to negative overgeneralization, a common feature of anxiety disorders that escalates during the same developmental window.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Dynamics of brain function in chronic pain patients assessed by microstate analysis of resting-state electroencephalography</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.29.318246v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Chronic pain is a highly prevalent and severely disabling disease, which is associated with substantial changes of brain function. Such changes have mostly been observed when analyzing static measures of brain activity during the resting-state. However, brain activity varies over time and it is increasingly recognized that the temporal dynamics of brain activity provide behaviorally relevant information in different neuropsychiatric disorders. Here, we therefore investigated whether the temporal dynamics of brain function are altered in chronic pain. To this end, we applied microstate analysis to eyes-open and eyes-closed resting-state electroencephalography (EEG) data of 101 patients suffering from chronic pain and 88 age- and gender-matched healthy controls. Microstate analysis describes EEG activity as a sequence of a limited number of topographies termed microstates, which remain stable for tens of milliseconds. Our results revealed that sequences of 5 microstates, labelled with the letters A to E, described resting-state brain activity in both groups and conditions. Bayesian analysis of the temporal characteristics of microstates revealed that microstate D has a less predominant role in patients than in healthy participants. This difference was consistently found in eyes-open and eyes-closed EEG recordings. No evidence for differences in other microstates was found. As microstate D has been previously related to attentional networks and functions, abnormalities of microstate D might relate to dysfunctional attentional processes in chronic pain. These findings add to the understanding of the pathophysiology of chronic pain and might eventually contribute to the development of an EEG-based biomarker of chronic pain.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.28.317404v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Astronauts are exposed to microgravity and elevated CO2 levels onboard the International Space Station. Little is known about how microgravity and elevated CO2 combine to affect the brain and sensorimotor performance during and after spaceflight. Here we examined changes in resting-state functional connectivity (FC) and sensorimotor behavior associated with a spaceflight analog environment. Participants underwent 30 days of strict 6-degree head-down tilt bed rest with elevated ambient CO2 (HDBR+CO2). Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging and sensorimotor assessments were collected 13 and 7 days prior to bed rest, on days 7 and 29 of bed rest, and 0, 5, 12, and 13 days following bed rest. We assessed the time course of FC changes from before, during, to after HDBR+CO2. We then compared the observed connectivity changes with those of a HDBR control group, which underwent HDBR in standard ambient air. Moreover, we assessed associations between post-HDBR+CO2 FC changes and alterations in sensorimotor performance. HDBR+CO2 was associated with significant changes in functional connectivity between vestibular, visual, somatosensory and motor brain areas. Several of these sensory and motor regions showed post-HDBR+CO2 FC changes that were significantly associated with alterations in sensorimotor performance. We propose that these FC changes reflect multisensory reweighting associated with adaptation to the HDBR+CO2 microgravity analog environment. This knowledge will further improve HDBR as a model of microgravity exposure and contribute to our knowledge of brain and performance changes during and after spaceflight.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Selecting stimulation intensity in repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation studies: A systematic review between 1991 and 2020</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.28.316190v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Background: Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is an increasingly used, non-invasive brain stimulation technique in neuroscience research and clinical practice with a broad spectrum of suggested applications. Among other parameters, the choice of stimulus intensity and intracranial electric field strength substantially impact rTMS outcome. This review provides a systematic overview of the intensity selection approaches and stimulation intensities used in human rTMS studies. We also examined whether studies report sufficient information to reproduce stimulus intensities in basic science research models. Methods: We performed a systematic review by focusing on original studies published between 1991 and 2020. We included conventional (e.g., 1 Hz or 10 Hz) and patterned protocols (e.g., continuous or intermittent theta burst stimulation). We identified 3,784 articles in total, and we manually processed a representative portion (20%) of randomly selected articles. Results: The majority of the analyzed studies (90% of entries) used the motor threshold (MT) approach and stimulation intensities from 80 to 120% of the MT. For continuous and intermittent theta burst stimulation, the most frequent stimulation intensity was 80% of the active MT. Most studies (92% of entries) did not report sufficient information to reproduce the stimulation intensity. Only a minority of studies (1.03% of entries) estimated the rTMS-induced electric field strengths. Conclusion: We formulate easy-to-follow recommendations to help scientists and clinicians report relevant information on stimulation intensity. Future standardized reporting guidelines may facilitate the use of basic science approaches aiming at better understanding the molecular, cellular, and neuronal mechanisms of rTMS.</content:encoded>

The field of transcriptomics uses and measures mRNA as a proxy of gene expression. There are currently two major platforms in use for quantifying mRNA, microarray and RNA-Seq. Many comparative studies have shown that their results are not always consistent. In this study we aim to find a robust method to increase comparability of both platforms enabling data analysis of merged data from both platforms. We transformed high dimensional transcriptomics data from two different platforms into a lower dimensional, and biologically relevant dataset by calculating enrichment scores based on gene set collections for all samples. We compared the similarity between data from both platforms based on the raw data and on the enrichment scores. We show that the performed data transforms the data in a biologically relevant way and filters out noise which leads to increased platform concordance. We validate the procedure using predictive models built with microarray based enrichment scores to predict subtypes of breast cancer using enrichment scores based on sequenced data. Although microarray and RNA-Seq expression levels might appear different, transforming them into biologically relevant gene set enrichment scores significantly increases their correlation, which is a step forward in data integration of the two platforms. The gene set collections were shown to contain biologically relevant gene sets. More in-depth investigation on the effect of the composition, size, and number of gene sets that are used for the transformation is suggested for future research.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/QAKeFKz1bhY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Healthy adults flexibly adapt their learning strategies to ongoing changes in uncertainty, a key feature of adaptive behaviour. However, the developmental trajectory of this ability is yet unknown, as developmental studies have not incorporated trial-to-trial variation in uncertainty in their analyses or models. To address this issue, we compared adolescents’ and adults’ trial-to-trial dynamics of uncertainty, learning rate, and exploration in two tasks that assess learning in noisy but otherwise stable environments. In an estimation task—which provides direct indices of trial-specific learning rate—both age groups reduced their learning rate over time, as self-reported uncertainty decreased. Accordingly, the estimation data in both groups was better explained by a Bayesian model with dynamic learning rate (Kalman filter) than by conventional reinforcement-learning models. Furthermore, adolescents’ learning rates asymptoted at a higher level, reflecting an over-weighting of the most recent outcome, and the estimated Kalman-filter parameters suggested that this was due to an overestimation of environmental volatility. In a choice task, both age groups became more likely to choose the higher-valued option over time, but this increase in choice accuracy was smaller in the adolescents. In contrast to the estimation task, we found no evidence for a Bayesian expectation-updating process in the choice task, suggesting that estimation and choice tasks engage different learning processes. However, our modeling results of the choice task suggested that both age groups reduced their degree of exploration over time, and that the adolescents explored overall more than the adults. Finally, age-related differences in exploration parameters from fits to the choice data were mediated by participants’ volatility parameter from fits to the estimation data. Together, these results suggest that adolescents overestimate the rate of environmental change, resulting in elevated learning rates and increased exploration, which may help understand developmental changes in learning and decision-making.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/q_oMUJUHLS8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

During these days of global emergency for the COVID-19 disease outbreak, there is an urgency to share reliable information able to help worldwide life scientists to get better insights and make sense of the large amount of data currently available. In this study we used the results presented in [1] to perform two different Systems Biology analyses on the HCoV-host interactome. In the first one, we reconstructed the interactome of the HCoV-host proteins, integrating it with highly reliable miRNA and drug interactions information. We then added the IL-6 gene, identified in recent publications [2] as heavily involved in the COVID-19 progression and, interestingly, we identified several interactions with the reconstructed interactome. In the second analysis, we performed a Gene Ontology and a Pathways enrichment analysis on the full set of the HCoV-host interactome proteins and on the ones belonging to a significantly dense cluster of interacting proteins identified in the first analysis. Results of the two analyses provide a compact but comprehensive glance on some of the current state-of-the-art regulations, GO, and pathways involved in the HCoV-host interactome, and that could support all scientists currently focusing on SARS-CoV-2 research.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/JzU-epzTyFw&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Aberrant computational mechanisms of social learning and decision-making in schizophrenia and borderline personality disorder</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/MrkTPYrQlV8/article</link>

Psychiatric disorders are ubiquitously characterized by debilitating social impairments. These difficulties are thought to emerge from aberrant social inference. In order to elucidate the underlying computational mechanisms, patients diagnosed with major depressive disorder (N = 29), schizophrenia (N = 31), and borderline personality disorder (N = 31) as well as healthy controls (N = 34) performed a probabilistic reward learning task in which participants could learn from social and nonsocial information. Patients with schizophrenia and borderline personality disorder performed more poorly on the task than healthy controls and patients with major depressive disorder. Broken down by domain, borderline personality disorder patients performed better in the social compared to the non-social domain. In contrast, controls and MDD patients showed the opposite pattern and SCZ patients showed no difference between domains. In effect, borderline personality disorder patients gave up a possible overall performance advantage by concentrating their learning in the social at the expense of the non-social domain. We used computational modeling to assess learning and decision-making parameters estimated for each participant from their behavior. This enabled additional insights into the underlying learning and decision-making mechanisms. Patients with borderline personality disorder showed slower learning from social and non-social information and an exaggerated sensitivity to changes in environmental volatility, both in the non-social and the social domain, but more so in the latter. Regarding decision-making the modeling revealed that compared to controls and major depression patients, patients with borderline personality disorder and schizophrenia showed a stronger reliance on social relative to non-social information when making choices. Depressed patients did not differ significantly from controls in this respect. Overall, our results are consistent with the notion of a general interpersonal hypersensitivity in borderline personality disorder and schizophrenia based on a shared computational mechanism characterized by an over-reliance on beliefs about others in making decisions and by an exaggerated need to make sense of others during learning specifically in borderline personality disorder.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/MrkTPYrQlV8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Cyclic transitions between higher order motifs underlie sustained asynchronous spiking in sparse recurrent networks</title>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Kyle Bojanek, Yuqing Zhu, Jason MacLean&lt;/p&gt;

A basic—yet nontrivial—function which neocortical circuitry must satisfy is the ability to maintain stable spiking activity over time. Stable neocortical activity is asynchronous, critical, and low rate, and these features of spiking dynamics contribute to efficient computation and optimal information propagation. However, it remains unclear how neocortex maintains this asynchronous spiking regime. Here we algorithmically construct spiking neural network models, each composed of 5000 neurons. Network construction synthesized topological statistics from neocortex with a set of objective functions identifying naturalistic low-rate, asynchronous, and critical activity. We find that simulations run on the same topology exhibit sustained asynchronous activity under certain sets of initial membrane voltages but truncated activity under others. Synchrony, rate, and criticality do not provide a full explanation of this dichotomy. Consequently, in order to achieve mechanistic understanding of sustained asynchronous activity, we summarized activity as functional graphs where edges between units are defined by pairwise spike dependencies. We then analyzed the intersection between functional edges and synaptic connectivity- i.e. recruitment networks. Higher-order patterns, such as triplet or triangle motifs, have been tied to cooperativity and integration. We find, over time in each sustained simulation, low-variance periodic transitions between isomorphic triangle motifs in the recruitment networks. We quantify the phenomenon as a Markov process and discover that if the network fails to engage this stereotyped regime of motif dominance “cycling”, spiking activity truncates early. Cycling of motif dominance generalized across manipulations of synaptic weights and topologies, demonstrating the robustness of this regime for maintenance of network activity. Our results point to the crucial role of excitatory higher-order patterns in sustaining asynchronous activity in sparse recurrent networks. They also provide a possible explanation why such connectivity and activity patterns have been prominently reported in neocortex.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/JIKiGK-cDv0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Small membrane proteins represent a largely unexplored yet abundant class of proteins in pro- and eukaryotes. They essentially consist of a single transmembrane domain and are associated with stress response mechanisms in bacteria. How these proteins are inserted into the bacterial membrane is unknown. Our study revealed that in &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt;, the 27-amino-acid-long model protein YohP is recognized by the signal recognition particle (SRP), as indicated by in vivo and in vitro site-directed cross-linking. Cross-links to SRP were also observed for a second small membrane protein, the 33-amino-acid-long YkgR. However, in contrast to the canonical cotranslational recognition by SRP, SRP was found to bind to YohP posttranslationally. In vitro protein transport assays in the presence of a SecY inhibitor and proteoliposome studies demonstrated that SRP and its receptor FtsY are essential for the posttranslational membrane insertion of YohP by either the SecYEG translocon or by the YidC insertase. Furthermore, our data showed that the &lt;i&gt;yohP&lt;/i&gt; mRNA localized preferentially and translation-independently to the bacterial membrane in vivo. In summary, our data revealed that YohP engages an unique SRP-dependent posttranslational insertion pathway that is likely preceded by an mRNA targeting step. This further highlights the enormous plasticity of bacterial protein transport machineries.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/J1Buzevc9iA&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Matrix proteins are encoded by many enveloped viruses, including influenza viruses, herpes viruses, and coronaviruses. Underneath the viral envelope of influenza virus, matrix protein 1 (M1) forms an oligomeric layer critical for particle stability and pH-dependent RNA genome release. However, high-resolution structures of full-length monomeric M1 and the matrix layer have not been available, impeding antiviral targeting and understanding of the pH-dependent transitions involved in cell entry. Here, purification and extensive mutagenesis revealed protein–protein interfaces required for the formation of multilayered helical M1 oligomers similar to those observed in virions exposed to the low pH of cell entry. However, single-layered helical oligomers with biochemical and ultrastructural similarity to those found in infectious virions before cell entry were observed upon mutation of a single amino acid. The highly ordered structure of the single-layered oligomers and their likeness to the matrix layer of intact virions prompted structural analysis by cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM). The resulting 3.4-Å–resolution structure revealed the molecular details of M1 folding and its organization within the single-shelled matrix. The solution of the full-length M1 structure, the identification of critical assembly interfaces, and the development of M1 assembly assays with purified proteins are crucial advances for antiviral targeting of influenza viruses.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/oIHtLnau1qM&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

&lt;p&gt;To evaluate in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) and acute ischaemic stroke the association of prior anticoagulation with vitamin‐K antagonists (VKA) or direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) with stroke severity, intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) utilization, safety of IVT, and 3‐months outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cohort study of consecutive patients (2013–2019) on anticoagulation versus those without (controls) with regard to stroke severity, rates of IVT/MT, symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (sICH), and favorable outcome (mRS 0–2) at 3 months.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of 8179 patients (mean[SD]age, 79.8[9.6] years;49%women), 1486(18%) were on VKA treatment, 1634(20%) on DOAC treatment at stroke onset, and 5059 controls. Stroke severity was lower in patients on DOACs (median NIHSS 4,[IQR2–11]) as compared to VKA (6,[2–14]) and controls (7,[3–15], P&amp;lt;0.001; quantile regression: β ‐2.1, 95%CI ‐2.6 – ‐1.7). The IVT‐rate in potentially eligible patients was significantly lower in patients on VKA (156/247 (63%);aOR 0.67; 95%CI 0.50–0.90) and particularly in patients on DOACs (69/464 (15%); aOR 0.06; 95%CI 0.05–0.08) as compared to controls (1544/2504 (74%)). sICH after IVT occurred in 3.6%(2.6–4.7%) of controls, 9/195 (4.6%; 1.9–9.2%; aOR 0.93;0.46‐1.90) of patients on VKA and 2/65 (3.1%; 0.4–10.8%, aOR 0.56;0.28–1.12) of those on DOACs. After adjustments for prognostic confounders, DOAC pretreatment was associated with favorable 3‐month outcome (aOR 1.24,1.01–1.51).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prior DOAC therapy in patients with AF was associated with decreased admission stroke severity at onset and a remarkably low rate of IVT. Overall, patients on DOAC might have better functional outcome at 3 months. Further research is needed to overcome potential restrictions for IVT in patients taking DOACs.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>arXiv: Computer Science: Neural and Evolutionary Computing: Deep Evolution for Facial Emotion Recognition. (arXiv:2009.14194v1 [cs.NE])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.14194</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Deep facial expression recognition faces two challenges that both stem from
the large number of trainable parameters: long training times and a lack of
interpretability. We propose a novel method based on evolutionary algorithms,
that deals with both challenges by massively reducing the number of trainable
parameters, whilst simultaneously retaining classification performance, and in
some cases achieving superior performance. We are robustly able to reduce the
number of parameters on average by 95% (e.g. from 2M to 100k parameters) with
no loss in classification accuracy. The algorithm learns to choose small
patches from the image, relative to the nose, which carry the most important
information about emotion, and which coincide with typical human choices of
important features. Our work implements a novel form attention and shows that
evolutionary algorithms are a valuable addition to machine learning in the deep
learning era, both for reducing the number of parameters for facial expression
recognition and for providing interpretable features that can help reduce bias.

	<title>arXiv: Quantitative Biology: Neurons and Cognition: Focal to bilateral tonic-clonic seizures are associated with widespread network abnormality in temporal lobe epilepsy. (arXiv:2009.13567v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.13567</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Objective: To identify if whole-brain structural network alterations in
patients with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) and focal to bilateral tonic-clonic
seizures (FBTCS) differ from alterations in patients without FBTCS.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Methods: We dichotomized a cohort of 83 drug-resistant patients with TLE into
those with and without FBTCS and compared each group to 29 healthy controls.
For each subject, we used diffusion MRI to construct whole-brain structural
networks. First, we measured the extent of alterations by performing
FBTCS-negative (FBTCS-) versus control and FBTCS-positive (FBTCS+) versus
control comparisons, thereby delineating altered sub-networks of the
whole-brain structural network. Second, by standardising networks of each
patient using control networks, we measured the subject-specific abnormality at
every brain region in the network, thereby quantifying the spatial localisation
and the amount of abnormality in every patient.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Results: Both FBTCS+ and FBTCS- patient groups had altered sub-networks with
reduced fractional anisotropy (FA) and increased mean diffusivity (MD) compared
to controls. The altered subnetwork in FBTCS+ patients was more widespread than
in FBTCS- patients (441 connections altered at t&amp;gt;3, p&amp;lt;0.001 in FBTCS+ compared
to 21 connections altered at t&amp;gt;3, p=0.01 in FBTCS-). Significantly greater
abnormalities-aggregated over the entire brain network as well as assessed at
the resolution of individual brain areas-were present in FBTCS+ patients
(p&amp;lt;0.001, d=0.82). In contrast, the fewer abnormalities present in FBTCS-
patients were mainly localised to the temporal and frontal areas.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Significance: The whole-brain structural network is altered to a greater and
more widespread extent in patients with TLE and FBTCS. We suggest that these
abnormal networks may serve as an underlying structural basis or consequence of
the greater seizure spread observed in FBTCS.

	<title>arXiv: Computer Science: Neural and Evolutionary Computing: New complex network building methodology for High Level Classification based on attribute-attribute interaction. (arXiv:2009.06762v1 [cs.LG] CROSS LISTED)</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.06762</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;High-level classification algorithms focus on the interactions between
instances. These produce a new form to evaluate and classify data. In this
process, the core is the complex network building methodology because it
determines the metrics to be used for classification. The current methodologies
use variations of kNN to produce these graphs. However, this technique ignores
some hidden pattern between attributes and require normalization to be
accurate. In this paper, we propose a new methodology for network building
based on attribute-attribute interactions that do not require normalization and
capture the hidden patterns of the attributes. The current results show us that
could be used to improve some current high-level techniques.

	<title>Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience: Neuronal Representations of Tactic-Based Sensorimotor Transformations in the Primate Medial Prefrontal, Presupplementary, and Supplementary Motor Areas: A Comparative Study</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2020.536246</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Adaptive context-dependent behaviors necessitate the flexible selection of multiple behavioral tactics, i.e., internal protocols for selecting an action. Previous primate studies have shown that the posterior medial prefrontal cortex (pmPFC) contributes to the selection, retention, and use of tactics, but the manner in which this area employs selected tactics to convert sensory information into action and how that manner differs from downstream cortical motor areas have yet to be fully elucidated. To address this issue, the present study recorded neuronal activity in two monkeys as they performed a two-choice arm reaching task that required the selection of multiple tactics when converting spatial cue information into the direction of arm reaching. Neuronal populations in both pmPFC and presupplementary motor area (pre-SMA) represented tactics during their selection, maintenance in memory, and their use in determining an action. Additionally, they represented the monkeys’ action in the behavioral epoch in which the direction of reaching was determined. A striking contrast between the pmPFC and the pre-SMA was the representation of the spatial cue location in the former and its absence in the latter area. In individual neurons, neurons in pmPFC and pre-SMA had either single or mixed representation of tactics and action. Some of the pmPFC neurons additionally encoded cue location. Finally, neurons in the supplementary motor area mainly represented the action. Taken together, the present results indicate that, of these three areas, the pmPFC plays a cardinal role during the integration of behavioral tactics and visuospatial information when selecting an action.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Synaptic Neuroscience: Dendritic Spines Shape Analysis—Classification or Clusterization? Perspective</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsyn.2020.00031</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Dendritic spines are small protrusions from the dendrite membrane, where contact with neighboring axons is formed in order to receive synaptic input. Changes in size, shape, and density of synaptic spines are associated with learning and memory, and observed after drug abuse in a variety of neurodegenerative, neurodevelopmental, and psychiatric disorders. Due to the preeminent importance of synaptic spines, there have been major efforts into developing techniques that enable visualization and analysis of dendritic spines in cultured neurons, in fixed slices and in intact brain tissue. The classification of synaptic spines into predefined morphological groups is a standard approach in neuroscience research, where spines are divided into fixed categories such as thin, mushroom, and stubby subclasses. This study examines accumulated evidence that supports the existence of dendritic spine shapes as a continuum rather than separated classes. Using new approaches and software tools we reflect on complex dendritic spine shapes, positing that understanding of their highly dynamic nature is required to perform analysis of their morphology. The study discusses and compares recently developed algorithms that rely on clusterization rather than classification, therefore enabling new levels of spine shape analysis. We reason that improved methods of analysis may help to investigate a link between dendritic spine shape and its function, facilitating future studies of learning and memory as well as studies of brain disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Tau Protein and Its Role in Blood–Brain Barrier Dysfunction</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2020.570045</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The blood–brain barrier (BBB) plays a crucial role in maintaining the specialized microenvironment of the central nervous system (CNS). In aging, the stability of the BBB declines and the permeability increases. The list of CNS pathologies involving BBB dysfunction is growing. The opening of the BBB and subsequent infiltration of serum components to the brain can lead to a host of processes resulting in progressive synaptic, neuronal dysfunction, and detrimental neuroinflammatory changes. Such processes have been implicated in different diseases, including vascular dementia, stroke, Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Parkinson’s disease, multiple sclerosis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, hypoxia, ischemia, and diabetes mellitus. The BBB damage is also observed in tauopathies that lack amyloid-β overproduction, suggesting a role for tau in BBB damage. Tauopathies represent a heterogeneous group of around 20 different neurodegenerative diseases characterized by abnormal deposition of the MAPT in cells of the nervous system. Neuropathology of tauopathies is defined as intracellular accumulation of neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) consisting of aggregated hyper- and abnormal phosphorylation of tau protein and neuroinflammation. Disruption of the BBB found in tauopathies is driven by chronic neuroinflammation. Production of pro-inflammatory signaling molecules such as cytokines, chemokines, and adhesion molecules by glial cells, neurons, and endothelial cells determine the integrity of the BBB and migration of immune cells into the brain. The inflammatory processes promote structural changes in capillaries such as fragmentation, thickening, atrophy of pericytes, accumulation of laminin in the basement membrane, and increased permeability of blood vessels to plasma proteins. Here, we summarize the knowledge about the role of tau protein in BBB structural and functional changes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: L-Asparaginase Exerts Neuroprotective Effects in an SH-SY5Y-A53T Model of Parkinson’s Disease by Regulating Glutamine Metabolism</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2020.563054</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Background: Parkinson’s disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease worldwide and involves deficiencies in alpha-synuclein (α-Syn) degradation. Effective therapeutic strategies for PD are urgently needed. L-asparaginase (L-ASNase) has been developed for therapeutic applications in many fields because it catalyzes the hydrolysis of asparagine and glutamine in cancer cells, which may also activate autophagy and induce the degradation of accumulated α-Syn. However, the efficacy and related mechanism of L-ASNase in PD remain poorly understood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: We determined the correlation between L-ASNase and autophagic degradation of α-Syn in a cell model of PD. Mitochondrial function and apoptosis were examined in the presence or absence of L-ASNase. Then, we applied GC-MS/MS targeted amino acid metabolomics analysis to validate the amino acid regulation induced by L-ASNase treatment. Glutamine was added to verify whether the neuroprotective effect was induced by deprivation of glutamine. α-Syn-related autophagy and mitochondrial fusion/fission dynamics were detected to explore the mechanism of L-ASNase-based therapy in PD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: L-ASNase activated the autophagic degradation of α-Syn in a cell model of PD without cytotoxicity at specific concentrations/times. Under these conditions, L-ASNase showed substantial neuroprotective effects, including improvements in mitochondrial function and decreased apoptosis. Through GC-MS/MS targeted analysis, glutamine metabolism was identified as the target of L-ASNase in PD treatment, and the neuroprotective effect of L-ASNase was reduced after glutamine supplementation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: Our study demonstrated for the first time that L-ASNase had a neuroprotective effect on a cell model of PD through a moderate deprivation of glutamine, which induced autophagic activation and mitochondrial fusion. Therefore, we demonstrated that L-ASNase could be a promising and effective drug for PD treatment.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurogenesis: 17β-Estradiol Protects Neural Stem/Progenitor Cells Against Ketamine-Induced Injury Through Estrogen Receptor β Pathway</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.576813</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Ketamine inhibits neural stem/progenitor cell (NSPC) proliferation and disrupts normal neurogenesis in the developing brain. 17β-Estradiol alleviates neurogenesis damage and enhances behavioral performance after ketamine administration. However, the receptor pathway of 17β-estradiol that protects NSPCs from ketamine-induced injury remains unknown. In the present study, we investigated the role of estrogen receptor α (ER-α) and estrogen receptor β (ER-β) in 17β-estradiol’s protection against ketamine-exposed NSPCs and explored its potential mechanism. The primary cultured NSPCs were identified by immunofluorescence and then treated with ketamine and varying doses of ER-α agonist 4,4′,4″-(4-propyl-[1H]-pyrazole-1,3,5-triyl) trisphenol (PPT) or ER-β agonist 2,3-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)-propionitrile (DPN) for 24 h. NSPC proliferation was analyzed by 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine incorporation test. The expression of phosphorylated glycogen synthase kinase-3β (p-GSK-3β) was quantified by western blotting. It was found that treatment with different concentrations of PPT did not alter the inhibition of ketamine on NSPC proliferation. However, treatment with DPN attenuated the inhibition of ketamine on NSPC proliferation at 24 h after their exposure (P &amp;lt; 0.05). Furthermore, treatment with DPN increased p-GSK-3β expression in NSPCs exposed to ketamine. These findings indicated that ER-β mediates probably the protective effects of 17β-estradiol on ketamine-damaged NSPC proliferation and GSK-3β is involved in this process&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Investigation on the Alteration of Brain Functional Network and Its Role in the Identification of Mild Cognitive Impairment</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.558434</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is generally regarded as a prodromal stage of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). In coping with the challenges caused by AD, we analyzed resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data of 82 MCI subjects and 93 normal controls (NCs). The alteration of brain functional network in MCI was investigated on three scales, including global metrics, nodal characteristics, and modular properties. The results supported the existence of small worldness, hubs, and community structure in the brain functional networks of both groups. Compared with NCs, the network altered in MCI over all the three scales. In scale I, we found significantly decreased characteristic path length and increased global efficiency in MCI. Moreover, altered global network metrics were associated with cognitive level evaluated by neuropsychological assessments. In scale II, the nodal betweenness centrality of some global hubs, such as the right Crus II of cerebellar hemisphere (CERCRU2.R) and fusiform gyrus (FFG.R), changed significantly and associated with the severity and cognitive impairment in MCI. In scale III, although anatomically adjacent regions tended to be clustered into the same module regardless of group, discrepancies existed in the composition of modules in both groups, with a prominent separation of the cerebellum and a less localized organization of community structure in MCI compared with NC. Taking advantages of random forest approach, we achieved an accuracy of 91.4% to discriminate MCI patients from NCs by integrating cognitive assessments and network analysis. The importance of the used features fed into the classifier further validated the nodal characteristics of CERCRU2.R and FFG.R could be potential biomarkers in the identification of MCI. In conclusion, the present study demonstrated that the brain functional connectome data altered at the stage of MCI and could assist the automatic diagnosis of MCI patients.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Deep Learning Based Inter-subject Continuous Decoding of Motor Imagery for Practical Brain-Computer Interfaces</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00918</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Inter-subject transfer learning is a long-standing problem in brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) and has not yet been fully realized due to high inter-subject variability in the brain signals related to motor imagery (MI). The recent success of deep learning-based algorithms in classifying different brain signals warrants further exploration to determine whether it is feasible for the inter-subject continuous decoding of MI signals to provide contingent neurofeedback which is important for neurorehabilitative BCI designs. In this paper, we have shown how a convolutional neural network (CNN) based deep learning framework can be used for inter-subject continuous decoding of MI related electroencephalographic (EEG) signals using the novel concept of Mega Blocks for adapting the network against inter-subject variabilities. These Mega Blocks have the capacity to repeat a specific architectural block several times such as one or more convolutional layers in a single Mega Block. The parameters of such Mega Blocks can be optimized using Bayesian hyperparameter optimization. The results, obtained on the publicly available BCI competition IV-2b dataset, yields an average inter-subject continuous decoding accuracy of 71.49% (κ = 0.42) and 70.84% (κ = 0.42) for two different training methods such as adaptive moment estimation (Adam) and stochastic gradient descent (SGDM), respectively, in 7 out of 9 subjects. Our results show for the first time that it is feasible to use CNN based architectures for inter-subject continuous decoding with a sufficient level of accuracy for developing calibration-free MI-BCIs for practical purposes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroinformatics: A Multi-Scale Computational Model of Excitotoxic Loss of Dopaminergic Cells in Parkinson's Disease</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fninf.2020.00034</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by loss of dopaminergic neurons in substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc). Although the exact cause of cell death is not clear, the hypothesis that metabolic deficiency is a key factor has been gaining attention in recent years. In the present study, we investigated this hypothesis using a multi-scale computational model of the subsystem of the basal ganglia comprising the subthalamic nucleus (STN), globus pallidus externa (GPe), and SNc. The proposed model is a multiscale model in that interaction among the three nuclei are simulated using more abstract Izhikevich neuron models, while the molecular pathways involved in cell death of SNc neurons are simulated in terms of detailed chemical kinetics. Simulation results obtained from the proposed model showed that energy deficiencies occurring at cellular and network levels could precipitate the excitotoxic loss of SNc neurons in PD. At the subcellular level, the models show how calcium elevation leads to apoptosis of SNc neurons. The therapeutic effects of several neuroprotective interventions are also simulated in the model. From neuroprotective studies, it was clear that glutamate inhibition and apoptotic signal blocker therapies were able to halt the progression of SNc cell loss when compared to other therapeutic interventions, which only slowed down the progression of SNc cell loss.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Competition Enhances the Effectiveness and Motivation of Attention Rehabilitation After Stroke. A Randomized Controlled Trial</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.575403</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Attention deficits are among the most common cognitive impairments observed after experiencing stroke. However, a very limited number of studies have investigated the effectiveness of interventions that specifically focus on the rehabilitation of attention deficits among subjects with impaired attention. Although several interventions have included the use of computerized programs to provide dynamic stimuli, real-time performance feedback, and motivating tasks, existing studies have not exploited the potential benefits of multi-user interactions. Group-based and competitive interventions have been reported to be more enjoyable and motivating, depending on individual traits, and may potentially be more demanding, which may increase their effectiveness. This study investigated the effectiveness and motivating abilities of an intervention specifically designed to address attention deficits. This intervention combined paper-and-pencil tasks and interactive, computerized, multi-touch exercises, which were administered, either non-competitively or competitively, to a group of 43 individuals with chronic stroke. The mediating effects of competitiveness were evaluated for both intervention effectiveness and motivation. Participants were randomly sorted into two groups and underwent 20 one-hour group-based sessions, during which they either worked individually or competed with peers, according to their group allocation. Participants were assessed before and after the intervention, using the Conners' Continuous Performance Test, the d2 Test of Attention, the Color Trail Test, the Digit Span Test, and the Spatial Span Test. The competitiveness and subjective experiences of the participants after the intervention were investigated with the Revised Competitiveness Index and the Intrinsic Motivation Inventory, respectively. The results showed that participants who competed demonstrated significantly greater improvements in all cognitive abilities, except for divided attention, and reported greater enjoyment than their non-competitive peers. Both groups reported comparable levels of perceived competence, pressure, and usefulness. Interestingly, the competitiveness of the participants did not alter either the effectiveness or the subjective experience of the intervention. These findings suggest that competition might enhance the effectiveness and enjoyment of rehabilitation interventions designed to address attention deficits in individuals post-stroke, regardless of their level of competitiveness and without having a negative effect on their perceived pressure and competence.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.556519</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between olfactory recognition and morphological changes in olfactory brain regions including the amygdala, hippocampus, rectus, parahippocampus, orbitofrontal cortex, and medial frontal cortex in 27 elderly subjects and 27 younger healthy controls. The specific aim of the study was to determine which brain areas are associated with the initial decline of olfaction in elderly subjects, which occurs before the onset of dementia. All subjects underwent magnetic resonance imaging to measure anatomical brain volume and cortical thickness, and subjects were assessed using tests of olfactory acuity and cognitive function measured with the Montreal Cognitive Assessment. Overall brain volume reductions were observed in elderly subjects compared with young healthy controls, but only reduction in the volume of the left hippocampus was associated with decreased olfactory ability. The parahippocampus of elderly subjects was not different from that of controls; the extent of the reduction of parahippocampus volume varied among individuals, and reduction in this region was associated with olfactory decline. Similarly, parahippocampus thinning was associated with decreased olfactory function. The path analysis showed direct and indirect effects of hippocampus and parahippocampus volume on olfactory ability and that volume reductions in these areas were not associated with cognitive function. Parahippocampus volume reduction and thinning exhibited individual variation; this may be the first appearance of pathological changes and may lead to dysfunction in the connection of olfactory memory to the neocortex. Parahippocampus change may reflect the first sign of olfactory impairment prior to pathological changes in the hippocampus, amygdala and orbitofrontal cortex.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Directional Local Field Potentials in the Subthalamic Nucleus During Deep Brain Implantation of Parkinson’s Disease Patients</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.521282</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Segmented deep brain stimulation leads feature directional electrodes that allow for a finer spatial control of electrical stimulation compared to traditional ring-shaped electrodes. These segmented leads have demonstrated enlarged therapeutic windows and have thus the potential to improve the treatment of Parkinson’s disease patients. Moreover, they provide a unique opportunity to record directional local field potentials. Here, we investigated whether directional local field potentials can help identify the best stimulation direction to assist device programming. Four Parkinson’s disease patients underwent routine implantation of the subthalamic nucleus. Firstly, local field potentials were recorded in three directions for two conditions: In one condition, the patient was at rest; in the other condition, the patient’s arm was moved. Secondly, current thresholds for therapeutic and side effects were identified intraoperatively for directional stimulation. Therapeutic windows were calculated from these two thresholds. Thirdly, the spectral power of the total beta band (13–35 Hz) and its sub-bands low, high, and peak beta were analyzed post hoc. Fourthly, the spectral power was used by different algorithms to predict the ranking of directions. The spectral power profiles were patient-specific, and spectral peaks were found both in the low beta band (13–20 Hz) and in the high beta band (20.5–35 Hz). The direction with the highest spectral power in the total beta band was most indicative of the 1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; best direction when defined by therapeutic window. Based on the total beta band, the resting condition and the moving condition were similarly predictive about the direction ranking and classified 83.3% of directions correctly. However, different algorithms were needed to predict the ranking defined by therapeutic window or therapeutic current threshold. Directional local field potentials may help predict the best stimulation direction. Further studies with larger sample sizes are needed to better distinguish the informative value of different conditions and the beta sub-bands.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience: Identifiability of a Binomial Synapse</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2020.558477</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Synapses are highly stochastic transmission units. A classical model describing this stochastic transmission is called the binomial model, and its underlying parameters can be estimated from postsynaptic responses to evoked stimuli. The accuracy of parameter estimates obtained via such a model-based approach depends on the identifiability of the model. A model is said to be structurally identifiable if its parameters can be uniquely inferred from the distribution of its outputs. However, this theoretical property does not necessarily imply practical identifiability. For instance, if the number of observations is low or if the recording noise is high, the model's parameters can only be loosely estimated. Structural identifiability, which is an intrinsic property of a model, has been widely characterized; but practical identifiability, which is a property of both the model and the experimental protocol, is usually only qualitatively assessed. Here, we propose a formal definition for the practical identifiability domain of a statistical model. For a given experimental protocol, this domain corresponds to the set of parameters for which the model is correctly identified as the ground truth compared to a simpler alternative model. Considering a model selection problem instead of a parameter inference problem allows to derive a non-arbitrary criterion for practical identifiability. We apply our definition to the study of neurotransmitter release at a chemical synapse. Our contribution to the analysis of synaptic stochasticity is three-fold: firstly, we propose a quantitative criterion for the practical identifiability of a statistical model, and compute the identifiability domains of different variants of the binomial release model (uni or multi-quantal, with or without short-term plasticity); secondly, we extend the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC), a classically used tool for model selection, to models with correlated data (which is the case for most models of chemical synapses); finally, we show that our approach allows to perform data free model selection, i.e., to verify if a model used to fit data was indeed identifiable even without access to the data, but having only access to the fitted parameters.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience: Inter-band Bispectral Analysis of EEG Background Activity to Characterize Alzheimer's Disease Continuum</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2020.00070</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The aim of this study was to characterize the EEG alterations in inter-band interactions along the Alzheimer's disease (AD) continuum. For this purpose, EEG background activity from 51 healthy control subjects, 51 mild cognitive impairment patients, 50 mild AD patients, 50 moderate AD patients, and 50 severe AD patients was analyzed by means of bispectrum. Three inter-band features were extracted from bispectrum matrices: bispectral relative power (BispRP), cubic bispectral entropy (BispEn), and bispectral median frequency (BispMF). BispRP results showed an increase of delta and theta interactions with other frequency bands and the opposite behavior for alpha, beta-1, and beta-2. Delta and theta interactions, along with the rest of the spectrum, also experimented a decrease of BispEn with disease progression, suggesting these bands interact with a reduced variety of components in advanced stages of dementia. Finally, BispMF showed a consistent reduction along the AD continuum in all bands, which is reflective of an interaction of the global spectrum with lower frequency bands as the disease develops. Our results indicate a progressive decrease in inter-band interactions with the severity of the disease, especially those involving high frequency components. Since inter-band coupling oscillations are related to complex and multi-scaled brain processes, these alterations likely reflect the neurodegeneration associated with the AD continuum.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Cognitive function was evaluated with the Montreal Cognitive Assessment Scale, Victoria Stroop Test, Rivermead Behavior Memory Test, and Activities of Daily Living (ADL) assessed with the Modified Barthel Index. 14 patients received functional MRI scan, a useful non-invasive technique of determining how structurally segregated and functionally specialized brain areas were interconnected, which was reflected by blood oxygenation level–dependent signals. The amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF) and functional connectivity (FC) were applied as the analytical approaches, which were used to measure the resting-state brain activity and functional connection.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;rTMS improved cognitive functions and ADLs for PSCI patients relative to patients who received no-stim control treatment. The cognitive improvements correlated to increased ALFF of the left medial prefrontal cortex, and increased FC of right medial prefrontal cortex and right ventral anterior cingulate cortex.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;10 Hz rTMS at DLPFC could improve cognitive function and quality of life for PSCI patients, which is associated with an altered frontal cortical activity.&lt;/p&gt;Clinical Registration&lt;p&gt;Chinese Clinical Trial Registry, ChiCTR-IPR-17011908, http://www.chictr.org.cn/index.aspx.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The lack of effective treatments for most neurological diseases has prompted the search for novel therapeutic options. Interestingly, neuroinflammation is emerging as a common feature to target in most CNS pathologies. Recent studies suggest that targeted delivery of small molecules to reduce neuroinflammation can be beneficial. However, suboptimal drug delivery to the CNS is a major barrier to modulate inflammation because neurotherapeutic compounds are currently being delivered systemically without spatial or temporal control. Emerging nanomaterial technologies are providing promising and superior tools to effectively access neuropathological tissue in a controlled manner. Here we highlight recent advances in nanomaterial technologies for drug delivery to the CNS. We propose that state-of-the-art nanoparticle drug delivery platforms can significantly impact local CNS bioavailability of pharmacological compounds and treat neurological diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Endocannabinoid Signaling Contributes to Experience-Induced Increase of Synaptic Release Sites From Parvalbumin Interneurons in Mouse Visual Cortex</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.571133</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;During postnatal development of the visual cortex between eye-opening to puberty, visual experience promotes a gradual increase in the strength of inhibitory synaptic connections from parvalbumin-positive interneurons (PV-INs) onto layer 2/3 pyramidal cells. However, the detailed connectivity properties and molecular mechanisms underlying these developmental changes are not well understood. Using dual-patch clamp in brain slices from G42 mice, we revealed that both connection probability and the number of synaptic release sites contributed to the enhancement of synaptic strength. The increase of release site number was hindered by dark rearing from eye-opening and rescued by 3-days re-exposure to the normal visual environment. The effect of light re-exposure on restoring synaptic release sites in dark reared mice was mimicked by the agonist of cannabinoid-1 (CB1) receptors and blocked by an antagonist of these receptors, suggesting a role for endocannabinoid signaling in light-induced maturation of inhibitory connectivity from PV-INs to pyramidal cells during postnatal development.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Since the discovery that the pro-inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) mediates some forms of HSP, it has been possible to probe some of the in vivo contribution of TNF-mediated HSP. Work from our lab and others has found roles for TNF-HSP in a variety of functions, including the developmental plasticity of sensory systems, models of drug addiction, and the response to psychiatric drugs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Enhanced spontaneous GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptor activity is associated with focal cortical dysplasia (FCD), a developmental malformation of the cerebral cortex. Clinical manifestations in FCD vary with age at epilepsy onset with a more favorable prognosis in patients with late-onset (LO) compared to that in cases with early-onset (EO). This study was designed to test the hypothesis in FCD that spontaneous GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptor-mediated epileptogenicity depends on the age at epilepsy onset and varies between patients with early and late-onset age in FCD. To this end, brain specimens were obtained from the maximal spiking region (MAX) and minimal spiking region (MIN) of the epileptic foci of EO (n = 14, mean age = 10.6 ± 2.9 years) and LO (n = 10, mean age = 27 ± 5.6 years) patients undergoing electrocorticography (ECoG) guided surgery. The whole-cell patch-clamp technique was used to record spontaneous GABAergic currents from normal-looking pyramidal neurons in slice preparations of resected brain samples. We detected higher frequency and amplitude of GABAergic events in MAX samples compared to MIN samples of LO patients, while they were comparable in MIN and MAX samples of EO patients. Further GABAergic activity in the MIN and MAX samples of EO patients was higher than the MIN samples of LO patients. This suggests that in LO patients, GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptor-mediated epileptogenicity is confined only to the high spiking areas, but in EO patients, it affects low spiking regions as well.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.572421</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Multiple system atrophy (MSA), an atypical parkinsonism of alpha-synucleinopathies, has no specific biomarker of diagnosis. According to different combinations of symptoms, MSA can be classified as parkinsonism-type MSA (MSA-P) and cerebellar-type MSA (MSA-C; Watanabe et al., 2018). Amide proton transfer (APT) imaging is by far the most studied chemical exchange saturation transfer imaging for its sensitivity to mobile protons and peptides in tissues. We hypothesize that APT imaging may be a feasible biomarker of MSA-P. Twenty MSA-P patients and 20 age-matched normal controls were enrolled in this study and underwent MR exams on a 3.0-T MR scanner. Magnetization transfer spectra at 3.5 ppm were acquired at two transverse slices of the head, including the midbrain and the basal ganglia. Mann–Whitney U test was used to compare the asymmetrical magnetization transfer ratio (MTR&lt;sub&gt;asym&lt;/sub&gt;) difference between MSA-P patients and normal controls. The APT MTR&lt;sub&gt;asym&lt;/sub&gt; values of MSA patients in the red nucleus (RN) (SN; P = 0.000), substantia nigra (P = 0.000), thalamus (P = 0.000), and putamen (P = 0.013) were significantly higher than those in normal controls. There was a negative correlation between APT MTR&lt;sub&gt;asym&lt;/sub&gt; and the score of part III of the Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale (R = −0.338, P = 0.044) in the putamen, while there was a positive correlation between the APT MTR&lt;sub&gt;asym&lt;/sub&gt; and the rate of motor symptom progression (R = 0.406, P = 0.017) in the RN. These findings suggest that APT MTR&lt;sub&gt;asym&lt;/sub&gt; changes are found and may be of value in the diagnosis of MSA-P.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Age-Related Shifts in Theta Oscillatory Activity During Audio-Visual Integration Regardless of Visual Attentional Load</title>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Audio-visual integration (AVI) is higher in attended conditions than in unattended conditions. Here, we explore the AVI effect when the attentional recourse is competed by additional visual distractors, and its aging effect using single- and dual-tasks. The results showed the highest AVI effect under single-task-attentional-load condition than under no- and dual-task-attentional-load conditions (all P &amp;lt; 0.05) in both older and younger groups, but the AVI effect was weaker and delayed for older adults compared to younger adults for all attentional-load conditions (all P &amp;lt; 0.05). The non-phase-locked oscillation for AVI analysis illustrated the highest theta and alpha oscillatory activity for single-task-attentional-load condition than for no- and dual-task-attentional-load conditions, and the AVI oscillatory activity mainly occurred in the Cz, CP1 and Oz of older adults but in the Fz, FC1, and Cz of younger adults. The AVI effect was significantly negatively correlated with FC1 (r&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.1468, P = 0.05) and Cz (r&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.1447, P = 0.048) theta activity and with Fz (r&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.1557, P = 0.043), FC1 (r&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.1042, P = 0.008), and Cz (r&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.0897, P = 0.010) alpha activity for older adults but not for younger adults in dual task. These results suggested a reduction in AVI ability for peripheral stimuli and a shift in AVI oscillation from anterior to posterior regions in older adults as an adaptive mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: New insights on the modeling of the molecular mechanisms underlying neural maps alignment in the midbrain</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/59754</link>
	<content:encoded>We previously identified and modeled a principle of visual map alignment in the midbrain involving the mapping of the retinal projections and concurrent transposition of retinal guidance cues into the superior colliculus providing positional information for the organization of cortical V1 projections onto the retinal map (Savier et al., 2017). This principle relies on mechanisms involving Epha/Efna signaling, correlated neuronal activity and axon competition. Here, using the 3-step map alignment computational model, we predict and validate in vivo the visual mapping defects in a well-characterized mouse model. Our results challenge previous hypotheses and provide an alternative, although complementary, explanation for the phenotype observed. In addition, we propose a new quantification method to assess the degree of alignment and organization between maps, allowing inter-model comparisons. This work generalizes the validity and robustness of the 3-step map alignment algorithm as a predictive tool and confirms the basic mechanisms of visual map organization.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/58993</link>
	<content:encoded>An important challenge of crop improvement strategies is assigning function to paralogs in polyploid crops. Here, we describe the circadian transcriptome in the polyploid crop &lt;i&gt;Brassica rapa&lt;/i&gt;. Strikingly, almost three quarters of expressed genes exhibited circadian rhythmicity. Genetic redundancy resulting from whole genome duplication is thought to facilitate evolutionary change through sub- and neo-functionalization among paralogous gene pairs. We observed genome-wide expansion of circadian expression phase among retained paralogous pairs. Using gene regulatory network models, we compared transcription factor targets between &lt;i&gt;B. rapa&lt;/i&gt; and Arabidopsis circadian networks to reveal evidence for divergence between &lt;i&gt;B. rapa&lt;/i&gt; paralogs that may be driven in part by variation in conserved non-coding sequences (CNS). Additionally, differential drought response among retained paralogous pairs suggests further functional diversification. These findings support the rapid expansion and divergence of the transcriptional network in a polyploid crop and offer a new approach for assessing paralog activity at the transcript level.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/58468</link>
	<content:encoded>Natural sounds convey information via frequency and amplitude modulations (FM and AM). Humans are acutely sensitive to the slow rates of FM that are crucial for speech and music. This sensitivity has long been thought to rely on precise stimulus-driven auditory-nerve spike timing (time code), whereas a coarser code, based on variations in the cochlear place of stimulation (place code), represents faster FM rates. We tested this theory in listeners with normal and impaired hearing, spanning a wide range of place-coding fidelity. Contrary to predictions, sensitivity to both slow and fast FM correlated with place-coding fidelity. We also used incoherent AM on two carriers to simulate place coding of FM and observed poorer sensitivity at high carrier frequencies and fast rates, two properties of FM detection previously ascribed to the limits of time coding. The results suggest a unitary place-based neural code for FM across all rates and carrier frequencies.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: Antinociceptive modulation by the adhesion GPCR CIRL promotes mechanosensory signal discrimination</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/56738</link>
	<content:encoded>Adhesion-type GPCRs (aGPCRs) participate in a vast range of physiological processes. Their frequent association with mechanosensitive functions suggests that processing of mechanical stimuli may be a common feature of this receptor family. Previously, we reported that the &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; aGPCR CIRL sensitizes sensory responses to gentle touch and sound by amplifying signal transduction in low-threshold mechanoreceptors (Scholz et al., 2017). Here, we show that &lt;i&gt;Cirl&lt;/i&gt; is also expressed in high-threshold mechanical nociceptors where it adjusts nocifensive behaviour under physiological and pathological conditions. Optogenetic &lt;i&gt;in vivo &lt;/i&gt;experiments indicate that CIRL lowers cAMP levels in both mechanosensory submodalities. However, contrasting its role in touch-sensitive neurons, CIRL dampens the response of nociceptors to mechanical stimulation. Consistent with this finding, rat nociceptors display decreased &lt;i&gt;Cirl1&lt;/i&gt; expression during allodynia. Thus, cAMP-downregulation by CIRL exerts opposing effects on low-threshold mechanosensors and high-threshold nociceptors. This intriguing bipolar action facilitates the separation of mechanosensory signals carrying different physiological information.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.30.321299v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>The two visual streams hypothesis is a robust framework that has inspired many studies in the past three decades. One of the well-studied claims of this hypothesis is the idea that the dorsal visual pathway is involved in visually guided motor behavior, and it is operating with a short memory. Conversely, this hypothesis claims that the ventral visual pathway is involved in object classification, and it works using a long-term memory. In this study, we tested these claims by training identical recurrent neural networks to either perform viewpoint-invariant object classification (a task attributed to dorsal stream) or orientation classification (a task attributed to dorsal stream) and measured how much they rely on their memory in each task. Using a modified leaky-integrator echo state recurrent network, we found that object classification requires a longer memory compared to orientation classification. However, when we used long-short-term memory (LSTM) networks, we observed that object classification requires longer memory only in larger datasets. Accordingly, our results suggest that having a longer memory is advantageous in performing ventral stream's tasks more than their dorsal counterparts, as was originally suggested by the two-streams hypothesis.</content:encoded>

Harmonic signals were consistently easier to detect than otherwise identical inharmonic signals. Harmonicity also improved discrimination of sounds in noise. In contrast to other documented effects of harmonicity, harmonic detection advantages were comparable in musicians and non-musicians. The results show that harmonicity is critical for hearing in noise, demonstrating a previously unappreciated aspect of auditory scene analysis. The consistency of the effect across synthetic and natural stimuli, as well as across musical expertise, suggests its importance in everyday hearing.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Similar sensorimotor transformations control balance during standing and walking</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.30.320127v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Standing and walking balance control in humans relies on the transformation of sensory information to motor commands that drive muscles. Here, we evaluated whether sensorimotor transformations underlying walking balance control can be described by task-level center of mass kinematics feedback similar to standing balance control. We found that delayed feedback of center of mass position and velocity, but not local feedback of joint positions and velocities, can explain reactive ankle muscle activity and joint moments in response to perturbations of walking across protocols (discrete and continuous platform translations and discrete pelvis pushes). Feedback gains were modulated during the gait cycle and decreased with walking speed. Our results thus suggest that similar task-level variables, i.e. center of mass position and velocity, are controlled across standing and walking but that feedback gains are modulated during gait to accommodate changes in body configuration during the gait cycle and in stability with walking speed. These findings have important implications for modelling the neuromechanics of human balance control and for biomimetic control of wearable robotic devices. The feedback mechanisms we identified can be used to extend the current neuromechanical models that lack balance control mechanisms for the ankle joint. When using these models in the control of wearable robotic devices, we believe that this will facilitate shared control of balance between the user and the robotic device.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Use of non-invasive intracranial pressure pulse waveform to monitor patients with End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD)</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.30.320085v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>End-stage renal disease (ESRD) is treated mainly by hemodialysis, however, hemodialysis is associated with frequent complications, some of them involve the increased intracranial pressure. In this context, monitoring the intracranial pressure of these patients may lead to a better understanding of how intracranial pressure morphology varies with hemodialysis. This study aimed to follow-up patients with ESRD by monitoring intracranial pressure before and after hemodialysis sessions using a noninvasive method. We followed-up 42 patients with ESRD in hemodialysis, for six months. Noninvasive intracranial pressure monitoring data were obtained through analysis of intracranial pressure waveform morphology, this information was uploaded to Brain4care(R) cloud algorithm for analysis. The cloud automatically sends a report containing intracranial pressure parameters. In total, 4881 data points were collected during the six months of follow-up. The intracranial pressure parameters (time to peak and P2/P1 ratio) were significantly higher in predialysis when compared to postdialysis for the three weekly sessions and throughout the follow-up period ( p &amp;lt;0.01) data showed general improvement in brain compliance after the hemodialysis session. Furthermore, intracranial pressure parameters were significantly higher in the first weekly hemodialysis session ( p &amp;lt;0.05). In conclusion, there were significant differences between pre and postdialysis intracranial pressure in patients with ESRD on hemodialysis. Additionally, the pattern of the intracranial pressure alterations was consistent over time suggesting that hemodialysis can improve time to peak and P2/P1 ratio which may reflect in brain compliance.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.30.316844v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Background: Current neurocognitive models of language function have been primarily built from evidence regarding object naming, and their hypothesized white matter circuit mechanisms tend to be coarse-grained. Methods: In this cross-sectional, observational study, we used novel correlational tractography to assess the white matter circuit mechanism behind verb retrieval, measured via action picture-naming performance in adults with chronic aphasia. Results: The analysis identified tracts implicated in current neurocognitive dual-stream models of language function, including the left inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus, inferior longitudinal fasciculus, and arcuate fasciculus. However, the majority of tracts associated with verb retrieval were not ones included in dual-stream models of language function. Instead, they were projection pathways that connect frontal and parietal cortices to subcortical regions associated with motor functions, including the left corticothalamic pathway, frontopontine tract, parietopontine tract, corticostriatal pathway, and corticospinal tract. Conclusions: These results highlight that cortico-subcortical projection pathways implicated in motor functions may be importantly related to language function. This finding is consistent with grounded accounts of cognition and may furthermore inform neurocognitive models.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.29.319418v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>The brain supports adaptive behavior by generating predictions, learning from errors, and updating memories. Prediction error, or surprise, is a known trigger for memory updating; however, the mechanisms that link prediction error, neural representations, and naturalistic memory updating remain unknown. In an fMRI study, we elicited prediction errors by interrupting familiar narrative videos immediately before an expected conclusion. We found that prediction errors reversed the effect of post-video univariate hippocampal activation on subsequent memory: hippocampal activation predicted false memories after prediction errors, but protected memories from distortion after expected events. Tracking second-by-second neural patterns revealed that prediction errors disrupted the temporal continuity of hippocampal representations. This disruption of signal history led to memory updating after prediction error. We conclude that prediction errors during memory reactivation prompt the hippocampus to abandon ongoing predictions and neural representations. Following prediction error, the hippocampus switches to an externally-oriented processing mode that supports memory updating.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Studies on CRMP2 SUMOylation-deficient transgenic mice reveal novel insights into the trafficking of NaV1.7 channels</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.29.318774v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Voltage-gated sodium channels are key players in neuronal excitability and pain signaling. Functional expression of the voltage-gated sodium channel NaV1.7 is under the control of SUMOylated collapsin response mediator protein 2 (CRMP2). If not SUMOylated, CRMP2 forms a complex with the endocytic proteins Numb, the epidermal growth factor receptor pathway substrate 15 (Eps15), and the E3 ubiquitin ligase Nedd4-2 to promote clathrin-mediated endocytosis of NaV1.7. We recently reported that CRMP2 SUMO-null knock-in (CRMP2K374A/K374A) female mice have reduced NaV1.7 membrane localization and currents in their sensory neurons. Preventing CRMP2 SUMOylation was sufficient to reverse mechanical allodynia in CRMP2K374A/K374A female mice with neuropathic pain. Here we report that inhibiting clathrin assembly in nerve-injured male and female CRMP2K374A/K374A mice, increased pain sensitivity in allodynia-resistant animals. Furthermore, Numb, Nedd4-2 and Eps15 expression was not modified in basal conditions in the dorsal root ganglia (DRG) of male and female CRMP2K374A/K374A mice. Finally, silencing these proteins in DRG neurons from female CRMP2K374A/K374A mice, restored the loss of sodium currents. Our study shows that the endocytic complex composed of Numb, Nedd4-2 and Eps15, is necessary for non SUMOylated CRMP2-mediated internalization of sodium channels in vivo.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.29.318527v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Nijmegen Breakage Syndrome (NBS) is a rare autosomal recessive genetic disorder caused by mutations within NBN, a DNA-damage repair protein. Hallmarks of NBS include several clinical manifestations such growth retardation, chromosomal instability, immunodeficiency and progressive microcephaly. However, the etiology of microcephaly in NBS patients remains elusive. Here, we employed induced pluripotent stem cell-derived brain organoids from two NBS patients to analyze the underlying mechanisms of microcephaly. We show that NBS-organoids carrying the homozygous 647del5 NBN mutation are significantly smaller in size with disrupted cyto-architecture Patient-derived organoids exhibit premature differentiation together with neuronatin (NNAT) overexpression and key pathways related to DNA damage response and cell cycle are differentially regulated compared to controls. Moreover, we show that after exposure to bleomycin, NBS organoids undergo a delayed p53-mediated DNA damage response and aberrant trans-synaptic signalling, which ultimately leads to neuronal apoptosis. Our data provide insights into how mutations within NBN alters neurogenesis in NBS patients, thus providing a proof of concept that cerebral organoids are a valuable tool for studying DNA damage-related disorders.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Terrestrial mammals use pheromones to effectively trigger or block conspecific aggression. Here we tested whether hexadecanal (HEX), a human body-volatile implicated as a mammalian-wide social odor, impacts human aggression. Using validated behavioral paradigms, we observed a remarkable dissociation: sniffing HEX blocked aggression in men, but triggered aggression in women. Next, using functional brain imaging, we uncovered a pattern of brain activity mirroring behaviour: In both men and women, HEX increased activity in the left angular gyrus, an area implicated in perception of social cues. Hex then modulated functional connectivity between the angular gyrus and a brain network implicated in social appraisal (temporal pole) and aggressive execution (amygdala and orbitofrontal cortex) in a sex-dependent manner consistent with behaviour: increasing connectivity in men, but decreasing connectivity in women. These findings implicate HEX as a human pheromone, whose sex-specific brain processing is at the mechanistic heart of human aggressive behavior.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Hippocampal silent infarct leads to subtle cognitive decline that is associated with inflammation and gliosis at twenty-four hours after injury in a rat model</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.29.318204v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Silent infarcts (SI) are subcortical cerebral infarcts that occur in the absence of clinical symptoms commonly associated with ischemia and are linked to dementia development. Little is known about the pathophysiology underlying the cognitive dysfunction associated with SI, and few studies have examined the early cellular responses and neurobiological underpinnings. We induced SI in adult male Sprague-Dawley rats using an infusion of endothelin-1 in the CA1 dorsal hippocampus. Twenty-four hours later, we assessed cognition using the hippocampal-dependent object place recognition task. We also examined whether the resulting cognitive effects were associated with common markers of ischemia, specifically cell and synapse loss, gliosis, and inflammation, using histology and immunohistochemistry. Hippocampal SI led to subtle cognitive impairment on the object place recognition task 24-hours post-injury. This was characterized by a significant difference in exploration proportion relative to a pre-injury baseline and a positive association between time spent with both the moved and unmoved objects. SI did not result in any detectable cell or synaptophysin loss, but did increase apoptosis, gliosis and inflammation in the CA1. Principal component analysis indicated the main variables associated with hippocampal SI included increased time spent with the unmoved object, gliosis, apoptosis and inflammation as well as decreased exploration proportion and CA1 cells. Our data demonstrate that hippocampal SI can lead to cognitive dysfunction 24-hours after injury. Further, this appears to be driven by early degenerative processes including apoptosis, gliosis and inflammation, suggesting that these may be targets for early interventions treating hippocampal SI and its cognitive consequences.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Successful adaptation to the environment requires accurate responding to external threats by recalling specific memories. However, elucidating underlying neural substrates of associative fear memory was limited due to the difficulties in direct examination of extinction-induced changes of specific synapses that encode an auditory fear memory. Using dual-eGRASP (enhanced Green Fluorescent Protein Reconstitution Across Synaptic Partners), we found that synapses between engram cells or synaptic engram showed a significantly larger spine morphology at auditory cortex (AC) to lateral amygdala (LA) projections after auditory fear conditioning. Fear extinction reversed the enhanced synaptic engram spines while re-conditioning with the same tone and shock restored the size of the synaptic engram. Taken together, we suggest that the synaptic engram may represent a different state of fear memory.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.28.317248v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Sensory systems rely on statistical regularities in the experienced inputs to either group disparate stimuli, or parse them into separate categories. While considerable progress has been made in understanding invariant object recognition in the visual system, how this is implemented by olfactory neural circuits remains an open question. The current leading model states that odor identity is primarily computed in the piriform cortex, drawing from mitral cell (MC) input. Surprisingly, the role of tufted cells (TC), the other principal cell-type of the olfactory bulb (OB) in decoding odor identity, and their dependence on cortical feedback, has been overlooked. Tufted cells preferentially project to the anterior olfactory nucleus (AON) and olfactory striatum, while mitral cells strongly innervate the piriform cortex (PC). Here we show that classifiers based on the population activity of tufted cells successfully decode both odor identity and intensity across a large concentration range. In these computations, tufted cells substantially outperform mitral cells, and are largely unaffected by silencing of cortical feedback. Further, cortical feedback from AON controls preferentially the gain of tufted cell odor representations, while PC feedback specifically restructures mitral cell responses, matching biases in feedforward connectivity. Leveraging cell-type specific analyses, we identify a non-canonical feedforward pathway for odor recognition and discrimination mediated by the tufted cells, and propose that OB target areas, other than the piriform cortex, such as AON and olfactory striatum, are well-positioned to compute odor identity.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Zachary R. Sailer, Sarah H. Shafik, Robert L. Summers, Alex Joule, Alice Patterson-Robert, Rowena E. Martin, Michael J. Harms&lt;/p&gt;

Understanding evolution requires detailed knowledge of genotype-phenotype maps; however, it can be a herculean task to measure every phenotype in a combinatorial map. We have developed a computational strategy to predict the missing phenotypes from an incomplete, combinatorial genotype-phenotype map. As a test case, we used an incomplete genotype-phenotype dataset previously generated for the malaria parasite’s ‘chloroquine resistance transporter’ (PfCRT). Wild-type PfCRT (PfCRT&lt;sup&gt;3D7&lt;/sup&gt;) lacks significant chloroquine (CQ) transport activity, but the introduction of the eight mutations present in the ‘Dd2’ isoform of PfCRT (PfCRT&lt;sup&gt;Dd2&lt;/sup&gt;) enables the protein to transport CQ away from its site of antimalarial action. This gain of a transport function imparts CQ resistance to the parasite. A combinatorial map between PfCRT&lt;sup&gt;3D7&lt;/sup&gt; and PfCRT&lt;sup&gt;Dd2&lt;/sup&gt; consists of 256 genotypes, of which only 52 have had their CQ transport activities measured through expression in the &lt;i&gt;Xenopus laevis&lt;/i&gt; oocyte. We trained a statistical model with these 52 measurements to infer the CQ transport activity for the remaining 204 combinatorial genotypes between PfCRT&lt;sup&gt;3D7&lt;/sup&gt; and PfCRT&lt;sup&gt;Dd2&lt;/sup&gt;. Our best-performing model incorporated a binary classifier, a nonlinear scale, and additive effects for each mutation. The addition of specific pairwise- and high-order-epistatic coefficients decreased the predictive power of the model. We evaluated our predictions by experimentally measuring the CQ transport activities of 24 additional PfCRT genotypes. The R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; value between our predicted and newly-measured phenotypes was 0.90. We then used the model to probe the accessibility of evolutionary trajectories through the map. Approximately 1% of the possible trajectories between PfCRT&lt;sup&gt;3D7&lt;/sup&gt; and PfCRT&lt;sup&gt;Dd2&lt;/sup&gt; are accessible; however, none of the trajectories entailed eight successive increases in CQ transport activity. These results demonstrate that phenotypes can be inferred with known uncertainty from a partial genotype-phenotype dataset. We also validated our approach against a collection of previously published genotype-phenotype maps. The model therefore appears general and should be applicable to a large number of genotype-phenotype maps.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/ACe5JeGOk7c&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by James D. Brunner, Nicholas Chia&lt;/p&gt;

Dynamic flux balance analysis uses a quasi-steady state assumption to calculate an organism’s metabolic activity at each time-step of a dynamic simulation, using the well-known technique of flux balance analysis. For microbial communities, this calculation is especially costly and involves solving a linear constrained optimization problem for each member of the community at each time step. However, this is unnecessary and inefficient, as prior solutions can be used to inform future time steps. Here, we show that a basis for the space of internal fluxes can be chosen for each microbe in a community and this basis can be used to simulate forward by solving a relatively inexpensive system of linear equations at most time steps. We can use this solution as long as the resulting metabolic activity remains within the optimization problem’s constraints (i.e. the solution to the linear system of equations remains a feasible to the linear program). As the solution becomes infeasible, it first becomes a feasible but degenerate solution to the optimization problem, and we can solve a different but related optimization problem to choose an appropriate basis to continue forward simulation. We demonstrate the efficiency and robustness of our method by comparing with currently used methods on a four species community, and show that our method requires at least 91% fewer optimizations to be solved. For reproducibility, we prototyped the method using Python.

Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) produced by gastrointestinal microbiota regulate immune responses, but host molecular mechanisms remain unknown. Unbiased screening using SCFA-conjugated affinity nanobeads identified apoptosis-associated speck-like protein (ASC), an adaptor protein of inflammasome complex, as a noncanonical SCFA receptor besides GPRs. SCFAs promoted inflammasome activation in macrophages by binding to its ASC PYRIN domain. Activated inflammasome suppressed survival of &lt;i&gt;Salmonella enterica&lt;/i&gt; serovar Typhimurium (&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. Typhimurium) in macrophages by pyroptosis and facilitated neutrophil recruitment to promote bacterial elimination and thus inhibit systemic dissemination in the host. Administration of SCFAs or dietary fibers, which are fermented to SCFAs by gut bacteria, significantly prolonged the survival of &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;. Typhimurium–infected mice through ASC-mediated inflammasome activation. SCFAs penetrated into the inflammatory region of the infected gut mucosa to protect against infection. This study provided evidence that SCFAs suppress &lt;i&gt;Salmonella&lt;/i&gt; infection via inflammasome activation, shedding new light on the therapeutic activity of dietary fiber.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/QtDva5UmCgg&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

The Myriapoda, composed of millipedes and centipedes, is a fascinating but poorly understood branch of life, including species with a highly unusual body plan and a range of unique adaptations to their environment. Here, we sequenced and assembled 2 chromosomal-level genomes of the millipedes &lt;i&gt;Helicorthomorpha holstii&lt;/i&gt; (assembly size = 182 Mb; shortest scaffold/contig length needed to cover 50% of the genome [N50] = 18.11 Mb mainly on 8 pseudomolecules) and &lt;i&gt;Trigoniulus corallinus&lt;/i&gt; (assembly size = 449 Mb, N50 = 26.78 Mb mainly on 17 pseudomolecules). Unique genomic features, patterns of gene regulation, and defence systems in millipedes, not observed in other arthropods, are revealed. Both repeat content and intron size are major contributors to the observed differences in millipede genome size. Tight Hox and the first loose ecdysozoan ParaHox homeobox clusters are identified, and a myriapod-specific genomic rearrangement including &lt;i&gt;Hox3&lt;/i&gt; is also observed. The Argonaute (AGO) proteins for loading small RNAs are duplicated in both millipedes, but unlike in insects, an AGO duplicate has become a pseudogene. Evidence of post-transcriptional modification in small RNAs—including species-specific microRNA arm switching—providing differential gene regulation is also obtained. Millipedes possesses a unique ozadene defensive gland unlike the venomous forcipules found in centipedes. We identify sets of genes associated with the ozadene that play roles in chemical defence as well as antimicrobial activity. Macro-synteny analyses revealed highly conserved genomic blocks between the 2 millipedes and deuterostomes. Collectively, our analyses of millipede genomes reveal that a series of unique adaptations have occurred in this major lineage of arthropod diversity. The 2 high-quality millipede genomes provided here shed new light on the conserved and lineage-specific features of millipedes and centipedes. These findings demonstrate the importance of the consideration of both centipede and millipede genomes—and in particular the reconstruction of the myriapod ancestral situation—for future research to improve understanding of arthropod evolution, and animal evolutionary genomics more widely.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/kaYcF_lVjGc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: A stearoyl‐CoA desaturase inhibitor prevents multiple Parkinson's disease‐phenotypes in α‐synuclein mice</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25920?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parkinson's disease (PD) has useful symptomatic treatments that do not slow the neurodegenerative process, and no significant disease‐modifying treatments are approved. A key therapeutic target in PD is α‐synuclein (αS), which is both genetically implicated and accumulates in Lewy bodies rich in vesicles and other lipid membranes. Reestablishing αS homeostasis is a central goal in PD. Based on previous lipidomic analyses, we conducted a mouse trial of a stearoyl‐CoA desaturase (SCD) inhibitor (“5b”) that prevented αS‐positive vesicular inclusions and cytotoxicity in cultured human neurons.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oral dosing and brain activity of 5b were established in non‐tg mice. 5b in drinking water was given to mice expressing WT human αS (WT) or an amplified familial PD αS mutation [E35K+E46K+E61K (‘3K’)] beginning near the onset of nigral and cortical neurodegeneration and the robust PD‐like motor syndrome in 3K. Motor phenotypes, brain cytopathology and SCD‐related lipid changes were quantified in 5b‐ vs. placebo‐treated mice. Outcomes were compared to effects of crossing 3K to SCD1&lt;sup&gt;‐/‐&lt;/sup&gt; mice.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5b treatment reduced αS hyperphosphorylation in E46K‐expressing human neurons, in 3K neural cultures and in both WT and 3K αS mice. 5b prevented subtle gait deficits in WT αS mice and the PD‐like resting tremor and progressive motor decline of 3K αS mice. 5b also increased αS tetramers and reduced PK‐resistant lipid‐rich aggregates. Similar benefits accrued from genetically deleting one SCD allele, providing target validation.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prolonged reduction of brain SCD activity prevented PD‐like neuropathology in multiple PD models. Thus, an orally available SCD inhibitor potently ameliorates PD phenotypes, positioning this approach to treat human α‐synucleinopathies.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Remote Blood Biomarkers of Longitudinal Cognitive Outcomes in a Population Study</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25874?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The longitudinal association of the blood biomarkers total tau (t‐tau), neurofilament light (Nf‐L), and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) with common sporadic Alzheimer disease (AD) and cognitive decline is not established.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using a single molecule array technology, ultrasensitive immunoassays for serum concentrations of t‐tau, Nf‐L, and GFAP were measured in a population sample of 1,327 participants (60% African Americans and women) who had a clinical evaluation for AD, had completed in‐home cognitive assessments, and had undergone 1.5T structural magnetic resonance imaging.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Higher concentrations of serum biomarkers were associated with the development of clinical AD; especially, the time‐specific associations were notable: t‐tau 8 to 16 years, and Nf‐L and GFAP 4 to 8 years prior to clinical AD. Serum biomarkers were associated with faster cognitive decline over 16 years; baseline t‐tau &amp;gt; 0.40pg/ml had 30% faster decline, Nf‐L &amp;gt; 25.5pg/ml had 110% faster decline, and GFAP &amp;gt; 232pg/ml had 130% faster decline compared to those in the lowest quartile. Participants with baseline GFAP &amp;gt; 232pg/ml showed 160% faster decline in hippocampal volume compared to those with values &amp;lt; 160pg/ml. Additionally, higher baseline t‐tau was associated with faster increase in 3rd ventricular volume, and baseline Nf‐L and GFAP were associated with faster decline in cortical thickness.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Serum t‐tau, Nf‐L, and GFAP predict the development of sporadic AD and cognitive decline, and changes in structural brain characteristics, suggesting their usefulness not only as screening and predictive biomarkers, but also in capturing the pathogenesis of Alzheimer dementia.

	<content:encoded>&lt;img alt=&quot;Neural anatomy of echinoid early juveniles and comparison of nervous system organization in echinoderms&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/677feba9-8624-4ed1-853c-dbce1e16120b/cne25012-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Graphical Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whole mount immunohistochemistry and confocal microscopy were used on juveniles of three echinoderm species to characterize their neuroanatomy. Detailed comparisons confirmed the conservation, among the three species, of a similar general neuroanatomical organization and revealed equivalent innervation patterns at the level of the appendages (i.e., the podia and the spines).

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The echinoderms are a phylum of marine deuterostomes characterized by the pentaradial (five fold) symmetry of their adult bodies. Due to this unusual body plan, adult echinoderms have long been excluded from comparative analyses aimed at understanding the origin and evolution of deuterostome nervous systems. Here, we investigated the neural anatomy of early juveniles of representatives of three of the five echinoderm classes: the echinoid &lt;i&gt;Paracentrotus lividus&lt;/i&gt;, the asteroid &lt;i&gt;Patiria miniata&lt;/i&gt;, and the holothuroid &lt;i&gt;Parastichopus parvimensis&lt;/i&gt;. Using whole mount immunohistochemistry and confocal microscopy, we found that the nervous system of echinoid early juveniles is composed of three main structures: a basiepidermal nerve plexus, five radial nerve cords connected by a circumoral nerve ring, and peripheral nerves innervating the appendages. Our whole mount preparations further allowed us to obtain thorough descriptions of these structures and of several innervation patterns, in particular at the level of the appendages. Detailed comparisons of the echinoid juvenile nervous system with those of asteroid and holothuroid juveniles moreover supported a general conservation of the main neural structures in all three species, including at the level of the appendages. Our results support the previously proposed hypotheses for the existence of two neural units in echinoderms: one consisting of the basiepidermal nerve plexus to process sensory stimuli locally and one composed of the radial nerve cords and the peripheral nerves constituting a centralized control system. This study provides the basis for more in‐depth comparisons of the echinoderm adult nervous system with those of other animals, in particular hemichordates and chordates, to address the long‐standing controversies about deuterostome nervous system evolution.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Causal associations between modifiable risk factors and the Alzheimer’s phenome</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25918?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To infer causal relationships between 22 previously reported risk factors for Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and the “AD phenome”: AD, AD age of onset (AAOS), hippocampal volume, cortical surface area and thickness, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of Aβ&lt;sub&gt;42&lt;/sub&gt;, tau, and ptau&lt;sub&gt;181&lt;/sub&gt;, and the neuropathological burden of neuritic plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, and vascular brain injury (VBI).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Polygenic risk scores (PRS) for the 22 risk factors were computed in 26,431 AD cases/controls and the association with AD was evaluated using logistic regression. Two‐sample Mendelian randomization was used to infer the causal effect of risk factors on the AD phenome.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PRS for increased education and diastolic blood pressure were associated with reduced risk for AD. MR indicated that only education was causally associated with reduced risk of AD, delayed AAOS, and increased cortical surface area and thickness. Total‐ and LDL‐cholesterol levels were causally associated with increased neuritic plaque burden, though the effects were driven by SNPs within the &lt;i&gt;APOE&lt;/i&gt; locus. Diastolic blood pressure and pulse pressure are causally associated with increased risk of VBI. Furthermore, total cholesterol was associated with decreased hippocampal volume; smoking initiation with decreased cortical thickness; type 2 diabetes with an earlier AAOS; and sleep duration with increased cortical thickness.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our comprehensive examination of the genetic evidence for the causal relationships between previously reported risk factors in AD using PRS and MR, supports a causal role for education, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, smoking, and diabetes with the AD phenome.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Astrocytes—The Ultimate Effectors of Long-Range Neuromodulatory Networks?</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.581075</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;It was long thought that astrocytes, given their lack of electrical signaling, were not involved in communication with neurons. However, we now know that one astrocyte on average maintains and regulates the extracellular neurotransmitter and potassium levels of more than 140,000 synapses, both excitatory and inhibitory, within their individual domains, and form a syncytium that can propagate calcium waves to affect distant cells via release of “gliotransmitters” such as glutamate, ATP, or adenosine. Neuromodulators can affect signal-to-noise and frequency transmission within cortical circuits by effects on inhibition, allowing for the filtering of relevant vs. irrelevant stimuli. Moreover, synchronized “resting” and desynchronized “activated” brain states are gated by short bursts of high-frequency neuromodulatory activity, highlighting the need for neuromodulation that is robust, rapid, and far-reaching. As many neuromodulators are released in a volume manner where degradation/uptake and the confines of the complex CNS limit diffusion distance, we ask the question—are astrocytes responsible for rapidly extending neuromodulator actions to every synapse? Neuromodulators are known to influence transitions between brain states, leading to control over plasticity, responses to salient stimuli, wakefulness, and sleep. These rapid and wide-spread state transitions demand that neuromodulators can simultaneously influence large and diverse regions in a manner that should be impossible given the limitations of simple diffusion. Intriguingly, astrocytes are ideally situated to amplify/extend neuromodulator effects over large populations of synapses given that each astrocyte can: (1) ensheath a large number of synapses; (2) release gliotransmitters (glutamate/ATP/adenosine) known to affect inhibition; (3) regulate extracellular potassium that can affect excitability and excitation/inhibition balance; and (4) express receptors for all neuromodulators. In this review article, we explore the hypothesis that astrocytes extend and amplify neuromodulatory influences on neuronal networks via alterations in calcium dynamics, the release of gliotransmitters, and potassium homeostasis. Given that neuromodulatory networks are at the core of our sleep-wake cycle and behavioral states, and determine how we interact with our environment, this review article highlights the importance of basic astrocyte function in homeostasis, general cognition, and psychiatric disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Mental disorders represent critical public health challenges as they are
leading contributors to the global burden of disease and intensely influence
social and financial welfare of individuals. The present comprehensive review
concentrate on the two mental disorders: Major depressive Disorder (MDD) and
Bipolar Disorder (BD) with noteworthy publications during the last ten years.
There's a big need nowadays for phenotypic characterization of psychiatric
disorders with biomarkers. Electroencephalography (EEG) signals could offer a
rich signature for MDD and BD and then they could improve understanding of
pathophysiological mechanisms underling these mental disorders. In this work,
we focus on the literature works adopting neural networks fed by EEG signals.
Among those studies using EEG and neural networks, we have discussed a variety
of EEG based protocols, biomarkers and public datasets for depression and
bipolar disorder detection. We conclude with a discussion and valuable
recommendations that will help to improve the reliability of developed models
and for more accurate and more deterministic computational intelligence based
systems in psychiatry. This review will prove to be a structured and valuable
initial point for the researchers working on depression and bipolar disorders
recognition by using EEG signals.

	<title>arXiv: Computer Science: Neural and Evolutionary Computing: Disentangled Neural Architecture Search. (arXiv:2009.13266v1 [cs.LG])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.13266</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Neural architecture search has shown its great potential in various areas
recently. However, existing methods rely heavily on a black-box controller to
search architectures, which suffers from the serious problem of lacking
interpretability. In this paper, we propose disentangled neural architecture
search (DNAS) which disentangles the hidden representation of the controller
into semantically meaningful concepts, making the neural architecture search
process interpretable. Based on systematical study, we discover the correlation
between network architecture and its performance, and propose a dense-sampling
strategy to conduct a targeted search in promising regions that may generate
well-performing architectures. We show that: 1) DNAS successfully disentangles
the architecture representations, including operation selection, skip
connections, and number of layers. 2) Benefiting from interpretability, DNAS
can find excellent architectures under different FLOPS restrictions flexibly.
3) Dense-sampling leads to neural architecture search with higher efficiency
and better performance. On the NASBench-101 dataset, DNAS achieves
state-of-the-art performance of 94.21% using less than 1/13 computational cost
of baseline methods. On ImageNet dataset, DNAS discovers the competitive
architectures that achieves 22.7% test error. our method provides a new
perspective of understanding neural architecture search.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Visual translation tolerance refers to our capacity to recognize objects over
a wide range of different retinal locations. Although translation is perhaps
the simplest spatial transform that the visual system needs to cope with, the
extent to which the human visual system can identify objects at previously
unseen locations is unclear, with some studies reporting near complete
invariance over 10{\deg} and other reporting zero invariance at 4{\deg} of
visual angle. Similarly, there is confusion regarding the extent of translation
tolerance in computational models of vision, as well as the degree of match
between human and model performance. Here we report a series of eye-tracking
studies (total N=70) demonstrating that novel objects trained at one retinal
location can be recognized at high accuracy rates following translations up to
18{\deg}. We also show that standard deep convolutional networks (DCNNs)
support our findings when pretrained to classify another set of stimuli across
a range of locations, or when a Global Average Pooling (GAP) layer is added to
produce larger receptive fields. Our findings provide a strong constraint for
theories of human vision and help explain inconsistent findings previously
reported with CNNs.

	<title>arXiv: Computer Science: Neural and Evolutionary Computing: An Analysis of Quality Indicators Using Approximated Optimal Distributions in a Three-dimensional Objective Space. (arXiv:2009.12788v1 [cs.NE])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.12788</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Although quality indicators play a crucial role in benchmarking evolutionary
multi-objective optimization algorithms, their properties are still unclear.
One promising approach for understanding quality indicators is the use of the
optimal distribution of objective vectors that optimizes each quality
indicator. However, it is difficult to obtain the optimal distribution for each
quality indicator, especially when its theoretical property is unknown. Thus,
optimal distributions for most quality indicators have not been well
investigated. To address these issues, first, we propose a problem formulation
of finding the optimal distribution for each quality indicator on an arbitrary
Pareto front. Then, we approximate the optimal distributions for nine quality
indicators using the proposed problem formulation. We analyze the nine quality
indicators using their approximated optimal distributions on eight types of
Pareto fronts of three-objective problems. Our analysis demonstrates that
uniformly-distributed objective vectors over the entire Pareto front are not
optimal in many cases. Each quality indicator has its own optimal distribution
for each Pareto front. We also examine the consistency among the nine quality
indicators.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Back-propagation is a popular machine learning algorithm that uses gradient
descent in training neural networks for supervised learning, but can be very
slow. A number of algorithms have been developed to speed up convergence and
improve robustness of the learning. However, they are complicated to implement
biologically as they require information from previous updates. Inspired by
synaptic competition in biology, we have come up with a simple and local
gradient descent optimization algorithm that can reduce training time, with no
demand on past details. Our algorithm, named dynamic learning rate (DLR), works
similarly to the traditional gradient descent used in back-propagation, except
that instead of having a uniform learning rate across all synapses, the
learning rate depends on the current neuronal connection weights. Our algorithm
is found to speed up learning, particularly for small networks.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.12696</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;How can memories be maintained from days to a lifetime, given turnover of
proteins that underlie expression of long-term synaptic potentiation (LTP)? One
likely solution relies on synaptic positive feedback loops, prominently
including persistent activation of CaM kinase II (CaMKII) and self-activated
synthesis of protein kinase M zeta (PKM). Recent studies also suggest positive
feedback based on recurrent synaptic reactivation within neuron assemblies, or
engrams, is necessary to maintain memories. The relative importance of these
feedback mechanisms is controversial. To explore the likelihood that each
mechanism is necessary or sufficient, we simulated LTP maintenance with a
simplified model incorporating persistent kinase activation, synaptic tagging,
and preferential reactivation of strong synapses, and analyzed implications of
recent data. We simulated three model variants, each maintaining LTP with one
feedback loop: self-activated PKM synthesis (variant I); self-activated CamKII
(variant II); and recurrent reactivation of strengthened synapses (variant
III). Variant I requires and predicts that PKM must contribute to synaptic
tagging. Variant II maintains LTP and suggests persistent CaMKII activation
could maintain PKM activity, a feedforward interaction not previously
considered. However we note data challenging this feedback loop. In variant III
synaptic reactivation drives, and thus predicts, recurrent or persistent
activity elevations of CamKII and other necessary kinases, plausibly
contributing to empirically persistent elevation of PKM levels. Reactivation is
thus predicted to sustain recurrent rounds of synaptic tagging and
incorporation of plasticity-related proteins. We also suggest (model variant
IV) that synaptic reactivation and autonomous kinase activation could
synergistically maintain LTP. We propose experiments that could discriminate
these maintenance mechanisms.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.12672</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Neuromorphic architectures built with Non-Volatile Memory (NVM) can
significantly improve the energy efficiency of machine learning tasks designed
with Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs). A major source of voltage drop in a
crossbar of these architectures are the parasitic components on the crossbar's
bitlines and wordlines, which are deliberately made longer to achieve lower
cost-per-bit. We observe that the parasitic voltage drops create a significant
asymmetry in programming speed and reliability of NVM cells in a crossbar.
Specifically, NVM cells that are on shorter current paths are faster to program
but have lower endurance than those on longer current paths, and vice versa.
This asymmetry in neuromorphic architectures create reliability-performance
trade-offs, which can be exploited efficiently using SNN mapping techniques. In
this work, we demonstrate such trade-offs using a previously-proposed SNN
mapping technique with 10 workloads from contemporary machine learning tasks
for a state-of-the art neuromoorphic hardware.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Freezing-of-gait a mysterious symptom of Parkinsons disease and defined as a
sudden loss of ability to move forward. Common treatments of freezing episodes
are currently of moderate efficacy and can likely be improved through a
reliable freezing evaluation. Basic-science studies about the characterization
of freezing episodes and a 24/7 evidence-support freezing detection system can
contribute to the reliability of the evaluation in daily life. In this study,
we analyzed multi-modal features from brain, eye, heart, motion, and gait
activity from 15 participants with idiopathic Parkinsons disease and 551
freezing episodes induced by turning in place. Statistical analysis was first
applied on 248 of the 551 to determine which multi-modal features were
associated with freezing episodes. Features significantly associated with
freezing episodes were ranked and used for the freezing detection. We found
that eye-stabilization speed during turning and lower-body trembling measure
significantly associated with freezing episodes and used for freezing
detection. Using a leave-one-subject-out cross-validation, we obtained a
sensitivity of 97%+/-3%, a specificity of 96%+/-7%, a precision of 73%+/-21%, a
Matthews correlation coefficient of 0.82+/-0.15, and an area under the
Precision-Recall curve of 0.94+/-0.05. According to the Precision-Recall

performed better than using single-modal features.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.12531</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Since the scale factor and the crossover rate significantly influence the
performance of differential evolution (DE), parameter adaptation methods (PAMs)
for the two parameters have been well studied in the DE community. Although
PAMs can sufficiently improve the effectiveness of DE, PAMs are poorly
understood (e.g., the working principle of PAMs). One of the difficulties in
understanding PAMs comes from the unclarity of the parameter space that
consists of the scale factor and the crossover rate. This paper addresses this
issue by analyzing adaptive parameter landscapes in PAMs for DE. First, we
propose a concept of an adaptive parameter landscape, which captures a moment
in a parameter adaptation process. For each iteration, each individual in the
population has its adaptive parameter landscape. Second, we propose a method of
analyzing adaptive parameter landscapes using a 1-step-lookahead greedy
improvement metric. Third, we examine adaptive parameter landscapes in PAMs by
using the proposed method. Results provide insightful information about PAMs in
DE.

	<title>Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience: A Computational Model Integrating Multiple Phenomena on Cued Fear Conditioning, Extinction, and Reinstatement</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2020.569108</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Conditioning, extinction, and reinstatement are fundamental learning processes of animal adaptation, also strongly involved in human pathologies such as post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety, depression, and dependencies. Cued fear conditioning, extinction, restatement, and systematic manipulations of the underlying brain amygdala and medial prefrontal cortex, represent key experimental paradigms to study such processes. Numerous empirical studies have revealed several aspects and the neural systems and plasticity underlying them, but at the moment we lack a comprehensive view. Here we propose a computational model based on firing rate leaky units that contributes to such integration by accounting for 25 different experiments on fear conditioning, extinction, and restatement, on the basis of a single neural architecture having a structure and plasticity grounded in known brain biology. This allows the model to furnish three novel contributions to understand these open issues: (a) the functioning of the central and lateral amygdala system supporting conditioning; (b) the role played by the endocannabinoids system in within- and between-session extinction; (c) the formation of three important types of neurons underlying fear processing, namely fear, extinction, and persistent neurons. The model integration of the results on fear conditioning goes substantially beyond what was done in previous models.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience: SeSBAT: Single Subject Brain Analysis Toolbox. Application to Huntington’s Disease as a Preliminary Study</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2020.488652</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) biomarkers require complex processing routines that are time-consuming and labor-intensive for clinical users. The Single Subject Brain Analysis Toolbox (SeSBAT) is a fully automated MATLAB toolbox with a graphical user interface (GUI) that offers standardized and optimized protocols for the pre-processing and analysis of anatomical MRI data at the single-subject level. In this study, the two-fold strategy provided by SeSBAT is illustrated through its application on a cohort of 42 patients with Huntington’s disease (HD), in pre-manifest and early manifest stages, as a suitable model of neurodegenerative processes. On the one hand, hypothesis-driven analysis can be used to extract biomarkers of neurodegeneration in specific brain regions of interest (ROI-based analysis). On the other hand, an exploratory voxel-based morphometry (VBM) approach can detect volume changes due to neurodegeneration throughout the whole brain (whole-brain analysis). That illustration reveals the potential of SeSBAT in providing potential prognostic biomarkers in neurodegenerative processes in clinics, which could be critical to overcoming the limitations of current qualitative evaluation strategies, and thus improve the diagnosis and monitoring of neurodegenerative disorders. Furthermore, the importance of the availability of tools for characterization at the single-subject level has been emphasized, as there is high interindividual variability in the pattern of neurodegeneration. Thus, tools like SeSBAT could pave the way towards more effective and personalized medicine.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Detection of Synaptic Proteins in Microglia by Flow Cytometry</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2020.00149</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A growing body of evidence indicates that microglia actively remove synapses in vivo, thereby playing a key role in synaptic refinement and modulation of brain connectivity. This phenomenon was mainly investigated in immunofluorescence staining and confocal microscopy. However, a quantification of synaptic material in microglia using these techniques is extremely time-consuming and labor-intensive. To address this issue, we aimed to quantify synaptic proteins in microglia using flow cytometry. With this approach, we first showed that microglia from the healthy adult mouse brain contain a detectable level of VGLUT1 protein. Next, we found more than two-fold increased VGLUT1 immunoreactivity in microglia from the developing brain (P15) as compared to adult microglia. These data indicate that microglia-mediated synaptic pruning mostly occurs during the brain developmental period. We then quantified the VGLUT1 staining in microglia in two transgenic models characterized by pathological microglia-mediated synaptic pruning. In the 5xFAD mouse model of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) microglia exhibited a significant increase in VGLUT1 immunoreactivity before the onset of amyloid pathology. Moreover, conditional deletion of TDP-43 in microglia, which causes a hyper-phagocytic phenotype associated with synaptic loss, also resulted in increased VGLUT1 immunoreactivity within microglia. This work provides a quantitative assessment of synaptic proteins in microglia, under homeostasis, and in mouse models of disease.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Integrative Neuroscience: Effects of Retinal Transcription Regulation After GB20 Needling Treatment in Retina With Optic Neuritis</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnint.2020.568449</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Optic neuritis (ON) is one of the most frequent symptoms of multiple sclerosis (MS) that results in progressive loss of axons and neurons. In clinical trials of Traditional Chinese Medicine, needling at the GB20 acupoint has been widely used for the treatment of ocular diseases, including ON. However, the molecular mechanisms of needling at this site are still unclear. In this study, we generated an experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) mouse model and investigated the effects of needling treatment at the GB20 acupoint on retina with EAE-associated ON. RNA sequencing of the retinal transcriptome revealed that, of the 234 differentially expressed genes induced by ON, 100 genes were upregulated, and 134 genes were downregulated by ON, while needling at the GB20 acupoint specifically reversed the expression of 21 genes compared with control treatment at GV16 acupoint. Among the reversed genes, Nr4a3, Sncg, Uchl1, and Tppp3 were involved in axon development and regeneration and were downregulated by ON, indicating the beneficial effect of needling at GB20. Further gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis revealed that needling at GB20 affected the molecular process of Circadian rhythm in mouse retina with ON. Our study first reported that needling treatment after ON at the GB20 acupoint regulated gene expression of the retina and reversed the expression of downregulated axon development-related genes. This study also demonstrated that GV16 was a perfect control treatment site for GB20 in animal research. Our study provided a scientific basis for needling treatments at GB20 for ocular diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

There was no significant difference of mean sNfL values (95% CI) between all three groups, FS 21.7 pg/ml (19.6–23.9), ES 17.7 pg/ml (13.8–21.6), and controls 23.4 pg/ml (19.2–27.4). In multivariable analysis, age was the most important predictor of sNfL, followed by sex and C reactive protein. Neither the duration of seizures nor the time elapsed from seizure onset to blood sampling had an impact on sNfL. None of the three biomarkers were related to recurrent seizures.&lt;/p&gt;Significance&lt;p&gt;Serum neurofilament light is not elevated during short recovery time after FS when compared with children presenting febrile infections without seizures. We demonstrate an age-dependent decrease of sNfL from early childhood until school age. In contrast to sNfL levels, copeptin and prolactin serum levels are elevated after FS.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Effective and Accurate Diagnosis of Subjective Cognitive Decline Based on Functional Connection and Graph Theory View</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.577887</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Subjective cognitive decline (SCD) is considered the earliest preclinical stage of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) that precedes mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Effective and accurate diagnosis of SCD is crucial for early detection of and timely intervention in AD. In this study, brain functional connectome (i.e., functional connections and graph theory metrics) based on the resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) provided multiple information about brain networks and has been used to distinguish individuals with SCD from normal controls (NCs). The consensus connections and the discriminative nodal graph metrics selected by group least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) mainly distributed in the prefrontal and frontal cortices and the subcortical regions corresponded to default mode network (DMN) and frontoparietal task control network. Nodal efficiency and nodal shortest path showed the most significant discriminative ability among the selected nodal graph metrics. Furthermore, the comparison results of topological attributes suggested that the brain network integration function was weakened and network segregation function was enhanced in SCD patients. Moreover, the combination of brain connectome information based on multiple kernel-support vector machine (MK-SVM) achieved the best classification performance with 83.33% accuracy, 90.00% sensitivity, and an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.927. The findings of this study provided a new perspective to combine machine learning methods with exploration of brain pathophysiological mechanisms in SCD and offered potential neuroimaging biomarkers for diagnosis of early-stage AD.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neural Technology: Effects of Akt/mTOR/p70S6K Signaling Pathway Regulation on Neuron Remodeling Caused by Translocation Repair</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.565870</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Peripheral nerve injury repair has been considered a difficult problem in the field of trauma for a long time. Conventional surgical methods are not applicable in some special types of nerve injury, prompting scholars to seek to develop more effective nerve translocation repair technologies. The purpose of this study was to explore the functional state of neurons in injured lower limbs after translocation repair, with a view to preliminarily clarify the molecular mechanisms underlying this process. Eighteen Sprague–Dawley rats were divided into the normal, tibial nerve in situ repair, and common peroneal nerve transposition repair tibial nerve groups. Nerve function assessment and immunohistochemical staining of neurofilament 200 (NF-200), protein kinase B (Akt), mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), and ribosomal protein S6 kinase (p70S6K) in the dorsal root ganglia were performed at 12 weeks after surgery. Tibial nerve function and neuroelectrophysiological analysis, osmic acid staining, muscle strength testing, and muscle fiber staining showed that the nerve translocation repair could restore the function of the recipient nerve to a certain extent; however, the repair was not as efficient as the in situ repair. Immunohistochemical staining showed that the translocation repair resulted in changes in the microstructure of neuronal cell bodies, and the expressions of Akt, mTOR, and p70S6K in the three dorsal root ganglia groups were significantly different (p &amp;lt; 0.05). This study demonstrates that the nerve translocation repair technology sets up a new reflex loop, with the corresponding neuroskeletal adjustments, in which, donor neurons dominate the recipient nerves. This indicates that nerve translocation repair technology can lead to neuronal remodeling and is important as a supplementary treatment for a peripheral nerve injury. Furthermore, the Akt/mTOR/p70S6K signaling pathway may be involved in the formation of the new neural reflex loop created as a result of the translocation repair.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.559117</link>
	<content:encoded>Background&lt;p&gt;Cognitive impairment is a well-defined complication of chronic kidney disease (CKD), but the neural mechanisms are largely unknown.&lt;/p&gt;Objectives&lt;p&gt;The study aimed to assess white matter (WM) microstructure changes and their relationship with cognitive impairment development during CKD progression.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) datasets were acquired from 38 patients with CKD (19 patients were at stage 3; 19 patients were at stage 4) and 22 healthy controls (HCs). Tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) was implemented to assess the differences in WM integrity among the three groups. The associations between abnormal WM integrity and clinical indicators (digit symbol test scores, the type A number connection test scores, hemoglobin, serum urea, serum creatinine, serum calcium, and serum potassium levels) were also computed.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Compared with patients with CKD at stage 3 and HCs, patients with CKD at stage 4 showed significantly lower fractional anisotropy (FA) and higher mean diffusivity (MD) in the corpus callosum (CC), anterior thalamic radiation, inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus, and inferior longitudinal fasciculus. Correlation analysis showed that the MD in the genu of CC was negatively associated with the digit symbol test scores (r = -0.61, p = 0.01), and the FA in the left anterior thalamic radiation was positively associated with the level of serum calcium (r = 0.58, p = 0.01).&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;Patients with non-end-stage CKD have multiple abnormalities in WM regions. DTI metrics change with the progression of CKD and are primarily associated with cognitive impairment. The reduced integrity of WM tracts may be related to a low level of blood calcium.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Perspective: Phase Amplitude Coupling–Based Phase–Dependent Neuromodulation in Parkinson’s Disease</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.558967</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is an effective surgical therapy for Parkinson’s disease (PD). However, limitations of the DBS systems have led to great interest in adaptive neuromodulation systems that can dynamically adjust stimulation parameters to meet concurrent therapeutic demand. Constant high-frequency motor cortex stimulation has not been remarkably efficacious, which has led to greater focus on modulation of subcortical targets. Understanding of the importance of timing in both cortical and subcortical stimulation has generated an interest in developing more refined, parsimonious stimulation techniques based on critical oscillatory activities of the brain. Concurrently, much effort has been put into identifying biomarkers of both parkinsonian and physiological patterns of neuronal activities to drive next generation of adaptive brain stimulation systems. One such biomarker is beta-gamma phase amplitude coupling (PAC) that is detected in the motor cortex. PAC is strongly correlated with parkinsonian specific motor signs and symptoms and respond to therapies in a dose-dependent manner. PAC may represent the overall state of the parkinsonian motor network and have less instantaneously dynamic fluctuation during movement. These findings raise the possibility of novel neuromodulation paradigms that are potentially less invasiveness than DBS. Successful application of PAC in neuromodulation may necessitate phase-dependent stimulation technique, which aims to deliver precisely timed stimulation pulses to a specific phase to predictably modulate to selectively modulate pathological network activities and behavior in real time. Overcoming current technical challenges can lead to deeper understanding of the parkinsonian pathophysiology and development of novel neuromodulatory therapies with potentially less side-effects and higher therapeutic efficacy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The simultaneous transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) offers a unique opportunity to non-invasively stimulate brain circuits while simultaneously monitoring changes in brain activity. However, to take advantage of this multimodal technique, some technical issues need to be considered/addressed. In this work, we evaluated technical issues associated with the setup and utilization of this multimodal tool, such as the use of a large single-channel radio frequency (rf) coil, and the artifacts induced by TMS when interleaved with the echo-planar imaging (EPI) sequence. We demonstrated that good image quality can be achieved with this rf coil and that the adoption of axial imaging orientation in conjunction with a safe interval of 100 ms, between the TMS pulse and imaging acquisition, is a suitable combination to eliminate potential image artifacts when using the combined TMS-fMRI technique in 3-T MRI scanners.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Electroacupuncture Promoted Nerve Repair After Peripheral Nerve Injury by Regulating miR-1b and Its Target Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.525144</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Growing evidence indicates that electroacupuncture (EA) has a definite effect on the treatment of peripheral nerve injury (PNI), but its mechanism is not completely clear. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are involved in the regulation of a variety of biological processes, and EA may enhance PNI repair by regulating miRNAs. In this study, the rat sciatic nerve injury model was treated with EA for 4 weeks. Acupoints Huantiao (GB30) and Zusanli (ST36) were stimulated by EA 20 min once a day, 6 days a week for 4 weeks. We found that EA treatment downregulated the expression of miR-1b in the local injured nerve. In vitro experiments showed that overexpression of miR-1b inhibited the expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in rat Schwann cell (SC) line, while BDNF knockdown inhibited the proliferation, migration, and promoted apoptosis of SCs. Subsequently, the rat model of sciatic nerve injury was treated by EA treatment and injection of agomir-1b or antagomir-1b. The nerve conduction velocity ratio (NCV), sciatic functional index (SFI), and S100 immunofluorescence staining were examined and showed that compared with the model group, NCV, SFI, proliferation of SC, and expression of BDNF in the injured nerves of rats treated with EA or EA + anti-miR-1b were elevated, while EA + miR-1b was reduced, indicating that EA promoted sciatic nerve function recovery and SC proliferation through downregulating miR-1b. To summarize, EA may promote the proliferation, migration of SC, and nerve repair after PNI by regulating miR-1b, which targets BDNF.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: PET Imaging for Dynamically Monitoring Neuroinflammation in APP/PS1 Mouse Model Using [18F]DPA714</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00810</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Background: In the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD), microglia play an increasingly important role. Molecular imaging of neuroinflammatory targeting microglia activation and the high expression of 18-kDa translocator protein (TSPO) has become a hot topic of research in recent years. Dynamic monitoring neuroinflammation is crucial for discovering the best time point of anti-inflammatory therapy. Motivated by this, Positron emission tomography (PET) imaging in an APP/PS1 mouse model of AD, using &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F-labeled DPA-714 to monitor microglia activation and neuroinflammation, were performed in this paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: We prepared [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]DPA714 and tested the biological characteristics of the molecular probe in normal mice. To obtain a higher radiochemical yield, we improved the [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]-fluorination conditions in the precursor dosage, reaction temperature, and synthesis time. We performed [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]DPA714 PET scanning on APP/PS1 mice at 6–7, 9–10, 12–13, and 15–16 months of age, respectively. The same experiments were conducted in Wild-type (Wt) mice as a control. Referring to the [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]DPA714 concentrated situation in the brain, we performed blocking experiments with PK11195 (1 mg/kg) in 12–13-months-old APP/PS1 mice to confirm the specificity of [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]DPA714 for TSPO in the APP/PS1 mice. Reconstructed brain PET images, fused with the Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) template atlas, and the volumes of interests (VOIs) of the hippocampus and cortex were determined. The distribution of [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]DPA714 in the brain tissues of 15–16-months-old APP/PS1 and Wt mice were studied by immunofluorescence staining.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Through the reaction of &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F, with 2 mg precursor dissolved in 300 ul acetonitrile at 105°C for 10 min, we obtained the optimal radiochemical yield of 42.3 ± 5.1% (non-decay correction). Quantitative analysis of brain PET images showed that the [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]DPA714 uptake in the cortex and hippocampus of 12–13-months-old APP/PS1 mice was higher than that of the control mice of the same age (cortex/muscle: 2.77 ± 0.13 vs. 1.93 ± 0.32, p = 0.0014; hippocampus/muscle: 3.33 ± 0.10 vs. 2.10 ± 0.35, p = 0.0008). The same significant difference was found between 15- and 16-months-old APP/PS1 mice (cortex/muscle: 2.64 ± 0.14 vs. 1.86 ± 0.52, p=0.0159; hippocampus/muscle: 2.89 ± 0.53 vs. 1.77 ± 0.48, p = 0.0050). Immunofluorescence staining showed that the activation of microglia and the level of TSPO expression in the cortex and hippocampus of APP/PS1 mice were significantly higher than Wt mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]DPA714, a molecular probe for targeting TSPO, showed great potential in monitoring microglia activation and neuroinflammation, which can be helpful in discovering the best time point for anti-inflammatory therapy in AD.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: The UF Deep Brain Stimulation Cognitive Rating Scale (DBS-CRS): Clinical Decision Making, Validity, and Outcomes</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.578216</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;To more efficiently communicate the results of neuropsychological assessment to interdisciplinary teams, the University of Florida Neuropsychology Service developed a Deep Brain Stimulation-Cognitive Rating Scale (DBS-CRS). This tool condensed results of a 3-h exam into a five-point scale ranging from 1 (least) to 5 (most) cognitive concern for DBS surgery. In this study, we evaluated the role of the DBS-CRS in clinical decisions by the interdisciplinary team to proceed to surgery, its relationship to objective neuropsychological scores, and its predictive utility for clinical outcome. We retrospectively examined 189 patients with Parkinson’s disease who were evaluated for DBS candidacy (mean age 64.8 [SD 9.2], disease duration 8.9 years [SD 5.0], UPDRS-Part III off medication 38.5 [SD 10.5], Dementia Rating Scale-II 135.4 [SD 6.0]). Approximately 19% of patients did not proceed to surgery, with neuropsychological red flags being the most commonly documented reason (57%). Patients who underwent DBS surgery had significantly better DBS-CRS scores than those who did not (p &amp;lt; 0.001). The two strongest and unique neuropsychological contributors to DBS-CRS ratings were delayed memory and executive function, followed by language and visuoperception, based on hierarchical linear regression that accounted for 77.2% of the variance. In terms of outcome, DBS-CRS scores were associated with higher quality of life, less severe motor symptoms, and better daily functioning 6 months following DBS surgery. Together, these findings support the construct and predictive validity of the DBS-CRS as a concise tool for effectively communicating pre-DBS cognitive concerns to an interdisciplinary team, thereby aiding decision making in potential DBS candidates.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Neural Correlates of Stepping in Healthy Elderly: Parietal and Prefrontal Cortex Activation Reflects Cognitive-Motor Interference Effects</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.566735</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Gait analysis involving cognitive-motor dual task (DT) is a diagnostic tool in geriatrics. Cognitive-motor interference effects during DT, such as decreased walking speed and increased step-to-step variability, have a high predictive value for fall risk and cognitive decline. Previously we showed the feasibility of DT during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) using an MRI-compatible stepping device. Here, we improved the DT-fMRI protocol with respect to task difficulty and signal robustness, making it more suitable for individualized analysis to better understand the neuronal substrates of cognitive-motor interference effects. Thirty healthy elderly subjects performed cognitive and motor single tasks (ST; stepping or finger tapping), as well as combined cognitive-motor DT during fMRI. After whole brain group level analysis, a region-of-interest (ROI) analysis and the computation of dual task costs (DTC = activation difference ratio ST/DT) at individual level were performed. Activations in the primary (M1) and secondary motor as well as in parietal and prefrontal cortex were measured at the group level during DT. Motor areas showed decreased activation whereas parietal and prefrontal areas showed increased activation in DT vs. ST. Stepping yielded more distinctive activations in DT vs. ST than finger tapping. At the individual level, the most robust activations (based on occurrence probability and signal strength) were measured in the stepping condition, in M1, supplementary motor area (SMA) and superior parietal lobule/intraparietal sulcus (SPL/IPS). The distribution of individual DTC in SPL/IPS during stepping suggested a separation of subjects in groups with high vs. low DTC. This study proposes an improved cognitive-motor DT-fMRI protocol and a standardized analysis routine of functional neuronal markers for cognitive-motor interference at the individual level.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neural Circuits: Continuous Theta-Burst Stimulation Intensity Dependently Facilitates Motor-Evoked Potentials Following Focal Electrical Stimulation of the Rat Motor Cortex</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncir.2020.585624</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Although theta-burst stimulation (TBS) is known to differentially modify motor cortical excitability according to stimulus conditions in humans, whether similar effects can be seen in animals, in particular rats, remains to be defined. Given the importance of experimental rat models for humans, this study explored this stimulation paradigm in rats. Specifically, this study aimed to explore corticospinal excitability after TBS in anesthetized animals to confirm its comparability with human results. Both inhibition-facilitation configurations using paired electrical stimulation protocols and the effects of the TBS paradigm on motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) in rat descending motor pathways were assessed. Paired-stimulation MEPs showed inhibition [interstimulus interval (ISI): 3 ms] and facilitation (11 ms) patterns under medetomidine/midazolam/butorphanol (MMB) anesthesia. Furthermore, while ketamine and xylazine (K/X) anesthesia completely blocked facilitation at 11-ms ISI, inhibition at a 3-ms ISI was preserved. Continuous and intermittent TBS strongly facilitated MEPs depending on stimulus intensity, persisting for up to 25 min under both MMB and K/X anesthesia. These findings are similar to the intracortical inhibition and facilitation observed in the human motor cortex using paired-pulse magnetic stimulation, particularly the glutamate-mediated facilitation phase. However, different TBS facilitatory mechanisms occur in the rat motor cortex. These different TBS facilitatory mechanisms affect the comparability and interpretations of TBS between rat and human models.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.589582</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Research over the last couple of decades has provided novel insights into lactate neurobiology and the implications of lactate transport-driven neuroenergetics in health and diseases of peripheral nerve and the brain. The expression pattern of lactate transporters in glia and neurons has now been described, though notable controversies and discrepancies remain. Importantly, down- and up-regulation experiments are underway to better understand the function of these transporters in different systems. Lactate transporters in peripheral nerves are important for maintenance of axon and myelin integrity, motor end-plate integrity, the development of diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN), and the functional recovery following nerve injuries. Similarly, brain energy metabolism and functions ranging from development to synaptic plasticity to axonal integrity are also dependent on lactate transport primarily between glia and neurons. This review is focused on critically analysing the expression pattern and the functions of lactate transporters in peripheral nerves and the brain and highlighting their role in glia-neuron metabolic crosstalk in physiological and pathological conditions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Cholinergic Dysfunction Involvement in Chronic Cerebral Hypoperfusion-Induced Impairment of Medial Septum–dCA1 Neurocircuit in Rats</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.586591</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Chronic cerebral hypoperfusion (CCH) is considered a preclinical condition of mild cognitive impairment and thought to precede dementia. However, as the principal cholinergic source of hippocampus, whether the septo-hippocampal neurocircuit was impaired after CCH is still unknown. In this study, we established the CCH rat model by bilateral common carotid artery occlusion (2VO). Under anesthesia, the medial septum (MS) of rats was stimulated to evoke the field excitatory post-synaptic potential (fEPSP) in the pyramidal cell layer of dCA1. Consequently, we observed decreased amplitude of fEPSP and increased paired-pulse ratio (PPR) after 8-week CCH. After tail pinch, we also found decreased peak frequency and shortened duration of hippocampal theta rhythm in 2VO rats, indicating the dysfunction of septo-hippocampal neurocircuit. Besides, by intracerebroventricularly injecting GABAergic inhibitor (bicuculline) and cholinergic inhibitors (scopolamine and mecamylamine), we found that CCH impaired both the pre-synaptic cholinergic release and the post-synaptic nAChR function in MS–dCA1 circuits. These results gave an insight into the role of CCH in the impairment of cholinergic MS–dCA1 neurocircuits. These findings may provide a new idea about the CCH-induced neurodegenerative changes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Beyond the Hippocampus and the SVZ: Adult Neurogenesis Throughout the Brain</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.576444</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Convincing evidence has repeatedly shown that new neurons are produced in the mammalian brain into adulthood. Adult neurogenesis has been best described in the hippocampus and the subventricular zone (SVZ), in which a series of distinct stages of neuronal development has been well characterized. However, more recently, new neurons have also been found in other brain regions of the adult mammalian brain, including the hypothalamus, striatum, substantia nigra, cortex, and amygdala. While some studies have suggested that these new neurons originate from endogenous stem cell pools located within these brain regions, others have shown the migration of neurons from the SVZ to these regions. Notably, it has been shown that the generation of new neurons in these brain regions is impacted by neurologic processes such as stroke/ischemia and neurodegenerative disorders. Furthermore, numerous factors such as neurotrophic support, pharmacologic interventions, environmental exposures, and stem cell therapy can modulate this endogenous process. While the presence and significance of adult neurogenesis in the human brain (and particularly outside of the classical neurogenic regions) is still an area of debate, this intrinsic neurogenic potential and its possible regulation through therapeutic measures present an exciting alternative for the treatment of several neurologic conditions. This review summarizes evidence in support of the classic and novel neurogenic zones present within the mammalian brain and discusses the functional significance of these new neurons as well as the factors that regulate their production. Finally, it also discusses the potential clinical applications of promoting neurogenesis outside of the classical neurogenic niches, particularly in the hypothalamus, cortex, striatum, substantia nigra, and amygdala.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: The Unfolded Protein Response and Autophagy as Drug Targets in Neuropsychiatric Disorders</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.554548</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Neurons are polarized in structure with a cytoplasmic compartment extending into dendrites and a long axon that terminates at the synapse. The high level of compartmentalization imposes specific challenges for protein quality control in neurons making them vulnerable to disturbances that may lead to neurological dysfunctions including neuropsychiatric diseases. Synapse and dendrites undergo structural modulations regulated by neuronal activity involve key proteins requiring strict control of their turnover rates and degradation pathways. Recent advances in the study of the unfolded protein response (UPR) and autophagy processes have brought novel insights into the specific roles of these processes in neuronal physiology and synaptic signaling. In this review, we highlight recent data and concepts about UPR and autophagy in neuropsychiatric disorders and synaptic plasticity including a brief outline of possible therapeutic approaches to influence UPR and autophagy signaling in these diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Mir363-3p Treatment Attenuates Long-Term Cognitive Deficits Precipitated by an Ischemic Stroke in Middle-Aged Female Rats</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.586362</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Cognitive impairment and memory loss are commonly seen after stroke and a third of patients will develop signs of dementia a year after stroke. Despite a large number of studies on the beneficial effects of neuroprotectants, few studies have examined the effects of these compounds/interventions on long-term cognitive impairment. Our previous work showed that the microRNA mir363-3p reduced infarct volume and sensory-motor impairment in the acute stage of stroke in middle-aged females but not males. Thus, the present study determined the impact of mir363-3p treatment on stroke-induced cognitive impairment in middle-aged females. Sprague–Dawley female rats (12 months of age) were subjected to middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAo; or sham surgery) and injected (iv) with mir363-3p mimic (MCAo + mir363-3p) or scrambled oligos (MCAo + scrambled) 4 h later. Sensory-motor performance was assessed in the acute phase (2–5 days after stroke), while all other behaviors were tested 6 months after MCAo (18 months of age). Cognitive function was assessed by the novel object recognition test (declarative memory) and the Barnes maze (spatial memory). The MCAo + scrambled group showed reduced preference for a novel object after the stroke and poor learning in the spatial memory task. In contrast, mir363-3p treated animals were similar to either their baseline performance or to the sham group. Histological analysis showed significant deterioration of specific white matter tracts due to stroke, which was attenuated in mir363-3p treated animals. The present data builds on our previous finding to show that a neuroprotectant can abrogate the long-term effects of stroke.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.566922</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Neurodegenerative diseases are characterized by the loss of neurons and/or myelin sheath, which deteriorate over time and cause dysfunction. Interleukin 17A is the signature cytokine of a subset of CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; helper T cells known as Th17 cells, and the IL-17 cytokine family contains six cytokines and five receptors. Recently, several studies have suggested a pivotal role for the interleukin-17A (IL-17A) cytokine family in human inflammatory or autoimmune diseases and neurodegenerative diseases, including psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis (RA), Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Parkinson’s disease (PD), multiple sclerosis (MS), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and glaucoma. Studies in recent years have shown that the mechanism of action of IL-17A is more subtle than simply causing inflammation. Although the specific mechanism of IL-17A in neurodegenerative diseases is still controversial, it is generally accepted now that IL-17A causes diseases by activating glial cells. In this review article, we will focus on the function of IL-17A, in particular the proposed roles of IL-17A, in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.557384</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Vertebrates have acquired complex high-order functions facilitated by the dispersion of vascular and neural networks to every corner of the body. Blood vessels deliver oxygen and nutrients to all cells and provide essential transport systems for removing waste products. For these functions, tissue vascularization must be spatiotemporally appropriate. Recent studies revealed that blood vessels create a tissue-specific niche, thus attracting attention as biologically active sites for tissue development. Each capillary network is critical for maintaining proper brain function because age-related and disease-related impairment of cognitive function is associated with the loss or diminishment of brain capillaries. This review article highlights how structural and functional alterations in the brain vessels may change with age and neurogenerative diseases. Capillaries are also responsible for filtering toxic byproducts, providing an appropriate vascular environment for neuronal function. Accumulation of amyloid β is a key event in Alzheimer’s disease pathogenesis. Recent studies have focused on associations reported between Alzheimer’s disease and vascular aging. Furthermore, the glymphatic system and meningeal lymphatic systems contribute to a functional unit for clearance of amyloid β from the brain from the central nervous system into the cervical lymph nodes. This review article will also focus on recent advances in stem cell therapies that aim at repopulation or regeneration of a degenerating vascular system for neural diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Enhancing Working Memory Based on Mismatch Negativity Neurofeedback in Subjective Cognitive Decline Patients: A Preliminary Study</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00263</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Mismatch negativity (MMN) is suitable for studies of preattentive auditory discriminability and the auditory memory trace. Subjective cognitive decline (SCD) is an ideal target for early therapeutic intervention because SCD occurs at preclinical stages many years before the onset of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). According to a novel lifespan-based model of dementia risk, hearing loss is considered the greatest potentially modifiable risk factor of dementia among nine health and lifestyle factors, and hearing impairment is associated with cognitive decline. Therefore, we propose a neurofeedback training based on MMN, which is an objective index of auditory discriminability, to regulate sensory ability and memory as a non-pharmacological intervention (NPI) in SCD patients. Seventeen subjects meeting the standardized clinical evaluations for SCD received neurofeedback training. The auditory frequency discrimination test, the visual digital N-back (1-, 2-, and 3-back), auditory digital N-back (1-, 2-, and 3-back), and auditory tone N-back (1-, 2-, and 3-back) tasks were used pre- and post-training in all SCD patients. The intervention schedule comprised five 60-min training sessions over 2 weeks. The results indicate that the subjects who received neurofeedback training had successfully improved the amplitude of MMN at the parietal electrode (Pz). A slight decrease in the threshold of auditory frequency discrimination was observed after neurofeedback training. Notably, after neurofeedback training, the working memory (WM) performance was significantly enhanced in the auditory tone 3-back test. Moreover, improvements in the accuracy of all WM tests relative to the baseline were observed, although the changes were not significant. To the best of our knowledge, our preliminary study is the first to investigate the effects of MMN neurofeedback training on WM in SCD patients, and our results suggest that MMN neurofeedback may represent an effective treatment for intervention in SCD patients and the elderly with aging memory decline.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/61762</link>
	<content:encoded>With implantation mouse stromal cells begin to transform into epithelial-like cells surrounding the implantation chamber forming an avascular zone called the primary decidual zone (PDZ). In mouse, the PDZ forms a transient, size-dependent permeable barrier to protect the embryo from maternal circulating harmful agents. The process of decidualization is critical for early pregnancy maintenance in mice and humans. Mice deficient in cannabinoid receptors, CB1 and CB2, show compromised PDZ with dysregulated angiogenic factors, resulting in the retention of blood vessels and macrophages. This phenotype is replicated in &lt;i&gt;Cnr1&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt;, but not in &lt;i&gt;Cnr2&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt; mice. &lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;n vitro&lt;/i&gt; decidualization models suggest that &lt;i&gt;Cnr1&lt;/i&gt; levels substantially increase in mouse and human decidualizing stromal cells, and that neutralization of CB1 signaling suppresses decidualization and misregulates angiogenic factors. In sum, we propose that implantation quality depends on appropriate angiogenic events driven by the integration of CB2 in endothelial cells and CB1 in decidual cells.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>The latent reservoir is a major barrier to HIV cure. As latently infected cells cannot be phenotyped directly, the features of the in vivo reservoir have remained elusive. Here, we describe a method that leverages high-dimensional phenotyping using CyTOF to trace latently infected cells reactivated ex vivo to their original pre-activation states. Our results suggest that, contrary to common assumptions, the reservoir is not randomly distributed among cell subsets, and is remarkably conserved between individuals. However, reservoir composition differs between tissues and blood, as do cells successfully reactivated by different latency reversing agents. By selecting 8–10 of our 39 original CyTOF markers, we were able to isolate highly purified populations of unstimulated in vivo latent cells. These purified populations were highly enriched for replication-competent and intact provirus, transcribed HIV, and displayed clonal expansion. The ability to isolate unstimulated latent cells from infected individuals enables previously impossible studies on HIV persistence.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Scars are a serious health concern for burn victims and individuals with skin conditions associated with wound healing. Here, we identify regenerative factors in neonatal murine skin that transforms adult skin to regenerate instead of only repairing wounds with a scar, without perturbing development and homeostasis. Using scRNA-seq to probe unsorted cells from regenerating, scarring, homeostatic, and developing skin, we identified neonatal papillary fibroblasts that form a transient regenerative cell type that promotes healthy skin regeneration in young skin. These fibroblasts are defined by the expression of a canonical Wnt transcription factor Lef1 and using gain- and loss of function genetic mouse models, we demonstrate that Lef1 expression in fibroblasts primes the adult skin macroenvironment to enhance skin repair, including regeneration of hair follicles with arrector pili muscles in healed wounds. Finally, we share our genomic data in an interactive, searchable companion website (&lt;a href=&quot;https://skinregeneration.org/&quot;&gt;https://skinregeneration.org/&lt;/a&gt;). Together, these data and resources provide a platform to leverage the regenerative abilities of neonatal skin to develop clinically tractable solutions that promote the regeneration of adult tissue.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/58873</link>
	<content:encoded>Prokaryotes acquire genes from the environment via lateral gene transfer (LGT). Recombination of environmental DNA can prevent the accumulation of deleterious mutations, but LGT was abandoned by the first eukaryotes in favour of sexual reproduction. Here we develop a theoretical model of a haploid population undergoing LGT which includes two new parameters, genome size and recombination length, neglected by previous theoretical models. The greater complexity of eukaryotes is linked with larger genomes and we demonstrate that the benefit of LGT declines rapidly with genome size. The degeneration of larger genomes can only be resisted by increases in recombination length, to the same order as genome size – as occurs in meiosis. Our results can explain the strong selective pressure towards the evolution of sexual cell fusion and reciprocal recombination during early eukaryotic evolution – the origin of meiotic sex.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/58108</link>
	<content:encoded>Cancer testis antigens (CTAs) are proteins whose expression is normally restricted to the testis but anomalously activated in human cancer. In sperm, a number of CTAs support energy generation, however whether they contribute to tumor metabolism is not understood. We describe human COX6B2, a component of cytochrome c oxidase (complex IV). &lt;i&gt;COX6B2&lt;/i&gt; is expressed in human lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and expression correlates with reduced survival time. COX6B2, but not its somatic isoform COX6B1, enhances activity of complex IV, increasing oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; generation. Consequently, COX6B2-expressing cancer cells display a proliferative advantage, particularly in low oxygen. Conversely, depletion of COX6B2 attenuates OXPHOS and collapses mitochondrial membrane potential leading to cell death or senescence. COX6B2 is both necessary and sufficient for growth of human tumor xenografts in mice. Our findings reveal a previously unappreciated, tumor specific metabolic pathway hijacked from one of the most ATP-intensive processes in the animal kingdom: sperm motility.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>New therapeutic targets for oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) are urgently needed. We conducted genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 screens in 21 OSCC cell lines, primarily derived from Asians, to identify genetic vulnerabilities that can be explored as therapeutic targets. We identify known and novel fitness genes and demonstrate that many previously identified OSCC-related cancer genes are non-essential and could have limited therapeutic value, while other fitness genes warrant further investigation for their potential as therapeutic targets. We validate a distinctive dependency on YAP1 and WWTR1 of the Hippo pathway, where the lost-of-fitness effect of one paralog can be compensated only in a subset of lines. We also discover that OSCCs with WWTR1 dependency signature are significantly associated with biomarkers of favourable response towards immunotherapy. In summary, we have delineated the genetic vulnerabilities of OSCC, enabling the prioritization of therapeutic targets for further exploration, including the targeting of YAP1 and WWTR1.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/57603</link>
	<content:encoded>The development of the cardiac outflow tract (OFT), which connects the heart to the great arteries, relies on a complex crosstalk between endothelial (ECs) and smooth muscle (SMCs) cells. Defects in OFT development can lead to severe malformations, including aortic aneurysms, which are frequently associated with impaired TGF-β signaling. To better understand the role of TGF-β signaling in OFT formation, we generated zebrafish lacking the TGF-β receptor Alk5 and found a strikingly specific dilation of the OFT: &lt;i&gt;alk5-/-&lt;/i&gt; OFTs exhibit increased EC numbers as well as extracellular matrix (ECM) and SMC disorganization. Surprisingly, endothelial-specific &lt;i&gt;alk5&lt;/i&gt; overexpression in &lt;i&gt;alk5&lt;/i&gt;-/- rescues the EC, ECM, and SMC defects. Transcriptomic analyses reveal downregulation of the ECM gene &lt;i&gt;fibulin-5,&lt;/i&gt; which when overexpressed in ECs ameliorates OFT morphology and function. These findings reveal a new requirement for endothelial TGF-β signaling in OFT morphogenesis and suggest an important role for the endothelium in the etiology of aortic malformations.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/57344</link>
	<content:encoded>In the cerebellar cortex, molecular layer interneurons use chemical and electrical synapses to form subnetworks that fine-tune the spiking output of the cerebellum. Although electrical synapses can entrain activity within neuronal assemblies, their role in feed-forward circuits is less well explored. By combining whole-cell patch-clamp and 2-photon laser scanning microscopy of basket cells (BCs), we found that classical excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) are followed by GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptor-independent outward currents, reflecting the hyperpolarization component of spikelets (a synapse-evoked action potential passively propagating from electrically coupled neighbors). FF recruitment of the spikelet-mediated inhibition curtails the integration time window of concomitant excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) and dampens their temporal integration. In contrast with GABAergic-mediated feed-forward inhibition, the depolarizing component of spikelets transiently increases the peak amplitude of EPSPs, and thus postsynaptic spiking probability. Therefore, spikelet transmission can propagate within the BC network to generate synchronous inhibition of Purkinje cells, which can entrain cerebellar output for driving temporally precise behaviors.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Somatic expansion of the Huntington's disease (HD) CAG repeat drives the rate of a pathogenic process ultimately resulting in neuronal cell death. Although mechanisms of toxicity are poorly delineated, transcriptional dysregulation is a likely contributor. To identify modifiers that act at the level of CAG expansion and/or downstream pathogenic processes, we tested the impact of genetic knockout, in &lt;i&gt;Htt&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Q111&lt;/sup&gt; mice, of &lt;i&gt;Hdac2&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;Hdac3&lt;/i&gt; in medium-spiny striatal neurons that exhibit extensive CAG expansion and exquisite disease vulnerability. Both knockouts moderately attenuated CAG expansion, with &lt;i&gt;Hdac2&lt;/i&gt; knockout decreasing nuclear huntingtin pathology. &lt;i&gt;Hdac2&lt;/i&gt; knockout resulted in a substantial transcriptional response that included modification of transcriptional dysregulation elicited by the &lt;i&gt;Htt&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Q111&lt;/sup&gt; allele, likely via mechanisms unrelated to instability suppression.

	<content:encoded>Ramón y Cajal proclaimed the neuron doctrine based on circuit features he exemplified using cerebellar basket cell projections. Basket cells form dense inhibitory plexuses that wrap Purkinje cell somata and terminate as pinceaux at the initial segment of axons. Here, we demonstrate that HCN1, Kv1.1, PSD95 and GAD67 unexpectedly mark patterns of basket cell pinceaux that map onto Purkinje cell functional zones. Using cell-specific genetic tracing with an &lt;i&gt;Ascl1&lt;sup&gt;CreERT2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt; mouse conditional allele, we reveal that basket cell zones comprise different sizes of pinceaux. We tested whether Purkinje cells instruct the assembly of inhibitory projections into zones, as they do for excitatory afferents. Genetically silencing Purkinje cell neurotransmission blocks the formation of sharp Purkinje cell zones and disrupts excitatory axon patterning. The distribution of pinceaux into size-specific zones is eliminated without Purkinje cell GABAergic output. Our data uncover the cellular and molecular diversity of a foundational synapse that revolutionized neuroscience.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Mammalian olfaction and reproduction are tightly linked, a link less explored in humans. Here, we asked whether human unexplained repeated pregnancy loss (uRPL) is associated with altered olfaction, and particularly altered olfactory responses to body-odor. We found that whereas most women with uRPL could identify the body-odor of their spouse, most control women could not. Moreover, women with uRPL rated the perceptual attributes of men's body-odor differently from controls. These pronounced differences were accompanied by an only modest albeit significant advantage in ordinary, non-body-odor-related olfaction in uRPL. Next, using structural and functional brain imaging, we found that in comparison to controls, most women with uRPL had smaller olfactory bulbs, yet increased hypothalamic response in association with men's body-odor. These findings combine to suggest altered olfactory perceptual and brain responses in women experiencing uRPL, particularly in relation to men's body-odor. Whether this link has any causal aspects to it remains to be explored.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/54707</link>
	<content:encoded>Cellular aging is a multifactorial process that is characterized by a decline in homeostatic capacity, best described at the molecular level. Physicochemical properties such as pH and macromolecular crowding are essential to all molecular processes in cells and require maintenance. Whether a drift in physicochemical properties contributes to the overall decline of homeostasis in aging is not known. Here we show that the cytosol of yeast cells acidifies modestly in early aging and sharply after senescence. Using a macromolecular crowding sensor optimized for long-term FRET measurements, we show that crowding is rather stable and that the stability of crowding is a stronger predictor for lifespan than the absolute crowding levels. Additionally, in aged cells we observe drastic changes in organellar volume, leading to crowding on the µm scale, which we term organellar crowding. Our measurements provide an initial framework of physicochemical parameters of replicatively aged yeast cells.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: A circuit mechanism for decision-making biases and NMDA receptor hypofunction</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/53664</link>
	<content:encoded>Decision-making biases can be features of normal behaviour, or deficits underlying neuropsychiatric symptoms. We used behavioural psychophysics, spiking-circuit modelling and pharmacological manipulations to explore decision-making biases during evidence integration. Monkeys showed a pro-variance bias (PVB): a preference to choose options with more variable evidence. The PVB was also present in a spiking circuit model, revealing a potential neural mechanism for this behaviour. To model possible effects of NMDA receptor (NMDA-R) antagonism on this behaviour, we simulated the effects of NMDA-R hypofunction onto either excitatory or inhibitory neurons in the model. These were then tested experimentally using the NMDA-R antagonist ketamine, a pharmacological model of schizophrenia. Ketamine yielded an increase in subjects’ PVB, consistent with lowered cortical excitation/inhibition balance from NMDA-R hypofunction predominantly onto excitatory neurons. These results provide a circuit-level mechanism that bridges across explanatory scales, from the synaptic to the behavioural, in neuropsychiatric disorders where decision-making biases are prominent.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.29.319467v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>The temporal frequency of synaptic activation is a decisive factor in the regulation of perceptual detection thresholds following high or low frequency sensory stimulation. However, surprisingly little is known about the neuronal and circuit level responses to distinct temporal parameters of sensory input. Here we demonstrate that the temporal frequency of a visual stimulus determines the locus of expression and specificity of visual response potentiation. Repetitive high frequency stimulation (HFS, 20 Hz), but not low frequency stimulation (LFS, 2 Hz), suppresses the activity of fast-spiking interneurons, and primes ongoing gamma oscillatory rhythms for visually-evoked phase reset. Accordingly, visual stimulation subsequent to HFS induces a non-stimulus specific response potentiation that is expressed in all cortical layers. In contrast, LFS induces a stimulus specific response potentiation that is specifically expressed in layer 4. This generalized response potentiation induced by HFS is coincident with an improved performance in a visual detection task that generalizes to novel visual stimuli.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.29.318881v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Detailing the ways drugs of abuse physically change dopaminergic circuits would provide new mechanisms for explaining addictive behaviors, future targets for therapeutic intervention, and insights into the nature of synaptic plasticity. We combine recent advances in genetic labeling with large volume serial electron microscopy to detail how normal dopaminergic (DA) axons interact with putative targets and how those interactions change in mice briefly exposed to cocaine. We find that while most DA boutons are devoid of obvious signs of synapses (i.e. synaptic vesicles or synaptic densities) many DA boutons physically interdigitate with both dendrites and excitatory and inhibitory axons. After a brief exposure to cocaine, we find evidence of large-scale structural remodeling: extensive axonal branching and frequent occurrences of axonal blind-ended bulbs, filled with mitochondria, reminiscent of axonal retraction in the developing and damaged brain. The number of physical interdigitations and vesicle filled boutons between DA axons and targets scales linearly with the length of axon whether in controls or cocaine exposed animals and the size or the type of interaction (i.e. axo-axonic or axo-dendritic) does not change. Finally, we find significant cell-type and sub-cellular specific increases in mitochondrial length in response to cocaine. Specifically, mitochondria in dopamine axons and local Nucleus Accumbens (NAc) dendrites are ~3.5 times and 2 times longer, respectively, in cocaine treated mice than controls. These results show for the first time the effects of cocaine on remodeling of dopamine circuitry and reveal new details on how dopamine neurons physical associate with downstream targets.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.28.317230v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Major depressive disorder (MDD) is one of the most common consequences of chronic stress. Still, there is currently no reliable biomarker to detect individuals at risk to develop MDD. Recently, the retina emerged as an effective way to approach the brain and investigate psychiatric disorders with the use of the electroretinogram (ERG). In this study, cones and rods ERGs were performed in male and female mice before and after chronic social defeat stress (CSDS). Mice were then divided as susceptible or resilient to stress. Significant results were only observed in rods ERGs. In males, susceptible mice showed prolonged a-wave implicit times at baseline that were shortened after CSDS. The a-wave was also decreased in both susceptible and resilient male mice after CSDS. In females, rod a-waves were shorter in susceptible than in control mice after CSDS resulting from the latter demonstrating delayed a-waves. Baseline ERGs were able to predict - to some extent - the expression of susceptibility and resilience before stress exposition in male and female mice. Overall, our findings suggest that retinal activity is a presumptive biomarker of stress response and that the ERG could potentially serve as a predicting tool of the stress response in mice.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.28.317180v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>The development of perinatal brain connectivity underpins motor, cognitive and behavioural abilities in later life. With the rise of advanced imaging methods such as diffusion MRI, the study of brain connectivity has emerged as an important tool to understand subtle alterations associated with neurodevelopmental conditions. Brain connectivity derived from diffusion MRI is complex, multi-dimensional and noisy, and hence it can be challenging to interpret on an individual basis. Machine learning methods have proven to be a powerful tool to uncover hidden patterns in such data, thus opening an opportunity for early identification of atypical development and potentially more efficient treatment. In this work, we used Deep Neural Networks and Random Forests to predict neurodevelopmental characteristics from neonatal structural connectomes, in a large sample of neonates (N = 524) derived from the developing Human Connectome Project. We achieved a highly accurate prediction of post menstrual age (PMA) at scan on term-born infants (Mean absolute error (MAE) = 0.72 weeks, r = 0.83, p&amp;lt;&amp;lt;0.001). We also achieved good accuracy when predicting gestational age at birth on a cohort of term and preterm babies scanned at term equivalent age (MAE = 2.21 weeks, r = 0.82, p&amp;lt;&amp;lt;0.001). From our models of PMA at scan for infants born at term, we computed the brain maturation index (i.e. predicted minus actual age) of individual preterm neonates and found significant correlation of this index with motor outcome at 18 months corrected age. Our results suggest that the neural substrate for later neurological functioning is detectable within a few weeks after birth in the structural connectome.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Epigenomic features related to microglia are associated with attenuated effect of APOE ε4 on Alzheimer's disease risk in humans</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.28.317156v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>INTRODUCTIONNot all APOE {varepsilon}4 carriers who survive to advanced age develop Alzheimers disease (AD); factors attenuating the risk of {varepsilon}4 on AD may exist.

METHODSGuided by the top {varepsilon}4-attenuating signals from methylome-wide association analyses (N=572, {varepsilon}4+ and {varepsilon}4-) of neurofibrillary tangles and neuritic plaques, we conducted a meta-analysis for pathological AD within the {varepsilon}4+ subgroups (N=235) across four independent collections of brains. Cortical RNA-seq and microglial morphology measurements were used in functional analyses.

RESULTSThree out of the four significant CpG dinucleotides were captured by one principle component (PC1), which interacts with {varepsilon}4 on AD, and is associated with expression of innate immune genes and activated microglia. In {varepsilon}4 carriers, reduction in each unit of PC1 attenuated the odds of AD by 58% (OR=2.39, 95%CI=[1.64,3.46], P=7.08x10-6).

DISCUSSIONAn epigenomic factor associated with a reduced proportion of activated microglia appears to attenuate the risk of {varepsilon}4 on AD.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Luxotonic signals in human prefrontal cortex: A possible substrate for effects of light on mood and cognition</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.28.316943v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Light impacts mood and cognition of humans and other animals in ways we are only beginning to recognize. These effects are thought to depend upon a specialized retinal output signal arising from intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs) that is being dedicated to a stable representation of the intensity of environmental light. Insights from animal studies now implicate a previously unknown pathway in the effects of environmental light on mood. A subset of ipRGCs transmits light-intensity information to the dorsothalamic perihabenular nucleus, which in turn, innervates the medial prefrontal cortex that plays a key role in mood regulation. While the prefrontal cortex has been implicated in depression and other mood disorders, its ability to encode the level of environmental light (luminance) has never been reported. Here, as a first step to probing for a similar retino-thalamo-frontocortical circuit in humans, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to identify brain regions in which activity depended on luminance level where activity was modulated either transiently or persistently by light. Twelve brain regions altered their steady-state activity according to luminance level. Most were in the prefrontal cortex or in the classic thalamocortical visual pathway; others were found in the cerebellum, caudate, and pineal. Prefrontal cortex and pineal exhibited reduced BOLD signal in bright light, while the other centers exhibited increased BOLD signals. The light-evoked prefrontal response was affected by light history and closely resembled those of ipRGCs. Although we did not find clear correspondence between the luxotonic regions in humans and those in mice, the persistence and luxotonic nature of light-evoked responses in the human prefrontal cortex may suggest that it receives input from ipRGCs, just like in the mouse. We also found seventeen regions in which activity varied only transiently with luminance level. These regions, which are involved in visual processing, motor control, and cognition, were in the cerebral cortex, diverse subcortical structures, and cerebellum. Therefore, our results demonstrate the effects of light on diverse brain centers that contribute to motor control, cognition, emotion, and reward processing.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: The meaning that emerges from combining words is robustly localizable in space but not in time</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.28.316935v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>To study a core component of human intelligence---our ability to combine the meaning of words---neuroscientists look for neural correlates of meaning composition, such as brain activity proportional to the difficulty of understanding a sentence. However, little is known about the product of meaning composition in the brain---the combined meaning of words beyond their individual meaning. We term this product &quot;supra-word meaning&quot; and devise a computational representation for it by using recent neural network algorithms and a new technique to disentangle composed- from individual-word meaning. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we find that supra-word meaning is processed in the bilateral anterior and posterior temporal lobes. Surprisingly, we cannot detect supra-word meaning in magnetoencephalography. These results suggest that composed meaning is maintained through a different neural mechanism that does not consist of synchronized cell firing. This difference in sensitivity has implications for past neuroimaging results and future neuroimaging studies.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.28.316828v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Autism is a developmental disorder characterized by impaired social skills and accompanied by motor and perceptual atypicalities. Its etiology is an open question, partly due to the diverse range of associated difficulties. Based on recent observations that individuals with autism are slow in updating perceptual priors, we now hypothesized that motor updating is also slow. Slow motor updating is expected to hamper the ability to synchronize to external events, since asynchronies are corrected sluggishly. Since sensorimotor synchronization is important for social bonding and cooperation, its impairment is expected to impair social skills. To test this hypothesis, we measured paced finger tapping to a metronome in neurotypical, ASD, and dyslexia groups. Dyslexia was assessed as a control group with a non-social neurodevelopmental atypicality. Only the ASD group showed reduced sensorimotor synchronization. Trial-by-trial computational modelling revealed that their ability to form controlled motor responses and to maintain reliable temporal representations was adequate. Only their rate of error-correction was slow and was correlated with the severity of their social difficulties. Taken together, these findings suggest that slow updating in autism contributes to both sloppy sensorimotor performance and difficulties in forming social bonds.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Abnormalities in the synchronized oscillatory activity of neurons in general and, specifically in the gamma band, might play a crucial role in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. While these changes in oscillatory activity have traditionally been linked to alterations at the synaptic level, we demonstrate here, using computational modeling, that common genetic variants of ion channels can contribute strongly to this effect. Our model of primary auditory cortex highlights multiple schizophrenia-associated genetic variants that reduce gamma power in an auditory steady-state response task. Furthermore, we show that combinations of several of these schizophrenia-associated variants can produce similar effects as the more traditionally considered synaptic changes. Overall, our study provides a mechanistic link between schizophrenia-associated common genetic variants, as identified by genome-wide association studies, and one of the most robust neurophysiological endophenotypes of schizophrenia.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.09.28.316646v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Transmitter receptors constitute a key component of the molecular machinery for inter-cellular communication in the brain. Recent efforts have mapped the density of diverse transmitter receptors across the human cerebral cortex with an unprecedented level of detail. Here, we distil these observations into key organizational principles. We demonstrate that receptor densities form a natural axis in the human cerebral cortex, reflecting decreases in differentiation at the level of laminar organization, and a sensory-to association axis at the functional level. Along this natural axis, key organizational principles are discerned: progressive molecular diversity (increase of the diversity of receptor density), excitation/inhibition (increase of the ratio of excitatory-to-inhibitory receptor density) and mirrored, orderly changes of the density of ionotropic and metabotropic receptors. The uncovered natural axis formed by the distribution of receptors aligns with the axis that is formed by other dimensions of cortical organization, such as the myelo- and cytoarchitectonic levels. Therefore, the uncovered natural axis constitutes a unifying organizational feature linking multiple dimensions of the cerebral cortex, thus bringing order to the heterogeneity of cortical organization.</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Mutation bias interacts with composition bias to influence adaptive evolution</title>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Alejandro V. Cano, Joshua L. Payne&lt;/p&gt;

Mutation is a biased stochastic process, with some types of mutations occurring more frequently than others. Previous work has used synthetic genotype-phenotype landscapes to study how such mutation bias affects adaptive evolution. Here, we consider 746 empirical genotype-phenotype landscapes, each of which describes the binding affinity of target DNA sequences to a transcription factor, to study the influence of mutation bias on adaptive evolution of increased binding affinity. By using empirical genotype-phenotype landscapes, we need to make only few assumptions about landscape topography and about the DNA sequences that each landscape contains. The latter is particularly important because the set of sequences that a landscape contains determines the types of mutations that can occur along a mutational path to an adaptive peak. That is, landscapes can exhibit a composition bias—a statistical enrichment of a particular type of mutation relative to a null expectation, throughout an entire landscape or along particular mutational paths—that is independent of any bias in the mutation process. Our results reveal the way in which composition bias interacts with biases in the mutation process under different population genetic conditions, and how such interaction impacts fundamental properties of adaptive evolution, such as its predictability, as well as the evolution of genetic diversity and mutational robustness.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/hNnBJaMhiPI&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Tuning network dynamics from criticality to an asynchronous state</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/pQLDDxBo8Qc/article</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Jingwen Li, Woodrow L. Shew&lt;/p&gt;

According to many experimental observations, neurons in cerebral cortex tend to operate in an asynchronous regime, firing independently of each other. In contrast, many other experimental observations reveal cortical population firing dynamics that are relatively coordinated and occasionally synchronous. These discrepant observations have naturally led to competing hypotheses. A commonly hypothesized explanation of asynchronous firing is that excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs are precisely correlated, nearly canceling each other, sometimes referred to as ‘balanced’ excitation and inhibition. On the other hand, the ‘criticality’ hypothesis posits an explanation of the more coordinated state that also requires a certain balance of excitatory and inhibitory interactions. Both hypotheses claim the same qualitative mechanism—properly balanced excitation and inhibition. Thus, a natural question arises: how are asynchronous population dynamics and critical dynamics related, how do they differ? Here we propose an answer to this question based on investigation of a simple, network-level computational model. We show that the strength of inhibitory synapses relative to excitatory synapses can be tuned from weak to strong to generate a family of models that spans a continuum from critical dynamics to asynchronous dynamics. Our results demonstrate that the coordinated dynamics of criticality and asynchronous dynamics can be generated by the same neural system if excitatory and inhibitory synapses are tuned appropriately.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/pQLDDxBo8Qc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Genome organization is critical for setting up the spatial environment of gene transcription, and substantial progress has been made towards its high-resolution characterization. The underlying molecular mechanism for its establishment is much less understood. We applied a deep-learning approach, variational autoencoder (VAE), to analyze the fluctuation and heterogeneity of chromatin structures revealed by single-cell imaging and to identify a reaction coordinate for chromatin folding. This coordinate connects the seemingly random structures observed in individual cohesin-depleted cells as intermediate states along a folding pathway that leads to the formation of topologically associating domains (TAD). We showed that folding into wild-type-like structures remain energetically favorable in cohesin-depleted cells, potentially as a result of the phase separation between the two chromatin segments with active and repressive histone marks. The energetic stabilization, however, is not strong enough to overcome the entropic penalty, leading to the formation of only partially folded structures and the disappearance of TADs from contact maps upon averaging. Our study suggests that machine learning techniques, when combined with rigorous statistical mechanical analysis, are powerful tools for analyzing structural ensembles of chromatin.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/YdoedOR0Mho&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Universal observations in Biology are sometimes described as “laws”. In &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;coli&lt;/i&gt;, experimental studies performed over the past six decades have revealed major growth laws relating ribosomal mass fraction and cell size to the growth rate. Because they formalize complex emerging principles in biology, growth laws have been instrumental in shaping our understanding of bacterial physiology. Here, we discovered a novel size law that connects cell size to the inverse of the metabolic proteome mass fraction and the active fraction of ribosomes. We used a simple whole-cell coarse-grained model of cell physiology that combines the proteome allocation theory and the structural model of cell division. This integrated model captures all available experimental data connecting the cell proteome composition, ribosome activity, division size and growth rate in response to nutrient quality, antibiotic treatment and increased protein burden. Finally, a stochastic extension of the model explains non-trivial correlations observed in single cell experiments including the adder principle. This work provides a simple and robust theoretical framework for studying the fundamental principles of cell size determination in unicellular organisms.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/O3t0l5JUN98&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Gene expression atlases have transformed our understanding of the development, composition and function of human tissues. New technologies promise improved cellular or molecular resolution, and have led to the identification of new cell types, or better defined cell states. But as new technologies emerge, information derived on old platforms becomes obsolete. We demonstrate that it is possible to combine a large number of different profiling experiments summarised from dozens of laboratories and representing hundreds of donors, to create an integrated molecular map of human tissue. As an example, we combine 850 samples from 38 platforms to build an integrated atlas of human blood cells. We achieve robust and unbiased cell type clustering using a variance partitioning method, selecting genes with low platform bias relative to biological variation. Other than an initial rescaling, no other transformation to the primary data is applied through batch correction or renormalisation. Additional data, including single-cell datasets, can be projected for comparison, classification and annotation. The resulting atlas provides a multi-scaled approach to visualise and analyse the relationships between sets of genes and blood cell lineages, including the maturation and activation of leukocytes in vivo and in vitro.
In allowing for data integration across hundreds of studies, we address a key reproduciblity challenge which is faced by any new technology. This allows us to draw on the deep phenotypes and functional annotations that accompany traditional profiling methods, and provide important context to the high cellular resolution of single cell profiling. Here, we have implemented the blood atlas in the open access Stemformatics.org platform, drawing on its extensive collection of curated transcriptome data. The method is simple, scalable and amenable for rapid deployment in other biological systems or computational workflows.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/-bcs3i7bY_U&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Domino-like transient dynamics at seizure onset in epilepsy</title>

The International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) groups seizures into “focal”, “generalized” and “unknown” based on whether the seizure onset is confined to a brain region in one hemisphere, arises in several brain region simultaneously, or is not known, respectively. This separation fails to account for the rich diversity of clinically and experimentally observed spatiotemporal patterns of seizure onset and even less so for the properties of the brain networks generating them. We consider three different patterns of domino-like seizure onset in Idiopathic Generalized Epilepsy (IGE) and present a novel approach to classification of seizures. To understand how these patterns are generated on networks requires understanding of the relationship between intrinsic node dynamics and coupling between nodes in the presence of noise, which currently is unknown. We investigate this interplay here in the framework of domino-like recruitment across a network. In particular, we use a phenomenological model of seizure onset with heterogeneous coupling and node properties, and show that in combination they generate a range of domino-like onset patterns observed in the IGE seizures. We further explore the individual contribution of heterogeneous node dynamics and coupling by interpreting in-vitro experimental data in which the speed of onset can be chemically modulated. This work contributes to a better understanding of possible drivers for the spatiotemporal patterns observed at seizure onset and may ultimately contribute to a more personalized approach to classification of seizure types in clinical practice.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/lljNI7eQQPU&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Interaction between filovirus glycoprotein (GP) and the Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC1) protein is essential for membrane fusion during virus entry. Some single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs) in two surface-exposed loops of NPC1 are known to reduce viral infectivity. However, the dependence of differences in entry efficiency on SNPs remains unclear. Using vesicular stomatitis virus pseudotyped with Ebola and Marburg virus GPs, we investigated the cell-to-cell spread of viruses in cultured cells expressing NPC1 or SNP derivatives. Eclipse and virus-producing phases were assessed by &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; infection experiments, and we developed a mathematical model describing spatial-temporal virus spread. This mathematical model fit the plaque radius data well from day 2 to day 6. Based on the estimated parameters, we found that SNPs causing the P424A and D508N substitutions in NPC1 most effectively reduced the entry efficiency of Ebola and Marburg viruses, respectively. Our novel approach could be broadly applied to other virus plaque assays.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/X9MgJdJjBeQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Obesity and related metabolic diseases show clear sex-related differences. The growing burden of these diseases calls for better understanding of the age- and sex-related metabolic consequences. High-throughput lipidomic analyses of population-based cohorts offer an opportunity to identify disease-risk–associated biomarkers and to improve our understanding of lipid metabolism and biology at a population level. Here, we comprehensively examined the relationship between lipid classes/subclasses and molecular species with age, sex, and body mass index (BMI). Furthermore, we evaluated sex specificity in the association of the plasma lipidome with age and BMI. Some 747 targeted lipid measures, representing 706 molecular lipid species across 36 classes/subclasses, were measured using a high-performance liquid chromatography coupled mass spectrometer on a total of 10,339 participants from the Australian Diabetes, Obesity and Lifestyle Study (AusDiab), with 563 lipid species being validated externally on 4,207 participants of the Busselton Health Study (BHS). Heat maps were constructed to visualise the relative differences in lipidomic profile between men and women. Multivariable linear regression analyses, including sex-interaction terms, were performed to assess the associations of lipid species with cardiometabolic phenotypes. Associations with age and sex were found for 472 (66.9%) and 583 (82.6%) lipid species, respectively. We further demonstrated that age-associated lipidomic fingerprints differed by sex. Specific classes of ether-phospholipids and lysophospholipids (calculated as the sum composition of the species within the class) were inversely associated with age in men only. In analyses with women alone, higher triacylglycerol and lower lysoalkylphosphatidylcholine species were observed among postmenopausal women compared with premenopausal women. We also identified sex-specific associations of lipid species with obesity. Lysophospholipids were negatively associated with BMI in both sexes (with a larger effect size in men), whilst acylcarnitine species showed opposing associations based on sex (positive association in women and negative association in men). Finally, by utilising specific lipid ratios as a proxy for enzymatic activity, we identified stearoyl CoA desaturase (SCD-1), fatty acid desaturase 3 (FADS3), and plasmanylethanolamine Δ1-desaturase activities, as well as the sphingolipid metabolic pathway, as constituent perturbations of cardiometabolic phenotypes. Our analyses elucidate the effect of age and sex on lipid metabolism by offering a comprehensive view of the lipidomic profiles associated with common cardiometabolic risk factors. These findings have implications for age- and sex-dependent lipid metabolism in health and disease and suggest the need for sex stratification during lipid biomarker discovery, establishing biological reference intervals for assessment of disease risk.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/FBmePFK0DOA&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Hippocampus: New boundaries and dissociation of the mouse hippocampus along the dorsal‐ventral axis based on glutamatergic, GABAergic and catecholaminergic receptor densities</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/hipo.23262?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In rodents, gene‐expression, neuronal tuning, connectivity and neurogenesis studies have postulated that the dorsal, the intermediate and the ventral hippocampal formation (HF) are distinct entities. These findings are underpinned by behavioral studies showing a dissociable role of dorsal and ventral HF in learning, memory, stress and emotional processing. However, up to now, the molecular basis of such differences in relation to discrete boundaries is largely unknown. Therefore, we analyzed binding site densities for glutamatergic AMPA, NMDA, kainate and mGluR&lt;sub&gt;2/3&lt;/sub&gt;, GABAergic GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; (including benzodiazepine binding sites), GABA&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;, dopaminergic D&lt;sub&gt;1/5&lt;/sub&gt; and noradrenergic α&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and α&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; receptors as key modulators for signal transmission in hippocampal functions, using quantitative in vitro receptor autoradiography along the dorsal‐ventral axis of the mouse HF. Beside general different receptor profiles of the dentate gyrus (DG) and Cornu Ammonis fields (CA1, CA2, CA3, CA4/hilus), we detected substantial differences between dorsal, intermediate and ventral subdivisions and individual layers for all investigated receptor types, except GABA&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;. For example, striking higher densities of α&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; receptors were detected in the ventral DG, while the dorsal DG possesses higher numbers of kainate, NMDA, GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; and D&lt;sub&gt;1/5&lt;/sub&gt; receptors. CA1 dorsal and intermediate subdivisions showed higher AMPA, NMDA, mGluR&lt;sub&gt;2/3&lt;/sub&gt;, GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;, D&lt;sub&gt;1/5&lt;/sub&gt; receptors, while kainate receptors are higher expressed in ventral CA1, and noradrenergic α&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and α&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; receptors in the intermediate region of CA1. CA2 dorsal was distinguished by higher kainate, α&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and α&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; receptors in the intermediate region, while CA3 showed a more complex dissociation. Our findings resulted not only in a clear segmentation of the mouse hippocampus along the dorsal‐ventral axis, but also provides insights into the neurochemical basis and likely associated physiological processes in hippocampal functions. Therein, the presented data has a high impact for future studies modeling and investigating dorsal, intermediate and ventral hippocampal dysfunction in relation to neurodegenerative diseases or psychiatric disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: PIK3R2/Pik3r2 Activating Mutations Result in Brain Overgrowth and EEG Changes</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25890?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mutations in phosphatidylinositol‐4,5‐bisphosphate 3‐kinase (PI3K) complex have been associated with a broad spectrum of brain and organ overgrowth syndromes. For example, mutations in phosphatidylinositol‐3‐kinase regulatory subunit 2 (&lt;i&gt;PIK3R2&lt;/i&gt;) have been identified in human patients with megalencephaly polymicrogyria polydactyly hydrocephalus (MPPH) syndrome, which includes brain overgrowth. To better understand the pathogenesis of &lt;i&gt;PIK3R2&lt;/i&gt;‐related mutations, we have developed and characterized a murine model.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We generated a knock‐in mouse model for the most common human &lt;i&gt;PIK3R2&lt;/i&gt; mutation, p.G373R (p.G367R in mice) using CRISPR/Cas9. The mouse phenotypes, including brain size, seizure activity, cortical lamination, cell proliferation/size/density, interneuron migration, and PI3K pathway activation, were analyzed using standard methodologies. For human patients with &lt;i&gt;PIK3R2&lt;/i&gt; mutations, clinical data (occipitofrontal circumference [OFC] and epilepsy) were retrospectively obtained from our clinical records (published / unpublished).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The PI3K‐AKT pathway was hyperactivated in these mice, confirming the p.G367R mutation is an activating mutation in vivo. Similar to human patients with &lt;i&gt;PIK3R2&lt;/i&gt; mutations, these mice have enlarged brains. We found cell size to be increased but not cell numbers. The embryonic brain showed mild defects in cortical lamination, although not observed in the mature brain. Furthermore, electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings from mutant mice showed background slowing and rare seizures, again similar to our observations in human patients.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have generated a &lt;i&gt;PIK3R2&lt;/i&gt; mouse model that exhibits megalencephaly and EEG changes, both of which overlap with human patients. Our data provide novel insight into the pathogenesis of the human disease caused by PIK3R2 p.G373R mutation. We anticipate this model will be valuable in testing therapeutic options for human patients with MPPH. ANN NEUROL 2020&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;img alt=&quot;Developmental distribution of primary cilia in the retinofugal visual pathway&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/2f94e0fb-4596-49d0-a46a-54650ff312d0/cne25029-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this study, we show that both the number of primary cilia and the number of ciliated neurons declines with age in major retinorecipient targets. Our data suggests that the maturation timing of neuronal and non‐neural cilia differs with maturation of neuronal cilia occurring over a longer postnatal period.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mammalian visual system is composed of circuitry connecting sensory input from the retina to the processing core of the visual cortex. The two main retinorecipient brain targets, the superior colliculus (SC) and dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN), bridge retinal input and visual output. The primary cilium is a conserved organelle increasingly viewed as a critical sensor for the regulation of developmental and homeostatic pathways in most mammalian cell types. Moreover, cilia have been described as crucial for neurogenesis, neuronal maturation, and survival in the cortex and retina. However, cilia in the visual relay center remain to be fully described. In this study, we characterized the ciliation profile of the SC and dLGN and found that the overall number of ciliated cells declined during development. Interestingly, shorter ciliated cells in both regions were identified as neurons, whose numbers remained stable over time, suggesting that cilia retention is a critical feature for optimal neuronal function in SC and dLGN. Our study suggests that primary cilia are important for neuronal maturation and function in cells of the SC and dLGN.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: Remodeling of projections from ventral hippocampus to prefrontal cortex in Alzheimer's mice</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/cne.25032?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;img alt=&quot;Remodeling of projections from ventral hippocampus to prefrontal cortex in Alzheimer's mice&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/2418eb20-0077-4d2f-965d-12a90c91b504/cne25032-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Axon terminal branches, originating from the ventral hippocampus and distributed in the prefrontal cortex, undergo more frequent bifurcation but bear less numerous varicosities, which are putative synaptic sites, in Alzheimer's than wild‐type mice. This projection appears to be more widely spread, with scantier synapses, and therefore diluted in Alzheimer's mice.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Emotional dysregulation often accompanies cognitive deficits in Alzheimer's disease (AD). The hippocampus, most notably damaged by AD pathology, is classified into the cognition‐bound posterior and emotion‐bound anterior hippocampi. Since the anterior hippocampus or its rodent counterpart, the ventral hippocampus (VH), sends dense afferents to the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and the basolateral amygdala (BLA), the two structures implicated in fear responses, we investigated whether these afferents are modified in 3xTg AD model mice. An anterograde dextrin tracer injected into VH revealed that axons in PFC were more ramified in 3xTg than wild‐type (WT) mice, with the synaptic density reduced. The VH projections to BLA were not affected. Intracellular accumulation of amyloid β (Aβ) or Aβ‐like immunoreactivity was found in PFC and BLA neurons alike. Behaviorally, in the 2‐way active avoidance test, the frequency of chamber change was higher, with the test performance better, in 3xTg than WT mice, suggesting a distorted contextual fear in the 3xTg group. Given the essential involvement of parts of PFC in contextual fear responses and that of BLA in fear responses in general, the observed remodeling of VH‐to‐PFC afferents and the accumulation of intracellular Aβ in BLA and PFC pyramidal cells might exercise critical influences on enhanced avoidance behavior in 3xTg mice.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;img alt=&quot;Sympathetic innervation of inguinal white adipose tissue in the mouse&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/730a09cc-d99e-4a3f-b372-29829ff62c56/cne25031-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Preganglionic and postganglionic sympathetic inguinal white adipose tissue (iWAT) inputs are anatomically distinct from interscapular brown adipose tissue.
Dorsolumbar and inguinal iWAT portions are innervated by anatomically distinct sympathetic nerves.
Sympathetic postganglionic iWAT innervation reaches its target organ via lateral cutaneous rami of intercostal nerves T11–L1 and anterior cutaneous femoral nerve (as part of the lumbar plexus, L1)
White adipocytes are sparsely innervated (sparse varicosities), while brown adipocytes (beige islands) show dense innervation (dense varicosities) in iWAT.



&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adipose tissue plays an important role in metabolic homeostasis and its prominent role as endocrine organ is now well recognized. Adipose tissue is controlled via the sympathetic nervous system (SNS). New viral, molecular‐genetic tools will soon allow a more detailed study of adipose tissue innervation in metabolic function, yet, the precise anatomical extent of preganglionic and postganglionic inputs to the inguinal white adipose tissue (iWAT) is limited. Furthermore, several viral, molecular‐genetic tools will require the use of cre/loxP mouse models, while the available studies on sympathetic iWAT innervation were established in larger species. In this study, we generated a detailed map for the sympathetic innervation of iWAT in male and female mice. We adapted iDISCO tissue clearing to process large, whole‐body specimens for an unprecedented view of the natural abdominal SNS. Combined with pseudorabies virus retrograde tracing from the iWAT, we defined the preganglionic and postganglionic sympathetic input to iWAT. We used fluorescence‐guided anatomical dissections of sympathetic nerves in reporter mice to further clarify that postganglionic axons connect to iWAT via lateral cutaneous rami (dorsolumbar iWAT portion) and the lumbar plexus (inguinal iWAT portion). Importantly, these rami carry axons that branch to iWAT, as well as axons that travel further to innervate the skin and vasculature, and their functional impact will require consideration in denervation studies. Our study may serve as a comprehensive map for future experiments that employ virally driven neuromodulation techniques to predict anatomy‐based viral labeling.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to the discovery of Rett Syndrome (RTT) genetic mutations, animal models have been developed. Sleep research in RTT animal models may unravel novel neural mechanisms for this severe neurodevelopmental heritable rare disease. In this systematic literature review we summarize the findings on sleep research of 13 studies in animal models of RTT. We found disturbed efficacy and continuity of sleep in all genetically mutated models of mice, cynomolgus monkeys, and &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt;. Models presented highly fragmented sleep with distinct differences in 24‐hr sleep/wake cyclicity and circadian arrhythmicity. Overall, animal models mimic sleep complaints reported in individuals with RTT. However, contrary to human studies, in mutant mice, attenuated sleep delta waves, and sleep apneas in non‐rapid eye movement sleep were reported. Future studies may focus on sleep structure and EEG alterations, potential central mechanisms involved in sleep fragmentation and the occurrence of sleep apnea across different sleep stages. Given that locomotor dysfunction is characteristic of individuals with RTT, studies may consider to integrate its potential impact on the behavioral analysis of sleep.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Parvalbumin-Deficiency Accelerates the Age-Dependent ROS Production in Pvalb Neurons in vivo: Link to Neurodevelopmental Disorders</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.571216</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) including autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and schizophrenia, impairment/malfunctioning of a subpopulation of interneurons expressing the calcium-binding protein parvalbumin (PV) –here termed Pvalb neurons– has gradually emerged as a possible cause. These neurons may represent a hub or point-of-convergence in the etiology of NDD. Increased oxidative stress associated with mitochondria impairment in Pvalb neurons is discussed as an essential step in schizophrenia etiology. Since PV downregulation is a common finding in ASD and schizophrenia individuals and PV-deficient (PV−/−) mice show a strong ASD-like behavior phenotype, we investigated the putative link between PV expression, alterations in mitochondria and oxidative stress. In a longitudinal study with 1, 3, and 6-months old PV−/− and wild type mice, oxidative stress was investigated in 9 Pvalb neuron subpopulations in the hippocampus, striatum, somatosensory cortex, medial prefrontal cortex, thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN) and cerebellum. In Pvalb neuron somata in the striatum and TRN, we additionally determined mitochondria volume and distribution at these three time points. In all Pvalb neuron subpopulations, we observed an age-dependent increase in oxidative stress and the increase strongly correlated with PV expression levels, but not with mitochondria density in these Pvalb neurons. Moreover, oxidative stress was elevated in Pvalb neurons of PV−/− mice and the magnitude of the effect was again correlated with PV expression levels in the corresponding wild type Pvalb neuron subpopulations. The PV-dependent effect was insignificant at 1 month and relative differences between WT and PV−/− Pvalb neurons were largest at 3 months. Besides the increase in mitochondria volume in PV’s absence in TRN and striatal PV−/− Pvalb neurons fully present already at 1 month, we observed a redistribution of mitochondria from the perinuclear region toward the plasma membrane at all time points. We suggest that in absence of PV, slow Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; buffering normally exerted by PV is compensated by a (mal)adaptive, mostly sub-plasmalemmal increase in mitochondria resulting in increased oxidative stress observed in 3- and 6-months old mice. Since PV−/− mice display core ASD-like symptoms already at 1 month, oxidative stress in Pvalb neurons is not a likely cause for their ASD-related behavior observed at this age.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: Direct translation of climbing fiber burst-mediated sensory coding into post-synaptic Purkinje cell dendritic calcium</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/61593</link>
	<content:encoded>Climbing fibers (CFs) generate complex spikes (CS) and Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; transients in cerebellar Purkinje cells (PCs), serving as instructive signals. The so-called 'all-or-none' character of CSs has been questioned since the CF burst was described. Although recent studies have indicated a sensory-driven enhancement of PC Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; signals, how CF responds to sensory events and contributes to PC dendritic Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and CS remains unexplored. Here, single or simultaneous Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; imaging of CFs and PCs in awake mice revealed the presynaptic CF Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; amplitude encoded the sensory input's strength and directly influenced post-synaptic PC dendritic Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+ &lt;/sup&gt;amplitude. The sensory-driven variability in CF Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; amplitude depended on the number of spikes in the CF burst. Finally, the spike number of the CF burst determined the PC Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; influx and CS properties. These results reveal the direct translation of sensory information-coding CF inputs into PC Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, suggesting the sophisticated role of CFs as error signals.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: Characterization of the mechanism by which the RB/E2F pathway controls expression of the cancer genomic DNA deaminase APOBEC3B</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/61287</link>
	<content:encoded>APOBEC3B (A3B)-catalyzed DNA cytosine deamination contributes to the overall mutational landscape in breast cancer. Molecular mechanisms responsible for &lt;i&gt;A3B&lt;/i&gt; upregulation in cancer are poorly understood. Here, we show that a single E2F cis-element mediates repression in normal cells and that expression is activated by its mutational disruption in a reporter construct or the endogenous &lt;i&gt;A3B&lt;/i&gt; gene. The same E2F site is required for &lt;i&gt;A3B&lt;/i&gt; induction by polyomavirus T antigen indicating a shared molecular mechanism. Proteomic and biochemical experiments demonstrate binding of wildtype but not mutant E2F promoters by repressive PRC1.6/E2F6 and DREAM/E2F4 complexes. Knockdown and overexpression studies confirm involvement of these repressive complexes in regulating A3B expression. Altogether, these studies demonstrate that &lt;i&gt;A3B&lt;/i&gt; expression is suppressed in normal cells by repressive E2F complexes and that viral or mutational disruption of this regulatory network triggers overexpression in breast cancer and provides fuel for tumor evolution.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: Defining the function of OmpA in the Rcs stress response</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/60861</link>
	<content:encoded>OmpA, a protein commonly found in the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria, has served as a paradigm for the study of b-barrel proteins for several decades. In &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt;, OmpA was previously reported to form complexes with RcsF, a surface-exposed lipoprotein that triggers the Rcs stress response when damage occurs in the outer membrane and the peptidoglycan. How OmpA interacts with RcsF and whether this interaction allows RcsF to reach the surface has remained unclear. Here, we integrated &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; approaches to establish that RcsF interacts with the C-terminal, periplasmic domain of OmpA, not with the N-terminal b-barrel, thus implying that RcsF does not reach the bacterial surface &lt;i&gt;via&lt;/i&gt; OmpA. Our results suggest a novel function for OmpA in the cell envelope: OmpA competes with the inner membrane protein IgaA, the downstream Rcs component, for RcsF binding across the periplasm, thereby regulating the Rcs response.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: Phosphatidylcholines from Pieris brassicae eggs activate an immune response in Arabidopsis</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/60293</link>
	<content:encoded>Recognition of conserved microbial molecules activates immune responses in plants, a process termed pattern-triggered immunity (PTI). Similarly, insect eggs trigger defenses that impede egg development or attract predators, but information on the nature of egg-associated elicitors is scarce. We performed an unbiased bioactivity-guided fractionation of eggs of the butterfly &lt;i&gt;Pieris brassicae&lt;/i&gt;. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and mass spectrometry of active fractions led to the identification of phosphatidylcholines (PCs). PCs are released from insect eggs, and they induce salicylic acid and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; accumulation, defense gene expression and cell death in &lt;i&gt;Arabidopsis&lt;/i&gt;, all of which constitute a hallmark of PTI. Active PCs contain primarily C16 to C18-fatty acyl chains with various levels of desaturation, suggesting a relatively broad ligand specificity of cell-surface receptor(s). The finding of PCs as egg-associated molecular patterns (EAMPs) illustrates the acute ability of plants to detect conserved immunogenic patterns from their enemies, even from seemingly passive structures such as eggs.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;img alt=&quot;The effects of internal jugular vein compression for modulating and preserving white matter following a season of American tackle football: A prospective longitudinal evaluation of differential head impact exposure&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/4b47412f-b661-47a7-a430-5f5ff80eb20e/jnr24727-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Internal jugular vein compression, by means of an externally worn neck collar (right side of image), is a potentially viable solution to intervene on the diffusion and anisotropic properties of white matter that change following a season of American tackle football. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The purpose of this clinical trial was to examine whether internal jugular vein compression (JVC)—using an externally worn neck collar—modulated the relationships between differential head impact exposure levels and pre‐ to postseason changes in diffusion tensor imaging (DTI)‐derived diffusivity and anisotropy metrics of white matter following a season of American tackle football. Male high‐school athletes (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 284) were prospectively assigned to a non‐collar group or a collar group. Magnetic resonance imaging data were collected from participants pre‐ and postseason and head impact exposure was monitored by accelerometers during every practice and game throughout the competitive season. Athletes' accumulated head impact exposure was systematically thresholded based on the frequency of impacts of progressively higher magnitudes (10 g intervals between 20 to 150 g) and modeled with pre‐ to postseason changes in DTI measures of white matter as a function of JVC neck collar wear. The findings revealed that the JVC neck collar modulated the relationships between greater high‐magnitude head impact exposure (110 to 140 g) and longitudinal changes to white matter, with each group showing associations that varied in directionality. Results also revealed that the JVC neck collar group partially preserved longitudinal changes in DTI metrics. Collectively, these data indicate that a JVC neck collar can provide a mechanistic response to the diffusion and anisotropic properties of brain white matter following the highly diverse exposure to repetitive head impacts in American tackle football.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Circulating lipoprotein lipids, apolipoproteins and ischemic stroke</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25916?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We conducted a Mendelian randomization study to disentangle the comparative effects of lipids and apolipoprotein on ischemic stroke.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Single‐nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with low‐ and high‐density lipoprotein (LDL and HDL) cholesterol, triglycerides and apolipoprotein A‐I and B (apoA‐I and apoB) at the level of genome‐wide significance (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;5×10&lt;sup&gt;‐8&lt;/sup&gt;) in the UK Biobank were used as instrumental variables. Summary‐level data for ischemic stroke and its subtypes were obtained from the MEGASTROKE consortium with 514 791 individuals (60 341 ischemic stroke cases and 454 450 non‐cases).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Increased levels of apoB, LDL cholesterol and triglycerides were associated with higher risk of any ischemic stroke, large artery stroke and small vessel stroke in the main and sensitivity univariable MR analyses. In multivariable MR analysis including apoB, LDL cholesterol and triglycerides in the same model, apoB retained a robust effect (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;lt;0.05), whereas the estimate for LDL cholesterol was reversed and that for triglycerides largely attenuated. Decreased levels of apoA‐I and HDL cholesterol were robustly associated with increased risk of any ischemic stroke, large artery stroke and small vessel stroke in all univariable MR analyses, but the association for apoA‐I was attenuated to the null after mutual adjustment.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The present MR study reveals that apoB is the predominant trait that accounts for the etiological basis of apoB, LDL cholesterol and triglycerides in relation to ischemic stroke, in particular large artery and small vessel stroke. Whether HDL cholesterol exerts a protective effect on ischemic stroke independent of apoA‐I needs further investigation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The present study compares age‐related difference in corpus callosum morphology of chimpanzees and humans across the adult lifespan utilizing measures of total midsagittal area and regional thickness. We find that the chimpanzee compared to the human aging trajectory is characterized by a slower increase from adolescence to middle adulthood, as well as by a lack of substantial decline from middle to old adulthood. Thus, callosal atrophy in old age is not a universal characteristic of the aging brain, but rather appears to be human‐specific phenomenon of aging.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The human corpus callosum exhibits substantial atrophy in old age, which is stronger than what would be predicted from parallel changes in overall brain anatomy. To date, however, it has not been conclusively established whether this accentuated decline represents a common feature of brain aging across species, or whether it is a specific characteristic of the aging human brain. In the present cross‐sectional study, we address this question by comparing age‐related difference in corpus callosum morphology of chimpanzees and humans. For this purpose, we measured total midsagittal area and regional thickness of the corpus callosum from T1‐weighted MRI data from 213 chimpanzees, aged between 9 and 54 years. The results were compared with data drawn from a large‐scale human sample which was age‐range matched using two strategies: (a) matching by chronological age (human sample size: &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 562), or (b) matching by accounting for differences in longevity and various maturational events between the species (i.e., adjusted human age range: 13.6 to 80.9 years; &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 664). Using generalized additive modeling to fit and compare aging trajectories, we found significant differences between the two species. The chimpanzee aging trajectory compared with the human trajectory was characterized by a slower increase from adolescence to middle adulthood, and by a lack of substantial decline from middle to old adulthood, which, however, was present in humans. Thus, the accentuated decline of the corpus callosum found in aging humans is not a universal characteristic of the aging brain, and appears to be human‐specific.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Short-term depression and long-term plasticity together tune sensitive range of synaptic plasticity</title>

Synaptic efficacy is subjected to activity-dependent changes on short- and long time scales. While short-term changes decay over minutes, long-term modifications last from hours up to a life-time and are thought to constitute the basis of learning and memory. Both plasticity mechanisms have been studied extensively but how their interaction shapes synaptic dynamics is little known. To investigate how both short- and long-term plasticity together control the induction of synaptic depression and potentiation, we used numerical simulations and mathematical analysis of a calcium-based model, where pre- and postsynaptic activity induces calcium transients driving synaptic long-term plasticity. We found that the model implementing known synaptic short-term dynamics in the calcium transients can be successfully fitted to long-term plasticity data obtained in visual- and somatosensory cortex. Interestingly, the impact of spike-timing and firing rate changes on plasticity occurs in the prevalent firing rate range, which is different in both cortical areas considered here. Our findings suggest that short- and long-term plasticity are together tuned to adapt plasticity to area-specific activity statistics such as firing rates.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Cf187X4zeHs&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Novel studies conducting cardiac safety assessment using human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) are promising but might be limited by their specificity and predictivity. It is often challenging to correctly classify ion channel blockers or to sufficiently predict the risk for Torsade de Pointes (TdP). In this study, we developed a method combining &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;in silico&lt;/i&gt; experiments to improve machine learning approaches in delivering fast and reliable prediction of drug-induced ion-channel blockade and proarrhythmic behaviour. The algorithm is based on the construction of a dictionary and a greedy optimization, leading to the definition of optimal classifiers. Finally, we present a numerical tool that can accurately predict compound-induced pro-arrhythmic risk and involvement of sodium, calcium and potassium channels, based on hiPSC-CM field potential data.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/OvvhAnsghl8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Spatial repellents (SRs) reduce human-mosquito contact by preventing mosquito entrance into human-occupied spaces and interfering with host-seeking and blood-feeding. A new model to synthesize experimental data on the effects of transfluthrin on &lt;i&gt;Aedes aegypti&lt;/i&gt; explores how SR effects interact to impact the epidemiology of diseases vectored by these mosquitoes. Our results indicate that the greatest impact on force of infection is expected to derive from the chemical’s lethal effect but delayed biting and the negative effect this may have on the mosquito population could elicit substantial impact in the absence of lethality. The relative contributions of these effects depend on coverage, chemical dose, and housing density. We also demonstrate that, through an increase in the number of potentially mosquito bites, increased partial blood-feeding and reduced exiting may elicit adverse impacts, which could offset gains achieved by other effects. Our analysis demonstrates how small-scale experimental data can be leveraged to derive expectations of epidemiological impact of SRs deployed at larger scales.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/doCS5w31lAk&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

&lt;p&gt;We comprehensively characterized 5‐HT‐immunoreactive (‐ir) innervation throughout the brain of &lt;i&gt;Porichthys notatus&lt;/i&gt;, plainfin midshipman fish, including well‐delineated vocal and auditory nuclei. We report neuroanatomical heterogeneity in populations of the serotonergic raphe nuclei of the brainstem reticular formation, with three discrete subregions in the superior raphe, an intermediate 5‐HT‐ir cell cluster, and an extensive inferior raphe population.

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Serotonin (5‐HT) is a modulator of neural circuitry underlying motor patterning, homeostatic control, and social behavior. While previous studies have described 5‐HT distribution in various teleosts, serotonergic raphe subgroups in fish are not well defined and therefore remain problematic for cross‐species comparisons. Here we used the plainfin midshipman fish, &lt;i&gt;Porichthys notatus&lt;/i&gt;, a well‐studied model for investigating the neural and hormonal mechanisms of vertebrate vocal‐acoustic communication, to redefine raphe subgroups based on both stringent neuroanatomical landmarks as well as quantitative cell measurements. In addition, we comprehensively characterized 5‐HT‐immunoreactive (‐ir) innervation throughout the brain, including well‐delineated vocal and auditory nuclei. We report neuroanatomical heterogeneity in populations of the serotonergic raphe nuclei of the brainstem reticular formation, with three discrete subregions in the superior raphe, an intermediate 5‐HT‐ir cell cluster, and an extensive inferior raphe population. 5‐HT‐ir neurons were also observed within the vocal motor nucleus (VMN), forming putative contacts on those cells. In addition, three major 5‐HT‐ir cell groups were identified in the hypothalamus and one group in the pretectum. Significant 5‐HT‐ir innervation was found in components of the vocal pattern generator and cranial motor nuclei. All vocal midbrain nuclei showed considerable 5‐HT‐ir innervation, as did thalamic and hindbrain auditory and lateral line areas and vocal‐acoustic integration sites in the preoptic area and ventral telencephalon. This comprehensive atlas offers new insights into the organization of 5‐HT nuclei in teleosts and provides neuroanatomical evidence for serotonin as a modulator of vocal‐acoustic circuitry and behavior in midshipman fish, consistent with findings in vocal tetrapods.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

&lt;p&gt;The front legs in whip spiders are modified into very long feelers (antenniform legs) equipped with sensory structures, including tens of thousands olfactory receptor neurons. Olfactory afferents terminate on hundreds of primary olfactory glomeruli in the first leg neuromere. Projection neurons relay this information to secondary olfactory glomeruli in the brain’s exceptionally large mushroom bodies. The mushroom bodies also comprise thousands of considerably smaller glomeruli that receive visual information. Mushroom bodies are supposed to underlie the whip spiders’ advanced multimodal navigation abilities.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whip spiders (Amblypygi) are known for their nocturnal navigational abilities, which rely on chemosensory and tactile cues and, to a lesser degree, on vision. Unlike true spiders, the first pair of legs in whip spiders is modified into extraordinarily long sensory organs (antenniform legs) covered with thousands of mechanosensory, olfactory and gustatory sensilla. Olfactory neurons send their axons through the leg nerve into the corresponding neuromere of the central nervous system, where they terminate on a particularly large number (about 460) of primary olfactory glomeruli, suggesting an advanced sense of smell. From the primary glomeruli, olfactory projection neurons ascend to the brain and terminate in the mushroom body calyx on a set of secondary olfactory glomeruli, a feature that is not known from olfactory pathways of other animals. Another part of the calyx receives visual input from the secondary visual neuropil (the medulla). This calyx region is composed of much smaller glomeruli (‘microglomeruli’). The bimodal input and the exceptional size of their mushroom bodies may support the navigational capabilities of whip spiders. In addition to input to the mushroom body, we describe other general anatomical features of the whip spiders’ central nervous system.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Annals of Neurology: CAG repeat size influences the progression rate of spinocerebellar ataxia type 3</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25919?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In spinocerebellar ataxia type 3/Machado‐Joseph disease (SCA3/MJD), the expanded CAG repeat in &lt;i&gt;ATXN3&lt;/i&gt; is the causal mutation, and its length is the main factor in determining the age at onset (AO) of clinical symptoms. However, the contribution of the expanded CAG repeat length to the rate of disease progression after onset has remained a matter of debate, even though an understanding of this factor is crucial for experimental data on disease modifiers and their translation to clinical trials and their design.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;82 Dutch SCA3/MJD patients were evaluated annually for 15 years using the International Cooperative Ataxia Rating Scale (ICARS). Using linear growth curve models, ICARS progression rates were calculated and tested for their relation to the length of the CAG repeat expansion and to the residual AO (RAO): the difference between the observed AO and the AO predicted on the basis of the CAG repeat length.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On average, ICARS scores increased 2·57 points/year of disease. The length of the CAG repeat was positively correlated with a more rapid ICARS progression, explaining 30% of the differences between patients. Combining both the length of the CAG repeat and RAO as co‐modifiers explained up to 47% of the inter‐patient variation in ICARS progression.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our data imply that the length of the expanded CAG repeat in &lt;i&gt;ATXN3&lt;/i&gt; is a major determinant of clinical decline, which suggests that CAG‐dependent molecular mechanisms similar to those responsible for disease onset also contribute to the rate of disease progression in SCA3/MJD.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Plasma NT1 Tau is a Specific and Early Marker of Alzheimer's Disease</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25885?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is an urgent need for sensitive, widely available, blood‐based screening tests to identify presymptomatic individuals destined to develop Alzheimer's disease (AD). We investigated whether tau detected in plasma by our in‐house NT1 assay is specifically altered in AD, and when applied to patients with subjective cognitive decline (SCD) or mild cognitive impairment (MCI) can serve to predict progression to AD dementia. The predictive value of NT1 versus tau measured using assays from Quanterix and Roche, and the specificity of NT1 for AD versus a nonspecific marker of neurodegeneration (neurofilament light [NfL]) were also examined.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NT1 tau and NfL were measured in plasma from prospectively followed patients with SCD or MCI who remained cognitively stable, converted to AD dementia, or converted to non‐AD dementias, and in cognitively unimpaired participants. Tau was measured using Quanterix and Roche assays in baseline subjects with SCD and MCI.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plasma NT1 tau was specifically elevated in AD, but not in non‐AD dementia compared with controls, whereas NfL was increased in both AD and non‐AD dementias. Baseline specimens from individuals who had SCD or MCI revealed that NT1 tau, but not tau measured using Quanterix or Roche assays, is elevated in subjects who progress to AD dementia. As expected, baseline plasma NfL is elevated in those who progress to AD and non‐AD dementias.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plasma NT1 tau is a specific marker of AD, which is elevated early in disease and may prove useful as a first round screen to identify individuals at risk of developing AD. ANN NEUROL 2020&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;img alt=&quot;Topographic gradients define the projection patterns of the claustrum core and shell in mice&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/3f6e0001-977b-4851-a4b5-72b07dd8e288/cne25043-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Claustrocortical projections are organized across the dorsoventral axis and map onto the rostrocaudal axis of the cortex. Interneuron subtypes are differentially localized to the core and shell of the claustrum. The lines linking claustrum and cortex highlight some of the most numerous and divergent claustrocortical pathways identified in this study.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The claustrum is densely connected to the cortex and participates in brain functions such as attention and sleep. Although some studies have reported the widely divergent organization of claustrum projections, others describe parallel claustrocortical connections to different cortical regions. Therefore, the details underlying how claustrum neurons broadcast information to cortical networks remain incompletely understood. Using multicolor retrograde tracing we determined the density, topography, and co‐projection pattern of fourteen claustrocortical pathways, in mice. We spatially registered these pathways to a common coordinate space and found that the claustrocortical system is topographically organized as a series of overlapping spatial modules, continuously distributed across the dorsoventral claustrum axis. The claustrum core projects predominantly to frontal‐midline cortical regions, whereas the dorsal and ventral shell project to the cortical motor system and temporal lobe, respectively. Anatomically connected cortical regions receive common input from a subset of claustrum neurons shared by neighboring modules, whereas spatially separated regions of cortex are innervated by different claustrum modules. Therefore, each output module exhibits a unique position within the claustrum and overlaps substantially with other modules projecting to functionally related cortical regions. Claustrum inhibitory cells containing parvalbumin, somatostatin, and neuropeptide Y also show unique topographical distributions, suggesting different output modules are controlled by distinct inhibitory circuit motifs. The topographic organization of excitatory and inhibitory cell types may enable parallel claustrum outputs to independently coordinate distinct cortical networks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rats and marmosets were injected with pentylenetetrazol and euthanized at different time points after stimulus. Immunohistochemical detection of c‐Fos was quantified using stereological cell counting in eight neocortical regions. Our results showed that the marmoset brain has a greater neuronal activation after intense stimulation by means of pentylenetetrazol and a more complex pattern of brain activation. We speculate that these functional differences may contribute for the understanding of the different neuronal processing capacities of the neocortex in these mammals’ orders.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previous evidence indicated a potential mechanism that might support the fact that primates exhibit greater neural integration capacity as a result of the activation of different structures of the central nervous system, as compared to rodents. The current study aimed to provide further evidence to confirm previous findings by analyzing the patterns of c‐Fos expression in more neocortical structures of rats and marmosets using a more robust quantitative technique and evaluating a larger number of brain areas. Nineteen Wistar rats and 21 marmosets (&lt;i&gt;Callithrix jacchus&lt;/i&gt;) were distributed among control groups (animals without injections) and animals injected with pentylenetetrazol (PTZ) and euthanized at different time points after stimulus. Immunohistochemical detection of c‐Fos was quantified using unbiased and efficient stereological cell counting in eight neocortical regions. Results: Marmosets had a c‐Fos expression that was notably more widely expressed (5x more cells) and longer lasting (up to 3 hours) than rats. c‐Fos expression in rats presented similar patterns of expression according to the function of the brain cortical structures (associative, sensorial and motor functions), which was not observed for marmosets (in which no clear pattern could be drawn, and a more diverse profile emerged). Our results provide evidence that the marmoset brain has a greater neuronal activation after intense stimulation by means of PTZ and a more complex pattern of brain activation. We speculate that these functional differences may contribute for the understanding of the different neuronal processing capacities of the neocortex in these mammals’ orders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mammalian brain can adapt to life experiences and reorganize its functional network to learn a new task. In our study we were able to detect and characterize rs‐fMRI signals from alert rabbits to track the functional reorganization of the neural networks that mediate acquisition and retention of eyeblink conditioning.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Animal imaging studies have the potential to further establish resting‐state fMRI (rs‐fMRI) and enable its validation for clinical use. The rabbit subjects used in this work are an ideal model system for studying learning and behavior and are also an excellent established test subject for awake scanning given their natural tolerance for restraint.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;We found that analysis of rs‐fMRI conducted on a cohort of rabbits undergoing eyeblink conditioning can reveal functional brain connectivity changes associated with learning, and that rs‐fMRI can be used to capture differences between subjects with different levels of cognitive performance.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;rs‐fMRI sessions were conducted on a cohort of rabbits before and after trace eyeblink conditioning. MRI results were analyzed using independent component analysis (ICA) and network analysis. Behavioral data were collected with standard methods using an infrared reflective sensor aimed at the cornea to detect blinks. Behavioral results were analyzed, and a median split was used to create two groups of rabbits based on their performance.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The cohort of rabbits undergoing eyeblink conditioning exhibited increased functional connectivity in&lt;/i&gt; cingulate cortex, retrosplenial cortex and thalamus &lt;i&gt;consistent with brain reorganization associated with increased learning. Differences in the striatum and right cerebellum were also identified between rabbits in the top or bottom halves of the group as measured by the behavioral assay. Thus, rs‐fMRI can provide not only a tool to detect and monitor functional brain changes associated with learning, but also to discriminate between different levels of cognitive performance.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Primary mechanosensory afferents serve as the first level of signal processing at the somatosensory periphery and provide information about behaviorally relevant stimulus features. Here, we show that the mechanosensory Rohon‐Beard (RB) neurons in larval zebrafish are rapidly adapting cells that can signal stimulus onset and offset and encode stimulus intensity implementing rate and temporal coding mechanisms. We also revealed a rostrocaudal variation in both morphology and physiology within the RB neuron population, which offers insights on what signals RBs carry into central circuits and on their role in locomotor behaviors.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Primary mechanosensory neurons play an important role in converting mechanical forces into the sense of touch. In zebrafish, Rohon‐Beard (RB) neurons serve this role at embryonic and larval stages of development. Here we examine the morphology and physiology of RBs in larval zebrafish to better understand how mechanosensory stimuli are represented along the spinal cord. We report that the morphology of RB neurons differs along the rostrocaudal body axis. Rostral RB neurons arborize in the skin near the cell body whereas caudal cells arborize at a distance posterior to their cell body. Using a novel electrophysiological approach, we also found longitudinal differences in the mechanosensitivity and physiological properties of RB neurons. Rostral RB neurons respond to mechanical stimulations close to the soma and produce up to three spikes with increasing stimulus intensity, whereas caudal cells respond at more distal locations and can produce four or more spikes when the intensity of the mechanical stimulus increases. The mechanosensory properties of RB neurons are consistent with those of rapidly adapting mechanoreceptors and can signal the onset, offset and intensity of mechanical stimulation. This is the first report of the intensity encoding properties of RB neurons, where an increase in spike number and a decrease in spike latency are observed with increasing stimulation intensity. This study reveals an unappreciated complexity of the larval zebrafish mechanosensory system and demonstrates how differences in the morphological and physiological properties of RBs related to their rostrocaudal location can influence the signals that enter the spinal cord.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience: Decreased Evoked Slow-Activity After tDCS in Disorders of Consciousness</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2020.00062</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Due to life-saving medical advances, the diagnosis and treatment of disorders of consciousness (DOC) has become a more commonly occurring clinical issue. One recently developed intervention option has been non-invasive transcranial direct current stimulation. This dichotomy of patient responders may be better understood by investigating the mechanism behind the transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) intervention. The combination of transcranial magnetic stimulation and electroencephalography (TMS-EEG) has been an important diagnostic tool in DOC patients. We therefore examined the neural response using TMS-EEG both before and after tDCS in seven DOC patients (four diagnosed as in a minimally conscious state and three with unresponsive wakefulness syndrome). tDCS was applied over the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, while TMS pulses were applied to the premotor cortex. None of the seven patients showed relevant behavioral change after tDCS. We did, however, find that the overall evoked slow activity was reduced following tDCS intervention. We also found a positive correlation between the strength of the slow activity and the amount of high-frequency suppression. However, there was no significant pre-post tDCS difference in high frequencies. In the resting-state EEG, we observed that both the incidence of slow waves and the positive slope of the wave were affected by tDCS. Taken together, these results suggest that the tDCS intervention can reduce the slow-wave activity component of bistability, but this may not directly affect high-frequency activity. We hypothesize that while reduced slow activity may be necessary for the recovery of neural function, especially consciousness, this alone is insufficient.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Diabetic Polyneuropathy Is Associated With Pathomorphological Changes in Human Dorsal Root Ganglia: A Study Using 3T MR Neurography</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.570744</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Diabetic neuropathy (DPN) is one of the most severe and yet most poorly understood complications of diabetes mellitus. In vivo imaging of dorsal root ganglia (DRG), a key structure for the understanding of DPN, has been restricted to animal studies. These have shown a correlation of decreased DRG volume with neuropathic symptom severity. Our objective was to investigate correlations of DRG morphology and signal characteristics at 3 Tesla (3T) magnetic resonance neurography (MRN) with clinical and serological data in diabetic patients with and without DPN. In this cross-sectional study, participants underwent 3T MRN of both L5 DRG using an isotropic 3D T2-weighted, fat-suppressed sequence with subsequent segmentation of DRG volume and analysis of normalized signal properties. Overall, 55 diabetes patients (66 ± 9 years; 32 men; 30 with DPN) took part in this study. DRG volume was smaller in patients with severe DPN when compared to patients with mild or moderate DPN (134.7 ± 21.86 vs 170.1 ± 49.22; p = 0.040). In DPN patients, DRG volume was negatively correlated with the neuropathy disability score (r = −0.43; 95%CI = −0.66 to −0.14; p = 0.02), a measure of neuropathy severity. DRG volume showed negative correlations with triglycerides (r = −0.40; 95%CI = −0.57 to −0.19; p = 0.006), and LDL cholesterol (r = −0.33; 95%CI = −0.51 to −0.11; p = 0.04). There was a strong positive correlation of normalized MR signal intensity (SI) with the neuropathy symptom score in the subgroup of patients with painful DPN (r = 0.80; 95%CI = 0.46 to 0.93; p = 0.005). DRG SI was positively correlated with HbA1c levels (r = 0.30; 95%CI = 0.09 to 0.50; p = 0.03) and the triglyceride/HDL ratio (r = 0.40; 95%CI = 0.19 to 0.57; p = 0.007). In this first in vivo study, we found DRG morphological degeneration and signal increase in correlation with neuropathy severity. This elucidates the potential importance of MR-based DRG assessments in studying structural and functional changes in DPN.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neural Technology: Comparison of Muscle MEPs From Transcranial Magnetic and Electrical Stimulation and Appearance of Reflexes in Horses</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.570372</link>
	<content:encoded>Introduction&lt;p&gt;Transcranial electrical (TES) and magnetic stimulation (TMS) are both used for assessment of the motor function of the spinal cord in horses. Muscular motor evoked potentials (mMEP) were compared intra-individually for both techniques in five healthy horses. mMEPs were measured twice at increasing stimulation intensity steps over the extensor carpi radialis (ECR), tibialis cranialis (TC), and caninus muscles. Significance was set at p &amp;lt; 0.05. To support the hypothesis that both techniques induce extracranially elicited mMEPs, literature was also reviewed.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Both techniques show the presence of late mMEPs below the transcranial threshold appearing as extracranially elicited startle responses. The occurrence of these late mMEPs is especially important for interpretation of TMS tracings when coil misalignment can have an additional influence. Mean transcranial motor latency times (MLT; synaptic delays included) and conduction velocities (CV) of the ECR and TC were significantly different between both techniques: respectively, 4.2 and 5.5 ms (MLT&lt;sub&gt;TMS&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sub&gt;–&lt;/sub&gt;-MLT&lt;sub&gt;TES&lt;/sub&gt;), and −7.7 and −9.9 m/s (CV&lt;sub&gt;TMS&lt;/sub&gt;-CV&lt;sub&gt;TES&lt;/sub&gt;). TMS and TES show intensity-dependent latency decreases of, respectively, −2.6 (ECR) and −2.7 ms (TC)/30% magnetic intensity and −2.6 (ECR) and −3.2 (TC) ms/30V. When compared to TMS, TES shows the lowest coefficients of variation and highest reproducibility and accuracy for MLTs. This is ascribed to the fact that TES activates a lower number of cascaded interneurons, allows for multipulse stimulation, has an absence of coil repositioning errors, and has less sensitivity for varying degrees of background muscle tonus. Real axonal conduction times and conduction velocities are most closely approximated by TES.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;Both intracranial and extracranial mMEPs inevitably carry characteristics of brainstem reflexes. To avoid false interpretations, transcranial mMEPs can be identified by a stepwise latency shortening of 15–20 ms when exceeding the transcranial motor threshold at increasing stimulation intensities. A ring block around the vertex is advised to reduce interference by extracranial mMEPs. mMEPs reflect the functional integrity of the route along the brainstem nuclei, extrapyramidal motor tracts, propriospinal neurons, and motoneurons. The corticospinal tract appears subordinate in horses. TMS and TES are interchangeable for assessing the functional integrity of motor functions of the spinal cord. However, TES reveals significantly shorter MLTs, higher conduction velocities, and better reproducibility.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis: A Neurodegenerative Motor Neuron Disease With Ocular Involvement</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.566858</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a neurodegenerative disease that causes degeneration of the lower and upper motor neurons and is the most prevalent motor neuron disease. This disease is characterized by muscle weakness, stiffness, and hyperreflexia. Patients survive for a short period from the onset of the disease. Most cases are sporadic, with only 10% of the cases being genetic. Many genes are now known to be involved in familial ALS cases, including some of the sporadic cases. It has also been observed that, in addition to genetic factors, there are numerous molecular mechanisms involved in these pathologies, such as excitotoxicity, mitochondrial disorders, alterations in axonal transport, oxidative stress, accumulation of misfolded proteins, and neuroinflammation. This pathology affects the motor neurons, the spinal cord, the cerebellum, and the brain, but recently, it has been shown that it also affects the visual system. This impact occurs not only at the level of the oculomotor system but also at the retinal level, which is why the retina is being proposed as a possible biomarker of this pathology. The current review discusses the main aspects mentioned above related to ALS, such as the main genes involved, the most important molecular mechanisms that affect this pathology, its ocular involvement, and the possible usefulness of the retina as a biomarker.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Background&lt;p&gt;Moyamoya disease (MMD) is an important cause of stroke in children and young adults in Asia. To date, diagnosis remains challenging due to varying clinical manifestations and unknown pathogenesis. The study aims to identify cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) exosomal microRNAs (exomiRs) that can serve as a novel diagnostic biomarker for diagnosis and assess its clinical applications.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;CSF samples were taken from 31 MMD patients and 31 healthy controls. Initial screening of miRNA expression was performed on samples pooled from MMD patients and controls using microarray and validated using quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). The diagnostic accuracy of the potential exosomal miRNAs was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic curve analyses in an independent patient cohort. The potential pathways regulated by the miRNAs was also determined using bioinformatics analysis.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;The microarray results demonstrated that six exomiRs were dysregulated in the MMD patients compared to the controls. Using qRT-PCR, we validated four of the miRNAs (miR-3679-5p, miR-6165, miR-6760-5p, and miR-574-5p) as a biomarker for MMD diagnosis. The four exomiRs showed enhanced sensitivity (75%) and specificity (93.75%) in terms of differentiating MMD patients from healthy subjects [area under the curve (AUC) = 0.9453]. Pathway enrichment analysis for potential targets of six exomiRs identified proteins involved in cell adhesion and junction formation in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusions&lt;p&gt;We identified a novel and highly sensitive exomiRs signature for MMD detection and explored its potential targets using bioinformatics analysis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.572693</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Background: The pathophysiology of patients with dry eye disease (DED) is associated with abnormal functional connectivity (FC). The present study aims to probe alterations of voxel-wise brain-wide FC in patient with DED at rest in an unbiased way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Method: A total of 20 patients with DED and 23 controls matched by age, sex, and years of education underwent resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging scans. Global-brain FC (GFC) was adopted to analyze the images. Support vector machine (SVM) was utilized to differentiate the patients from the controls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Compared with the controls, patients with DED exhibited decreased GFC in the right cerebellum lobule VIII/inferior semi-lunar lobule and left thalamus that belonged to the cerebello-thalamo-cortical network. The GFC values in the left thalamus were positively correlated to the illness duration (r = 0.589, p = 0.006) in the patients. Decreased GFC values in the left thalamus could be used to discriminate the patients from the controls with optimal accuracy, sensitivity and specificity (88.37, 85.00, and 91.30%).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: Our findings indicate that decreased GFC in the brain regions associated with cerebello-thalamo-cortical network may provide a new insight for understanding the pathological changes of FC in DED. GFC values in the left thalamus may be utilized as a potential biomarker to identify the patients from the controls.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.565772</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;What are the key ingredients that make some persuasive messages resonate with audiences and elicit action, while others fail? Billions of dollars per year are put towards changing human behavior, but it is difficult to know which messages will be the most persuasive in the field. By combining novel neuroimaging techniques and large-scale online data, we examine the role of key health communication variables relevant to motivating action at scale. We exposed a sample of smokers to anti-smoking web-banner messages from a real-world campaign while measuring message-evoked brain response patterns via fMRI, and we also obtained subjective evaluations of each banner. Neural indices were derived based on: (i) message-evoked activity in specific brain regions; and (ii) spatially distributed response patterns, both selected based on prior research and theoretical considerations. Next, we connected the neural and subjective data with an independent, objective outcome of message success, which is the per-banner click-through rate in the real-world campaign. Results show that messages evoking brain responses more similar to signatures of negative emotion and vividness had lower online click-through-rates. This strategy helps to connect and integrate the rapidly growing body of knowledge about brain function with formative research and outcome evaluation of health campaigns, and could ultimately further disease prevention efforts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.549965</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The objective of this study was to evaluate the biomechanical, neural, and functional outcomes during a 10-min treadmill stepping trial before and after two independent interventions with neuromuscular electrical stimulation (ES) in an individual with spinal cord injury (SCI). In this longitudinal study, a 34-year-old male with sensory- and motor-complete SCI (C5/C6) underwent two consecutive interventions: 61 h of supine lower limb ES (ES-alone) followed by 51 h of ES combined with stand training (ST) using an overhead body-weight support (BWS) system (ST + ES). In post ES-alone (unloaded), compared to baseline, the majority (∼60%) of lower extremity muscles decreased their peak surface electromyography (sEMG) amplitude, while in post ST + ES (loaded), compared to post ES-alone, there was a restoration in muscle activation that endured the continuous 10-min stepping. Temporal α-motor neuron activity patterns were observed for the SCI participant. In post ST + ES, there were increases in spinal activity patterns during mid-stance at spinal levels L5–S2 for the right and left limbs. Moreover, in post ES-alone, trunk stability increased with excursions from the midline of the base-of-support (50%) to the left (44.2%; Baseline: 54.2%) and right (66.4%; baseline: 77.5%). The least amount of trunk excursion observed post ST + ES, from midline to left (43%; AB: 22%) and right (64%; AB: 64%). Overall, in post ES-alone, there were gains in trunk independence with a decrease in lower limb muscle activation, whereas in post ST + ES, there were gains in trunk independence and increased muscle activation in both bilateral trunk muscles as well as lower limb muscles during the treadmill stepping paradigm. The results of the study illustrate the importance of loading during the stimulation for neural and mechanical gains.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

However, many computational models of VTA are limited by assuming tissue homogeneity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: We generated a multimodal image-based detailed anatomical (MIDA) computational model with a directional DBS lead (1.5 mm or 0.5 mm vertical electrode spacing) placed with segmented contact 2 at the ventral posterolateral “sensorimotor” region of the GPi. The effect of tissue heterogeneity was examined by replacing the MIDA tissues with a homogeneous tissue of conductance 0.3 S/m. DBS pulses (amplitude: 1 mA, pulse width: 60 μs, frequency: 130 Hz) were used to produce VTAs. The following DBS contact configurations were tested: single-segment monopole (2B-/Case+), two-segment monopole (2A-/2B-/Case+ and 2B-/3B-/Case+), ring monopole (2A-/2B-/2C-/Case+), one-cathode three-anode bipole (2B-/3A+/3B+/3C+), three-cathode three-anode bipole (2A-/2B-/2C-/3A+/3B+/3C+). Additionally, certain vertical configurations were repeated with 2 mA current amplitude.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Using a heterogeneous tissue model affected both the size and shape of the VTA in GPi. Electrodes with both 0.5 mm and 1.5 mm vertical spacing (1 mA) modeling showed that the single segment monopolar VTA was entirely contained within the GPi when the active electrode is placed at the posterolateral “sensorimotor” GPi. Two segments in a same ring and ring settings, however, produced VTAs outside of the GPi border that spread into adjacent white matter pathways, e.g., optic tract and internal capsule. Both stacked monopolar settings and vertical bipolar settings allowed activation of structures dorsal to the GPi in addition to the GPi. Modeling of the stacked monopolar settings with the DBS lead with 0.5 mm vertical electrode spacing further restricted VTAs within the GPi, but the VTA volumes were smaller compared to the equivalent settings of 1.5 mm spacing.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: The Role of Iron, Its Metabolism and Ferroptosis in Traumatic Brain Injury</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.590789</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a structural and physiological disruption of brain function caused by external forces. It is a major cause of death and disability for patients worldwide. TBI includes both primary and secondary impairments. Iron overload and ferroptosis highly involved in the pathophysiological process of secondary brain injury. Ferroptosis is a form of regulatory cell death, as increased iron accumulation in the brain leads to lipid peroxidation, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, mitochondrial dysfunction and neuroinflammatory responses, resulting in cellular and neuronal damage. For this reason, eliminating factors like iron deposition and inhibiting lipid peroxidation may be a promising therapy. Iron chelators can be used to eliminate excess iron and to alleviate some of the clinical manifestations of TBI. In this review we will focus on the mechanisms of iron and ferroptosis involving the manifestations of TBI, broaden our understanding of the use of iron chelators for TBI. Through this review, we were able to better find novel clinical therapeutic directions for further TBI study.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: An Efficient Screen for Cell-Intrinsic Factors Identifies the Chaperonin CCT and Multiple Conserved Mechanisms as Mediating Dendrite Morphogenesis</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.577315</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Dendritic morphology is inextricably linked to neuronal function. Systematic large-scale screens combined with genetic mapping have uncovered several mechanisms underlying dendrite morphogenesis. However, a comprehensive overview of participating molecular mechanisms is still lacking. Here, we conducted an efficient clonal screen using a collection of mapped P-element insertions that were previously shown to cause lethality and eye defects in Drosophila melanogaster. Of 280 mutants, 52 exhibited dendritic defects. Further database analyses, complementation tests, and RNA interference validations verified 40 P-element insertion genes as being responsible for the dendritic defects. Twenty-eight mutants presented severe arbor reduction, and the remainder displayed other abnormalities. The intrinsic regulators encoded by the identified genes participate in multiple conserved mechanisms and pathways, including the protein folding machinery and the chaperonin-containing TCP-1 (CCT) complex that facilitates tubulin folding. Mutant neurons in which expression of CCT4 or CCT5 was depleted exhibited severely retarded dendrite growth. We show that CCT localizes in dendrites and is required for dendritic microtubule organization and tubulin stability, suggesting that CCT-mediated tubulin folding occurs locally within dendrites. Our study also reveals novel mechanisms underlying dendrite morphogenesis. For example, we show that Drosophila Nogo signaling is required for dendrite development and that Mummy and Wech also regulate dendrite morphogenesis, potentially via Dpp- and integrin-independent pathways. Our methodology represents an efficient strategy for identifying intrinsic dendrite regulators, and provides insights into the plethora of molecular mechanisms underlying dendrite morphogenesis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Rod and Cone Coupling Modulates Photopic ERG Responses in the Mouse Retina</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.566712</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Light adaptation changes both the sensitivity and maximum amplitude (R&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;) of the mouse photopic electroretinogram (ERG) b-wave. Using the ERG, we examined how modulation of gap junctional coupling between rod and cones alters the light-adapted ERG. To measure changes, a b-wave light adaptation enhancement factor (LAEF), was defined as the ratio of R&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; after 15 min light adaptation to R&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; recorded at the onset of an adapting light. For wild-type mice (WT), the LAEF averaged 2.64 ± 0.29, however, it was significantly reduced (1.06 ± 0.04) for connexin 36 knock out (Cx36KO) mice, which lack electrical coupling between photoreceptors. Wild type mice intraocularly injected with meclofenamic acid (MFA), a gap junction blocker, also showed a significantly reduced LAEF. Degeneration of rod photoreceptors significantly alters the effects of light adaptation on the photopic ERG response. Rd10 mice at P21, with large portions of their rod photoreceptors present in the retina, exhibited a similar b-wave enhancement as wildtype controls, with a LAEF of 2.55 ± 0.19. However, by P31 with most of their rod photoreceptors degenerated, rd10 mice had a much reduced b-wave enhancement during light-adaptation (LAEF of 1.54 ± 0.12). Flicker ERG responses showed a higher temporal amplitude in mesopic conditions for WT than those of Cx36KO mice, suggesting rod-cone coupling help high-frequency signals to pass from rods to cone pathways in the retina. In conclusion, our study provides a novel method to noninvasively measure the dynamics and modulation by the light adaptation for rod-cone gap junctional coupling in intact eyes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Synaptojanin2 Mutation Causes Progressive High-frequency Hearing Loss in Mice</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.561857</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Progressive hearing loss is very common in the human population but we know little about the underlying molecular mechanisms. Synaptojanin2 (Synj2) has been reported to be involved, as a mouse mutation led to a progressive increase in auditory thresholds with age. Synaptojanin2 is a phosphatidylinositol (PI) phosphatase that removes the five-position phosphates from phosphoinositides, such as PIP&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and PIP&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, and is a key enzyme in clathrin-mediated endocytosis. To investigate the mechanisms underlying progressive hearing loss, we have studied a different mutation of mouse Synj2 to look for any evidence of involvement of vesicle trafficking particularly affecting the synapses of sensory hair cells. Auditory brainstem responses (ABR) developed normally at first but started to decline between 3 and 4 weeks of age in Synj2&lt;sup&gt;tm1b&lt;/sup&gt; mutants. At 6 weeks old, some evidence of outer hair cell (OHC) stereocilia fusion and degeneration was observed, but this was only seen in the extreme basal turn so cannot explain the raised ABR thresholds that correspond to more apical regions of the cochlear duct. We found no evidence of any defect in inner hair cell (IHC) exocytosis or endocytosis using single hair cell recordings, nor any sign of hair cell synaptic abnormalities. Endocochlear potentials (EP) were normal. The mechanism underlying progressive hearing loss in these mutants remains elusive, but our findings of raised distortion product otoacoustic emission (DPOAE) thresholds and signs of OHC degeneration both suggest an OHC origin for the hearing loss. Synaptojanin2 is not required for normal development of hearing but it is important for its maintenance.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Intracerebral Transplants of GMP-Grade Human Umbilical Cord-Derived Mesenchymal Stromal Cells Effectively Treat Subacute-Phase Ischemic Stroke in a Rodent Model</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.546659</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In subacute and chronic phases of the stroke, there are no therapeutics available at present to promote functional recovery. Human umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (hUC-MSCs) are one of the candidate cell types for treating subacute-phase stroke. The benefits of cell-based therapy largely depend on the migratory capacity of products administered, as well as their potential for engraftment in targeted tissues and paracrine activities. Timing and delivery modes may also influence the outcomes of stem-cell therapy. Still, the functional recuperative effects of differing hUC-MSC delivery modes, about cell replacement and cell-to-cell paracrine activity levels, have yet to be clarified in subacute phases of stroke.This study was conducted to compare the therapeutic effects of various delivery routes when administering Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP)-grade hUC-MSCs in a rodent model of subacute-phase stroke. Cell aliquots (1 × 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;) were given to rats as intravenous (IV) injections or intracerebral (IC) transplants 1 week after middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAo). Transplanted rats were examined up to 7 weeks later using various behavioral tests and immunohistochemical analyses. Most IC-transplanted cells survived for short periods (i.e., &amp;lt;4 weeks after receipt) and gradually disappeared, whereas IV-injected cells were undetectable in the brain at the same time points (i.e., 3 days, 4 weeks, or 7 weeks after injection). Although short-lived, IC-transplanted cells effectively improved behavioral deficits, serving to reduce infarct volumes and glial scar formation, increase subventricular counts of proliferating neuroblasts, and promote cerebrovascular ingrowth in ischemic penumbra regions. IV injection, however, failed to improve behavioral function or histologic parameters during the same 7-week time frame. These findings overall suggest that IC transplantation is preferable to IV injection for delivery of hUC-MSCs during subacute phases of stroke.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnana.2020.584266</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Neuroplasticity is a complex process of structural and functional reorganization of brain tissue. In the fetal period, neuroplasticity plays an important role in the emergence and development of white matter tracts. Here, we aimed to study the architecture of normal fetal brains by way of Klingler’s dissection. Ten normal brains were collected from in utero deceased fetuses aged between 13 and 35 gestational weeks (GW). During this period, we observed modifications in volume, shape, and sulci configuration. Our findings indicate that the major white matter tracts follow four waves of development. The first wave (13 GW) involves the corpus callosum, the fornix, the anterior commissure, and the uncinate fasciculus. In the second one (14 GW), the superior and inferior longitudinal fasciculi and the cingulum could be identified. The third wave (17 GW) concerns the internal capsule and in the fourth wave (20 GW) all the major tracts, including the inferior-occipital fasciculus, were depicted. Our results suggest an earlier development of the white matter tracts than estimated by DTI tractography studies. Correlating anatomical dissection with tractography data is of great interest for further research in the field of fetal brain mapping.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.572037</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Working memory (WM) represents a core cognitive function with a major striatal contribution, and thus WM deficits, commonly observed in Parkinson’s disease (PD), could also relate to many other problems in PD patients. Our online study aimed to determine the subdomains of WM that are particularly affected in PD and to clarify the links between WM and everyday cognitive deficits, other executive functions, psychiatric and PD symptoms, as well as early cognitive impairment. Fifty-two mild-to-moderate PD patients and 54 healthy controls performed seven WM tasks tapping selective updating, continuous monitoring, or maintenance of currently active information. Self-ratings of everyday cognition, depression, and apathy symptoms, as well as screenings of global cognitive impairment, were also collected. The data were analyzed using structural equation modeling. Of the three WM domains, only selective updating was directly predictive of PD group membership. More widespread WM deficits were observed only in relation to global cognitive impairment in PD patients. Self-rated everyday cognition or psychiatric symptoms were not linked to WM performance but correlated with each other. Our findings suggest that WM has a rather limited role in the clinical manifestation of PD. Nevertheless, due to its elementary link to striatal function, the updating component of WM could be a candidate for a cognitive marker of PD also in patients who are otherwise cognitively well-preserved.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Differential Circulating Levels of Naturally Occurring Antibody to α-Synuclein in Parkinson’s Disease Dementia, Alzheimer’s Disease, and Vascular Dementia</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.571437</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Background: Aggregation of alpha-synuclein (α-Syn) is considered to be a significant pathological hallmark and a driving force of Parkinson’s disease (PD). PD dementia (PDD) occurs in a substantial number of PD patients. Naturally occurring antibody against α-Syn (NAb-α-Syn) exists ubiquitously in human blood and is reported to be altered in PD. However, it is not clear yet whether PDD had similar changes of circulating NAb-α-Syn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: In this study, we recruited 61 PDD patients, 52 patients with Alzheimer’s disease (AD), 51 patients with vascular dementia (VaD), and 50 normal controls (NCs). ELISA was used to examine NAb-α-Syn levels in serum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: In comparison with NCs, serum levels of NAb-α-Syn were significantly lower in patients with PDD. However, serum levels of NAb-α-Syn were comparable among AD, VaD, and NC groups. Serum levels of NAb-α-Syn were positively correlated with the cognitive function, as reflected by Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). Serum levels of NAb-α-Syn were negatively correlated with the severity of PD [as reflected by the Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS)] and the duration of PD and PDD. Serum NAb-α-Syn can differentiate PDD patients from AD and VaD patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: These results suggest that circulating NAb-α-Syn might be a potential biomarker of PDD.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Objective&lt;p&gt;To establish a clinically relevant mouse model of perioperative delirium.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;Aged C57BL/6J mice were tested at baseline in the Y-maze novel arm preference, buried food, simple discrimination task of the attentional set-shifting test, and open field tests. They were subsequently randomized to insult (anesthesia, surgery, and Intensive Care Unit environment) or control group. Insult-exposed mice received laparotomy under sevoflurane anesthesia, propofol sedation and exposure to intermittent lights, sounds and cage shaking. Controls did not receive anesthesia, surgery, or intensive care environment. All mice were tested in the Y-maze novel arm preference, buried food, attentional, and open field tests at the end of intensive care environment (0 h) and every 6 h up to 24 h. Mouse hippocampi were collected at 24 h for gene expression analyses.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Surgery, anesthesia and Intensive Care environment decreased the entries in the Y-maze novel arm at 0 h (P = 0.001), 6 h (P &amp;lt; 0.001), 18 h (P = 0.002), and 24 h (P = 0.029). Insult exposure increased the latency to find a buried cereal reward at 18 h (P = 0.035) and 24 h (P = 0.027), and increased the trials to criterion in the reverse compound discrimination (P = 0.013) and extradimensional shift (P &amp;lt; 0.001) tasks of the attentional test. The overall incidence of delirium was 72% in A/S/I mice. Messenger RNA levels of synuclein alpha (−3.785 fold change relative to controls), Neurotrophic Receptor Tyrosine Kinase1 (−2.267), and syntaxin1a (−1.498) were decreased in the hippocampus of mice 24 h after insult exposure. Protein levels of syntaxin 1a (P = 0.012), Neurotrophic Receptor Tyrosine Kinase1 (P = 0.039), synuclein alpha (P = 0.017), phosphorylated synuclein alpha (P = 0.008), synaptophysin (P = 0.002), postsynaptic density protein 95 (P = 0.003), and microtubule-associated protein 2 (P = 0.013) were also decreased, relative to controls.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;Surgery, anesthesia and Intensive Care environment impaired mouse behaviors that depend on attention, memory, and thought organization. The changes were acute in onset and fluctuating in time. Mice with delirium exhibited decreased expression of key synaptic function-related genes. The behavioral changes induced by anesthesia, surgery, and Intensive Care environment in aged mice are consistent with the clinical features of human delirium, and support the use of this animal model for future mechanistic studies of perioperative delirium.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Preclinical Evidence and Possible Mechanisms of Baicalein for Rats and Mice With Parkinson's Disease: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00277</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Baicalein, a major bioactive flavone of Scutellaria baicalensis Georgi, has neuroprotective properties in several animal models of Parkinson's disease (PD). Here, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the available preclinical evidence and possible mechanisms of baicalein for animal models of PD. Ultimately, 20 studies were identified by searching 7 databases from inception to December 2019. Review Manager 5.3 was applied for data analysis. Meta-analyses showed baicalein can significantly improve neurobehavioral function in animal models with PD, including spontaneous motor activity test (n = 5), pole test (n = 2), rotarod test (n = 9), apomorphine-induced rotations test (n = 4), grid test (n = 2), and tremor test (n = 2). Compared with controls, the results of the meta-analysis showed baicalein exerted a significant effect in increasing the frequency of spontaneous activity, prolongating the total time for climbing down the pole, decreasing the number of rotations, prolongating the descent latency, reducing the amplitude, and the frequency in animal models with PD. The possible mechanisms of baicalein for PD are regulating neurotransmitters, adjusting enzyme activity, antioxidation, anti-inflammatory, inhibiting protein aggregation, restorating mitochondrial dysfunction, inhibiting apoptosis, and autophagy. In conclusion, these findings preliminarily demonstrated that baicalein exerts potential neuroprotective effects through multiple signaling pathways in animal models of PD.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Environmental toxicants affect human health in various ways. Of the thousands of chemicals present in the environment, those with adverse effects on the endocrine system are referred to as endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs). Here, we focused on a subclass of EDCs that impacts the estrogen receptor (ER), a pivotal transcriptional regulator in health and disease. Estrogenic activity of compounds can be measured by many &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; or cell-based high throughput assays that record various endpoints from large pools of cells, and increasingly at the single-cell level. To simultaneously capture multiple mechanistic ER endpoints in individual cells that are affected by EDCs, we previously developed a sensitive high throughput/high content imaging assay that is based upon a stable cell line harboring a visible multicopy ER responsive transcription unit and expressing a green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion of ER. High content analysis generates voluminous multiplex data comprised of minable features that describe numerous mechanistic endpoints. In this study, we present a machine learning pipeline for rapid, accurate, and sensitive assessment of the endocrine-disrupting potential of benchmark chemicals based on data generated from high content analysis. The multidimensional imaging data was used to train a classification model to ultimately predict the impact of unknown compounds on the ER, either as agonists or antagonists. To this end, both linear logistic regression and nonlinear Random Forest classifiers were benchmarked and evaluated for predicting the estrogenic activity of unknown compounds. Furthermore, through feature selection, data visualization, and model discrimination, the most informative features were identified for the classification of ER agonists/antagonists. The results of this data-driven study showed that highly accurate and generalized classification models with a minimum number of features can be constructed without loss of generality, where these machine learning models serve as a means for rapid mechanistic/phenotypic evaluation of the estrogenic potential of many chemicals.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/WJZyXcuVTMs&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Efficient sensory coding of multidimensional stimuli</title>

According to the efficient coding hypothesis, sensory systems are adapted to maximize their ability to encode information about the environment. Sensory neurons play a key role in encoding by selectively modulating their firing rate for a subset of all possible stimuli. This pattern of modulation is often summarized via a tuning curve. The optimally efficient distribution of tuning curves has been calculated in variety of ways for one-dimensional (1-D) stimuli. However, many sensory neurons encode multiple stimulus dimensions simultaneously. It remains unclear how applicable existing models of 1-D tuning curves are for neurons tuned across multiple dimensions. We describe a mathematical generalization that builds on prior work in 1-D to predict optimally efficient multidimensional tuning curves. Our results have implications for interpreting observed properties of neuronal populations. For example, our results suggest that not all tuning curve attributes (such as gain and bandwidth) are equally useful for evaluating the encoding efficiency of a population.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/JqrtlKafi_w&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Buffering and total calcium levels determine the presence of oscillatory regimes in cardiac cells</title>

Calcium oscillations and waves induce depolarization in cardiac cells which are believed to cause life-threathening arrhythimas. In this work, we study the conditions for the appearance of calcium oscillations in both a detailed subcellular model of calcium dynamics and a minimal model that takes into account just the minimal ingredients of the calcium toolkit. To avoid the effects of homeostatic changes and the interaction with the action potential we consider the somewhat artificial condition of a cell without pacing and with no calcium exchange with the extracellular medium. Both the full subcellular model and the minimal model present the same scenarios depending on the calcium load: two stationary states, one with closed ryanodine receptors (RyR) and most calcium in the cell stored in the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR), and another, with open RyRs and a depleted SR. In between, calcium oscillations may appear. The robustness of these oscillations is determined by the amount of calsequestrin (CSQ). The lack of this buffer in the SR enhances the appearance of oscillations. The minimal model allows us to relate the stability of the oscillating state to the nullcline structure of the system, and find that its range of existence is bounded by a homoclinic and a Hopf bifurcation, resulting in a sudden transition to the oscillatory regime as the cell calcium load is increased. Adding a small amount of noise to the RyR behavior increases the parameter region where oscillations appear and provides a gradual transition from the resting state to the oscillatory regime, as observed in the subcellular model and experimentally.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/kxOItuzUC2g&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;img alt=&quot;Distinct proportions of cholinergic neurons in the rat prepositus hypoglossi nucleus according to their cerebellar projection targets&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/36c3e35d-a78e-4292-b799-10afba73768e/cne25035-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The prepositus hypoglossi nucleus (PHN) is one of the major sources of cholinergic input to the cerebellum. We report the proportions of cholinergic neurons in PHN projections to distinct cerebellar regions by applying retrograde labeling with dextran‐conjugated Alexa 488 in ChAT‐tdTomato rats. The results suggest the proportion of cholinergic PHN neurons differs depending on cerebellar target areas and the rostro‐caudal regions of the PHN.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cerebellar functions are modulated by cholinergic inputs, the density of which varies among cerebellar regions. Although the prepositus hypoglossi nucleus (PHN), a brainstem structure involved in controlling gaze holding, is known as one of the major sources of these cholinergic inputs, the proportions of cholinergic neurons in PHN projections to distinct cerebellar regions have not been quantitatively analyzed. In this study, we identified PHN neurons projecting to the cerebellum by applying retrograde labeling with dextran‐conjugated Alexa 488 in choline acetyltransferase (ChAT)‐tdTomato transgenic rats and compared the proportion of cholinergic PHN neurons in the PHN projections to four different regions of the cerebellum, namely the flocculus (FL), the uvula and nodulus (UN), lobules III‐V in the vermis (VM), and the hemispheric paramedian lobule and crus 2 (PC). In the PHN, the percentage of cholinergic PHN neurons was lower in the projection to the FL than in the projection to the UN, VM or PC. Preposito‐cerebellar neurons, except for preposito‐FL neurons, included different proportions of cholinergic neurons at different rostrocaudal positions in the PHN. These results suggest that cholinergic PHN neurons project to not only the vestibulocerebellum but also the anterior vermis and posterior hemisphere and that the proportion of cholinergic neurons among projection neurons from the PHN differs depending on cerebellar target areas and the rostro‐caudal regions of the PHN. This study provides insights regarding the involvement of cerebellar cholinergic networks in gaze holding.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Mesencephalic Astrocyte-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (MANF) Regulates Neurite Outgrowth Through the Activation of Akt/mTOR and Erk/mTOR Signaling Pathways</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2020.560020</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Neurite outgrowth is essential for brain development and the recovery of brain injury and neurodegenerative diseases. In this study, we examined the role of the neurotrophic factor MANF in regulating neurite outgrowth. We generated MANF knockout (KO) neuro2a (N2a) cell lines using clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/Cas9 and demonstrated that MANF KO N2a cells failed to grow neurites in response to RA stimulation. Using MANF siRNA, this finding was confirmed in human SH-SY5Y neuronal cell line. Nevertheless, MANF overexpression by adenovirus transduction or addition of MANF into culture media facilitated the growth of longer neurites in RA-treated N2a cells. MANF deficiency resulted in inhibition of Akt, Erk, mTOR, and P70S6, and impaired protein synthesis. MANF overexpression on the other hand facilitated the growth of longer neurites by activating Akt, Erk, mTOR, and P70S6. Pharmacological blockade of Akt, Erk or mTOR eliminated the promoting effect of MANF on neurite outgrowth. These findings suggest that MANF positively regulated neurite outgrowth by activating Akt/mTOR and Erk/mTOR signaling pathways.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.588234</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Gene therapy is proving to be an effective approach to treat or prevent ocular diseases ensuring a targeted, stable, and regulated introduction of exogenous genetic material with therapeutic action. Retinal diseases can be broadly categorized into two groups, namely monogenic and complex (multifactorial) forms. The high genetic heterogeneity of monogenic forms represents a significant limitation to the application of gene-specific therapeutic strategies for a significant fraction of patients. Therefore, mutation-independent therapeutic strategies, acting on common pathways that underly retinal damage, are gaining interest as complementary/alternative approaches for retinal diseases. This review will provide an overview of mutation-independent strategies that rely on the modulation in the retina of key genes regulating such crucial degenerative pathways. In particular, we will describe how gene-based approaches explore the use of neurotrophic factors, microRNAs (miRNAs), genome editing and optogenetics in order to restore/prolong visual function in both outer and inner retinal diseases. We predict that the exploitation of gene delivery procedures applied to mutation/gene independent approaches may provide the answer to the unmet therapeutic need of a large fraction of patients with genetically heterogeneous and complex retinal diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.570123</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Neuroimaging evidence has suggested white matter microstructure are heavily affected in Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, whether white matter dysfunction is localized at the specific regions of fiber tracts and whether they would be a potential biomarker for AD remain unclear. By automated fiber quantification (AFQ), we applied diffusion tensor images from 25 healthy controls (HC), 24 amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) patients and 18 AD patients to create tract profiles along 16 major white matter fibers. We compared diffusion metrics [Fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), axial diffusivity (DA), and radial diffusivity (DR)] between groups. To assess the diagnostic value, we applied a random forest (RF) classifier, a type of machine learning method. In the global tract level, we found that aMCI and AD patients showed higher MD, DA, and DR values in some fiber tracts mostly in the left hemisphere compared to HC. In the point-wise level, widespread disruption were distributed on specific locations of different tracts. The point-wise MD measurements presented the best classification performance with respect to differentiating AD from HC. The two most important variables were localized in the prefrontal potion of left uncinate fasciculus and anterior thalamic radiation. In addition, the point-wise DA in the posterior component of the left cingulum cingulate displayed the most robust discriminative ability to identify AD from aMCI. Our findings provide evidence that white matter abnormalities based on the AFQ method could be as a diagnostic biomarker in AD.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Animal models are indispensable tools in the development of innovative treatments for rare and incurable diseases. To date, there is almost no effective treatment for neurodegenerative diseases, and animal models that properly simulate human disease pathologies are eagerly anticipated to identify disease biomarkers and develop therapeutic methods and agents. Among experimental animals, non-human primates are the most suitable animal models for the study of neurodegenerative diseases with human-specific higher brain dysfunction and late-onset and slowly progressing symptoms. With the rapid development of novel therapies such as oligonucleotide therapeutics and genome editing technologies, non-human primate models for neurodegenerative diseases will be essential for preclinical studies and active interventional trials. In a previous publication, we reported the generation of the first transgenic marmoset model of spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 and successful obtainment of subsequent generations with stable disease onset. Moreover, we generated transgenic marmosets in which the transgene was controlled by the tetracycline-inducible gene expression system. In this mini-review, we summarize the research on our marmoset model of spinocerebellar ataxia type 3.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Effects of Different Stimulation Conditions on the Stimulation Effect of Noisy Galvanic Vestibular Stimulation</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.581405</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Balance disorders are a risk factor for falls in the elderly population. Balance control involving the complex interaction among nervous, muscular, and sensory systems should be maintained to keep an upright posture and prevent falls. Vestibular sensation is one of the main senses essential for postural control. Noisy galvanic vestibular stimulation (nGVS) is a noninvasive stimulation method for vestibular organs. Recently, it has received increasing attention for the treatment of balance disorders. However, the effect of balance disorders on stimulus effect during the implementation of nGVS remains unknown. Therefore, this study aimed to determine the effects of different floor surface and visual conditions on the stimulus effects of the nGVS intervention. In this study, two experiments were conducted with 24 participants (12 each for Experiments 1 and 2). In Experiment 1, nGVS (0.4 mA; 0.1–640 Hz) was performed in the open-eyes standing position on a solid surface (nGVS condition) and in the closed-eye standing position on a foam rubber (nGVS + foam rubber condition). In Experiment 2, sham stimulation was performed under the same conditions as in Experiment 1, except for nGVS. Center of pressure (COP) sway was measured in all participants with them standing with open eyes at Pre and Post-1 (immediately after the intervention) and Post-2 (10 min after the measurement of post-1). In Experiment 1, under the nGVS condition, COP sway was significantly reduced in Post-1 and Post-2 compared with Pre. However, no significant difference was observed among Pre, Post-1, and Post-2 under the nGVS + foam rubber condition. Furthermore, the intervention effect was significantly greater in the nGVS condition than in the nGVS + foam rubber condition. In contrast, in Experiment 2, the COP sway did not significantly differ among Pre, Post-1, and Post-2 under either condition. Based on the results of this study, nGVS was found to be effective with open-eyes standing on a solid surface.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience: Proto-Object Based Saliency Model With Texture Detection Channel</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2020.541581</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The amount of visual information projected from the retina to the brain exceeds the information processing capacity of the latter. Attention, therefore, functions as a filter to highlight important information at multiple stages of the visual pathway that requires further and more detailed analysis. Among other functions, this determines where to fixate since only the fovea allows for high resolution imaging. Visual saliency modeling, i.e. understanding how the brain selects important information to analyze further and to determine where to fixate next, is an important research topic in computational neuroscience and computer vision. Most existing bottom-up saliency models use low-level features such as intensity and color, while some models employ high-level features, like faces. However, little consideration has been given to mid-level features, such as texture, for visual saliency models. In this paper, we extend a biologically plausible proto-object based saliency model by adding simple texture channels which employ nonlinear operations that mimic the processing performed by primate visual cortex. The extended model shows statistically significant improved performance in predicting human fixations compared to the previous model. Comparing the performance of our model with others on publicly available benchmarking datasets, we find that our biologically plausible model matches the performance of other models, even though those were designed entirely for maximal performance with little regard to biological realism.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic value of the MAP MRI in Parkinson’s disease (PD) in comparison with conventional diffusion tensor imaging (DTI).&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;23 PD patients and 22 age- and gender-matched healthy controls were included. MAP MRI and DTI were performed on a 3T MR scanner with a 20-channel head coil. The MAP metrics including mean square displacement (MSD), return to the origin probability (RTOP), return to the axis probability (RTAP), and return to the plane probability (RTPP), and DTI metrics including fractional anisotropy (FA), and mean diffusivity (MD), were measured in subcortical gray matter and compared between the two groups. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to analyze the diagnostic performance of all the metrics. The association between the diffusion metrics and disease severity was assessed by Pearson correlation analysis.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;For MAP MRI, the mean values of MSD in the bilateral caudate, pallidum, putamen, thalamus and substantia nigra (SN) were higher in PD patients than in healthy controls (p&lt;sub&gt;FDR&lt;/sub&gt; ≤ 0.001); the mean values of the zero displacement probabilities (RTOP, RTAP, and RTPP) in the bilateral caudate, pallidum, putamen and thalamus were lower in PD patients (p&lt;sub&gt;FDR&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001). For DTI, only FA in the bilateral SN was significantly higher in PD patients than those in the controls (p&lt;sub&gt;FDR&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001). ROC analysis showed that the areas under the curves of MAP MRI metrics (MSD, RTOP, RTAP, and RTPP) in the bilateral caudate, pallidum, putamen and thalamus (range, 0.85–0.94) were greater than those of FA and MD of DTI (range, 0.55–0.69) in discriminating between PD patients and healthy controls. RTAP in the ipsilateral pallidum (r = −0.56, p&lt;sub&gt;FDR&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.027), RTOP in the bilateral and contralateral putamen (r = −0.58, p&lt;sub&gt;FDR&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.019; r = −0.57, p&lt;sub&gt;FDR&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.024) were negatively correlated with UPDRS III motor scores.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;MAP MRI outperformed the conventional DTI in the diagnosis of PD and evaluation of the disease severity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Central synapses are often surrounded by thin astroglial processes that confine chemical neurotransmission to the synaptic cleft.

Moore, Martin Hirst, Samuel Aparicio, Sohrab P. Shah&lt;/p&gt;

We present Epiclomal, a probabilistic clustering method arising from a hierarchical mixture model to simultaneously cluster sparse single-cell DNA methylation data and impute missing values. Using synthetic and published single-cell CpG datasets, we show that Epiclomal outperforms non-probabilistic methods and can handle the inherent missing data characteristic that dominates single-cell CpG genome sequences. Using newly generated single-cell 5mCpG sequencing data, we show that Epiclomal discovers sub-clonal methylation patterns in aneuploid tumour genomes, thus defining epiclones that can match or transcend copy number-determined clonal lineages and opening up an important form of clonal analysis in cancer. Epiclomal is written in R and Python and is available at https://github.com/shahcompbio/Epiclomal.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/a3cNWSbgpNA&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Identifying locations of re-entrant drivers from patient-specific distribution of fibrosis in the left atrium</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/FB6rj9a04UM/article</link>

Clinical evidence suggests a link between fibrosis in the left atrium (LA) and atrial fibrillation (AF), the most common sustained arrhythmia. Image-derived fibrosis is increasingly used for patient stratification and therapy guidance. However, locations of re-entrant drivers (RDs) sustaining AF are unknown and therapy success rates remain suboptimal. This study used image-derived LA models to explore the dynamics of RD stabilization in fibrotic regions and generate maps of RD locations. LA models with patient-specific geometry and fibrosis distribution were derived from late gadolinium enhanced magnetic resonance imaging of 6 AF patients. In each model, RDs were initiated at multiple locations, and their trajectories were tracked and overlaid on the LA fibrosis distributions to identify the most likely regions where the RDs stabilized. The simulations showed that the RD dynamics were strongly influenced by the amount and spatial distribution of fibrosis. In patients with fibrosis burden greater than 25%, RDs anchored to specific locations near large fibrotic patches. In patients with fibrosis burden below 25%, RDs either moved near small fibrotic patches or anchored to anatomical features. The patient-specific maps of RD locations showed that areas that harboured the RDs were much smaller than the entire fibrotic areas, indicating potential targets for ablation therapy. Ablating the predicted locations and connecting them to the existing pulmonary vein ablation lesions was the most effective in-silico ablation strategy.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/FB6rj9a04UM&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

The explosive growth in semiconductor integrated circuits was made possible in large part by design automation software. The design and/or analysis of synthetic and natural circuits in living cells could be made more scalable using the same approach. We present a compiler which converts standard representations of chemical reaction networks and circuits into hardware configurations that can be used to simulate the network on specialized cytomorphic hardware. The compiler also creates circuit–level models of the target configuration, which enhances the versatility of the compiler and enables the validation of its functionality without physical experimentation with the hardware. We show that this compiler can translate networks comprised of mass–action kinetics, classic enzyme kinetics (Michaelis–Menten, Briggs–Haldane, and Botts–Morales formalisms), and genetic repressor kinetics, thereby allowing a large class of models to be transformed into a hardware representation. Rule–based models are particularly well–suited to this approach, as we demonstrate by compiling a MAP kinase model. Development of specialized hardware and software for simulating biological networks has the potential to enable the simulation of larger kinetic models than are currently feasible or allow the parallel simulation of many smaller networks with better performance than current simulation software.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Acb_9JRoD9g&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Biology: Dendritic integration in olfactory bulb granule cells upon simultaneous multispine activation: Low thresholds for nonlocal spiking activity</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~3/48r20hfzkFo/article</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Max Mueller, Veronica Egger&lt;/p&gt;

The inhibitory axonless olfactory bulb granule cells form reciprocal dendrodendritic synapses with mitral and tufted cells via large spines, mediating recurrent and lateral inhibition. As a case in point for dendritic transmitter release, rat granule cell dendrites are highly excitable, featuring local Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; spine spikes and global Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;- and Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-spikes. To investigate the transition from local to global signaling, we performed holographic, simultaneous 2-photon uncaging of glutamate at up to 12 granule cell spines, along with whole-cell recording and dendritic 2-photon Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; imaging in acute juvenile rat brain slices. Coactivation of less than 10 reciprocal spines was sufficient to generate diverse regenerative signals that included regional dendritic Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-spikes and dendritic Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-spikes (D-spikes). Global Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-spikes could be triggered in one third of granule cells. Individual spines and dendritic segments sensed the respective signal transitions as increments in Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; entry. Dendritic integration as monitored by the somatic membrane potential was mostly linear until a threshold number of spines was activated, at which often D-spikes along with supralinear summation set in. As to the mechanisms supporting active integration, NMDA receptors (NMDARs) strongly contributed to all aspects of supralinearity, followed by dendritic voltage-gated Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;- and Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-channels, whereas local Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; spine spikes, as well as morphological variables, barely mattered.
Because of the low numbers of coactive spines required to trigger dendritic Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; signals and thus possibly lateral release of GABA onto mitral and tufted cells, we predict that thresholds for granule cell-mediated bulbar lateral inhibition are low. Moreover, D-spikes could provide a plausible substrate for granule cell-mediated gamma oscillations.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/48r20hfzkFo&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

&lt;p&gt;Macroscopic gray matter changes have been well documented in chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). The present study examined microscopic gray matter changes in CTE by comparing the dendritic arbors of supragranular pyramidal neurons from prefrontal and occipital cortices in both Control and CTE cases. CTE neurons exhibited significantly lower mean dendritic measure values than did Control neurons, while also displaying considerably greater variability across measures. These changes may be a newly described pathological marker of CTE and could supplement current mechanistic and functional understandings of the disease.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) is a neurodegenerative disorder that is associated with repetitive head impacts. Neuropathologically, it is defined by the presence of perivascular hyperphosphorylated tau aggregates in cortical tissue (McKee et al., 2016, &lt;i&gt;Acta Neuropathologica&lt;/i&gt;, 131, 75–86). Although many pathological and assumed clinical correlates of CTE have been well characterized, its effects on cortical dendritic arbors are still unknown. Here, we quantified dendrites and dendritic spines of supragranular pyramidal neurons in tissue from human frontal and occipital lobes, in 11 cases with (&lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;age&lt;/sub&gt; = 79 ± 7 years) and 5 cases without (&lt;i&gt;M&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;age&lt;/sub&gt; = 76 ± 11 years) CTE. Tissue was stained with a modified rapid Golgi technique. Dendritic systems of 20 neurons per region in each brain (&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt; = 640 neurons) were quantified using computer‐assisted morphometry. One key finding was that CTE neurons exhibited increased variability and distributional changes across six of the eight dendritic system measures, presumably due to ongoing degeneration and compensatory reorganization of dendritic systems. However, despite heightened variation among CTE neurons, CTE cases exhibited lower mean values than Control cases in seven of the eight dendritic system measures. These dendritic alterations may represent a new pathological marker of CTE, and further examination of dendritic changes could contribute to both mechanistic and functional understandings of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Hippocampus: Reminders activate the prefrontal‐medial temporal cortex and attenuate forgetting of event memory</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/hipo.23260?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Replicas of an aspect of an experienced event can serve as effective reminders, yet little is known about the neural basis of such reminding effects. Here we examined the neural activity underlying the memory‐enhancing effect of reminders 1 week after encoding of naturalistic film clip events. We used fMRI to determine differences in network activity associated with recently reactivated memories relative to comparably aged, non‐reactivated memories. Reminders were effective in facilitating overall retrieval of memory for film clips, in an all‐or‐none fashion. Prefrontal cortex and hippocampus were activated during both reminders and retrieval. Peak activation in ventro‐lateral prefrontal cortex (vPFC) preceded peak activation in the right hippocampus during the reminders. For film clips that were successfully retrieved after 7 days, pre‐retrieval reminders did not enhance the quality of the retrieved memory or the number of details retrieved, nor did they more strongly engage regions of the recollection network than did successful retrieval of a non‐reminded film clip. These results suggest that reminders prior to retrieval are an effective means of boosting retrieval of otherwise inaccessible episodic events, and that the inability to recall certain events after a delay of a week largely reflects a retrieval deficit, rather than a storage deficit for this information. The results extend other evidence that vPFC drives activation of the hippocampus to facilitate memory retrieval and scene construction, and show that this facilitation also occurs when reminder cues precede successful retrieval attempts. The time course of vPFC‐hippocampal activity during the reminder suggests that reminders may first engage schematic information meditated by vPFC followed by a recollection process mediated by the hippocampus.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

&lt;p&gt;1. Three weeks of anti‐Lingo‐1 antibody injection at a dose of 8 mg/(kg • d) significantly improved the spatial memory ability of rats under chronic stress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. The synapses of the DG, CA1 and CA3 fields of the hippocampus were significantly decreased after 7 weeks of CS stimulation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chronic stress can induce cognitive impairment, and synapse number was significantly decreased in the hippocampus of rats suffering from chronic stress. Lingo‐1 is a potent negative regulator of axonal outgrowth and synaptic plasticity. In the current study, the effects of anti‐Lingo‐1 antibody on the spatial learning and memory abilities and hippocampal synapses of stressed rats were investigated. After 4 weeks of stress exposure, the model group was randomly divided into a chronic stress group and an anti‐Lingo‐1 group. Then, the anti‐Lingo‐1 group rats were treated with anti‐Lingo‐1 antibody (8 mg/kg) for 3 weeks. The effects of anti‐Lingo‐1 antibody on the spatial learning and memory abilities were investigated with the Morris water maze test. Immunohistological staining and an unbiased stereological method were used to estimate the total number of dendritic spine synapses in the hippocampus. At the behavioral level, after three weeks of treatment, the anti‐Lingo‐1 group rats displayed significantly more platform location crossings in the Morris water maze test than the chronic stress group rats. Anti‐Lingo‐1 significantly prevented the declines in dendritic spine synapses and postsynaptic density protein‐95 (PSD‐95) expression in the dentate gyrus and the CA1 and CA3 regions of the hippocampus. The present results indicated that anti‐Lingo‐1 antibody may be a safe and effective drug for alleviating memory impairment in rats after chronic stress and protecting synapses in the hippocampus of stressed rats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Punishment feels bad, but relief from it feels good. Correspondingly, negative memories are formed for cues when these are associated with the occurrence of punishment. In contrast, positive memories result from their association with relief. Such timing‐dependent valence reversal is observed in humans and in animals alike. Using Drosophila larvae, Weiglein et al present an odor cue either before or after optogenetically activating single, identified dopaminergic neurons known to mediate punishment. This reveals that these dopaminergic neurons are heterogeneous: DAN‐f1 establishes timing‐dependent valence reversal, whereas DAN‐d1 does not. Together with recent findings in the reward domain and from adult Drosophila, this suggests that such heterogeneity might be a more general principle of reinforcement processing through dopamine neurons.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dopamine serves many functions, and dopamine neurons are correspondingly diverse. We use a combination of optogenetics, behavioral experiments, and high‐resolution video‐tracking to probe for the functional capacities of two single, identified dopamine neurons in larval &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt;. The DAN‐f1 and the DAN‐d1 neuron were recently found to carry aversive teaching signals during Pavlovian olfactory learning. We enquire into a fundamental feature of these teaching signals, namely their temporal ‘fingerprint’. That is, receiving punishment feels bad, whereas being relieved from it feels good, and animals and humans alike learn with opposite valence about the occurrence and the termination of punishment (the same principle applies in the appetitive domain, with opposite sign). We find that DAN‐f1 but not DAN‐d1 can mediate such timing‐dependent valence reversal: presenting an odor before DAN‐f1 activation leads to learned avoidance of the odor (punishment memory), whereas presenting the odor upon termination of DAN‐f1 activation leads to learned approach (relief memory). In contrast, DAN‐d1 confers punishment memory only. These effects are further characterized in terms of the impact of the duration of optogenetic activation, the temporal stability of the memories thus established, and the specific microbehavioral patterns of locomotion through which they are expressed. Together with recent findings in the appetitive domain and from adult &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt;, our results suggest that heterogeneity in the temporal fingerprint of teaching signals might be a more general principle of reinforcement processing through dopamine neurons.&lt;/p&gt;

Scale bars in each image = 1 mm.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study provides an analysis of the cytoarchitecture, myeloarchitecture and chemoarchitecture of the diencephalon (dorsal thalamus, ventral thalamus and epithalamus) of the banded mongoose (&lt;i&gt;Mungos mungo&lt;/i&gt;) and domestic ferret (&lt;i&gt;Mustela putorius furo&lt;/i&gt;). Using architectural and immunohistochemical stains, we observe that the nuclear organization of the diencephalon is very similar in the two species, and similar to that reported in other carnivores, such as the domestic cat and dog. The same complement of putatively homologous nuclei were identified in both species, with only one variance, that being the presence of the perireticular nucleus in the domestic ferret, that was not observed in the banded mongoose. The chemoarchitecture was also mostly consistent between species, although there were a number of minor variations across a range of nuclei in the density of structures expressing the calcium‐binding proteins parvalbumin, calbindin and calretinin. Thus, despite almost 53 million years since these two species of carnivores shared a common ancestor, strong phylogenetic constraints appear to limit the potential for adaptive evolutionary plasticity within the carnivore order. Apart from the presence of the perireticular nucleus, the most notable difference between the species studied was the physical inversion of the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus, as well as the lateral posterior and pulvinar nuclei in the domestic ferret compared to the banded mongoose and other carnivores, although this inversion appears to be a feature of the Mustelidae family. While no functional sequelae are suggested, this inversion is likely to result from the altricial birth of Mustelidae species.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience Research: Dietary docosahexaenoic acid inhibits neurodegeneration and prevents stroke</title>

	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stroke severely impairs quality of life and has a high mortality rate. On the other hand, dietary docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) prevents neuronal damage. In this review, we describe the effects of dietary DHA on ischemic stroke‐associated neuronal damage and its role in stroke prevention. Recent epidemiological studies have been conducted to analyze stroke prevention through DHA intake. The effects of dietary intake and supply of DHA to neuronal cells, DHA‐mediated inhibition of neuronal damage, and its mechanism, including the effects of the DHA metabolite, neuroprotectin D1 (NPD1), were investigated. These studies revealed that DHA intake was associated with a reduced risk of stroke. Moreover, studies have shown that DHA intake may reduce stroke mortality rates. DHA, which is abundant in fish oil, passes through the blood–brain barrier to accumulate as a constituent of phospholipids in the cell membranes of neuronal cells and astrocytes. Astrocytes supply DHA to neuronal cells, and neuronal DHA, in turn, activates Akt and Raf‐1 to prevent neuronal death or damage. Therefore, DHA indirectly prevents neuronal damage. Furthermore, NDP1 blocks neuronal apoptosis. DHA, together with NPD1, may block neuronal damage and prevent stroke. The inhibitory effect on neuronal damage is achieved through the antioxidant (via inducing the Nrf2/HO‐1 system) and anti‐inflammatory effects (via promoting JNK/AP‐1 signaling) of DHA.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsyn.2020.00035</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Perinatal asphyxia (PA) is an obstetric complication occurring when the oxygen supply to the newborn is temporally interrupted. This health problem is associated with high morbimortality in term and preterm neonates. It severely affects the brain structure and function, involving cortical, hippocampal, and striatal loss of neurons. Nearly 25% of PA survivor newborns develop several neurodevelopmental disabilities. Behavioral alterations, as well as the morphological and biochemical pathways involved in PA pathophysiology, have been studied using an animal model that resembles intrauterine asphyxia. Experimental evidence shows that PA induces synaptic derangement. Then, synaptic dysfunction embodies a putative target for neuroprotective strategies. Over the last years, therapeutic hypothermia (TH), the only treatment available, has shown positive results in the clinic. Several pharmacological agents are being tested in experimental or clinical trial studies to prevent synaptopathy. Preservation of the synaptic structure and function, i.e., “synaptoprotection,” makes up a promising challenge for reducing incidental neurodevelopmental disorders associated with PA. Accordingly, here, we summarize and review the findings obtained from the referred experimental model and propose a renewed overview in the field.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: The Cell Biology of Tau Secretion</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2020.569818</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The progressive accumulation and spread of misfolded tau protein in the nervous system is the hallmark of tauopathies, progressive neurodegenerative diseases with only symptomatic treatments available. A growing body of evidence suggests that spreading of tau pathology can occur via cell-to-cell transfer involving secretion and internalization of pathological forms of tau protein followed by templated misfolding of normal tau in recipient cells. Several studies have addressed the cell biological mechanisms of tau secretion. It now appears that instead of a single mechanism, cells can secrete tau via three coexisting pathways: (1) translocation through the plasma membrane; (2) membranous organelles-based secretion; and (3) ectosomal shedding. The relative importance of these pathways in the secretion of normal and pathological tau is still elusive, though. Moreover, glial cells contribute to tau propagation, and the involvement of different cell types, as well as different secretion pathways, complicates the understanding of prion-like propagation of tauopathy. One of the important regulators of tau secretion in neuronal activity, but its mechanistic connection to tau secretion remains unclear and may involve all three secretion pathways of tau. This review article summarizes recent advancements in the field of tau secretion with an emphasis on cell biological aspects of the secretion process and discusses the role of neuronal activity and glial cells in the spread of pathological forms of tau.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: A Semiquantitative Non-invasive Measurement of PcomA Patency in C57BL/6 Mice Explains Variance in Ischemic Brain Damage in Filament MCAo</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.576741</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Numerous studies on experimental ischemic stroke use the filament middle cerebral artery occlusion (fMCAo) model in C57BL/6 mice, but lesion sizes in this strain are highly variable. A known contributor is variation in the posterior communicating artery (PcomA) patency. We therefore aimed to provide a semiquantitative non-invasive in vivo method to routinely assess PcomA patency. We included 43 male C57BL/6 mice from four independent studies using a transient 45 min fMCAo model. Edema-corrected lesion sizes were measured by magnetic resonance (MR) imaging 24 h after reperfusion. Time-of-flight MR angiography was performed 7 days before and 24 h after fMCAo. Scores of PcomA size measured 24 h after, but not scores measured 7 days before fMCAo were negatively correlated with lesion size. Variability in PcomA patency explained 30% of the variance in our cohort (p &amp;lt; 0.0001, coefficient of determination r&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.3). In a simulation using parameters typical for experimental stroke research, the power to detect a true effect of d = 1 between two groups increased by 15% when an according covariate was included in the statistical model. We have demonstrated that in vivo measurement of PcomA size is feasible and can lead to increased accuracy in assessing the effect of treatments.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Objective&lt;p&gt;Peripheral nerve stimulation may be an alternative option to treat severe facial pain. We assessed the application of peripheral nerve stimulation for pain management in patients with herpes zoster ophthalmicus.&lt;/p&gt;Method&lt;p&gt;A retrospective analysis was conducted in patients suffering severe facial pain caused by ophthalmic herpetic lesions. We identified the change in pain severity before and after peripheral nerve stimulation for up to 12 months.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Eighteen patients were enrolled. Their mean age was 70.8 ± 9.5 years. Fifteen patients presented with subacute pain for 1–3 months, and three patients suffered postherpetic neuralgia. Dramatic relief from pain was achieved in 83% of patients (15 out of 18) upon initial removal of the stimulator, with pain reduction of &amp;gt; 50%. The long-term analgesic effect was reported at the 6- and 12-month follow-ups, with reductions in the visual analog scale of 4.8 ± 1.2 (n = 18) and 5.4 ± 1.4 (n = 11), respectively. The prevalence of postherpetic neuralgia was 7% (1 out of 15) in the subacute pain group. No obvious adverse effect was observed.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;Peripheral nerve stimulation may be an efficacious and safe approach for pain control in patients with herpes zoster ophthalmicus.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Common and Distinct Features of Adult Neurogenesis and Regeneration in the Telencephalon of Zebrafish and Mammals</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.568930</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In contrast to mammals, the adult zebrafish brain shows neurogenic activity in a multitude of niches present in almost all brain subdivisions. Irrespectively, constitutive neurogenesis in the adult zebrafish and mouse telencephalon share many similarities at the cellular and molecular level. However, upon injury during tissue repair, the situation is entirely different. In zebrafish, inflammation caused by traumatic brain injury or by induced neurodegeneration initiates specific and distinct neurogenic programs that, in combination with signaling pathways implicated in constitutive neurogenesis, quickly, and efficiently overcome the loss of neurons. In the mouse brain, injury-induced inflammation promotes gliosis leading to glial scar formation and inhibition of regeneration. A better understanding of the regenerative mechanisms occurring in the zebrafish brain could help to develop new therapies to combat the debilitating consequences of brain injury, stroke, and neurodegeneration. The aim of this review is to compare the properties of neural progenitors and the signaling pathways, which control adult neurogenesis and regeneration in the zebrafish and mammalian telencephalon.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Systems Biology: Subjectivity as an Emergent Property of Information Processing by Neuronal Networks</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.548071</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Here, we examine subjectivity and consciousness as emergent properties of the computational complexity of information processing by the brain, rather than metaphysical phenomena. While Psychology concentrates on the emergent properties and Neurobiology examines the properties of the biological substrate, Neurophysiology and Cognitive Neuroscience link the two levels by investigating the mechanisms and processes by which the functions of the brain emerge from the anatomical, cellular and network properties of the nervous system. Our purpose here is not to locate the neural structures that sustain subjectivity or other psychic functions; rather, we examine the operating modes of neurons and neural circuits: they reveal an intrinsically relational quality; sensory elaboration itself proves to be relational and self-centred, necessarily associated with the vital, hedonic, emotional relevance of each experience and external cue, and intrinsically oriented to a behavioral interaction with the latter. The hippocampus adds to this self-centred relational perspective the capability of transforming the identification and the spatial location of objects into a contextualized representation of reality. Since the hippocampus is strongly interconnected with the archaic structures that evaluate vital and hedonic relevance and generate emotional responses, the contextualized information, emotionally colored, is transformed into a comprehensive individual experience. This way, a subjective, self-centred, affectively colored perspective arises in animals due to the intrinsic properties of neuronal circuits in the brain. We conclude that neuronal network processing is strongly characterized per se by a relational and self-centred (subjective) and emotionally colored, motivationally oriented (personal) perspective. The properties and features of neural processing discussed here constitute well-established knowledge in the neuroscientific community. Yet, from a layman’s perception, subjectivity still mysteriously arises in our brain due to the action of consciousness, and in epistemological and philosophical debates, the question often arises as to how consciousness may add the subjective and personal perspective to neural elaboration. The answer appears to be simple: it does not; subjectivity is already there, present ab initio in neuronal processing and not added a posteriori by some other “consciousness” function of unclear neural basis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00903</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The immune system is essential for maintaining homeostasis, as well as promoting growth and healing throughout the brain and body. Considering that immune cells respond rapidly to changes in their microenvironment, they are very difficult to study without affecting their structure and function. The advancement of non-invasive imaging methods greatly contributed to elucidating the physiological roles performed by immune cells in the brain across stages of the lifespan and contexts of health and disease. For instance, techniques like two-photon in vivo microscopy were pivotal for studying microglial functional dynamics in the healthy brain. Through these observations, their interactions with neurons, astrocytes, blood vessels and synapses were uncovered. High-resolution electron microscopy with immunostaining and 3D-reconstruction, as well as super-resolution fluorescence microscopy, provided complementary insights by revealing microglial interventions at synapses (phagocytosis, trogocytosis, synaptic stripping, etc.). In addition, serial block-face scanning electron microscopy has provided the first 3D reconstruction of a microglial cell at nanoscale resolution. This review will discuss the technical toolbox that currently allows to study microglia and other immune cells in the brain, as well as introduce emerging methods that were developed and could be used to increase the spatial and temporal resolution of neuroimmune imaging. A special attention will also be placed on positron emission tomography and the development of selective functional radiotracers for microglia and peripheral macrophages, considering their strong potential for research translation between animals and humans, notably when paired with other imaging modalities such as magnetic resonance imaging.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Not All Words Are Equally Acquired: Transitional Probabilities and Instructions Affect the Electrophysiological Correlates of Statistical Learning</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.577991</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Statistical learning (SL), the process of extracting regularities from the environment, is a fundamental skill of our cognitive system to structure the world regularly and predictably. SL has been studied using mainly behavioral tasks under implicit conditions and with triplets presenting the same level of difficulty, i.e., a mean transitional probability (TP) of 1.00. Yet, the neural mechanisms underlying SL under other learning conditions remain largely unknown. Here, we investigated the neurofunctional correlates of SL using triplets (i.e., three-syllable nonsense words) with a mean TP of 1.00 (easy “words”) and 0.50 (hard “words”) in an SL task performed under incidental (implicit) and intentional (explicit) conditions, to determine whether the same core mechanisms were recruited to assist learning. Event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded while participants listened firstly to a continuous auditory stream made of the concatenation of four easy and four hard “words” under implicit instructions, and subsequently to another auditory stream made of the concatenation of four easy and four hard “words” drawn from another artificial language under explicit instructions. The stream in each of the SL tasks was presented in two consecutive blocks of ~3.5-min each (~7-min in total) to further examine how ERP components might change over time. Behavioral measures of SL were collected after the familiarization phase of each SL task by asking participants to perform a two-alternative forced-choice (2-AFC) task. Results from the 2-AFC tasks revealed a moderate but reliable level of SL, with no differences between conditions. ERPs were, nevertheless, sensitive to the effect of TPs, showing larger amplitudes of N400 for easy “words,” as well as to the effect of instructions, with a reduced N250 for “words” presented under explicit conditions. Also, significant differences in the N100 were found as a result of the interaction between TPs, instructions, and the amount of exposure to the auditory stream. Taken together, our findings suggest that triplets’ predictability impacts the emergence of “words” representations in the brain both for statistical regularities extracted under incidental and intentional instructions, although the prior knowledge of the “words” seems to favor the recruitment of different SL mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.560586</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Recently a positive treatment effect on disorders of consciousness (DOCs) with high-definition transcranial direct-current stimulation (HD-tDCS) has been reported; however, the neural modulation mechanisms of this treatment’s efficacy need further investigation. To better understand the processing of HD-tDCS interventions, a long-lasting HD-tDCS protocol was applied to 15 unresponsive wakefulness syndrome (UWS) patients and 20 minimally conscious states (MCS) patients in this study. Ten minutes of resting-state electroencephalograms (EEGs) were recorded from the patients, and the coma recovery scale-revised scores (CRS-Rs) were assessed for each patient from four time-points (T0, T1, T2, and T3). Brain networks were constructed by calculating the EEG spectral connectivity using the debiased weighted phase lag index (dwPLI) and then quantified the network information transmission efficiency by graph theory. We found that there was an increasing trend in local and global information processing of beta and gamma bands in resting-state functional brain networks during the 14 days of HD-tDCS modulation for MCS patients. Furthermore, the increased functional connectivity not only occurred in the local brain area surrounding the stimulation position but was also present across more global brain areas. Our results suggest that long-lasting HD-tDCS on the precuneus may facilitate information processing among neural populations in MCS patients.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00284</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Emotional decoding and automatic identification of major depressive disorder (MDD) are helpful for the timely diagnosis of the disease. Electroencephalography (EEG) is sensitive to changes in the functional state of the human brain, showing its potential to help doctors diagnose MDD. In this paper, an approach for identifying MDD by fusing interhemispheric asymmetry and cross-correlation with EEG signals is proposed and tested on 32 subjects [16 patients with MDD and 16 healthy controls (HCs)]. First, the structural features and connectivity features of the θ-, α-, and β-frequency bands are extracted on the preprocessed and segmented EEG signals. Second, the structural feature matrix of the θ-, α-, and β-frequency bands are added to and subtracted from the connectivity feature matrix to obtain mixed features. Finally, the structural features, connectivity features, and the mixed features are fed to three classifiers to select suitable features for the classification, and it is found that our mode achieves the best classification results using the mixed features. The results are also compared with those from some state-of-the-art methods, and we achieved an accuracy of 94.13%, a sensitivity of 95.74%, a specificity of 93.52%, and an F1-score (f1) of 95.62% on the data from Beijing Anding Hospital, Capital Medical University. The study could be generalized to develop a system that may be helpful in clinical purposes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2020.579143</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;We describe an integrated theory of olfactory systems operation that incorporates experimental findings across scales, stages, and methods of analysis into a common framework. In particular, we consider the multiple stages of olfactory signal processing as a collective system, in which each stage samples selectively from its antecedents. We propose that, following the signal conditioning operations of the nasal epithelium and glomerular-layer circuitry, the plastic external plexiform layer of the olfactory bulb effects a process of category learning—the basis for extracting meaningful, quasi-discrete odor representations from the metric space of undifferentiated olfactory quality. Moreover, this early categorization process also resolves the foundational problem of how odors of interest can be recognized in the presence of strong competitive interference from simultaneously encountered background odorants. This problem is fundamentally constraining on early-stage olfactory encoding strategies and must be resolved if these strategies and their underlying mechanisms are to be understood. Multiscale general theories of olfactory systems operation are essential in order to leverage the analytical advantages of engineered approaches together with our expanding capacity to interrogate biological systems.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

We developed custom pipelines for brain-wide comparisons of input sources in both sexes with the registration of the whole-brain data set to the Allen Mouse Brain Reference Atlas. Among 257 distinct anatomical regions, we demonstrated the differential proportions of inputs to LC-NE neurons in male and female mice at different levels. Locus coeruleus noradrenaline neurons of two sexes showed general similarity in the input patterns, but with differentiated input proportions quantitatively from major brain regions and diverse sub-regions. For instance, inputs to male LC-NE neurons were found mainly in the cerebrum, interbrain, and cerebellum, whereas inputs to female LC-NE neurons were found in the midbrain and hindbrain. We further found that specific subsets of nuclei nested within sub-regions contributed to overall sex-related differences in the input circuitry. Furthermore, among the totaled 123 anatomical regions with proportion of inputs &amp;gt;0.1%, we also identified 11 sub-regions with significant statistical differences of total inputs between male and female mice, and seven of them also showed such differences in ipsilateral hemispheres. Our study not only provides a structural basis to facilitate our understanding of sex differences at a circuitry level but also provides clues for future sexually differentiated functional studies related to LC-NE neurons.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Effect of β-Hydroxybutyrate on Autophagy Dynamics During Severe Hypoglycemia and the Hypoglycemic Coma</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.547215</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Glucose supply from blood is mandatory for brain functioning and its interruption during acute hypoglycemia or cerebral ischemia leads to brain injury. Alternative substrates to glucose such as the ketone bodies (KB), acetoacetate (AcAc), and β-hydroxybutyrate (BHB), can be used as energy fuels in the brain during hypoglycemia and prevent neuronal death, but the mechanisms involved are still not well understood. During glucose deprivation adaptive cell responses can be activated such as autophagy, a lysosomal-dependent degradation process, to support cell survival. However, impaired or excessive autophagy can lead to cell dysfunction. We have previously shown that impaired autophagy contributes to neuronal death induced by glucose deprivation in cortical neurons and that D isomer of BHB (D-BHB) reestablishes the autophagic flux increasing viability. Here, we aimed to investigate autophagy dynamics in the brain of rats subjected to severe hypoglycemia (SH) without glucose infusion (GI), severe hypoglycemia followed by GI (SH + GI), and a brief period of hypoglycemic coma followed by GI (Coma). The effect of D-BHB administration after the coma was also tested (Coma + BHB). The transformation of LC3-I to LC3-II and the abundance of autophagy proteins, Beclin 1 (BECN1), ATG7, and ATG12–ATG5 conjugate, were analyzed as an index of autophagosome formation, and the levels of sequestrosome1/p62 (SQSTM1/p62) were determined as a hallmark of autophagic degradation. Data suggest that autophagosomes accumulate in the cortex and the hippocampus of rats after SH, likely due to impaired autophagic degradation. In the cortex, autophagosome accumulation persisted at 6 h after GI in animals exposed to SH but recovered basal levels at 24 h, while in the hippocampus no significant effect was observed. In animals subjected to coma, autophagosome accumulation was observed at 24 h after GI in both regions. D-BHB treatment reduced LC3-II and SQSTM1/p62 content and reduced ULK1 phosphorylation by AMPK, suggesting it stimulates the autophagic flux and decreases AMPK activity reducing autophagy initiation. D-BHB also reduced the number of degenerating cells. Together, data suggest different autophagy dynamics after GI in rats subjected to SH or the hypoglycemic coma and support that D-BHB treatment can modulate autophagy dynamics favoring the autophagic flux.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Microglia are the brain resident immune cells; they can produce a large variety of growth factors (GFs) to prevent neuronal damages and promote recovery. In neurodegenerative diseases, microglia can play both benefic and deleterious roles, depending on different factors and disease context. In multiple sclerosis, microglia are involved in both demyelination (DM) and remyelination (RM) processes. Recent studies suggest a beneficial role of microglia in regenerative processes. These include the regenerative development of myelin after DM. This review gives an overlook of how microglia and GFs can influence the RM properties.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroanatomy: Catecholaminergic Innervation of Periventricular Neurogenic Regions of the Developing Mouse Brain</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnana.2020.558435</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The major catecholamines—dopamine (DA) and norepinephrine (NE)—are not only involved in synaptic communication but also act as important trophic factors and might ultimately be involved in mammalian brain development. The catecholaminergic innervation of neurogenic regions of the developing brain and its putative relationship to neurogenesis is thus of pivotal interest. We here determined DA and NE innervation around the ventricular/subventricular zone (VZ/SVZ) bordering the whole ventricular system of the developing mouse brain from embryonic day 14.5 (E14.5), E16.5, and E19.5 until postnatal day zero (P0) by histological evaluation and HPLC with electrochemical detection. We correlated these data with the proliferation capacity of the respective regions by quantification of MCM2&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cells. During development, VZ/SVZ catecholamine levels dramatically increased between E16.5 and P0 with DA levels increasing in forebrain VZ/SVZ bordering the lateral ventricles and NE levels raising in midbrain/hindbrain VZ/SVZ bordering the third ventricle, the aqueduct, and the fourth ventricle. Conversely, proliferating MCM2&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cell counts dropped between E16.5 and E19.5 with a special focus on all VZ/SVZs outside the lateral ventricles. We detected an inverse strong negative correlation of the proliferation capacity in the periventricular neurogenic regions (log-transformed MCM2&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cell counts) with their NE levels (r = −0.932; p &amp;lt; 0.001), but not their DA levels (r = 0.440; p = 0.051) suggesting putative inhibitory effects of NE on cell proliferation within the periventricular regions during mouse brain development. Our data provide the first framework for further demandable studies on the functional importance of catecholamines, particularly NE, in regulating neural stem/progenitor cell proliferation and differentiation during mammalian brain development.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroanatomy: 3D Exploration of the Brainstem in 50-Micron Resolution MRI</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnana.2020.00040</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The brainstem, a structure of vital importance in mammals, is currently becoming a principal focus in cognitive, affective, and clinical neuroscience. Midbrain, pontine and medullary structures serve as the conduit for signals between the forebrain and spinal cord, are the epicenter of cranial nerve-circuits and systems, and subserve such integrative functions as consciousness, emotional processing, pain, and motivation. In this study, we parcellated the nuclear masses and the principal fiber pathways that were visible in a high-resolution T2-weighted MRI dataset of 50-micron isotropic voxels of a postmortem human brainstem. Based on this analysis, we generated a detailed map of the human brainstem. To assess the validity of our maps, we compared our observations with histological maps of traditional human brainstem atlases. Given the unique capability of MRI-based morphometric analysis in generating and preserving the morphology of 3D objects from individual 2D sections, we reconstructed the motor, sensory and integrative neural systems of the brainstem and rendered them in 3D representations. We anticipate the utilization of these maps by the neuroimaging community for applications in basic neuroscience as well as in neurology, psychiatry, and neurosurgery, due to their versatile computational nature in 2D and 3D representations in a publicly available capacity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Aging and Neurodegenerative Disease: Is the Adaptive Immune System a Friend or Foe?</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.572090</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Neurodegenerative diseases of the central nervous system (CNS) are characterized by progressive neuronal death and neurological dysfunction, leading to increased disability and a loss of cognitive or motor functions. Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis have neurodegeneration as a primary feature. However, in other CNS diseases such as multiple sclerosis, stroke, traumatic brain injury, and spinal cord injury, neurodegeneration follows another insult, such as demyelination or ischaemia. Although there are different primary causes to these diseases, they all share a hallmark of neuroinflammation. Neuroinflammation can occur through the activation of resident immune cells such as microglia, cells of the innate and adaptive peripheral immune system, meningeal inflammation and autoantibodies directed toward components of the CNS. Despite chronic inflammation being pathogenic in these diseases, local inflammation after insult can also promote endogenous regenerative processes in the CNS, which are key to slowing disease progression. The normal aging process in the healthy brain is associated with a decline in physiological function, a steady increase in levels of neuroinflammation, brain shrinkage, and memory deficits. Likewise, aging is also a key contributor to the progression and exacerbation of neurodegenerative diseases. As there are associated co-morbidities within an aging population, pinpointing the precise relationship between aging and neurodegenerative disease progression can be a challenge. The CNS has historically been considered an isolated, “immune privileged” site, however, there is mounting evidence that adaptive immune cells are present in the CNS of both healthy individuals and diseased patients. Adaptive immune cells have also been implicated in both the degeneration and regeneration of the CNS. In this review, we will discuss the key role of the adaptive immune system in CNS degeneration and regeneration, with a focus on how aging influences this crosstalk.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Biology: Quantifying and contextualizing the impact of bioRxiv preprints through automated social media audience segmentation</title>

Engagement with scientific manuscripts is frequently facilitated by Twitter and other social media platforms. As such, the demographics of a paper's social media audience provide a wealth of information about how scholarly research is transmitted, consumed, and interpreted by online communities. By paying attention to public perceptions of their publications, scientists can learn whether their research is stimulating positive scholarly and public thought. They can also become aware of potentially negative patterns of interest from groups that misinterpret their work in harmful ways, either willfully or unintentionally, and devise strategies for altering their messaging to mitigate these impacts. In this study, we collected 331,696 Twitter posts referencing 1,800 highly tweeted bioRxiv preprints and leveraged topic modeling to infer the characteristics of various communities engaging with each preprint on Twitter. We agnostically learned the characteristics of these audience sectors from keywords each user’s followers provide in their Twitter biographies. We estimate that 96% of the preprints analyzed are dominated by academic audiences on Twitter, suggesting that social media attention does not always correspond to greater public exposure. We further demonstrate how our audience segmentation method can quantify the level of interest from nonspecialist audience sectors such as mental health advocates, dog lovers, video game developers, vegans, bitcoin investors, conspiracy theorists, journalists, religious groups, and political constituencies. Surprisingly, we also found that 10% of the preprints analyzed have sizable (&amp;gt;5%) audience sectors that are associated with right-wing white nationalist communities. Although none of these preprints appear to intentionally espouse any right-wing extremist messages, cases exist in which extremist appropriation comprises more than 50% of the tweets referencing a given preprint. These results present unique opportunities for improving and contextualizing the public discourse surrounding scientific research.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/y8swW83DbuM&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Biology: Evolutionary dynamics in the Anthropocene: Life history and intensity of human contact shape antipredator responses</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~3/4hD4AIRQKYc/article</link>

Humans profoundly impact landscapes, ecosystems, and animal behavior. In many cases, animals living near humans become tolerant of them and reduce antipredator responses. Yet, we still lack an understanding of the underlying evolutionary dynamics behind these shifts in traits that affect animal survival. Here, we used a phylogenetic meta-analysis to determine how the mean and variability in antipredator responses change as a function of the number of generations spent in contact with humans under 3 different contexts: urbanization, captivity, and domestication. We found that any contact with humans leads to a rapid reduction in mean antipredator responses as expected. Notably, the variance among individuals over time observed a short-term increase followed by a gradual decrease, significant for domesticated animals. This implies that intense human contact immediately releases animals from predation pressure and then imposes strong anthropogenic selection on traits. In addition, our results reveal that the loss of antipredator traits due to urbanization is similar to that of domestication but occurs 3 times more slowly. Furthermore, the rapid disappearance of antipredator traits was associated with 2 main life-history traits: foraging guild and whether the species was solitary or gregarious (i.e., group-living). For domesticated animals, this decrease in antipredator behavior was stronger for herbivores than for omnivores or carnivores and for solitary than for gregarious species. By contrast, the decrease in antipredator traits was stronger for gregarious, urbanized species, although this result is based mostly on birds. Our study offers 2 major insights on evolution in the Anthropocene: (1) changes in traits occur rapidly even under unintentional human “interventions” (i.e., urbanization) and (2) there are similarities between the selection pressures exerted by domestication and by urbanization. In all, such changes could affect animal survival in a predator-rich world, but through understanding evolutionary dynamics, we can better predict when and how exposure to humans modify these fitness-related traits.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/4hD4AIRQKYc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25904?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Congenital structural brain malformations have been described in patients with pathogenic &lt;i&gt;PTEN&lt;/i&gt; variants, but the frequency of cortical malformations in &lt;i&gt;PTEN&lt;/i&gt; variants and their impact on clinical phenotype are not well understood. Our goal was to systematically characterize brain malformations in patients with &lt;i&gt;PTEN&lt;/i&gt; variants and assess the relevance of their brain malformations to clinical presentation.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We systematically searched a local radiology database for patients with pathogenic &lt;i&gt;PTEN&lt;/i&gt; variants who had available brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). MRIs were reviewed systematically for cortical abnormalities. We reviewed EEG data and evaluated the electronic medical record to for evidence of epilepsy and developmental delay.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In total we identified 22 patients with &lt;i&gt;PTEN&lt;/i&gt; pathogenic variants for which brain MRIs were available (age range 0.4 years – 17 years). Twelve among these 22 (54%) had polymicrogyria (PMG). Variants associated with PMG or atypical gyration encoded regions of the phosphatase or C2 domains of PTEN. Interestingly, epilepsy was present in only 2 of the 12 patients with PMG. We found a trend toward higher rates of GDD, ID, and motor delay in individuals with cortical abnormalities, though cohort size limited statistical significance.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Malformations of cortical development, PMG in particular, represent an underrecognized phenotype associated with &lt;i&gt;PTEN&lt;/i&gt; pathogenic variants and may have an association with cognitive and motor delays. Epilepsy was infrequent compared to the high risk of epilepsy in patients with PMG reported previously.&lt;/p&gt;

	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ethanol exposure to the fetus during pregnancy can result in fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). These disorders vary in severity, can affect multiple organ systems, and can lead to lifelong disabilities. Damage to the central nervous system (CNS) is common in FASD, and can result in altered behavior and cognition. The incidence of FASD is alarmingly high, resulting in significant personal and societal costs. There are no cures for FASD. Alcohol can directly alter the function of neurons in the developing CNS. In addition, ethanol can alter the function of CNS glial cells including microglia and astrocytes which normally maintain homeostasis in the CNS. These glial cells can function as resident immune cells in the CNS to protect against pathogens and other insults. However, activation of glia can also damage CNS cells and lead to aberrant CNS function. Ethanol exposure to the developing brain can result in the activation of glia and neuroinflammation, which may contribute to the pathology associated with FASD. This suggests that anti‐inflammatory agents may be effective in the treatment of FASD.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Hippocampus: Downregulation of hyperpolarization‐activated cyclic nucleotide‐gated channels (HCN) in the hippocampus of patients with medial temporal lobe epilepsy and hippocampal sclerosis (MTLE‐HS)</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/hipo.23219?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Changes in the expression of HCN ion channels leading to changes in &lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt; function and neuronal excitability are considered to be possible mechanisms involved in epileptogenesis in kinds of human epilepsy. In previous animal studies of febrile seizures and temporal lobe epilepsy, changes in the expression of HCN1 and HCN2 channels at different time points and in different parts of the brain were not consistent, suggesting that transcriptional disorders involving HCNs play a crucial role in the epileptogenic process. Therefore, we aimed to assess the transcriptional regulation of HCN channels in Medial temporal lobe epilepsy with hippocampal sclerosis (MTLE‐HS) patients. This study included eight nonhippocampal sclerosis patients and 40 MTLE‐HS patients. The mRNA expression of HCN channels was evaluated by qRT‐PCR, while the protein expression was quantitatively analyzed by Western blotting. The subcellular localization of HCN channels in the hippocampus was explored by immunofluorescence. We demonstrated that the mRNA and protein expression of HCN1 and HCN2 are downregulated in controls compared to that in MTLE‐HS patients. In the hippocampal CA1/CA4 subregion and GCL, in addition to a large decrease in neurons, the expression of HCN1 and HCN2 on neuronal cell membranes was also downregulated in MTLE‐HS patients. These findings suggest that the expression of HCN channels are downregulated in MTLE‐HS, which indicates that the decline in HCN channels in the hippocampus during chronic epilepsy in MTLE‐HS patients leads to the downregulation of &lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt; current density and function, thereby reducing the inhibitory effect and increasing neuronal excitability and eventually causing disturbances in the electrical activity of neurons.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Hippocampus: Longitudinal development of hippocampal subregions from early‐ to mid‐childhood</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/hipo.23218?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Early childhood is characterized by vast changes in behaviors supported by the hippocampus and an increased susceptibility of the hippocampus to environmental influences. Thus, it is an important time to investigate the development of the hippocampus. Existing research suggests subregions of the hippocampus (i.e., head, body, tail) have dissociable functions and that the relations between subregions and cognitive abilities vary across development. However, longitudinal research examining age‐related changes in subregions in humans, particularly during early childhood (i.e., 4–6 years), is limited. Using a large sample of 184 healthy 4‐ to 8‐year‐old children, the present study is the first to characterize developmental changes in hippocampal subregion volume from early‐ to mid‐childhood. Results reveal differential developmental trajectories in hippocampal head, body, and tail during this period. Specifically, head volume showed a quadratic pattern of change, and both body and tail showed linear increases, resulting in a pattern of cubic change for total hippocampal volume. Further, main effects of sex on hippocampal volume (males &amp;gt; females) and hemispheric differences in developmental trajectories were observed. These findings provide an improved understanding of the development of the hippocampus and have important implications for research investigating a range of cognitive abilities and behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Hippocampus: The associations of the BDNF and APOE polymorphisms, hippocampal subfield volumes, and episodic memory performance across the lifespan</title>

	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this study, we explored the associations between the brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and the apolipoprotein E (APOE) polymorphisms and hippocampal subfields in 127 healthy participants (18–85 years). MRI datasets were collected on a 4.7 T system. Participants were administered the Wechsler Memory Scale to evaluate episodic memory function. Significant associations of both polymorphisms were present only in older adults (≥50 years). BDNF polymorphism was associated with larger dentate gyrus volumes within the anterior hippocampus (head) in Met‐carriers compared to Val/Val homozygotes. We found that in Met‐carriers total hippocampal volume predicted performance on visuospatial memory tasks. APOE polymorphism was associated with larger total hippocampal volume, especially in cornu ammonis 1–3 and subiculum in APOE ɛ2 carriers compared to both ɛ4 and ɛ3 carriers, while APOE ɛ3 and ɛ4 carriers did not differ from each other. APOE polymorphism was associated with better performance on visuospatial memory tasks in APOE ε2 carriers in comparison to ε4 carriers.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Hippocampus: Amygdala and ventral tegmental area differentially interact with hippocampus and cortical medial temporal lobe during rest in humans</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/hipo.23216?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neuromodulatory regions that detect salience, such as amygdala and ventral tegmental area (VTA), have distinct effects on memory. Yet, questions remain about how these modulatory regions target subregions across the hippocampus and medial temporal lobe (MTL) cortex. Here, we sought to characterize how VTA and amygdala subregions (i.e., basolateral amygdala and central‐medial amygdala) interact with hippocampus head, body, and tail, as well as cortical MTL areas of perirhinal cortex and parahippocampal cortex in a task‐free state. To quantify these interactions, we used high‐resolution resting state fMRI and characterized pair‐wise, partial correlations across regions‐of‐interest. We found that basolateral amygdala showed greater functional coupling with hippocampus head, hippocampus tail, and perirhinal cortex when compared to either VTA or central‐medial amygdala. Furthermore, the VTA showed greater functional coupling with hippocampus tail when compared to central‐medial amygdala. There were no significant differences in functional coupling with hippocampus body and parahippocampal cortex. These results support a framework by which neuromodulatory regions do not indiscriminately influence all MTL subregions equally, but rather bias information processing to discrete MTL targets. These findings provide a more specified model of the intrinsic properties of systems underlying MTL neuromodulation. This emphasizes the need to consider heterogeneity both across and within neuromodulatory systems to better understand affective memory.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Hippocampus: Altered hippocampal centrality and dynamic anatomical covariance of intracortical microstructure in first episode psychosis</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/hipo.23215?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hippocampal circuitry has been posited to be fundamental to positive symptoms in psychosis, but its contributions to other factors important for outcome remains unclear. We hypothesized that longitudinal changes in the hippocampal circuit and concomitant changes of intracortical microstructure are altered in first episode psychosis (FEP) patients and that such changes are associated with negative symptoms and verbal memory. Longitudinal brain scans (2–4 visits over 3–15 months) were acquired for 27 FEP and 29 age‐ and sex‐matched healthy controls. Quantitative T1 maps, sensitive to myelin content, were used to sample the microstructure of the hippocampal subfields and output circuitry (fimbria, alveus, fornix, mammillary bodies), and intracortical regions. Dynamic anatomical covariance in pair‐wise regional trajectories were assessed for each subject, and graph theory was used to calculate a participation coefficient metric that quantifies the similarity/divergence between hippocampal and intracortical microstructure. The mean participation coefficient of the hippocampus was significantly reduced in FEP patients compared with controls, reflecting differences in output hippocampal regions. Importantly, lower participation coefficient of the hippocampal circuit was associated with worse negative symptoms, a relationship that was mediated by changes in verbal memory. This study provides evidence for reduced hippocampal centrality in FEP and concomitant changes in intracortical anatomy. Myelin‐rich output regions of the hippocampus may be an important biological trigger in early psychosis, with cascading effects on broader cortical networks and resultant clinical profiles.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Hippocampus: Synchronicity of excitatory inputs drives hippocampal networks to distinct oscillatory patterns</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/hipo.23214?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rodent hippocampus expresses a variety of neuronal network oscillations depending on the behavioral state of the animal. Locomotion and active exploration are accompanied by theta‐nested gamma oscillations while resting states and slow‐wave sleep are dominated by intermittent sharp wave‐ripple complexes. It is believed that gamma rhythms create a framework for efficient acquisition of information whereas sharp wave‐ripples are thought to be involved in consolidation and retrieval of memory. While not strictly mutually exclusive, one of the two patterns usually dominates in a given behavioral state. Here we explore how different input patterns induce either of the two network states, using an optogenetic stimulation approach in hippocampal brain slices of mice. We report that the pattern of the evoked oscillation depends strongly on the initial synchrony of activation of excitatory cells within CA3. Short, synchronous activation favors the emergence of sharp wave‐ripple complexes while persistent but less synchronous activity—as typical for sensory input during exploratory behavior—supports the generation of gamma oscillations. This dichotomy is reflected by different degrees of synchrony of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic currents within these two states. Importantly, the induction of these two fundamental network patterns does not depend on the presence of any neuromodulatory transmitter like acetylcholine, but is merely based on a different synchrony in the initial activation pattern.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Hippocampus: Frequency‐ and state‐dependent effects of hippocampal neural disinhibition on hippocampal local field potential oscillations in anesthetized rats</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/hipo.23212?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reduced inhibitory GABA function, so‐called neural disinhibition, has been implicated in cognitive disorders, including schizophrenia and age‐related cognitive decline. We previously showed in rats that hippocampal disinhibition by local microinfusion of the GABA‐A receptor antagonist picrotoxin disrupted memory and attention and enhanced hippocampal multi‐unit burst firing recorded around the infusion site under isoflurane anesthesia. Here, we analyzed the hippocampal local field potential (LFP) recorded alongside the multi‐unit data. We predicted frequency‐specific LFP changes, based on previous studies implicating GABA in hippocampal oscillations, with the weight of evidence suggesting that disinhibition would facilitate theta and disrupt gamma oscillations. Using a new semi‐automated method based on the kurtosis of the LFP peak‐amplitude distribution as well as on amplitude envelope thresholding, we separated three distinct hippocampal LFP states under isoflurane anesthesia: “burst” and “suppression” states—high‐amplitude LFP spike bursts and the interspersed low‐amplitudeperiods—and a medium‐amplitude “continuous” state. The burst state showed greater overall power than suppression and continuous states and higher relative delta/theta power, but lower relative beta/gamma power. The burst state also showed reduced functional connectivity across the hippocampal recording area, especially around theta and beta frequencies. Overall neuronal firing was higher in the burst than the other two states, whereas the proportion of burst firing was higher in burst and continuous states than the suppression state. Disinhibition caused state‐ and frequency‐dependent LFP changes, tending to increase power at lower frequencies (&amp;lt;20 Hz), but to decrease power and connectivity at higher frequencies (&amp;gt;20 Hz) in burst and suppression states. The disinhibition‐induced enhancement of multi‐unit bursting was also state‐dependent, tending to be more pronounced in burst and suppression states than the continuous state. Overall, we characterized three distinct hippocampal LFP states in isoflurane‐anesthetized rats. Disinhibition changed hippocampal LFP oscillations in a state‐ and frequency‐dependent way. Moreover, the disinhibition‐induced enhancement of multi‐unit bursting was also LFP state‐dependent.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

&lt;p&gt;A 19‐to‐16 million year old natural endocast of an odontocete whale is described and compared. The exceptional preservation allowed the identification of major neural and vascular characters opening a window into the cetacean brain evolution. The encephalization quotient and other statistical analyses revealed that this endocast belonged to a well encephalized, early‐diverging toothed whale and helped in interpreting a number of morphological changes in odontocete brain evolution.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The natural endocast Museo di Geologia e Paleontologia of the Università degli Studi di Torino (MGPT)‐PU 13873 is described and analyzed in order to interpret its taxonomic affinities and its potential significance on our understanding of cetacean brain evolution. The endocast is from the early Miocene of Piedmont (between ca. 19 and 16 million years ago), Northwestern Italy, and shows a number of plesiomorphic characters. These include: scarcely rounded cerebral hemispheres, cerebellum exposed in dorsal view with little superimposition by the cerebral hemispheres, short temporal lobe, and long sylvian fissure. The distance between the hypophysis and the rostral pons is particularly high, as it was determined by the calculus of the hypothalamus quotient, suggesting that the development of a deep interpeduncular fossa was not as advanced as in living odontocetes. The encephalization quotient (EQ) of MGPT‐PU 13873 is ~1.81; therefore, this specimen shows an EQ in line with other fossil whales of the same geological age (early Miocene). Comparative analysis shows that there is a critical lack of data from the late Miocene and Pliocene that prevents us to fully understand the recent evolution of the EQ diversity in whales. Moreover, the past diversity of brain size and shape in mysticetes is virtually unknown. All these observations point to the need of additional efforts to uncover evolutionary patterns and processes on cetacean brain evolution.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Cell Reports: Current Issue: SFPQ Depletion Is Synthetically Lethal with BRAFV600E in Colorectal Cancer Cells</title>
	<link>https://www.cell.com/cell-reports/fulltext/S2211-1247(20)31173-6?rss=yes</link>
	<content:encoded>BRAFV600E-mutant colorectal cancer lacks therapeutic options. Klotz-Noack et al. find that BRAFV600E sensitizes cancer cells to SFPQ loss. Depletion of SFPQ causes R-loop formation, replication stress, Chk1-mediated intra-S-phase checkpoint activation, and apoptosis. Relevant for therapy, the study shows that inhibition of Chk1 sensitizes BRAFV600E-mutant cancer cells to replication stress.</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Biology: Encoding of social exploration by neural ensembles in the insular cortex</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~3/fP2gnP6B3TE/article</link>

The insular cortex (IC) participates in diverse complex brain functions, including social function, yet their cellular bases remain to be fully understood. Using microendoscopic calcium imaging of the agranular insular cortex (AI) in mice interacting with freely moving and restrained social targets, we identified 2 subsets of AI neurons—a larger fraction of “Social-ON” cells and a smaller fraction of “Social-OFF” cells—that change their activity in opposite directions during social exploration. Social-ON cells included those that represented social investigation independent of location and consisted of multiple subsets, each of which was preferentially active during exploration under a particular behavioral state or with a particular target of physical contact. These results uncover a previously unknown function of AI neurons that may act to monitor the ongoing status of social exploration while an animal interacts with unfamiliar conspecifics.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/fP2gnP6B3TE&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: Efferent projections of Vglut2, Foxp2, and Pdyn parabrachial neurons in mice</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/cne.24975?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;img alt=&quot;Efferent projections of Vglut2, Foxp2, and Pdyn parabrachial neurons in mice&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/ee5f59ec-cce9-40ce-8289-ee94fa744d8a/cne24975-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The parabrachial nucleus surrounds the superior cerebellar peduncle at the midbrain‐hindbrain junction. Its glutamatergic neurons form subpopulations with distinct genetic identities, two of which express &lt;i&gt;Foxp2&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Pdyn&lt;/i&gt;. Here, we detail the location of &lt;i&gt;Foxp2&lt;/i&gt;‐ and &lt;i&gt;Pdyn&lt;/i&gt;‐expressing neurons within the larger &lt;i&gt;Vglut2&lt;/i&gt;‐expressing population. We then use Cre‐conditional expression of synaptophysin‐mCherry to map the efferent projections of each population. Salient findings include the identification of glutamatergic output from the parabrachial nucleus to the rostral entorhinal cortex and lateral superior colliculus, plus an absence of &lt;i&gt;Foxp2&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;Pdyn&lt;/i&gt; output to the cerebral cortex, basal forebrain, and amygdala.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The parabrachial nucleus (PB) is a complex structure located at the junction of the midbrain and hindbrain. Its neurons have diverse genetic profiles and influence a variety of homeostatic functions. While its cytoarchitecture and overall efferent projections are known, we lack comprehensive information on the projection patterns of specific neuronal subtypes in the PB. In this study, we compared the projection patterns of glutamatergic neurons here with a subpopulation expressing the transcription factor &lt;i&gt;Foxp2&lt;/i&gt; and a further subpopulation expressing the neuropeptide &lt;i&gt;Pdyn&lt;/i&gt;. To do this, we injected an AAV into the PB region to deliver a Cre‐dependent anterograde tracer (synaptophysin‐mCherry) in three different strains of Cre‐driver mice. We then analyzed 147 neuroanatomical regions for labeled boutons in every brain (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 11). Overall, glutamatergic neurons in the PB region project to a wide variety of sites in the cerebral cortex, basal forebrain, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, amygdala, diencephalon, and brainstem. &lt;i&gt;Foxp2&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Pdyn&lt;/i&gt; subpopulations project heavily to the hypothalamus, but not to the cortex, basal forebrain, or amygdala. Among the few differences between &lt;i&gt;Foxp2&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Pdyn&lt;/i&gt; cases was a notable lack of &lt;i&gt;Pdyn&lt;/i&gt; projections to the ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus. Our results indicate that genetic identity determines connectivity (and therefore, function), providing a framework for mapping all PB output projections based on the genetic identity of its neurons. Using genetic markers to systematically classify PB neurons and their efferent projections will enhance the translation of research findings from experimental animals to humans.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Hypersensitivity to Calcitonin Gene‐Related Peptide in Post‐Traumatic Headache</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25915?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To demonstrate that calcitonin gene‐related peptide (CGRP) induces headache exacerbation with migraine‐like features in patients with persistent post‐traumatic headache (PTH) attributed to mild traumatic brain injury (TBI).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled, 2‐way crossover study. Analyses were intention‐to‐treat. Eligible patients were aged 18 to 65 years and had a history of persistent PTH after mild TBI for at least 12 months. Patients were randomized to receive intravenous infusion 1.5 μg/min of CGRP or placebo (isotonic saline) over 20 minutes on two separate experimental days. A 12‐hour observational period was used to evaluate the following outcomes: 1) difference in incidence of headache exacerbation with migraine‐like features, 2) difference in area under the curve for headache intensity scores.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thirty patients (mean age, 37 years; 25 women [83%]) were randomized and completed the study. During the 12‐hour observational period, 21 of 30 patients (70%) developed headache exacerbation with migraine‐like features after CGRP, compared with six patients (20%) after placebo (&lt;i&gt;P &amp;lt; 0.001&lt;/i&gt;). The baseline‐corrected area under the curve for headache intensity scores was significantly larger after CGRP, compared with placebo (&lt;i&gt;P &amp;lt; 0.001&lt;/i&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patients with persistent PTH are hypersensitive to CGRP, which underscores its pathophysiological importance. Furthermore, CGRP‐targeted therapies might provide a novel mechanism‐based treatment option for patients with persistent PTH.&lt;/p&gt;
