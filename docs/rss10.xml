	<content:encoded>The neuromuscular junction (NMJ) is a specialized synapse that is the point of connection between motor neurons and skeletal muscle. Although developmental studies have established the importance of cell–cell communication at the NMJ for the integrity and full functionality of this synapse, the contribution of this structure as a primary driver in motor neuron disease pathogenesis remains uncertain. Here, we consider the biology of the NMJ and review emerging lines of investigation that are highlighting the importance of cell–cell interaction at the NMJ in spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), X-linked spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).</content:encoded>

	<title>arXiv: Quantitative Biology: Neurons and Cognition: Searching for long time scales without fine tuning. (arXiv:2008.11674v1 [physics.bio-ph])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2008.11674</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Most of animal and human behavior occurs on time scales much longer than the
response times of individual neurons. In many cases it is plausible that these
long time scales emerge from the recurrent dynamics of electrical activity in
networks of neurons. In linear models, time scales are set by the eigenvalues
of a dynamical matrix whose elements measure the strengths of synaptic
connections between neurons. It is not clear to what extent these matrix
elements need to be tuned in order to generate long time scales; in some cases,
one needs not just a single long time scale but a whole range. Starting from
the simplest case of random symmetric connections, we combine maximum entropy
and random matrix theory methods to construct ensembles of networks, exploring
the constraints required for long time scales to become generic. We argue that
a single long time scale can emerge generically from realistic constraints, but
a full spectrum of slow modes requires more tuning. Langevin dynamics that will
generate patterns of synaptic connections drawn from these ensembles involve a
combination of Hebbian learning and activity-dependent synaptic scaling.

	<title>arXiv: Computer Science: Neural and Evolutionary Computing: Large-scale neuromorphic optoelectronic computing with a reconfigurable diffractive processing unit. (arXiv:2008.11659v1 [eess.IV])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2008.11659</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Application-specific optical processors have been considered disruptive
technologies for modern computing that can fundamentally accelerate the
development of artificial intelligence (AI) by offering substantially improved
computing performance. Recent advancements in optical neural network
architectures for neural information processing have been applied to perform
various machine learning tasks. However, the existing architectures have
limited complexity and performance; and each of them requires its own dedicated
design that cannot be reconfigured to switch between different neural network
models for different applications after deployment. Here, we propose an
optoelectronic reconfigurable computing paradigm by constructing a diffractive
processing unit (DPU) that can efficiently support different neural networks
and achieve a high model complexity with millions of neurons. It allocates
almost all of its computational operations optically and achieves extremely
high speed of data modulation and large-scale network parameter updating by
dynamically programming optical modulators and photodetectors. We demonstrated
the reconfiguration of the DPU to implement various diffractive feedforward and
recurrent neural networks and developed a novel adaptive training approach to
circumvent the system imperfections. We applied the trained networks for
high-speed classifying of handwritten digit images and human action videos over
benchmark datasets, and the experimental results revealed a comparable
classification accuracy to the electronic computing approaches. Furthermore,
our prototype system built with off-the-shelf optoelectronic components
surpasses the performance of state-of-the-art graphics processing units (GPUs)
by several times on computing speed and more than an order of magnitude on
system energy efficiency.

	<title>arXiv: Computer Science: Neural and Evolutionary Computing: Robust robotic control on the neuromorphic research chip Loihi. (arXiv:2008.11642v1 [cs.NE])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2008.11642</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Neuromorphic hardware has several promising advantages compared to von
Neumann architectures and is highly interesting for robot control. However,
despite the high speed and energy efficiency of neuromorphic computing,
algorithms utilizing this hardware in control scenarios are still missing. One
problem is the transition from fast spiking activity on the hardware, which
acts on a timescale of a few milliseconds, to a control-relevant timescale on
the order of hundreds of milliseconds. Another problem is to enable the
execution of complex trajectories, requiring the spiking activity to contain
sufficient variability, while at the same time, for reliable performance,
network dynamics require adequate robustness against noise. In this study we
exploit a recently developed biologically-inspired spiking neural network
model, the so-called anisotropic network, as the basis for a neuromorphic
algorithm for robotic control. For this, we identified and transferred the core

neuromorphic research chip Loihi and validated the system on trajectories from
a motor-control task performed by a robot arm. We show that the anisotropic
network on Loihi reliably encodes sequential patterns of neural activity, each
representing a robotic action, and that the patterns allow the generation of
multidimensional trajectories on control-relevant timescales. Taken together,
our study presents a new algorithm that allows the control of complex robotic
movements using state of the art neuromorphic hardware.

	<title>arXiv: Computer Science: Neural and Evolutionary Computing: Assessment of Reward Functions for Reinforcement Learning Traffic Signal Control under Real-World Limitations. (arXiv:2008.11634v1 [cs.AI])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2008.11634</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Adaptive traffic signal control is one key avenue for mitigating the growing
consequences of traffic congestion. Incumbent solutions such as SCOOT and SCATS
require regular and time-consuming calibration, can't optimise well for
multiple road use modalities, and require the manual curation of many
implementation plans. A recent alternative to these approaches are deep
reinforcement learning algorithms, in which an agent learns how to take the
most appropriate action for a given state of the system. This is guided by
neural networks approximating a reward function that provides feedback to the
agent regarding the performance of the actions taken, making it sensitive to
the specific reward function chosen. Several authors have surveyed the reward
functions used in the literature, but attributing outcome differences to reward
function choice across works is problematic as there are many uncontrolled
differences, as well as different outcome metrics. This paper compares the
performance of agents using different reward functions in a simulation of a
junction in Greater Manchester, UK, across various demand profiles, subject to
real world constraints: realistic sensor inputs, controllers, calibrated
demand, intergreen times and stage sequencing. The reward metrics considered
are based on the time spent stopped, lost time, change in lost time, average
speed, queue length, junction throughput and variations of these magnitudes.
The performance of these reward functions is compared in terms of total waiting
time. We find that speed maximisation resulted in the lowest average waiting
times across all demand levels, displaying significantly better performance
than other rewards previously introduced in the literature.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2008.11545</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;We present experimental results on the effects of using quantum or 'truly'
random numbers, as opposed to pseudorandom numbers, in a system that exhibits
computational creativity (given its ability to compose original chess
problems). The results indicate that using quantum random numbers too often or
too seldom in the composing process does not have any positive effect on the
output generated. Interestingly, there is a 'sweet spot' of using quantum
random numbers 15% of the time that results in fewer statistical outliers.
Overall, it would appear that there may indeed be a slight advantage to using
quantum random numbers in such a system and this may also be true in other
systems that exhibit computational creativity. The benefits of doing so should,
however, be weighed against the overhead of obtaining quantum random numbers in
contrast to a pseudorandom number generator that is likely more convenient to
incorporate.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2008.11491</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The human brain uses selective attention to filter perceptual input so that
only the components that are useful for behaviour are processed using its
limited computational resources. We focus on one particular form of visual
attention known as feature-based attention, which is concerned with identifying
features of the visual input that are important for the current task regardless
of their spatial location. Visual feature-based attention has been proposed to
improve the efficiency of Reinforcement Learning (RL) by reducing the
dimensionality of state representations and guiding learning towards relevant
features. Despite achieving human level performance in complex perceptual-motor
tasks, Deep RL algorithms have been consistently criticised for their poor
efficiency and lack of flexibility. Visual feature-based attention therefore
represents one option for addressing these criticisms. Nevertheless, it is
still an open question how the brain is able to learn which features to attend
to during RL. To help answer this question we propose a novel algorithm, termed
Selective Particle Attention (SPA), which imbues a Deep RL agent with the
ability to perform selective feature-based attention. SPA learns which
combinations of features to attend to based on their bottom-up saliency and how
accurately they predict future reward. We evaluate SPA on a multiple choice
task and a 2D video game that both involve raw pixel input and dynamic changes
to the task structure. We show various benefits of SPA over approaches that
naively attend to either all or random subsets of features. Our results
demonstrate (1) how visual feature-based attention in Deep RL models can
improve their learning efficiency and ability to deal with sudden changes in
task structure and (2) that particle filters may represent a viable
computational account of how visual feature-based attention occurs in the
brain.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;We introduce a novel variant of cutting production planning problems named
Integrated Cutting and Packing Heterogeneous Precast Beams Multiperiod
Production Planning (ICP-HPBMPP). We propose an integer linear programming
model for the ICP-HPBMPP, as well as a lower bound for its optimal objective
function value, which is empirically shown to be closer to the optimal solution
value than the bound obtained from the linear relaxation of the model. We also
propose a genetic algorithm approach for the ICP-HPBMPP as an alternative
solution method. We discuss computational experiments and propose a
parameterization for the genetic algorithm using D-optimal experimental design.
We observe good performance of the exact approach when solving small-sized
instances, although there are difficulties in finding optimal solutions for
medium and large-sized problems, or even in finding feasible solutions for
large instances. On the other hand, the genetic algorithm could find
good-quality solutions for large-sized instances within short computing times.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2008.11298</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;\textit{Deep Neural Networks} (DNNs) have been shown to be prone to
adversarial attacks. With a growing need to enable intelligence in embedded
devices in this \textit{Internet of Things} (IoT) era, secure hardware
implementation of DNNs has become imperative. Memristive crossbars, being able
to perform \textit{Matrix-Vector-Multiplications} (MVMs) efficiently, are used
to realize DNNs on hardware. However, crossbar non-idealities have always been
devalued since they cause errors in performing MVMs, leading to degradation in
the accuracy of the DNNs. Several software-based adversarial defenses have been
proposed in the past to make DNNs adversarially robust. However, no previous
work has demonstrated the advantage conferred by the non-idealities present in
analog crossbars in terms of adversarial robustness. In this work, we show that
the intrinsic hardware variations manifested through crossbar non-idealities
yield adversarial robustness to the mapped DNNs without any additional
optimization. We evaluate resilience of state-of-the-art DNNs (VGG8 \&amp;amp; VGG16
networks) using benchmark datasets (CIFAR-10 \&amp;amp; CIFAR-100) across various
crossbar sizes towards both hardware and software adversarial attacks. We find
that crossbar non-idealities unleash greater adversarial robustness
($&amp;gt;10-20\%$) in DNNs than baseline software DNNs. We further assess the
performance of our approach with other state-of-the-art efficiency-driven
adversarial defenses and find that our approach performs significantly well in
terms of reducing adversarial losses.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Vocal arousal, the non-linear acoustic features taken on by human and animal
vocalizations when highly aroused, has an important communicative function
because it signals aversive states such as fear, pain or distress. In this
work, we present a computationally-efficient, real-time voice transformation
algorithm, ANGUS, which uses amplitude modulation and time-domain filtering to
simulate roughness, an important component of vocal arousal, in arbitrary voice
recordings. In a series of 4 studies, we show that ANGUS allows parametric
control over the spectral features of roughness like the presence of
sub-harmonics and noise; that ANGUS increases the emotional negativity
perceived by listeners, to a comparable level as a non-real-time
analysis/resynthesis algorithm from the state-of-the-art; that listeners cannot
distinguish transformed and non-transformed sounds above chance level; and that
ANGUS has a similar emotional effect on animal vocalizations and musical
instrument sounds than on human vocalizations. A real-time implementation of
ANGUS is made available as open-source software, for use in experimental
emotion reseach and affective computing.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Text classification has become increasingly challenging due to the continuous
refinement of classification label granularity and the expansion of
classification label scale. To address that, some research has been applied
onto strategies that exploit the hierarchical structure in problems with a
large number of categories. At present, hierarchical text classification (HTC)
has received extensive attention and has broad application prospects. Making
full use of the relationship between parent category and child category in text
classification task can greatly improve the performance of classification. In
this paper, We propose a joint embedding of text and parent category based on
hierarchical fine-tuning ordered neurons LSTM (HFT-ONLSTM) for HTC. Our method
makes full use of the connection between the upper-level and lower-level
labels. Experiments show that our model outperforms the state-of-the-art

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s disease (AD), a chronic multifactorial and complex neurodegenerative disorder is a leading cause of dementia. Recently, neuroinflammation has been hypothesized as a contributing factor to AD pathogenesis. The role of adaptive immune responses against neuronal antigens, which can either confer protection or induce damage in AD, has not been fully characterized. Here, we measured T cell responses to several potential antigens of neural origin including amyloid precursor protein (APP), amyloid beta (Aβ), tau, α-synuclein, and transactive response DNA binding protein (TDP-43) in patients with AD and age-matched healthy controls (HC). Antigen-specific T cell reactivity was detected for all tested antigens, and response to tau-derived epitopes was particularly strong, but no significant differences between individuals with AD and age-matched HC were identified. We also did not observe any correlation between the antigen-specific T cell responses and clinical variables including age, gender, years since diagnosis and cognitive score. Additionally, further characterization did not reveal any differences in the relative frequency of major Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMC) subsets, or in the expression of genes between AD patients and HC. These observations have not identified a key role of neuronal antigen-specific T cell responses in AD.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00357</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A single session of anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) has been shown to increase arousal in healthy participants for up to 24 h post-stimulation. However, little is known about the effects of tDCS on subsequent sleep in this population. Based on previous clinical studies, we hypothesized that anodal stimulation to the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (lDLPFC) would produce higher arousal with decreased sleep time and stimulation to the primary motor cortex (M1) would have the converse effect. Thirty-six active duty military were randomized into one of three groups (n = 12/group); active anodal tDCS over the lDLPFC, active anodal tDCS over left M1, or sham tDCS. Participants answered questionnaires 3 times a day and wore a wrist activity monitor (WAM) to measure sleep time and efficiency for 3 weeks. On weeks 2 and 3 (order counterbalance), participants received stimulation at 1800 h before 26 h of sustained wakefulness testing (sleep deprived) and at 1800 h without sleep deprivation (non-sleep deprived). There were no significant effects for the non-sleep deprived portion of testing. For the sleep deprived portion of testing, there were main effects of group and night on sleep time. The DLPFC group slept less than the other groups on the second and third night following stimulation. There is no negative effect on mood or sleep quality from a single dose of tDCS when participants have normal sleep patterns (i.e., non-sleep deprived portion of testing). The results suggest that stimulation may result in faster recovery from fatigue caused by acute periods of sleep deprivation, as their recovery sleep periods were less.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: The Association Between Amygdala Subfield-Related Functional Connectivity and Stigma Reduction 12 Months After Social Contacts: A Functional Neuroimaging Study in a Subgroup of a Randomized Controlled Trial</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00356</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Social contact is one of the best methods for reducing stigma, and the effect may be associated with emotional response and social cognition. The amygdala is a key region of these functions and can be divided into three subregions, each of which has a different function and connectivity. We investigated whether the amygdala subregion-related functional connectivity is associated with the effect of anti-stigma interventions on reducing mental health-related stigma in a randomized controlled trial (RCT) over 12 months. Healthy young adults [n = 77, age, mean (SD) = 21.23 (0.94) years; male, n = 48], who were subsampled from an RCT (n = 259) investigating the effect of anti-stigma interventions, using filmed social contacts (FSC) or internet self-learning (INS), on reducing stigma, underwent 10 min resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging between the trial registration and 12 months follow-up. The extent of stigma was assessed at the baseline, post-intervention and 12 month follow-up surveys, using the Japanese-language version of the Social Distance Scale (SDSJ), to assess negative emotional attitude toward people with schizophrenia. We compared associations between amygdala subregion-related functional connectivity and changes in the SDSJ scores for 12 months across the control, INS, and FSC groups. Associations between the change in stigma for 12 months and the superficial (SF) subregion of the amygdala-related connectivity in the intracalcarine cortex [(x, y, z) = (−8, −66, 12), z = 4.21, P&lt;sub&gt;FWE–corrected&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.0003, cluster size = 192] differed across groups. The post hoc analysis showed that the SF–intracalcarine cortex connectivity was negatively correlated with the change in stigma only in the FSC group. The current results indicate that greater SF–intracalcarine cortex connectivity is associated with a better response to the FSC interventions, suggesting that biological variability could underlie the long-term effect of anti-stigma interventions on stigma in the real world.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00320</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;This paper explores in parallel the underlying mechanisms in human perception of biological motion and the best approaches for automatic classification of gait. The experiments tested three different learning paradigms, namely, biological, biomimetic, and non-biomimetic models for gender identification from human gait. Psychophysical experiments with twenty-one observers were conducted along with computational experiments without applying any gender specific modifications to the models or the stimuli. Results demonstrate the utilization of a generic memory based learning system in humans for gait perception, thus reducing ambiguity between two opposing learning systems proposed for biological motion perception. Results also support the biomimetic nature of memory based artificial neural networks (ANN) in their ability to emulate biological neural networks, as opposed to non-biomimetic models. In addition, the comparison between biological and computational learning approaches establishes a memory based biomimetic model as the best candidate for a generic artificial gait classifier (83% accuracy, p &amp;lt; 0.001), compared to human observers (66%, p &amp;lt; 0.005) or non-biomimetic models (83%, p &amp;lt; 0.001) while adhering to human-like sensitivity to gender identification, promising potential for application of the model in any given non-gender based gait perception objective with superhuman performance.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00306</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Aim: This systematic review and meta-analysis investigated neurophysiological responses using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) following a concussion or sub-concussion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: A systematic searching of relevant databases for peer-reviewed literature quantifying motor evoked potentials from TMS between 1999 and 2019 was performed. A meta-analysis quantified pooled data for measures including motor threshold, motor latency, and motor evoked potential amplitude and for inhibitory measures such as cortical silent period duration, short-interval intracortical inhibition (SICI), and long-interval intracortical inhibition (LICI) ratios.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Fifteen articles met the inclusion criteria. The studies were arbitrarily classified into the groups, based on time post-concussion, “acute” (subjects 0–3 months post-injury, n = 8) and “post-acute” (3 months−2 years post-concussion, n = 7). A TMS quality of study checklist rated studies from moderate to high in methodological quality; however, the risk of bias analysis found that the included studies were categorised as high risk of bias, particularly for a lack of allocation concealment and blinding of participants in the methodologies. A meta-analysis showed no differences in excitability measures, apart from a decreased motor threshold that was observed in the concussed group (SMD −0.28, 95% CI −0.51 to −0.04; P = 0.02) for the post-acute time frame. Conversely, all inhibitory measures showed differences between groups. Cortical silent period duration was found to be significantly increased in the acute (SMD 1.19, 95% CI 0.58–1.81; P &amp;lt; 0.001) and post-acute (SMD 0.55, 95% CI 0.12–0.98; P = 0.01) time frames. The SICI (SMD −1.15, 95% CI −1.95 to −0.34; P = 0.005) and LICI (SMD −1.95, 95% CI −3.04 to −0.85; P = 0.005) ratios were reduced, inferring increased inhibition, for the post-acute time frame.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: This systematic review and meta-analysis demonstrates that inhibitory pathways are affected in the acute period post-concussion. However, persistent alterations in cortical excitability remain, with increased intracortical inhibition. While TMS should be considered as a reliable technique to measure the functional integrity of the central nervous system, the high risk of bias and heterogeneity in data suggest that future studies should aim to incorporate standardised methodological techniques, particularly with threshold determination and stimulus intervals for paired-pulse measures.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: The Inflamed Brain in Schizophrenia: The Convergence of Genetic and Environmental Risk Factors That Lead to Uncontrolled Neuroinflammation</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00274</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Schizophrenia is a disorder with a heterogeneous etiology involving complex interplay between genetic and environmental risk factors. The immune system is now known to play vital roles in nervous system function and pathology through regulating neuronal and glial development, synaptic plasticity, and behavior. In this regard, the immune system is positioned as a common link between the seemingly diverse genetic and environmental risk factors for schizophrenia. Synthesizing information about how the immune-brain axis is affected by multiple factors and how these factors might interact in schizophrenia is necessary to better understand the pathogenesis of this disease. Such knowledge will aid in the development of more translatable animal models that may lead to effective therapeutic interventions. Here, we provide an overview of the genetic risk factors for schizophrenia that modulate immune function. We also explore environmental factors for schizophrenia including exposure to pollution, gut dysbiosis, maternal immune activation and early-life stress, and how the consequences of these risk factors are linked to microglial function and dysfunction. We also propose that morphological and signaling deficits of the blood-brain barrier, as observed in some individuals with schizophrenia, can act as a gateway between peripheral and central nervous system inflammation, thus affecting microglia in their essential functions. Finally, we describe the diverse roles that microglia play in response to neuroinflammation and their impact on brain development and homeostasis, as well as schizophrenia pathophysiology.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Secreted Chaperones in Neurodegeneration</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00268</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Protein homeostasis, or proteostasis, is a combination of cellular processes that govern protein quality control, namely, protein translation, folding, processing, and degradation. Disruptions in these processes can lead to protein misfolding and aggregation. Proteostatic disruption can lead to cellular changes such as endoplasmic reticulum or oxidative stress; organelle dysfunction; and, if continued, to cell death. A majority of neurodegenerative diseases involve the pathologic aggregation of proteins that subverts normal neuronal function. While prior reviews of neuronal proteostasis in neurodegenerative processes have focused on cytoplasmic chaperones, there is increasing evidence that chaperones secreted both by neurons and other brain cells in the extracellular – including transsynaptic – space play important roles in neuronal proteostasis. In this review, we will introduce various secreted chaperones involved in neurodegeneration. We begin with clusterin and discuss its identification in various protein aggregates, and the use of increased cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) clusterin as a potential biomarker and as a potential therapeutic. Our next secreted chaperone is progranulin; polymorphisms in this gene represent a known genetic risk factor for frontotemporal lobar degeneration, and progranulin overexpression has been found to be effective in reducing Alzheimer’s- and Parkinson’s-like neurodegenerative phenotypes in mouse models. We move on to BRICHOS domain-containing proteins, a family of proteins containing highly potent anti-amyloidogenic activity; we summarize studies describing the biochemical mechanisms by which recombinant BRICHOS protein might serve as a therapeutic agent. The next section of the review is devoted to the secreted chaperones 7B2 and proSAAS, small neuronal proteins which are packaged together with neuropeptides and released during synaptic activity. Since proteins can be secreted by both classical secretory and non-classical mechanisms, we also review the small heat shock proteins (sHsps) that can be secreted from the cytoplasm to the extracellular environment and provide evidence for their involvement in extracellular proteostasis and neuroprotection. Our goal in this review focusing on extracellular chaperones in neurodegenerative disease is to summarize the most recent literature relating to neurodegeneration for each secreted chaperone; to identify any common mechanisms; and to point out areas of similarity as well as differences between the secreted chaperones identified to date.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00265</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is pathologically defined by extracellular accumulation of amyloid-β (Aβ) peptides generated by the cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP), strings of hyperphosphorylated Tau proteins accumulating inside neurons known as neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) and neuronal loss. The association between the two hallmarks and cognitive decline has been known since the beginning of the 20th century when the first description of the disease was carried out by Alois Alzheimer. Today, more than 40 million people worldwide are affected by AD that represents the most common cause of dementia and there is still no effective treatment available to cure the disease. In general, the aggregation of Aβ is considered an essential trigger in AD pathogenesis that gives rise to NFTs, neuronal dysfunction and dementia. During the process leading to AD, tau and Aβ first misfold and form aggregates in one brain region, from where they spread to interconnected areas of the brain thereby inducing its gradual morphological and functional deterioration. In this mini-review article, we present an overview of the current literature on the spreading mechanisms of Aβ and tau pathology in AD since a more profound understanding is necessary to design therapeutic approaches aimed at preventing or halting disease progression.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by John R. Casey, Michael J. Follows&lt;/p&gt;

Microbes acclimate to changes in substrate availability by altering the number of transporters on the cell surface, however there is some disagreement on just how. We revisit the physics of substrate uptake and consider the steady-state scenario whereby cells have acclimated to maximize fitness. Flux balance analysis of a stoichiometric model of &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; was used in conjunction with quantitative proteomics data and molecular modeling of membrane transporters to reconcile these opposing views. An emergent feature of the proposed model is a critical substrate concentration &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;*, which delineates two rate limits. At concentrations above &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;*, transporter abundance can be regulated to maintain uptake rates as demanded by maximal growth rates, whereas below &lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;*, uptake rates are strictly diffusion limited. In certain scenarios, the proposed model can take on a qualitatively different shape from the familiar hyperbolic kinetics curves, instead resembling the long-forgotten Blackman kinetics.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Bm1t2IRj0pU&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~3/GrlGEmn0lpk/article</link>

Humans’ propensity to acquire literacy relates to several factors, including the ability to understand speech in noise (SiN). Still, the nature of the relation between reading and SiN perception abilities remains poorly understood. Here, we dissect the interplay between (1) reading abilities, (2) classical behavioral predictors of reading (phonological awareness, phonological memory, and rapid automatized naming), and (3) electrophysiological markers of SiN perception in 99 elementary school children (26 with dyslexia). We demonstrate that, in typical readers, cortical representation of the phrasal content of SiN relates to the degree of development of the lexical (but not sublexical) reading strategy. In contrast, classical behavioral predictors of reading abilities and the ability to benefit from visual speech to represent the syllabic content of SiN account for global reading performance (i.e., speed and accuracy of lexical and sublexical reading). In individuals with dyslexia, we found preserved integration of visual speech information to optimize processing of syntactic information but not to sustain acoustic/phonemic processing. Finally, within children with dyslexia, measures of cortical representation of the phrasal content of SiN were negatively related to reading speed and positively related to the compromise between reading precision and reading speed, potentially owing to compensatory attentional mechanisms. These results clarify the nature of the relation between SiN perception and reading abilities in typical child readers and children with dyslexia and identify novel electrophysiological markers of emergent literacy.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/GrlGEmn0lpk&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2008.11167</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Understanding the functional connectivity of the brain has become a major
goal of neuroscience. In many situatons, the relative phase difference,
together with coherence patterns, have been employed to infer the direction of
the information flow. However, it has been recently shown in local field
potential data from monkeys the existence of a synchronized regime in which
unidirectionally coupled areas can present both positive and negative phase
differences. During the counterintuitive regime, called anticipated
synchronization (AS), the phase difference does not reflect the causality. Here
we investigate coherence and causality at the alpha frequency band (10 Hz)
between pairs of electroencephalogram (EEG) electrodes in humans during a
GO/NO-GO task. We show that human EEG signals can exhibit anticipated
synchronization, which is characterized by a unidirectional influence from an
electrode A to an electrode B, but the electrode B leads the electrode A in
time. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first verification of AS in EEG
signals and in the human brain. The usual delayed synchronization (DS) regime
is also present between many pairs. DS is characterized by a unidirectional
influence from an electrode A to an electrode B and a positive phase difference
between A and B which indicates that the electrode A leads the electrode B in
time. Moreover, we show that EEG signals exhibit diversity in phase relations:
the pairs of electrodes can present in-phase, anti-phase, or out-of-phase
synchronization with a similar distribution of positive and negative phase
differences.

Search (NAS), which received great attention in recent years, can design the
architecture automatically. Among different kinds of NAS methods, Evolutionary
Computation (EC) based NAS methods have recently gained much attention and
success. Unfortunately, there is not a comprehensive summary of the EC-based
methods. This paper reviews 100+ papers of EC-based NAS methods in light of the
common process. Four steps of the process have been covered in this paper
including population initialization, population operators, evaluation and

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;It has been classically conjectured that the brain compresses data by
assigning probabilistic models to sequences of stimuli. An important issue
associated to this conjecture is what class of models is used by the brain to
perform its compression task. We address this issue by introducing a new
statistical model selection procedure aiming to study the manner by which the
brain performs data compression. Our procedure uses context tree models to
represent sequences of stimuli and a new projective method for clustering EEG
segments. The starting point is an experimental protocol in which EEG data is
recorded while a participant is exposed to auditory stimuli generated by a
stochastic chain. A simulation study using sequences of stimuli generated by
two different context tree models with EEG segments generated by two distinct
algorithms concludes this article.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Reservoir computers are a type of neuromorphic computer that may be built a
an analog system, potentially creating powerful computers that are small, light
and consume little power. Typically a reservoir computer is build by connecting
together a set of nonlinear nodes into a network; connecting the nonlinear
nodes may be difficult or expensive, however. This work shows how a reservoir
computer may be expanded by adding functions to its output. The particular
functions described here are linear filters, but other functions are possible.
The design and construction of linear filters is well known, and such filters
may be easily implemented in hardware such as field programmable gate arrays
(FPGA's). The effect of adding filters on the reservoir computer performance is
simulated for a signal fitting problem, a prediction problem and a signal
classification problem.

thereafter continue to achieve them without further teacher feedback. We
explain this ability and illustrate it with a variety of target dynamics,

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Thyroid Hormone and Neural Stem Cells: Repair Potential Following Brain and Spinal Cord Injury</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00875</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Neurodegenerative diseases are characterized by chronic neuronal and/or glial cell loss, while traumatic injury is often accompanied by the acute loss of both. Multipotent neural stem cells (NSCs) in the adult mammalian brain spontaneously proliferate, forming neuronal and glial progenitors that migrate toward lesion sites upon injury. However, they fail to replace neurons and glial cells due to molecular inhibition and the lack of pro-regenerative cues. A major challenge in regenerative biology therefore is to unveil signaling pathways that could override molecular brakes and boost endogenous repair. In physiological conditions, thyroid hormone (TH) acts on NSC commitment in the subventricular zone, and the subgranular zone, the two largest NSC niches in mammals, including humans. Here, we discuss whether TH could have beneficial actions in various pathological contexts too, by evaluating recent data obtained in mammalian models of multiple sclerosis (MS; loss of oligodendroglial cells), Alzheimer’s disease (loss of neuronal cells), stroke and spinal cord injury (neuroglial cell loss). So far, TH has shown promising effects as a stimulator of remyelination in MS models, while its role in NSC-mediated repair in other diseases remains elusive. Disentangling the spatiotemporal aspects of the injury-driven repair response as well as the molecular and cellular mechanisms by which TH acts, could unveil new ways to further exploit its pro-regenerative potential, while TH (ant)agonists with cell type-specific action could provide safer and more target-directed approaches that translate easier to clinical settings.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Oxidative Stress Marker Aberrations in Multiple Sclerosis: A Meta-Analysis Study</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00823</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Oxidative stress has been suggested to play a key role in multiple sclerosis (MS), but clinical data on oxidative stress markers in MS patients were inconsistent. This study sought to quantitatively summarize the data of oxidative stress markers in the blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients with MS in the literature. We conducted a systematic search of PubMed and Web of Science and included studies if they provided data on the concentrations of oxidative stress markers in the peripheral blood and CSF of MS patients and healthy control (HC) subjects. The systematic search resulted in the inclusion of 31 studies with 2,001 MS patients and 2,212 HC subjects for meta-analysis. Random-effects meta-analysis demonstrated that patients with MS had significantly increased concentrations of blood oxidative stress markers compared with HC subjects for malondialdehyde (MDA; Hedges' g, 2.252; 95% CI, 1.080 to 3.424; p &amp;lt; 0.001) and lipid hydroperoxide by tert-butyl hydroperoxide-initiated chemiluminescence (CL-LOOH; Hedges' g, 0.383; 95% CI, 0.065 to 0.702; p = 0.018). In contrast, concentrations of albumin (Hedges' g, −1.036; CI, −1.679 to −0.394; p = 0.002) were significantly decreased in MS patients when compared with those in HC subjects. However, the other analyzed blood oxidative stress markers did not show significant differences between cases and controls. Furthermore, this meta-analysis showed significant association between CSF MDA and MS (Hedges' g, 3.275; 95% CI, 0.859 to 5.691; p = 0.008). Taken together, our results revealed increased blood and CSF MDA and decreased blood albumin levels in patients with MS, strengthening the clinical evidence of increased oxidative stress in MS.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroinformatics: Disrupted Rich Club Organization of Hemispheric White Matter Networks in Bipolar Disorder</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fninf.2020.00039</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Neuroimaging studies suggest disrupted connections of the brain white matter (WM) network in bipolar disorder (BD). A group of highly interconnected high-density structures, termed the ‘rich club,’ represents an important network for brain functioning. Recent works have revealed abnormal rich club organization in brain networks in BD. However, little is known regarding changes in the rich club organization of the hemispheric WM network in BD. Forty-nine BD patients and fifty-five age- and sex-matched normal controls (NCs) underwent diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). Graph theory approaches were applied to quantify group-specific rich club organization and nodal degree of hemispheric WM networks. We demonstrated that rich club organization of hemispheric WM networks in BD was disrupted, with disrupted feeder and local connections among hub and peripheral regions located in the default mode network (DMN) and the control execution network (CEN). In addition, BD patients showed abnormal asymmetry in the feeder and local connections, involving the hub and peripheral regions associated with emotion regulation and visuospatial functions. Moreover, the clinical symptoms of BD showed a significant correlation with the aberrant asymmetry in the regional degree of peripheral regions. These findings reveal that BD is closely associated with disrupted feeder and local connections but no alteration in rich-club connections in the rich club organization of hemispheric WM networks and provide novel insight into the changes of brain functions in BD.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Subthreshold Electrical Noise Applied to the Plantar Foot Enhances Lower-Limb Cutaneous Reflex Generation</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00351</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Reflex responses generated by cutaneous mechanoreceptors of the plantar foot are important for the maintenance of balance during postural tasks and gait. With aging, reflex generation, particularly from fast adapting type I receptors, is reduced, which likely contributes to impaired postural stability in this population. Therefore, improving reflex generation from these receptors may serve as a tool to improve balance performance. A mechanism to enhance reflexes may lie in the phenomenon of stochastic resonance, whereby the addition of certain intensities and frequencies of noise stimuli improves the performance of a system. This study was conducted to determine whether tactile noise stimuli could improve cutaneous reflex generation. In 12 healthy young adults, we evoked cutaneous reflex responses using a 0–50 Hz Gaussian noise vibration applied to the plantar heel. Concurrently, we applied one of six subthreshold intensities of electrical tactile noise to the plantar heel [0%, 20%, 40%, 60%, 80% or 100% (threshold)] and were able to analyze data from 0%, 20% and 40% trials. Across participants, it was found that the addition of a 20% perceptual threshold (PT) noise resulted in enhanced reflex responses when analyzed in both the time and frequency domains. These data provide evidence that cutaneous reflex generation can be enhanced via a stochastic resonance effect and that 20% PT is the optimal intensity of noise to do so. Therefore, the addition of noise stimuli may be a valuable clinical intervention to improve reflex responses associated with postural balance in populations with impairments.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Links Between the Neurobiology of Oxytocin and Human Musicality</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00350</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The human species possesses two complementary, yet distinct, universal communication systems—language and music. Functional imaging studies have revealed that some core elements of these two systems are processed in closely related brain regions, but there are also clear differences in brain circuitry that likely underlie differences in functionality. Music affects many aspects of human behavior, especially in encouraging prosocial interactions and promoting trust and cooperation within groups of culturally compatible but not necessarily genetically related individuals. Music, presumably via its impact on the limbic system, is also rewarding and motivating, and music can facilitate aspects of learning and memory. In this review these special characteristics of music are considered in light of recent research on the neuroscience of the peptide oxytocin, a hormone that has both peripheral and central actions, that plays a role in many complex human behaviors, and whose expression has recently been reported to be affected by music-related activities. I will first briefly discuss what is currently known about the peptide’s physiological actions on neurons and its interactions with other neuromodulator systems, then summarize recent advances in our knowledge of the distribution of oxytocin and its receptor (OXTR) in the human brain. Next, the complex links between oxytocin and various social behaviors in humans are considered. First, how endogenous oxytocin levels relate to individual personality traits, and then how exogenous, intranasal application of oxytocin affects behaviors such as trust, empathy, reciprocity, group conformity, anxiety, and overall social decision making under different environmental conditions. It is argued that many of these characteristics of oxytocin biology closely mirror the diverse effects that music has on human cognition and emotion, providing a link to the important role music has played throughout human evolutionary history and helping to explain why music remains a special prosocial human asset. Finally, it is suggested that there is a potential synergy in combining oxytocin- and music-based strategies to improve general health and aid in the treatment of various neurological dysfunctions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00335</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;High-frequency oscillations (HFOs) have been proposed as a promising biomarker of the epileptogenic zone (EZ). But accurate delineation of EZ based on HFOs is still challenging. Our study compared HFOs from EZ and non-EZ on the basis of their associations with interictal slow waves, aiming at exploring a new way to localize EZ. Nineteen medically intractable epilepsy patients with good surgical outcome were included. Five minute interictal intracranial electroencephalography (EEG) epochs of slow-wave sleep were randomly selected; then ripples (80–200 Hz), fast ripples (FRs; 200–500 Hz), and slow waves (0.1–4 Hz) were automatically analyzed. The EZ and non-EZ were identified by resection range during the surgeries. We found that both ripples and FRs superimposed more frequently on slow waves in EZ than in non-EZ (P &amp;lt; 0.01). Although ripples preferred to occur on the down state of slow waves in both two groups, ripples in EZ tended to be closer to the down-state peak of slow wave than in non-EZ (-174 vs. -231 ms, P = 0.008). As for FR, no statistical difference was found between the two groups (P = 0.430). Additionally, slow wave-containing ripples in EZ had a steeper slope (1.7 vs. 1.5 μV/ms, P &amp;lt; 0.001) and wider distribution ratio (32.3 vs. 30.1%, P &amp;lt; 0.001) than those in the non-EZ. But for slow wave-containing FR, only a steeper slope (1.7 vs. 1.4 μV/ms, P &amp;lt; 0.001) was observed. Our study innovatively compared the different features of association between HFOs and slow wave in EZ and non-EZ from refractory focal epilepsy with good surgical outcome, proposing a new method to localize EZ and facilitating the surgical plan.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neural Circuits: Why Brain Criticality Is Clinically Relevant: A Scoping Review</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncir.2020.00054</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The past 25 years have seen a strong increase in the number of publications related to criticality in different areas of neuroscience. The potential of criticality to explain various brain properties, including optimal information processing, has made it an increasingly exciting area of investigation for neuroscientists. Recent reviews on this topic, sometimes termed brain criticality, make brief mention of clinical applications of these findings to several neurological disorders such as epilepsy, neurodegenerative disease, and neonatal hypoxia. Other clinicallyrelevant domains – including anesthesia, sleep medicine, developmental-behavioral pediatrics, and psychiatry – are seldom discussed in review papers of brain criticality. Thorough assessments of these application areas and their relevance for clinicians have also yet to be published. In this scoping review, studies of brain criticality involving human data of all ages are evaluated for their current and future clinical relevance. To make the results of these studies understandable to a more clinical audience, a review of the key concepts behind criticality (e.g., phase transitions, long-range temporal correlation, self-organized criticality, power laws, branching processes) precedes the discussion of human clinical studies. Open questions and forthcoming areas of investigation are also considered.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: The Kainate Receptor Subunit GluK2 Interacts With KCC2 to Promote Maturation of Dendritic Spines</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00252</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Kainate receptors (KAR) play a crucial role in the plasticity and functional maturation of glutamatergic synapses. However, how they regulate structural plasticity of dendritic spines is not known. The GluK2 subunit was recently shown to coexist in a functional complex with the neuronal K-Cl cotransporter KCC2. Apart from having a crucial role in the maturation of GABAergic transmission, KCC2 has a morphogenic role in the maturation of dendritic spines. Here, we show that in vivo local inactivation of GluK2 expression in CA3 hippocampal neurons induces altered morphology of dendritic spines and reduction in mEPSC frequency. GluK2 deficiency also resulted in a strong change in the subcellular distribution of KCC2 as well as a smaller somatodendritic gradient in the reversal potential of GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;. Strikingly, the aberrant morphology of dendritic spines in GluK2-deficient CA3 pyramidal neurons was restored by overexpression of KCC2. GluK2 silencing in hippocampal neurons significantly reduced the expression of 4.1N and functional form of the actin filament severing protein cofilin. Consistently, assessment of actin dynamics using fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) of β-actin showed a significant increase in the stability of F-actin filaments in dendritic spines. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that GluK2-KCC2 interaction plays an important role in the structural maturation of dendritic spines. This also provides novel insights into the connection between KAR dysfunction, structural plasticity, and developmental disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Age-Related Regional Network Covariance of Magnetic Resonance Imaging Gray Matter in the Rat</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00267</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Healthy human aging has been associated with brain atrophy in prefrontal and selective temporal regions, but reductions in other brain areas have been observed. We previously found regional covariance patterns of gray matter with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in healthy humans and rhesus macaques, using multivariate network Scaled Subprofile Model (SSM) analysis and voxel-based morphometry (VBM), supporting aging effects including in prefrontal and temporal cortices. This approach has yet to be applied to neuroimaging in rodent models of aging. We investigated 7.0T MRI gray matter covariance in 10 young and 10 aged adult male Fischer 344 rats to identify, using SSM VBM, the age-related regional network gray matter covariance pattern in the rodent. SSM VBM identified a regional pattern that distinguished young from aged rats, characterized by reductions in prefrontal, temporal association/perirhinal, and cerebellar areas with relative increases in somatosensory, thalamic, midbrain, and hippocampal regions. Greater expression of the age-related MRI gray matter pattern was associated with poorer spatial learning in the age groups combined. Aging in the rat is characterized by a regional network pattern of gray matter reductions corresponding to aging effects previously observed in humans and non-human primates. SSM MRI network analyses can advance translational aging neuroscience research, extending from human to small animal models, with potential for evaluating mechanisms and interventions for cognitive aging.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00266</link>
	<content:encoded>Objective&lt;p&gt;This study aimed to evaluate the value of odors in the olfactory identification (OI) test and other known risk factors for predicting incident dementia in the prospective Shanghai Aging Study.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;At baseline, OI was assessed using the Sniffin’ Sticks Screening Test 12, which contains 12 different odors. Cognition assessment and consensus diagnosis were conducted at both baseline and follow-up to identify incident dementia. Four different multivariable logistic regression (MLR) models were used for predicting incident dementia. In the no-odor model, only demographics, lifestyle, and medical history variables were included. In the single-odor model, we further added one single odor to the first model. In the full model, all 12 odors were included. In the stepwise model, the variables were selected using a bidirectional stepwise selection method. The predictive abilities of these models were evaluated by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). The permutation importance method was used to evaluate the relative importance of different odors and other known risk factors.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Seventy-five (8%) incident dementia cases were diagnosed during 4.9 years of follow-up among 947 participants. The full and the stepwise MLR model (AUC = 0.916 and 0.914, respectively) have better predictive abilities compared with those of the no- or single-odor models. The five most important variables are Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score, age, peppermint detection, coronary artery disease, and height in the full model, and MMSE, age, peppermint detection, stroke, and education in the stepwise model. The combination of only the top five variables in the stepwise model (AUC = 0.901 and sensitivity = 0.880) has as a good a predictive ability as other models.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;The ability to smell peppermint might be one of the useful indicators for predicting dementia. Combining peppermint detection with MMSE, age, education, and history of stroke may have sensitive and robust predictive value for dementia in older adults.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Factors Associated With the Occurrence and Evolution of Recent Small Subcortical Infarcts (RSSIs) in Different Locations</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00264</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Recent small subcortical infarcts (RSSIs) can occur in different brain regions. Distinct etiologies might be involved for RSSIs in different locations and could further affect RSSI cavitation and functional outcomes. In this study, we aim to analyze the baseline clinical and imaging characteristics associated with the occurrence and cavitation of RSSIs in different locations. We retrospectively include patients who presented with RSSIs from a database for cerebral small vessel disease. Detailed information, including demographic, clinical, laboratory, and radiological data, were collected. We identify baseline RSSIs on diffusion-weighted images and divide them into brainstem, subcortical white matter, and basal ganglia region groups. Cavitation is evaluated on follow-up T2 fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) images. Statistical analysis is performed to determine factors associated with the occurrence and cavitation of RSSIs in different locations. We find that patients with brainstem RSSIs have a higher proportion of diabetes (64.1%) compared to patients with subcortical white matter (27.3%, P &amp;lt; 0.001) and basal ganglia region RSSIs (35.2%, P = 0.006) and have higher levels of HbA1c (7.20%) compared to patients with subcortical white matter (6.10%, P = 0.001) and basal ganglia region RSSIs (6.20%, P = 0.003). In addition, patients with brainstem RSSIs have higher NIHSS scores than patients with subcortical white matter RSSIs (2 vs 0, P = 0.001). Patients with subcortical white matter RSSIs have higher a white matter hyperintensity (WMH) burden compared to patients with basal ganglia region RSSIs (21.64 cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; vs 11.10 cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, P = 0.004). Follow-up analysis demonstrates that basal ganglia region RSSIs are less likely to cavitate than subcortical white matter RSSIs (61.4% vs 83.6%, P = 0.010), and contacting with WMH is associated with the cavitation of subcortical white matter RSSIs (OR: 101.760, P = 0.003). Our study demonstrates that RSSIs in different locations are associated with different clinical and imaging characteristics. Furthermore, cavitation of RSSIs might be affected by local lesion features and the surrounding environment rather than general demographic and clinical factors.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: CISD2 Attenuates Inflammation and Regulates Microglia Polarization in EOC Microglial Cells—As a Potential Therapeutic Target for Neurodegenerative Dementia</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00260</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Background: Accumulating evidence has demonstrated a significant association between microglia-driven inflammation in the brain and neurodegenerative dementia. We previously showed a significant decline in CISD2 expression in mice models with advanced age. Moreover, we observed that the knockdown of CISD2 led to remarkable inflammation and mitochondrial dysfunction in neural cells. In the present study, we investigated whether CISD2 attenuation influences anti-inflammatory effects and M1-M2 polarization in microglia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Materials and Methods: The knockdown of CISD2 expression by siRNA (siCISD2) in EOC microglial cells was performed to mimic the age-driven decline of CISD2 expression. The extent of the inflammatory reaction, polarization in the M1/M2 spectrum, and NFκB activation were verified in EOC microglial cells exhibiting CISD2 deficiency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: In the cellular model of microglia, loss of CISD2 function mediated by siCISD2 exhibited a significant augmentation of proinflammatory signaling, as well as reduced expression levels of Arg-1, Ym1, IL-10, and BCL2. Attenuation of CISD2 expression led to a decrease in the proportion of the M2 phenotype of microglia (compared to M1). Enhanced DNA-binding activity of the NFκB p65 subunit was confirmed in cells transfected with siCISD2, as demonstrated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report examining the following phenomena: (1) anti-inflammatory effects of CISD2 in microglia via NFκB regulation; and (2) microglial CISD2 assistance in the restoration of M2 microglia phenotype. The anti-inflammatory effects of CISD2 in microglia eventually augment anti-apoptotic effects, which provides a rationale for the development of potential therapeutic target for neurodegenerative diseases and neurodegenerative dementia.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: PARP1 inhibitors trigger innate immunity via PARP1 trapping-induced DNA damage response</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/60637</link>
	<content:encoded>It is being increasingly appreciated that the immunomodulatory functions of PARP inhibitors (PARPi) underlie their clinical activities in various &lt;i&gt;BRCA&lt;/i&gt;-mutated tumors. PARPi possess both PARP1 inhibition and PARP1 trapping activities. The relative contribution of these two mechanisms toward PARPi-induced innate immune signaling, however, is poorly understood. We find that the presence of the PARP1 protein with uncompromised DNA-binding activities is required for PARPi-induced innate immune response. The activation of cGAS-STING signaling induced by various PARPi closely depends on their PARP1 trapping activities. Finally, we show that a small molecule PARP1 degrader blocks the enzymatic activity of PARP1 without eliciting PARP1 trapping or cGAS-STING activation. Our findings thus identify PARP1 trapping as a major contributor of the immunomodulatory functions of PARPi. Although PARPi-induced innate immunity is highly desirable in human malignancies, the ability of “non-trapping” PARP1 degraders to avoid the activation of innate immune response could be useful in non-oncological diseases.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>G protein-gated inward rectifier potassium (GIRK) channels are regulated by G proteins and PIP&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Here using cryo-EM single particle analysis we describe the equilibrium ensemble of structures of neuronal GIRK2 as a function of the C8-PIP&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; concentration. We find that PIP&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; shifts the equilibrium between two distinguishable structures of neuronal GIRK (GIRK2), extended and docked, towards the docked form. In the docked form the cytoplasmic domain, to which G&lt;sub&gt;βγ&lt;/sub&gt; binds, becomes accessible to the cytoplasmic membrane surface where G&lt;sub&gt;βγ&lt;/sub&gt; resides. Furthermore, PIP&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; binding reshapes the G&lt;sub&gt;βγ&lt;/sub&gt; binding surface on the cytoplasmic domain, preparing it to receive G&lt;sub&gt;βγ&lt;/sub&gt;. We find that cardiac GIRK (GIRK1/4) can also exist in both extended and docked conformations. These findings lead us to conclude that PIP&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; influences GIRK channels in a structurally similar manner to Kir2.2 channels. In Kir2.2 channels, the PIP&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-induced conformational changes open the pore. In GIRK channels, they prepare the channel for activation by G&lt;sub&gt;βγ&lt;/sub&gt;.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: Puromycin reactivity does not accurately localize translation at the subcellular level</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/60303</link>
	<content:encoded>Puromycin is a tyrosyl-tRNA mimic that blocks translation by labeling and releasing elongating polypeptide chains from translating ribosomes. Puromycin has been used in molecular biology research for decades as a translation inhibitor. The development of puromycin antibodies and derivatized puromycin analogs has enabled the quantification of active translation in bulk and single-cell assays. More recently, &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; puromycylation assays have become popular tools for localizing translating ribosomes in cells. These assays often use elongation inhibitors to purportedly inhibit the release of puromycin-labeled nascent peptides from ribosomes. Using &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; experiments in various eukaryotic systems, we demonstrate that, even in the presence of elongation inhibitors, puromycylated peptides are released and diffuse away from ribosomes. Puromycylation assays reveal subcellular sites, such as nuclei, where puromycylated peptides accumulate post-release and which do not necessarily coincide with sites of active translation. Our findings urge caution when interpreting puromycylation assays &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/60048</link>
	<content:encoded>Puromycin is an amino-acyl transfer RNA analog widely employed in studies of protein synthesis. Since puromycin is covalently incorporated into nascent polypeptide chains, anti-puromycin immunofluorescence enables visualization of nascent protein synthesis. A common assumption in studies of local messenger RNA translation is that the anti-puromycin staining of puromycylated nascent polypeptides in fixed cells accurately reports on their original site of translation, particularly when ribosomes are stalled with elongation inhibitors prior to puromycin treatment. However, when we attempted to implement a proximity ligation assay to detect ribosome-puromycin complexes, we found no evidence to support this assumption. We further demonstrated, using biochemical assays and live cell imaging of nascent polypeptides in mammalian cells, that puromycylated nascent polypeptides rapidly dissociate from ribosomes even in the presence of elongation inhibitors. Our results suggest that attempts to define precise subcellular translation sites using anti-puromycin immunostaining may be confounded by release of puromycylated nascent polypeptide chains prior to fixation.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: The transcriptional elongation rate regulates alternative polyadenylation in yeast</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/59810</link>
	<content:encoded>Yeast cells undergoing the diauxic response show a striking upstream shift in poly(A) site utilization, with increased use of ORF-proximal poly(A) sites resulting in shorter 3' mRNA isoforms for most genes. This altered poly(A) pattern is extremely similar to that observed in cells containing Pol II derivatives with slow elongation rates. Conversely, cells containing derivatives with fast elongation rates show a subtle downstream shift in poly(A) sites. Polyadenylation patterns of many genes are sensitive to both fast and slow elongation rates, and a global shift of poly(A) utilization is strongly linked to increased purine content of sequences flanking poly(A) sites. Pol II processivity is impaired in diauxic cells, but strains with reduced processivity and normal Pol II elongation rates have normal polyadenylation profiles. Thus, Pol II elongation speed is important for poly(A) site selection and for regulating poly(A) patterns in response to environmental conditions.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/59395</link>
	<content:encoded>Schistosomiasis is a debilitating parasitic disease infecting hundreds of millions of people. Schistosomes use aquatic snails as intermediate hosts. A promising avenue for disease control involves leveraging innate host mechanisms to reduce snail vectorial capacity. In a genome-wide association study of &lt;i&gt;Biomphalaria&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;glabrata&lt;/i&gt; snails, we identify genomic region PTC2 which exhibits the largest known correlation with susceptibility to parasite infection (&amp;gt;15-fold effect). Using new genome assemblies with substantially higher contiguity than the &lt;i&gt;Biomphalaria&lt;/i&gt; reference genome, we show that PTC2 haplotypes are exceptionally divergent in structure and sequence. This variation includes multi-kilobase indels containing entire genes, and orthologs for which most amino acid residues are polymorphic. RNA-Seq annotation reveals that most of these genes encode single-pass transmembrane proteins, as seen in another resistance region in the same species. Such groups of hyperdiverse snail proteins may mediate host-parasite interaction at the cell surface, offering promising targets for blocking the transmission of schistosomiasis.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/57757</link>
	<content:encoded>Compared to other stages in the RNA polymerase II transcription cycle, the role of chromatin in transcription termination is poorly understood. We performed a genetic screen in &lt;i&gt;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&lt;/i&gt; to identify histone mutants that exhibit transcriptional readthrough of terminators. Amino acid substitutions identified by the screen map to the nucleosome DNA entry-exit site. The strongest H3 mutants revealed widespread genomic changes, including increased sense-strand transcription upstream and downstream of genes, increased antisense transcription overlapping gene bodies, and reduced nucleosome occupancy particularly at the 3’ ends of genes. Replacement of the native sequence downstream of a gene with a sequence that increases nucleosome occupancy in vivo reduced readthrough transcription and suppressed the effect of a DNA entry-exit site substitution. Our results suggest that nucleosomes can facilitate termination by serving as a barrier to transcription and highlight the importance of the DNA entry-exit site in broadly maintaining the integrity of the transcriptome.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/57617</link>
	<content:encoded>Arginine methyltransferase PRMT7 is associated with human breast cancer metastasis. Endosomal FAK signalling is critical for cancer cell migration. Here we identified the pivotal roles of PRMT7 in promoting endosomal FAK signalling activation during breast cancer metastasis. PRMT7 exerted its functions through binding to scaffold protein SHANK2 and catalyzing di-methylation of SHANK2 at R240. SHANK2 R240 methylation exposed ANK domain by disrupting its SPN-ANK domain blockade, promoting in co-accumulation of dynamin2, talin, FAK, cortactin with SHANK2 on endosomes. In addition, SHANK2 R240 methylation activated endosomal FAK/cortactin signals in vitro and in vivo. Consistently, all the levels of PRMT7, methylated SHANK2, FAK Y397 phosphorylation and cortactin Y421 phosphorylation were correlated with aggressive clinical breast cancer tissues. These findings characterize the PRMT7-dependent SHANK2 methylation as a key player in mediating endosomal FAK signals activation, also point to the value of SHANK2 R240 methylation as a target for breast cancer metastasis.</content:encoded>

Using whole-exome sequencing in a family with 3 cases of POI, we identified the candidate missense variant S167L in &lt;i&gt;HSF2BP&lt;/i&gt;, an essential meiotic gene. Functional analysis of the HSF2BP-S167L variant in mouse showed that it behaves as a hypomorphic allele compared to a new loss of function (knock-out) mouse model. &lt;i&gt;Hsf2bp&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;S167L/S167L&lt;/sup&gt; females show reduced fertility with smaller litter sizes. To obtain mechanistic insights, we identified C19ORF57/BRME1 as a strong interactor and stabilizer of HSF2BP and showed that the BRME1/HSF2BP protein complex co-immunoprecipitates with BRCA2, RAD51, RPA and PALB2. Meiocytes bearing the HSF2BP-S167L variant showed a strongly decreased staining of both HSF2BP and BRME1 at the recombination nodules and a reduced number of the foci formed by the recombinases RAD51/DMC1, thus leading to a lower frequency of crossovers. Our results provide insights into the molecular mechanism of HSF2BP-S167L in human ovarian insufficiency and sub(in)fertility.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: m6A RNA methylation impacts fate choices during skin morphogenesis</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/56980</link>
	<content:encoded>N&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;-methyladenosine is the most prominent RNA modification in mammals. Here we study mouse skin embryogenesis to tackle m6A’s functions and physiological importance. We first landscape the m6A modifications on skin epithelial progenitor mRNAs. Contrasting with &lt;i&gt;in vivo &lt;/i&gt;ribosomal profiling, we unearth a correlation between m6A-modification in coding sequences and enhanced translation, particularly of key morphogenetic signaling pathways. Tapping physiological relevance, we show that m6A loss profoundly alters these cues and perturbs cellular fate choices and tissue architecture in all skin lineages. By single-cell transcriptomics and bioinformatics, both signaling and canonical translation pathways show significant downregulation after m6A loss. Interestingly, however, many highly m6A-modified mRNAs are markedly upregulated upon m6A loss, and they encode RNA-methylation, RNA-processing and RNA-metabolism factors. Together, our findings suggest that m6A functions to enhance translation of key morphogenetic regulators, while also destabilizing sentinel mRNAs that are primed to activate rescue pathways when m6A levels drop.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: Anatomy of nerve fiber bundles at micrometer-resolution in the vervet monkey visual system</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/55444</link>
	<content:encoded>Although the primate visual system has been extensively studied, detailed spatial organization of white matter fiber tracts carrying visual information between areas has not been fully established. This is mainly due to the large gap between tracer studies and diffusion-weighted MRI studies, which focus on specific axonal connections and macroscale organization of fiber tracts, respectively. Here we used 3D polarization light imaging (3D-PLI), which enables direct visualization of fiber tracts at micrometer resolution, to identify and visualize fiber tracts of the visual system, such as stratum sagittale, inferior longitudinal fascicle, vertical occipital fascicle, tapetum and dorsal occipital bundle in vervet monkey brains. Moreover, 3D-PLI data provide detailed information on cortical projections of these tracts, distinction between neighboring tracts, and novel short-range pathways. This work provides essential information for interpretation of functional and diffusion-weighted MRI data, as well as revision of wiring diagrams based upon observations in the vervet visual system.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Boosting L-type Ca2+ channel activity in tuberous sclerosis mitigates excess glutamate receptors and seizures</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.08.26.269209v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Tuberous sclerosis complex (TS) is a dominant, multisystem disorder with devastating neurological symptoms. Approximately 85% of TS patients suffer from epilepsy over their lifespan and roughly 25-50% of those patients develop Autism Spectrum Disorder (1, 2). Current seizure therapies are effective in some, but not all, and often have significant risk factors associated with their use (1, 3). Thus, there is a critical need for new medication development or drug repositioning. Herein, we leveraged proteomic signatures of epilepsy and ASD, often comorbid in TS, to utilize an in silco approach to identify new drug therapies for TS-related seizures. We have discovered that activation of L-type voltage dependent calcium channels (L-VDCC) by Bay-K8644 (BayK) in a preclinical mouse model of TS curtails seizure frequency. Remarkably, at the molecular level, excess expression of ionotropic, AMPA-subtype glutamate (GluA) receptors is rescued by the administration of BayK. As added proof of BayK working through L-VDCC to regulate GluA levels, we found that increasing expression of alpha2delta2 (2{delta}2), an auxiliary calcium channel subunit that boosts L-VDCC surface expression, similarly lowers the surface expression of dendritic GluA in TS. These BayK-induced molecular and functional alterations may underlie the longer lifespan of TS mice treated with BayK.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.08.26.268904v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Genetically encoded voltage indicators (GEVIs) allow for cell-specific optical recordings of membrane potential changes in defined cell populations. One tool that would further their use in the in vivo mammalian brain is transgenic reporter animals that facilitate precise and repeatable targeting with high expression levels. The present literature on the development and use of transgenic mouse lines as vehicles for GEVI expression is limited. Here we report the first in vivo experiments using a transgenic reporter mouse for the GEVI ArcLight (Ai86(TITL-ArcLight)), which utilizes a Cre/tTA dependent expression system (TIGRE 1.0). Following pairing to appropriate Cre- and tTA transgenic mice, we report two mouse lines with ArcLight expression restricted to olfactory sensory neurons (OMP-ArcLight), and a subpopulation of interneurons that include periglomerular and granule cells (Emx1-ArcLight) in the olfactory bulb (OB). The ArcLight expression in these lines was sufficient for in vivo imaging of odorant responses in single trials. Odor responses were measured in the OB using epifluorescence and 2-photon imaging. The voltage responses were odor-specific and concentration-dependent, and confirmed earlier conclusions from calcium measurements. This study shows that the ArcLight Ai86(TITL-ArcLight) transgenic line is a flexible genetic tool that can be used to record neuronal electrical activity of a variety of cell types with a signal-to-noise ratio that is comparable to previous reports using viral transduction.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.08.26.268631v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Mutations in RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) have been genetically associated with the motoneuron disease Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS). Using both human induced Pluripotent Stem Cells and mouse models, we found that FUS-ALS causative mutations have a profound impact on a network of RBPs, including two relevant factors with important roles in neuronal RNA metabolism: HuD and FMRP. Mechanistically, cytoplasmic localization of mutant FUS leads to upregulation of HuD levels through competition with FMRP for HuD 3'UTR binding. In turn, increased HuD levels overly stabilize the transcript levels of its targets, NRN1 and GAP43. As a consequence, mutant FUS motoneurons show altered axon branching and growth upon injury. Abnormal axon branching and regrowth in FUS mutant motoneurons could be rescued by dampening NRN1 levels. Since similar phenotypes have been previously described in SOD1 and TDP-43 mutant models, aberrant axonal growth and branching might represent broad early events in the pathogenesis of ALS.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.08.26.268359v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Prenatal stress (PS) can impact fetal brain structure and function and lead to higher vulnerability to neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders. To understand how PS alters evoked and spontaneous cortical activity and intrinsic brain functional connectivity, mesoscale voltage imaging was performed in adult C57BL/6NJ mice who were exposed to an auditory stress paradigm on gestational days 12-16. PS mice demonstrated a four-fold higher basal corticosterone level, reduced amplitude of all cortical sensory-evoked responses (visual, auditory, whisker, forelimb, and hindlimb), decreased overall resting-state functional connectivity, declined network efficiency, reduced inter-module connectivity, enhanced intra-module connectivity, and altered frequency of auditory and forelimb spontaneous sensory motifs relative to control animals. In fact, for PS, the resting-state functional connectivity changes drastically towards an overall less connected structure that consists of largely disjoint but tight modules, leading to a declined network efficiency. The changes in structure also indicate that the posterior secondary motor, primary barrel, and secondary hindlimb cortices are cortical areas with higher susceptibility to dysfunction. Our findings highlight the PS modulation of brain functional connectivity that can pose offspring at risk for stress-related neuropsychiatric disorders.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Longitudinal changes in brain metabolites in healthy subjects and patients with first episode psychosis (FEP): a 7-Tesla MRS study</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.08.25.267419v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>OBJECTIVE: 7 Tesla (T) longitudinal magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) offers a precise measurment of metabolic levels in human brain via a non-invasive approach. Studying longitudinal changes in neurometabolites could help identify trait and state markers for diseases and understand inconsistent findings from different researchers due to differences in the age of study participants and duration of illness. This study is the first to report novel longitudinal patterns in young adulthood from both physiological and pathological viewpoints using 7T MRS. METHODS: Utilizing a four-year longitudinal cohort with 38 first episode psychosis (FEP) patients (onset within 2 years) and 48 healthy controls (HC), the authors examined the annual percentage changes of 9 neurometabolites in 5 brain regions. RESULTS: Both FEP patients and HC subjects were found to have significant longitudinal reductions in glutamate (Glu) in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). Only FEP patients were found to have a significant decrease over time in gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), N-acetyl aspartate (NAA), myo-inositol (mI), and total choline (tCho: phosphocholine plus glycerophosphocholine) in the ACC. Uniquely, glutathione (GSH) was found to have a near zero annual percentage change in both FEP patients and HC subjects in all 5 brain regions over a four-year timespan in young adulthood. CONCLUSIONS: GSH could be a trait marker for diagnostic applications at least in young adulthood. Glu, GABA, NAA, mI, and tCho in the ACC are associated with the patient's status and could be state markers for mechanistic studies of psychotic disorders, including those for progressive pathological changes and medication effects in young adulthood.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.08.25.267393v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>The current experiment investigated the extent to which perceptual categorization of animacy, i.e. the ability to discriminate animate and inanimate objects, is facilitated by image-based features that distinguish the two object categories. We show that, with nominal training, naive macaques could classify a trial-unique set of 1000 novel images with high accuracy. To test whether image-based features that naturally differ between animate and inanimate objects, such as curvilinear and rectilinear information, contribute to the monkeys' accuracy, we created synthetic images using an algorithm that distorted the global shape of the original animate/inanimate images while maintaining their intermediate features (Portilla and Simoncelli, 2000). Performance on the synthesized images was significantly above chance and was predicted by the amount of curvilinear information in the images. Our results demonstrate that, without training, macaques can use an intermediate image feature, curvilinearity, to facilitate their categorization of animate and inanimate objects.</content:encoded>

We used Bax-/- mice to show that neuronal death following neonatal exposure to isoflurane is mediated by the apoptotic pathway, and that GABAergic interneurons are selectively vulnerable. Neonatal Bax-/- mice also showed attenuated microglial activation after exposure to isoflurane, indicating that neuroinflammatory response is secondary to neuronal apoptosis. Isoflurane-induced neuronal apoptosis in neonates appeared to have little effect on seizure threshold or cognitive function later in life. Collectively, these findings define the acute injury mechanism of volatile anesthetics during the neonatal period.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.08.25.267062v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) has found great utility for a wide range of neuroscientific and clinical applications. However, high-resolution dMRI, which is required for improved delineation of fine brain structures and connectomics, is hampered by its low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Since dMRI relies on the acquisition of multiple different diffusion weighted images of the same anatomy, it is well-suited for denoising methods that utilize correlations across the image series to improve the apparent SNR and the subsequent data analysis. In this work, we introduce and quantitatively evaluate a comprehensive framework, NOise Reduction with DIstribution Corrected (NORDIC) PCA method for processing dMRI. NORDIC uses low-rank modeling of g-factor-corrected complex dMRI reconstruction and non-asymptotic random matrix distributions to remove signal components which cannot be distinguished from thermal noise. The utility of the proposed framework for denoising dMRI is demonstrated on both simulations and experimental data obtained at 3 Tesla with different resolutions using human connectome project style acquisitions. The proposed framework leads to substantially enhanced quantitative performance for estimating diffusion tractography related measures and for resolving crossing fibers as compared to a conventional/state-of-the-art dMRI denoising method.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.08.25.266700v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Defocus blur and spatial attention both act on our ability to see clearly over time. However, it is currently unknown how these two factors interact because studies on acuity resolution only focused on the separate effects of attention and defocus blurs. In this study, resolution acuity was measured for clear and blur Landolt C images under various manipulations of covert endogenous attention. We observe that attention not just improves the resolution of clear stimuli, but also modulates the resolution of defocused stimuli for compensating the loss of resolution caused by retinal blur. Our results show, however, that as the degree of attention decreases, the differences between clear and blurred images largely diminish, thus limiting the benefit of an image quality enhancement. It also appeared that attention tends to enhance the resolution of clear images more than blurred targets, suggesting potential variations in the gain of vision correction with the level of attention. This demonstrates that the interaction between spatial attention and focus plays a role in the way we see things. In view of these findings, the development of adaptive neuro-optical interventions, which adjust the eye focus to attention, may hold promise.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.08.25.266619v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>The brain creates internal representations that translate sensory stimuli into appropriate behavior. Most studies of sensory processing focus on which subsets of neurons are activated by a stimulus, but the temporal features of the neural response are also important for behavior. In the taste system, the timing of peripheral sensory responses has rarely been examined. We investigated the temporal properties of taste responses in Drosophila melanogaster and discovered that different types of taste sensory neurons show striking differences in their response dynamics. Strong responses to stimulus onset (ON responses) and offset (OFF responses) were observed in bitter-sensing neurons in the labellum, whereas bitter neurons in the leg and other classes of labellar taste neurons showed only an ON response. Individual bitter labellar neurons generate both the ON and OFF responses through a cell-intrinsic mechanism that requires canonical bitter receptors. The bitter ON and OFF responses at the periphery are propagated to dopaminergic neurons that innervate the mushroom body and mediate aversive learning. When bitter is used as a reinforcement cue, the bitter ON and OFF responses can drive opposing types of synaptic plasticity and the effect of the OFF response dominates, likely due to the rapid and preferential habituation of the ON response. Together, these studies characterize novel features of neural responses in the taste system and reveal their importance for neural circuit function.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Functional circuits consist of neurons with diverse axonal projections and gene expression. Understanding the molecular signature of projections requires high-throughput interrogation of both gene expression and projections to multiple targets in the same cells at cellular resolution, which is difficult to achieve using current technology. Here, we introduce BARseq2, a technique that simultaneously maps projections and detects multiplexed gene expression by in situ sequencing. We determined the expression of cadherins and cell-type markers in 29,933 cells, and the projections of 3,164 cells in both the mouse motor cortex and auditory cortex. Associating gene expression and projections in 1,349 neurons revealed shared cadherin signatures of homologous projections across the two cortical areas. These cadherins were enriched across multiple branches of the transcriptomic taxonomy. By correlating multi-gene expression and projections to many targets in single neurons with high throughput, BARseq2 provides a path to uncovering the molecular logic underlying neuronal circuits.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Many animal behaviours require orientation and steering with respect to the environment. For insects, a key brain area involved in spatial orientation and navigation is the central complex. Activity in this neural circuit has been shown to track the insect's current heading relative to its environment, and has also been proposed to be the substrate of path integration. However, it remains unclear how the output of the central complex is integrated into motor commands. Central complex output neurons project to the lateral accessory lobes (LAL), from which descending neurons project to thoracic motor centres. Here, we present a computational model of a simple neural network that has been described anatomically and physiologically in the LALs of male silkworm moths, in the context of odour-mediated steering. We present and analyze two versions of this network, both implemented in the Nengo framework, one rate-based and one based on spiking neurons. The modelled network consists of an inhibitory local interneuron and a bistable descending neuron (flip-flop), which both receive input in the LAL. The flip-flop neuron projects onto neck motor neurons to induce steering. We show that this simple computational model not only replicates the basic parameters of male silkworm moth behaviour in a simulated odour plume, but can also take input from a computational model of path integration in the central complex and use it to steer back to a point of origin. Furthermore, we find that increasing the level of detail within the model improves the realism of the model's behaviour. Our results suggest that descending neurons originating in the lateral accessory lobes, such as flip-flop neurons, are sufficient to mediate multiple steering behaviours. This study is therefore a first step to close the gap between orientation circuits in the central complex and downstream motor centres.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Non-invasive brain perfusion MRI using endogenous deoxyhemoglobin as a contrast agent: preliminary data</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.08.21.255802v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>BACKGROUND: The paramagnetic properties of deoxyhemoglobin shorten T2* as do gadolinium based contrast agents. Induction of abrupt changes in arterial deoxyhemoglobin concentration ([dOHb]) can mimic the action of intra-vascular boluses of gadolinium based contrast agents (GBCAs) used for perfusion imaging. AIM: To demonstrate the feasibility of rapidly changing pulmonary venous hemoglobin saturation for generating boluses of blood with altered T2* properties for measuring flow metrics in the systemic circulation. METHODS: A gas blender with a sequential gas delivery breathing circuit and software enabling prospective arterial blood gas targeting was used to implement rapid lung changes in the partial pressure of blood oxygen (PaO2) while maintaining isocapnea. Lung PaO2 was initially lowered to induce a low baseline deoxyhemoglobin concentration [dOHb]. PaO2 was then rapidly raised to normal for 10 seconds and then rapidly lowered to the initial low baseline creating a oxyhemoglobin (OHb) bolus. R2* changes were measured using blood oxygenation dependent (BOLD) MRI signal changes in large arteries and veins as well as in the microcirculation. This enabled generation of the following maps: bolus arrival time delay (TD) cerebral blood volume (CBV), mean transit time (MTT) and cerebral blood flow (CBF). RESULTS: BOLD signal in the middle cerebral artery showed a sharp increase during the OHb bolus transit indicating minimal dispersion confirming effective rapid modulation of pulmonary venous PO2 with reasonable cortical contrast-to-noise ratio of 3. Signals sorted by amplitude of signal changes and arrival times enabled the visualization of major arteries and veins. Contrast to noise ratio was adequate for a single gas challenge to provide most of the contrast, little improved by averaging over the remaining set of challenges. Values of the flow metrics derived from the perfusion maps were within normal ranges from published literature values. CONCLUSION: Non-invasive induction of abrupt changes in OHb saturation can function as a novel non-invasive vascular contrast agent for use in perfusion imaging.</content:encoded>

Phenotypic variation in the copy number of gene products expressed by cells or tissues has been the focus of intense investigation. To what extent the observed differences in cellular expression levels are persistent or transient is an intriguing question. Here, we develop a quantitative framework that resolves the expression variation into stable and unstable components. The difference between the expression means in two cohorts isolated from any cell population is shown to converge to an asymptotic value, with a characteristic time, &lt;i&gt;τ&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt;, that measures the timescale of the unstable dynamics. The asymptotic difference in the means, relative to the initial value, measures the stable proportion of the original population variance R α 2. Empowered by this insight, we analysed the T-cell receptor (TCR) expression variation in CD4 T cells. About 70% of TCR expression variance is stable in a diverse polyclonal population, while over 80% of the variance in an isogenic TCR transgenic population is volatile. In both populations the TCR levels fluctuate with a characteristic time of 32 hours. This systematic characterisation of the expression variation dynamics, relying on time series of cohorts’ means, can be combined with technologies that measure gene or protein expression in single cells or in bulk.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/BAblQzdt3Fo&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

The impairment of cognitive function in Alzheimer’s disease is clearly correlated to synapse loss. However, the mechanisms underlying this correlation are only poorly understood. Here, we investigate how the loss of excitatory synapses in sparsely connected random networks of spiking excitatory and inhibitory neurons alters their dynamical characteristics. Beyond the effects on the activity statistics, we find that the loss of excitatory synapses on excitatory neurons reduces the network’s sensitivity to small perturbations. This decrease in sensitivity can be considered as an indication of a reduction of computational capacity. A full recovery of the network’s dynamical characteristics and sensitivity can be achieved by firing rate homeostasis, here implemented by an up-scaling of the remaining excitatory-excitatory synapses. Mean-field analysis reveals that the stability of the linearised network dynamics is, in good approximation, uniquely determined by the firing rate, and thereby explains why firing rate homeostasis preserves not only the firing rate but also the network’s sensitivity to small perturbations.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/jQqBQvPlo5c&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Women with bacterial vaginosis (BV), an imbalance of the vaginal microbiome, are more likely to be colonized by potential pathogens such as &lt;i&gt;Fusobacterium nucleatum&lt;/i&gt;, a bacterium linked with intrauterine infection and preterm birth. However, the conditions and mechanisms supporting pathogen colonization during vaginal dysbiosis remain obscure. We demonstrate that sialidase activity, a diagnostic feature of BV, promoted &lt;i&gt;F&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;nucleatum&lt;/i&gt; foraging and growth on mammalian sialoglycans, a nutrient resource that was otherwise inaccessible because of the lack of endogenous &lt;i&gt;F&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;nucleatum&lt;/i&gt; sialidase. In mice with sialidase-producing vaginal microbiotas, mutant &lt;i&gt;F&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;nucleatum&lt;/i&gt; unable to consume sialic acids was impaired in vaginal colonization. These experiments in mice also led to the discovery that &lt;i&gt;F&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;nucleatum&lt;/i&gt; may also “give back” to the community by reinforcing sialidase activity, a biochemical feature of human dysbiosis. Using human vaginal bacterial communities, we show that &lt;i&gt;F&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;nucleatum&lt;/i&gt; supported robust outgrowth of &lt;i&gt;Gardnerella vaginalis&lt;/i&gt;, a major sialidase producer and one of the most abundant organisms in BV. These results illustrate that mutually beneficial relationships between vaginal bacteria support pathogen colonization and may help maintain features of dysbiosis. These findings challenge the simplistic dogma that the mere absence of “healthy” lactobacilli is the sole mechanism that creates a permissive environment for pathogens during vaginal dysbiosis. Given the ubiquity of &lt;i&gt;F&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;nucleatum&lt;/i&gt; in the human mouth, these studies also suggest a possible mechanism underlying links between vaginal dysbiosis and oral sex.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/7TBR4CibSDA&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

&lt;p&gt;We investigated potential neuroprotective effects of dietary omega‐3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) on white matter damage following closed‐head injury in mice. While injured animals exhibited reduced fractional anisotropy (FA) in the optic tract and brachium compared to the uninjured animals, there was no evidence of neuroprotection from dietary omega‐3 PUFAs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previous studies suggest that long‐term supplementation and dietary intake of omega‐3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) may have neuroprotective effects following brain injury. The objective of this study was to investigate potential neuroprotective effects of omega‐3 PUFAs on white matter following closed‐head trauma. The closed‐head injury model of engineered rotational acceleration (CHIMERA) produces a reproducible injury in the optic tract and brachium of the superior colliculus in mice. Damage is detectable using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) metrics, particularly fractional anisotropy (FA), with sensitivity comparable to histology. We acquired &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 38) and &lt;i&gt;ex vivo&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 41) DTI data in mice divided into sham and CHIMERA groups with two dietary groups: one deficient in omega‐3 PUFAs and one adequate in omega‐3 PUFAs. We examined injury effects (reduction in FA) and neuroprotection (FA reduction modulated by diet) in the optic tract and brachium. We verified that diet did not affect FA in sham animals. In injured animals, we found significantly reduced FA in the optic tract and brachium (~10% reduction, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001), and Bayes factor analysis showed strong evidence to reject the null hypothesis. However, Bayes factor analysis showed substantial evidence to accept the null hypothesis of no diet‐related FA differences in injured animals in the &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;ex vivo&lt;/i&gt; samples. Our results indicate no neuroprotective effect from adequate dietary omega‐3 PUFA intake on white matter damage following traumatic brain injury. Since damage from CHIMERA mainly affects white matter, our results do not necessarily contradict previous findings showing omega‐3 PUFA‐mediated neuroprotection in gray matter.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

&lt;p&gt;Using the capacity of a systemic growth hormone (GH) injection to induce STAT5 phosphorylation in the mouse brain, we identified several neurochemically distinct neuronal populations in the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus that are directly responsive to GH, including tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)‐, somatostatin (SST)‐, thyrotropin‐releasing hormone (TRH)‐ and corticotropin‐releasing hormone (CRH)‐producing neurons.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Multiple neuroendocrine, autonomic and behavioral responses are regulated by the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVH). Previous studies have shown that PVH neurons express the growth hormone (GH) receptor (GHR), although the role of GH signaling on PVH neurons is still unknown. Given the great heterogeneity of cell types located in the PVH, we performed a detailed analysis of the neurochemical identity of GH‐responsive cells to understand the possible physiological importance of GH action on PVH neurons. GH‐responsive cells were detected via the phosphorylated form of the signal transducer and activator of transcription‐5 (pSTAT5) in adult male mice that received an intraperitoneal GH injection. Approximately 51% of GH‐responsive cells in the PVH co‐localized with the vesicular glutamate transporter 2. Rare co‐localizations between pSTAT5 and vesicular GABA transporter or vasopressin were observed, whereas approximately 20% and 38% of oxytocin and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) cells, respectively, were responsive to GH in the PVH. Approximately 55%, 35% and 63% of somatostatin, thyrotropin‐releasing hormone (TRH) and corticotropin‐releasing hormone (CRH) neurons expressed GH‐induced pSTAT5, respectively. Additionally, 8%, 49% and 75% of neuroendocrine TH, TRH and CRH neurons, and 67%, 32% and 74% of non‐neuroendocrine TH, TRH and CRH neurons were responsive to GH in the PVH of Fluoro‐Gold‐injected mice. Our findings suggest that GH action on PVH neurons is involved in the regulation of the thyroid, somatotropic and adrenal endocrine axes, possibly influencing homeostatic and stress responses.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Long‐term exposure to lipid‐lowering drugs might affect Parkinson’s disease (PD) risk. We conducted Mendelian randomization analyses where genetic variants indexed expected effects of modulating lipid‐lowering drug targets on PD. Statin exposure was not predicted to increase PD risk, although results were not precise enough to support benefits for prevention clearly (odds ratio: 0.83; 95% confidence interval: 0.65, 1.07). Other target results were null, except for variants indicating Apolipoprotein‐A5 or Apolipoprotein‐C3 inhibition might confer protection. These findings suggest peripheral lipid variation may not have a prominent role in PD etiology, but some related drug targets could influence PD via alternate pathways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whole mount immunohistochemistry and confocal microscopy were used on juveniles of three echinoderm species to characterize their neuroanatomy. Detailed comparisons confirmed the conservation, among the three species, of a tripartite neuroanatomical organization and revealed similar innervation patterns at the level of the appendages (i.e. the podia and the spines).

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The echinoderms are a phylum of marine deuterostomes characterized by the pentaradial (five fold) symmetry of their adult bodies. Due to this unusual body plan, adult echinoderms have long been excluded from comparative analyses aimed at understanding the origin and evolution of deuterostome nervous systems. Here, we investigated the neural anatomy of early juveniles of members of three of the five echinoderm classes: the echinoid &lt;i&gt;Paracentrotus lividus&lt;/i&gt;, the asteroid &lt;i&gt;Patiria miniata&lt;/i&gt;, and the holothuroid &lt;i&gt;Parastichopus parvimensis&lt;/i&gt;. Using whole mount immunohistochemistry and confocal microscopy, we found that the nervous system of echinoid early juveniles is composed of three main structures: a basiepidermal nerve plexus, five radial nerve cords connected by a circumoral nerve ring, and peripheral nerves innervating the appendages. Our whole mount preparations further allowed us to obtain thorough descriptions of these structures and of several innervation patterns, in particular at the level of the appendages. Detailed comparisons of the echinoid juvenile nervous system with those of asteroid and holothuroid juveniles moreover supported a general conservation of the main neural structures in all three species. Our results sustain the hypotheses of previous work for the existence of two neural units in echinoderms: one consisting of the basiepidermal nerve plexus to process sensory stimuli locally, and one composed of the radial nerve cords and the peripheral nerves constituting a centralized control system. This study provides the basis of more in‐depth comparisons of the echinoderm adult nervous system with those of other animals, in particular hemichordates and chordates, to address the long‐standing controversies about deuterostome nervous system evolution.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

&lt;p&gt;Photoreceptor morphology and anatomy, including their density distribution and orientation were studied in the skate &lt;i&gt;Leucoraja erinacea&lt;/i&gt;. In addition to a dorsal visual streak, which is typical in elasmobranchs, photoreceptors were noticeably tilted, a finding that has to date not received much attention. Skate &lt;i&gt;L. erinacea&lt;/i&gt; (left), and image of a whole‐mounted retina showing retinal photoreceptors (right).

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Studying retinal specializations offers insights into eye functionality and visual ecology. Using light microscopic techniques, including retinal whole‐mounts, we investigated photoreceptor densities in the retina of the skate &lt;i&gt;Leucoraja erinacea.&lt;/i&gt; We show that photoreceptors are not sized or oriented in the same way, and that they are not evenly distributed across the retina. There was a dorsally located horizontal visual streak with increased photoreceptor density, with additional local maxima in which densities were highest. Photoreceptors were longest and thinnest inside this visual streak, becoming shorter and thicker toward the periphery and toward the ventral retina. Furthermore, in the peripheral retinal parts, photoreceptors (particularly the outer segments) were noticeably tilted with respect to the retinal long axis. In order to understand how photoreceptors are tilted inside the eye, we used computerized tomography (CT) and micro‐CT, to obtain geometrical dimensions of the whole skate eye. These CT/micro‐CT data provided us with the outlines of the skate eye and the location of the retina and this enabled us to reconstruct how photoreceptors tilt in an intact eye. Findings were analyzed relative to previously published ganglion cell distributions in this species, showing a posteriorly located retinal area with photoreceptor:ganglion cell convergence as low as 39:1. Some peripheral areas showed ratios as high as 391:1. We frame our findings in terms of the animal’s anatomy: body and eye shape, specifically the location of the tapetum, as well as the visual demands associated with lifestyle and habitat type. A speculative function in polarization sensitivity is discussed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A 19‐to‐16 million year old natural endocast of an odontocete whale is described and compared. The exceptional preservation allowed the identification of major neural and vascular characters opening a window into the cetacean brain evolution. The encephalization quotient and other statistical analyses revealed that this endocast belonged to a scarcely encephalized, early‐diverging toothed whale and helped in interpreting a number of morphological changes in odontocete brain evolution.


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The natural endocast MGPT‐PU 13873 is described and analyzed in order to interpret its taxonomic affinities and its potential significance on our understanding of cetacean brain evolution. The endocast is from the early Miocene of Piedmont (between &lt;i&gt;c.&lt;/i&gt; 19 and 16 million years ago), Northwestern Italy, and shows a number of plesiomorphic characters. These include: scarcely rounded cerebral hemispheres, cerebellum exposed in dorsal view with little superimposition by the cerebral hemispheres, short temporal lobe and long sylvian fissure. The distance between the hypophysis and the rostral pons is particularly high, as it was determined by the calculus of the hypothalamus quotient, suggesting that the development of a deep interpeduncular fossa was not as advanced as in living odontocetes. The encephalization quotient of MGPT‐PU 13873 is &lt;i&gt;c.&lt;/i&gt; 1.81, therefore this specimen shows an encephalization quotient in line with other fossil whales of the same geological age (early Miocene). Comparative analysis shows that there is a critical lack of data from the late Miocene and Pliocene that prevents us to fully understand the recent evolution of the EQ diversity in whales. Moreover, the past diversity of brain size and shape in mysticetes is virtually unknown. All these observations point to the need of additional efforts to uncover evolutionary patterns and processes on cetacean brain evolution.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Existing disentanglement methods for deep generative models rely on
hand-picked priors and complex encoder-based architectures. In this paper, we
propose the Hessian Penalty, a simple regularization term that encourages the
Hessian of a generative model with respect to its input to be diagonal. We
introduce a model-agnostic, unbiased stochastic approximation of this term
based on Hutchinson's estimator to compute it efficiently during training. Our
method can be applied to a wide range of deep generators with just a few lines
of code. We show that training with the Hessian Penalty often causes
axis-aligned disentanglement to emerge in latent space when applied to ProGAN
on several datasets. Additionally, we use our regularization term to identify
interpretable directions in BigGAN's latent space in an unsupervised fashion.
Finally, we provide empirical evidence that the Hessian Penalty encourages
substantial shrinkage when applied to over-parameterized latent spaces.

build a continuous-state formulation that prescribes the brain's computation
for actively inferring the causes of sensory inputs, based on the principle of
least action. For this, we consider that the motor signal arises from the
residual errors in the cognitive expectation about the nonstationary sensory
inputs at the proprioceptive level. Consequently, we derive the effective
Hamilton equations that determine the optimal trajectories in the perceptual
phase space, which minimize the sensory uncertainty. We also demonstrate their
utility using a simple model with biological relevance to sensorimotor
regulation processes such as motor reflex arcs or saccadic eye movement.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Single-objective bilevel optimization is a specialized form of constraint
optimization problems where one of the constraints is an optimization problem
itself. These problems are typically non-convex and strongly NP-Hard. Recently,
there has been an increased interest from the evolutionary computation
community to model bilevel problems due to its applicability in the real-world
applications for decision-making problems. In this work, a partial nested
evolutionary approach with a local heuristic search has been proposed to solve
the benchmark problems and have outstanding results. This approach relies on
the concept of intermarriage-crossover in search of feasible regions by
exploiting information from the constraints. A new variant has also been
proposed to the commonly used convergence approaches, i.e., optimistic and
pessimistic. It is called extreme optimistic approach. The experimental results
demonstrate the algorithm converges differently to known optimum solutions with
the optimistic variants. Optimistic approach also outperforms pessimistic
approach. Comparative statistical analysis of our approach with other recently
published partial to complete evolutionary approaches demonstrates very
competitive results.

	<title>arXiv: Computer Science: Neural and Evolutionary Computing: iCVI-ARTMAP: Accelerating and improving clustering using adaptive resonance theory predictive mapping and incremental cluster validity indices. (arXiv:2008.09903v1 [cs.LG])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2008.09903</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;This paper presents an adaptive resonance theory predictive mapping (ARTMAP)
model which uses incremental cluster validity indices (iCVIs) to perform
unsupervised learning, namely iCVI-ARTMAP. Incorporating iCVIs to the
decision-making and many-to-one mapping capabilities of ARTMAP can improve the
choices of clusters to which samples are incrementally assigned. These
improvements are accomplished by intelligently performing the operations of
swapping sample assignments between clusters, splitting and merging clusters,
and caching the values of variables when iCVI values need to be recomputed.
Using recursive formulations enables iCVI-ARTMAP to considerably reduce the
computational burden associated with cluster validity index (CVI)-based offline
clustering. Depending on the iCVI and the data set, it can achieve running
times up to two orders of magnitude shorter than when using batch CVI
computations. In this work, the incremental versions of Calinski-Harabasz,
WB-index, Xie-Beni, Davies-Bouldin, Pakhira-Bandyopadhyay-Maulik, and
negentropy increment were integrated into fuzzy ARTMAP. Experimental results
show that, with proper choice of iCVI, iCVI-ARTMAP outperformed fuzzy adaptive
resonance theory (ART), dual vigilance fuzzy ART, kmeans, spectral clustering,
Gaussian mixture models and hierarchical agglomerative clustering algorithms in
most of the synthetic benchmark data sets. It also performed competitively on
real world image benchmark data sets when clustering on projections and on
latent spaces generated by a deep clustering model. Naturally, the performance
of iCVI-ARTMAP is subject to the selected iCVI and its suitability to the data
at hand; fortunately, it is a general model wherein other iCVIs can be easily
embedded.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Game-playing Evolutionary Algorithms, specifically Rolling Horizon
Evolutionary Algorithms, have recently managed to beat the state of the art in
win rate across many video games. However, the best results in a game are
highly dependent on the specific configuration of modifications and hybrids

algorithm. Further, the best previously published parameters have been found
from only a few human-picked combinations, as the possibility space has grown
beyond exhaustive search. This paper presents the state of the art in Rolling
Horizon Evolutionary Algorithms, combining all modifications described in
literature, as well as new ones, for a large resultant hybrid. We then use a
parameter optimiser, the N-Tuple Bandit Evolutionary Algorithm, to find the
best combination of parameters in 20 games from the General Video Game AI
Framework. Further, we analyse the algorithm's parameters and some interesting

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;There is a significantly accelerating trend in the application of the marine
wave energy converters in recent years. As a result, it is imperative to adopt
a suitable point for implementing these systems. Besides, the Caspian Sea, as
one of the most important marine renewable energy sources in Asia, is capable
of supplying the coastal areas with a large amount of energy. Therefore, areas
around nine ports in the southern coasts of the Caspian Sea were selected to
measure their wave energy potential. Initially, the amount of energy on these
points was measured using the irregular energy theory. It was observed that the
wave power was higher in the southwestern areas (within the Kiashahr coast and
Anzali port) than the southeastern areas. A new approach was developed to
compare these points and measure their fitnesses in supplying the maximum
energy using the Grey Wolf optimizer (GWO) algorithm and time history analysis.
In this method, the optimal parameters were first extracted from the algorithm
for assessing the points within the southern areas of the Caspian Sea. These
values were regarded as the assessment indices. Then, the fitness of each point
was obtained using the correlation function and the norm vector to present the
most optimal position with maximum wave energy exploitation potential. This new
approach was validated with analytical data, and its accuracy in predicting and
comparing the wave power on different points was approved. Finally, by a
side-by-side comparison of the parameters affecting the wave energy, the
optimum range of significant wave height and wave energy period was achieved.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Automatic classification of epileptic seizure types in electroencephalograms
(EEGs) data can enable more precise diagnosis and efficient management of the
disease. This task is challenging due to factors such as low signal-to-noise
ratios, signal artefacts, high variance in seizure semiology among epileptic
patients, and limited availability of clinical data. To overcome these
challenges, in this paper, we present SeizureNet, a deep learning framework
which learns multi-spectral feature embeddings using an ensemble architecture
for cross-patient seizure type classification. We used the recently released
TUH EEG Seizure Corpus (V1.4.0 and V1.5.2) to evaluate the performance of
SeizureNet. Experiments show that SeizureNet can reach a weighted F1 score of
up to 0.95 for seizure-wise cross validation and 0.62 for patient-wise cross
validation for scalp EEG based multi-class seizure type classification. We also
show that the high-level feature embeddings learnt by SeizureNet considerably
improve the accuracy of smaller networks through knowledge distillation for
applications with low-memory constraints.

	<title>arXiv: Computer Science: Neural and Evolutionary Computing: An evolutionary model that satisfies detailed balance. (arXiv:1902.10834v2 [cs.NE] UPDATED)</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1902.10834</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;We propose a class of evolutionary models that involves an arbitrary
exchangeable process as the breeding process and different selection schemes.
In those models, a new genome is born according to the breeding process, and
then a genome is removed according to the selection scheme that involves
fitness. Thus the population size remains constant. The process evolves
according to a Markov chain, and, unlike in many other existing models, the
stationary distribution -- so called mutation-selection equilibrium -- can be
easily found and studied. The behaviour of the stationary distribution when the
population size increases is our main object of interest. Several
phase-transition theorems are proved.

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Structure and Functions of Sidekicks</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2020.00139</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Many of the immunoglobulin superfamily (IgSF) molecules play pivotal roles in cell communication. The Sidekick (Sdk) gene, first described in Drosophila, encodes the single-pass transmembrane protein, Sdk, which is one of the largest among IgSF membrane proteins. Sdk first appeared in multicellular animals during the Precambrian age and later evolved to Sdk1 and Sdk2 in vertebrates by gene duplication. In flies, a single Sdk is involved in positioning photoreceptor neurons and their axons in the visual system and is responsible for dynamically rearranging cell shapes by strictly populating tricellular adherens junctions in epithelia. In vertebrates, Sdk1 and Sdk2 are expressed by unique sets of cell types and distinctively participate in the formation and/or maintenance of neural circuits in the retina, indicating that they are determinants of synaptic specificity. These functions are mediated by specific homophilic binding of their ectodomains and by intracellular association with PDZ scaffold proteins. Recent human genetic studies as well as animal experiments implicate that Sdk genes may influence various neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders, such as autism spectrum disorders, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, addiction, and depression. The gigantic Sdk1 gene is susceptible to erratic gene rearrangements or mutations in both somatic and germ-line cells, potentially contributing to neurological disorders and some types of cancers. This review summarizes what is known about the structure and roles of Sdks.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Diffusion Tensor Imaging and Chemical Exchange Saturation Transfer MRI Evaluation on the Long-Term Effects of Pulsed Focused Ultrasound and Microbubbles Blood Brain Barrier Opening in the Rat</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00908</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Blood-brain barrier opening (BBBO) with pulsed Focused Ultrasound (pFUS) and microbubbles (MB) has received increasing interest as a method for neurotherapeutics of the central nervous system. In general, conventional MRI [i.e., T2w, T2&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt;w, gadolinium (Gd) enhanced T1w] is used to monitor the effects of pFUS+MB on BBBO and/or assess whether sonication results in parenchymal damage. This study employed multimodal MRI techniques and &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F-Fludeoxyglucose (FDG) PET to evaluate the effects of single and multiple weekly pFUS+MB sessions on morphology and glucose utilization levels in the rat cortex and hippocampus. pFUS was performed with 0.548 MHz transducer with a slow infusion over 1 min of Optison&lt;sup&gt;TM&lt;/sup&gt; (5–8 × 10&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; MB) in nine focal points in cortex and four in hippocampus. During pFUS+MB treatment, Gd-T1w was performed at 3 T to confirm BBBO, along with subsequent T2w, T2&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt;w, DTI and glucose CEST (glucoCEST)-weighted imaging by high field 9.4 T and compared with FDG-PET and immunohistochemistry. Animals receiving a single pFUS+MB exhibited minimal hypointense voxels on T2&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt;w. Brains receiving multiple pFUS+MB treatments demonstrated persistent T2w and T2&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt; abnormalities associated with changes in DTI and glucoCEST when compared to contralateral parenchyma. Decreased glucoCEST contrast was substantiated by FDG-PET in cortex following multiple sonications. Immunohistochemistry showed significantly dilated vessels and decreased neuronal glucose transporter (GLUT3) expression in sonicated cortex and hippocampus without changes in neuronal counts. These results suggest the importance to standardize MRI protocols in concert with advanced imaging techniques when evaluating long term effects of pFUS+MB BBBO in clinical trials for neurological diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Olfaction is in addition to touch the most ancient of our senses, developing already in the womb it decays progressively from 65 years of age with a more pronounced impairment associated with dementia. Despite its clinical relevance and testing accessibility, smell remains an overlooked biomarker, which is rarely used by neurologists in the early screening phase. In this perspective article, we outline the reasons underlying the lack of awareness for this sense. In an attempt to put olfaction forward as an early biomarker for pathological brain aging, we draw a comparison with vision and hearing, regarded as more relevant for general health. This perspective article wants to encourage further studies aimed at understanding the mechanisms responsible for the early smell dysfunction in individuals a decade or more before the onset of cognitive symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Neurodynamic Utility Toolbox for Magnetoencephalo- and Electroencephalography (NUTMEG) is an open-source MATLAB-based toolbox for the analysis and reconstruction of magnetoencephalography/electroencephalography data in source space. NUTMEG includes a variety of options for the user in data import, preprocessing, source reconstruction, and functional connectivity. A group analysis toolbox allows the user to run a variety of inferential statistics on their data in an easy-to-use GUI-driven format. Importantly, NUTMEG features an interactive five-dimensional data visualization platform. A key feature of NUTMEG is the availability of a large menu of interference cancelation and source reconstruction algorithms. Each NUTMEG operation acts as a stand-alone MATLAB function, allowing the package to be easily adaptable and scripted for the more advanced user for interoperability with other software toolboxes. Therefore, NUTMEG enables a wide range of users access to a complete “sensor-to- source-statistics” analysis pipeline.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00344</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Respect is a positive other-oriented social emotion upon the recognition of excellence in others. We previously reported that respect-related brain activity in the left anterior temporal lobe (ATL). Since brain activity and structure are often involved in common cognitive functions, we investigated the morphological properties of the left ATL using voxel-based morphometry analysis. We found an association of trait respect with reduced gray matter volume (GMV) in part of the left ATL. Moreover, since the ATL is involved in general conceptual knowledge, we investigated the relationships between other social emotions with similar properties as respect and the GMV of the left ATL. We observed an association of reduced GMV with empathic concern, which is an other-oriented and affective aspect of trait empathy. Our findings indicated an association of the left ATL with other-oriented and affective aspect of social emotions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Activation of Functional Brain Networks in Children With Psychogenic Non-epileptic Seizures</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00339</link>
	<content:encoded>Objectives&lt;p&gt;Psychogenic non-epileptic seizures (PNES) have been hypothesized to emerge in the context of neural networks instability. To explore this hypothesis in children, we applied a graph theory approach to examine connectivity in neural networks in the resting-state EEG in 35 children with PNES, 31 children with other functional neurological symptoms (but no PNES), and 75 healthy controls.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;The networks were extracted from Laplacian-transformed time series by a coherence connectivity estimation method.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Children with PNES (vs. controls) showed widespread changes in network metrics: increased global efficiency (gamma and beta bands), increased local efficiency (gamma band), and increased modularity (gamma and alpha bands). Compared to controls, they also had higher levels of autonomic arousal (e.g., lower heart variability); more anxiety, depression, and stress on the Depression Anxiety and Stress Scales; and more adverse childhood experiences on the Early Life Stress Questionnaire. Increases in network metrics correlated with arousal. Children with other functional neurological symptoms (but no PNES) showed scattered and less pronounced changes in network metrics.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;The results indicate that children with PNES present with increased activation of neural networks coupled with increased physiological arousal. While this shift in functional organization may confer a short-term adaptive advantage—one that facilitates neural communication and the child’s capacity to respond self-protectively in the face of stressful life events—it may also have a significant biological cost. It may predispose the child’s neural networks to periods of instability—presenting clinically as PNES—when the neural networks are faced with perturbations in energy flow or with additional demands.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Physiological and Behavioral Factors in Musicians’ Performance Tempo</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00311</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Musicians display individual differences in their spontaneous performance rates (tempo) for simple melodies, but the factors responsible are unknown. Previous research suggests that musical tempo modulates listeners’ cardiovascular activity. We report an investigation of musicians’ melody performances measured over a 12-h day and subsequent changes in the musicians’ physiological activity. Skilled pianists completed four testing sessions in a single day as cardiac activity was recorded during an initial 5 min of baseline rest and during performances of familiar and unfamiliar melodies. Results indicated slower tempi for familiar and unfamiliar melodies at early testing times. Performance rates at 09 h were predicted by differences in participants’ alertness and musical training; these differences were not explained by sleep patterns, chronotype, or cardiac activity. Individual differences in pianists’ performance tempo were consistent across testing sessions: participants with a faster tempo at 09 h maintained a faster tempo at later testing sessions. Cardiac measures at early testing times indicated increased heart rates and more predictable cardiac dynamics during music performance than baseline rest, and during performances of unfamiliar melodies than familiar melodies. These findings provide the first evidence of cardiac dynamics that are unique to music performance contexts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Rac1 Impairs Forgetting-Induced Cellular Plasticity in Mushroom Body Output Neurons</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00258</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Active memory forgetting is a well-regulated biological process thought to be adaptive and to allow proper cognitive functions. Recent efforts have elucidated several molecular players involved in the regulation of olfactory forgetting in Drosophila, including the small G protein Rac1, the dopamine receptor DAMB, and the scaffold protein Scribble. Similarly, we recently reported that dopaminergic neurons mediate both learning- and forgetting-induced plasticity in the mushroom body output neuron MBON-γ2α′1. Two open questions remain: how does forgetting affect plasticity in other, highly plastic, mushroom body compartments and how do genes that regulate forgetting affect this cellular plasticity? Here, we show that forgetting reverses short-term synaptic depression induced by aversive conditioning in the highly plastic mushroom body output neuron MBON-γ1pedc&amp;gt;α/β. In addition, our results indicate that genetic tampering with normal forgetting by inhibition of small G protein Rac1 impairs restoration of depressed odor responses to learned odor by intrinsic forgetting through time passing and forgetting induced acutely by shock stimulation after conditioning or reversal learning. These data further indicate that some forms of forgetting truly erase physiological changes generated by memory encoding.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/61238</link>
	<content:encoded>Typical human perception features stable biases such as perceiving visual events as later than synchronous auditory events. The origin of such perceptual biases is unknown. To investigate the role of early sensory experience, we tested whether a congenital, transient loss of pattern vision, caused by bilateral dense cataracts, has sustained effects on audio-visual and tactile-visual temporal biases and resolution. Participants judged the temporal order of successively presented, spatially separated events within and across modalities. Individuals with reversed congenital cataracts showed a bias towards perceiving visual stimuli as occurring earlier than auditory (Expt. 1) and tactile (Expt. 2) stimuli. This finding stood in stark contrast to normally sighted controls and sight-recovery individuals who had developed cataracts later in childhood: both groups exhibited the typical bias of perceiving vision as delayed compared to audition. These findings provide strong evidence that cross-modal temporal biases depend on sensory experience during an early sensitive period.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/59212</link>
	<content:encoded>Avian influenza outbreaks have been occurring on smallholder poultry farms in Asia for two decades. Farmer responses to these outbreaks can slow down or accelerate virus transmission. We used a longitudinal survey of 53 small-scale chicken farms in southern Vietnam to investigate the impact of outbreaks with disease-induced mortality on harvest rate, vaccination, and disinfection behaviors. We found that in small broiler flocks (≤16 birds/flock) the estimated probability of harvest was 56% higher when an outbreak occurred, and 214% higher if an outbreak with sudden deaths occurred in the same month. Vaccination and disinfection were strongly and positively correlated with the number of birds. Small-scale farmers – the overwhelming majority of poultry producers in low-income countries – tend to rely on rapid sale of birds to mitigate losses from diseases. As depopulated birds are sent to markets or trading networks, this reactive behavior has the potential to enhance onward transmission.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: A novel acidification mechanism for greatly enhanced oxygen supply to the fish retina</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/58995</link>
	<content:encoded>Previously, we showed that the evolution of high acuity vision in fishes was directly associated with their unique pH-sensitive hemoglobins that allow O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to be delivered to the retina at PO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;s more than ten-fold that of arterial blood (Damsgaard et al., 2019). Here, we show strong evidence that vacuolar-type H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-ATPase and plasma-accessible carbonic anhydrase in the vascular structure supplying the retina act together to acidify the red blood cell leading to O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; secretion. In vivo data indicate that this pathway primarily affects the oxygenation of the inner retina involved in signal processing and transduction, and that the evolution of this pathway was tightly associated with the morphological expansion of the inner retina. We conclude that this mechanism for retinal oxygenation played a vital role in the adaptive evolution of vision in teleost fishes.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/58810</link>
	<content:encoded>Breast cancer stem cells (BCSCs) contribute to intra-tumoral heterogeneity and therapeutic resistance. However, the binary concept of universal BCSCs co-existing with bulk tumor cells is over-simplified. Through single-cell RNA-sequencing, we found that Neu, PyMT and BRCA1-null mammary tumors each corresponded to a spectrum of minimally overlapping cell differentiation states without a universal BCSC population. Instead, our analyses revealed that these tumors contained distinct lineage-specific tumor propagating cells (TPCs) and this is reflective of the self-sustaining capabilities of lineage-specific stem/progenitor cells in the mammary epithelial hierarchy. By understanding the respective tumor hierarchies, we were able to identify CD14 as a TPC marker in the Neu tumor. Additionally, single-cell breast cancer subtype stratification revealed the co-existence of multiple breast cancer subtypes within tumors. Collectively, our findings emphasize the need to account for lineage-specific TPCs and the hierarchical composition within breast tumors, as these heterogenous sub-populations can have differential therapeutic susceptibilities.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/58567</link>
	<content:encoded>We examined whether specifically statins, of the major lipid modifiers (statins, proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors and ezetimibe) have pleiotropic effects on ischemic heart disease (IHD) via testosterone in men or women. As a validation, we similarly assessed whether a drug that unexpectedly likely increases IHD also operates via testosterone. Using previously published genetic instruments we conducted a sex-specific univariable and multivariable Mendelian randomization study in the UK Biobank, including 179918 men with 25410 IHD cases and 212080 women with 12511 IHD cases. Of these three lipid modifiers, only genetically mimicking the effects of statins in men affected testosterone, which partly mediated effects on IHD. Correspondingly, genetically mimicking effects of anakinra on testosterone and IHD presented a reverse pattern to that for statins. These insights may facilitate the development of new interventions for cardiovascular diseases as well as highlighting the importance of sex-specific explanations, investigations, prevention and treatment.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/58498</link>
	<content:encoded>A rapidly growing body of literature in several organisms suggests that environmentally-induced adaptive changes in phenotype can be transmitted across multiple generations. Although within-generation plasticity has been well documented, multigenerational plasticity represents a significant departure from conventional evolutionary thought. Studies of &lt;i&gt;C. elegans&lt;/i&gt; have been particularly influential because this species exhibits extensive phenotypic plasticity, it is often essentially isogenic, and it has well-documented molecular and cellular mechanisms through which nongenetic inheritance occurs. However, while experimentalists are eager to claim that nongenetic modes of inheritance characterized in this and other model systems enhance fitness, many biologists remain skeptical given the extraordinary nature of this claim. We establish three criteria to evaluate how compelling the evidence for adaptive multigenerational plasticity is, and we use these criteria to critically examine putative cases of it in &lt;i&gt;C. elegans.&lt;/i&gt; We conclude by suggesting potentially fruitful avenues for future research.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: A transient role of the ciliary gene Inpp5e in controlling direct versus indirect neurogenesis in cortical development</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/58162</link>
	<content:encoded>During the development of the cerebral cortex, neurons are generated directly from radial glial cells or indirectly via basal progenitors. The balance between these division modes determines the number and types of neurons formed in the cortex thereby affecting cortical functioning. Here, we investigate the role of primary cilia in controlling the decision between forming neurons directly or indirectly. We show that a mutation in the ciliary gene &lt;i&gt;Inpp5e&lt;/i&gt; leads to a transient increase in direct neurogenesis and subsequently to an overproduction of layer V neurons in newborn mice. Loss of &lt;i&gt;Inpp5e&lt;/i&gt; also affects ciliary structure coinciding with reduced Gli3 repressor levels. Genetically restoring Gli3 repressor rescues the decreased indirect neurogenesis in &lt;i&gt;Inpp5e&lt;/i&gt; mutants. Overall, our analyses reveal how primary cilia determine neuronal subtype composition of the cortex by controlling direct versus indirect neurogenesis. These findings have implications for understanding cortical malformations in ciliopathies with &lt;i&gt;INPP5E&lt;/i&gt; mutations.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Respiration, an essential metabolic process, provides cells with chemical energy. In eukaryotes, respiration occurs via the mitochondrial electron transport chain (mETC) composed of several large membrane-protein complexes. Complex I (CI) is the main entry point for electrons into the mETC. For plants, limited availability of mitochondrial material has curbed detailed biochemical and structural studies of their mETC. Here, we present the cryoEM structure of the known CI assembly intermediate CI* from &lt;i&gt;Vigna radiata&lt;/i&gt; at 3.9 Å resolution. CI* contains CI’s NADH-binding and CoQ-binding modules, the proximal-pumping module and the plant-specific γ-carbonic-anhydrase domain (γCA). Our structure reveals significant differences in core and accessory subunits of the plant complex compared to yeast, mammals and bacteria, as well as the details of the γCA domain subunit composition and membrane anchoring. The structure sheds light on differences in CI assembly across lineages and suggests potential physiological roles for CI* beyond assembly.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: Ageing compromises mouse thymus function and remodels epithelial cell differentiation</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/56221</link>
	<content:encoded>Ageing is characterised by cellular senescence, leading to imbalanced tissue maintenance, cell death and compromised organ function. This is first observed in the thymus, the primary lymphoid organ that generates and selects T cells. However, the molecular and cellular mechanisms underpinning these ageing processes remain unclear. Here, we show that mouse ageing leads to less efficient T cell selection, decreased self-antigen representation and increased T cell receptor repertoire diversity. Using a combination of single-cell RNA-seq and lineage-tracing, we find that progenitor cells are the principal targets of ageing, whereas the function of individual mature thymic epithelial cells is compromised only modestly. Specifically, an early-life precursor cell population, retained in the mouse cortex postnatally, is virtually extinguished at puberty. Concomitantly, a medullary precursor cell quiesces, thereby impairing maintenance of the medullary epithelium. Thus, ageing disrupts thymic progenitor differentiation and impairs the core immunological functions of the thymus.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>The social interactions underlying group foraging and their benefits have been mostly studied using mechanistic models replicating qualitative features of group behavior, and focused on a single resource or a few clustered ones. Here, we tracked groups of freely foraging adult zebrafish with spatially dispersed food items and found that fish perform stereotypical maneuvers when consuming food, which attract neighboring fish. We then present a mathematical model, based on &lt;i&gt;inferred&lt;/i&gt; functional interactions between fish, which accurately describes individual and group foraging of real fish. We show that these interactions allow fish to combine individual and social information to achieve near-optimal foraging efficiency and promote income equality within groups. We further show that the interactions that would maximize efficiency in these social foraging models depend on group size, but not on food distribution - suggesting that fish may adaptively pick the subgroup of neighbors they 'listen to' to determine their own behavior.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/54385</link>
	<content:encoded>Long-lived cells such as terminally differentiated postmitotic neurons and glia must cope with the accumulation of damage over the course of an animal’s lifespan. How long-lived cells deal with ageing-related damage is poorly understood. Here we show that polyploid cells accumulate in the adult fly brain and that polyploidy protects against DNA damage-induced cell death. Multiple types of neurons and glia that are diploid at eclosion, become polyploid in the adult &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; brain. The optic lobes exhibit the highest levels of polyploidy, associated with an elevated DNA damage response in this brain region. Inducing oxidative stress or exogenous DNA damage leads to an earlier onset of polyploidy, and polyploid cells in the adult brain are more resistant to DNA damage-induced cell death than diploid cells. Our results suggest polyploidy may serve a protective role for neurons and glia in adult &lt;i&gt;Drosophila melanogaster&lt;/i&gt; brains.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/53051</link>
	<content:encoded>In speech, listeners extract continuously-varying spectrotemporal cues from the acoustic signal to perceive discrete phonetic categories. Spectral cues are spatially encoded in the amplitude of responses in phonetically-tuned neural populations in auditory cortex. It remains unknown whether similar neurophysiological mechanisms encode temporal cues like voice-onset time (VOT), which distinguishes sounds like /&lt;i&gt;b&lt;/i&gt;/-/&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;/. We used direct brain recordings in humans to investigate the neural encoding of temporal speech cues with a VOT continuum from /&lt;i&gt;ba&lt;/i&gt;/ to /&lt;i&gt;pa&lt;/i&gt;/. We found that distinct neural populations respond preferentially to VOTs from one phonetic category, and are also sensitive to sub-phonetic VOT differences within a population's preferred category. In a simple neural network model, simulated populations tuned to detect either temporal gaps or coincidences between spectral cues captured encoding patterns observed in real neural data. These results demonstrate that a spatial/amplitude neural code underlies the cortical representation of both spectral and temporal speech cues.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.08.25.267278v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Competent social functioning of group-living species relies on the ability of individuals to detect and utilize conspecific social cues to guide behavior. In many species, cues about an individual's identity, including social status, are conveyed through urinary proteins. Previous studies have identified numerous brain regions involved in processing these external cues, collectively referred to as the Social Decision-Making Network. However, how the brain encodes social information with respect to an individual's internal social status has not been thoroughly examined. Here we show that neuronal activity in male mice, as indicated by cFos immunoreactivity, is modulated by the social status and familiarity of the cue source and the subject's own social status. The posteroventral medial amygdala was the only brain region that responded exclusively to the social status of the cue source. Activity in other brain regions was modulated by social status. Specifically, within the brain of dominant subjects there was robust differential activity dependent on the status or familiarity of the cue source. Our results suggest that individuals perceive social cues differently depending on their social experience. These data inform further the investigation of neurobiological mechanisms underlying social-status related brain differences and how social status-associated differences influence physiology and behavior.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.08.25.266841v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>White matter pathways form a complex network of myelinated axons that regulate signal transmission in the nervous system and play a key role in behaviour and cognition. Recent evidence reveals that white matter networks are adaptive and that myelin remodels itself in an activity-dependent way, during both developmental stages and later on through behaviour and learning. As a result, axonal conduction delays continuously adjust in order to regulate the timing of neural signals propagating between different brain areas. This delay plasticity mechanism has yet to be integrated in computational neural models, where conduction delays are oftentimes constant or simply ignored. As a first approach to adaptive white matter remodelling, we modified the canonical Kuramoto model by enabling all connections with adaptive, phase-dependent delays. We analyzed the equilibria and stability of this system, and applied our results to two oscillator and large dimensional networks. Our joint mathematical and numerical analysis demonstrates that plastic delays act as a stabilizing mechanism promoting the network's ability to maintain synchronous activity. Our work also shows that global synchronization is more resilient to perturbations and injury towards network architecture. Our results provide key insights about the analysis and potential significance of activity-dependent myelination in large-scale brain synchrony.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Categorization is an essential cognitive and perceptual process for recognition and decision making. The posterior parietal cortex (PPC), particularly the lateral intraparietal (LIP) area has been suggested to transform visual feature encoding into cognitive or abstract category representations. By contrast, areas closer to sensory input, such as the middle temporal (MT) area, encode stimulus features but not more abstract categorical information during categorization tasks. Here, we compare the contributions of PPC subregions in category computation by recording neuronal activity in the medial superior temporal (MST) and LIP areas during a categorization task. MST is a core motion processing area interconnected with MT, and often considered an intermediate processing stage between MT and LIP. Here we show that MST shows robust decision-correlated category encoding and working memory encoding similar to LIP, suggesting that MST plays a substantial role in cognitive computation, extending beyond its widely recognized role in visual motion processing.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Biological aging is revealed by physical measures, e.g., DNA probes or brain scans. Individual differences in personal functioning are instead explained by psychological constructs. Constructs such as intelligence or neuroticism are typically assessed by specialized workforce through tailored questionnaires and tests. Similar to how brain age captures biological aging, intelligence and neuroticism may provide empirical proxies for mental health. Could the combination of brain imaging and sociodemographic information yield measures for these constructs that do not rely on human judgment? Here, we built proxy measures by applying machine learning on multimodal MR images and rich sociodemographic information from the largest brain-imaging cohort to date: the UK Biobank. Objective comparisons revealed that all proxies captured the target constructs and related to health-contributing habits beyond the measures they were derived from. Our results demonstrate that proxies targeting classical psychological constructs reveal facets of mental health complementary to information conveyed by brain age.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Stellate cell computational modelling predicts signal filtering in the molecular layer circuit of cerebellum</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.08.25.266429v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>The functional properties of cerebellar stellate cells and the way they regulate molecular layer activity are still unclear. We have measured stellate cells electroresponsiveness and their activation by parallel fiber bursts. Stellate cells showed intrinsic pacemaking, along with characteristic responses to depolarization and hyperpolarization, and showed a marked short-term facilitation during repetitive parallel fiber transmission. Spikes were emitted after a lag and only at high frequency, making stellate cells to operate as delay-high-pass filters. A detailed computational model summarizing these physiological properties allowed to explore different functional configurations of the parallel fiber-stellate cell-Purkinje cell circuit. Simulations showed that, following parallel fiber stimulation, Purkinje cells almost linearly increased their response with input frequency but such an increase was inhibited by stellate cells, which leveled the Purkinje cell gain curve to its 4 Hz value. When reciprocal inhibitory connections between stellate cells were activated, the control of stellate cells over Purkinje cell discharge was maintained only at very high frequencies. These simulations thus predict a new role for stellate cells, which could endow the molecular layer with low-pass and band-pass filtering properties regulating Purkinje cell gain and, along with this, also burst delay and the burst-pause responses pattern.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Medial prefrontal activity at encoding determines recognition of threatening faces after 1.5 years</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.08.25.266353v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Studies demonstrated that faces with emotional expressions are better remembered than neutral faces. However, whether the memory advantage persists over years and which neural systems mediate such an effect remains unknown. We investigated recognition of incidentally encoded faces with angry, fearful, happy, sad and neutral expressions over &amp;gt;1.5 years (N=102). Both univariate and multivariate analyses showed that faces with threatening expressions (angry, fearful) were better recognized than happy and neutral faces. Comparison with immediate recognition indicated that this effect was driven by decreased recognition of non-threatening faces. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data was acquired during encoding and results revealed that differential neural encoding in the right ventromedial prefrontal/orbitofrontal cortex neurally mediated the long-term recognition advantage for threatening faces. Our study provides the evidence that threatening facial expressions lead to persistent face recognition over periods of &amp;gt;1.5 years and encoding-related activity in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex may underlie preserved recognition.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Multivariate associative patterns between the gut microbiota and large-scale brain network connectivity</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.08.25.266122v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Research on the gut-brain axis has accelerated substantially over the course of the last years. Many reviews have outlined the important implications of understanding the relation of the gut microbiota with human brain function and behavior. One substantial drawback in integrating gut microbiome and brain data is the lack of integrative multivariate approaches that enable capturing variance in both modalities simultaneously. To address this issue, we applied a linked independent component analysis (LICA) to microbiota and brain connectivity data. We analyzed data from 58 healthy females (mean age=21.5 years). Magnetic Resonance Imaging data were acquired using resting state functional imaging data. The assessment of gut microbial composition from feces was based on sequencing of the V4 16S rRNA gene region. We used the LICA model to simultaneously factorize the subjects' large-scale brain networks and microbiome relative abundance data into 10 independent components of spatial and abundance variation. LICA decomposition resulted in four components with non-marginal contribution of the microbiota data. The default mode network featured strongly in three components, whereas the two-lateralized fronto-parietal attention networks contributed to one component. The executive-control (with the default mode) network was associated to another component. We found the abundance of Prevotella genus was associated to the strength of expression of all networks, whereas Bifidobacterium was associated with the default mode and frontoparietal-attention networks. We provide the first exploratory evidence for multivariate associative patterns between the gut microbiota and brain network connectivity in healthy humans, taking into account the complexity of both systems.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Highly redundant neuropeptide volume cotransmission underlying episodic activation of the GnRH neuron dendron</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.08.25.266080v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>The necessity and functional significance of neurotransmitter co-transmission remains unclear. The glutamatergic KNDy neurons co-express kisspeptin, neurokinin B (NKB) and dynorphin and exhibit a highly stereotyped synchronized behavior that reads out to the gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) neuron dendrons to drive episodic hormone secretion. Using expansion microscopy, we show that KNDy neurons make abundant close but non-synaptic appositions with the GnRH neuron dendron. Confocal GCaMP6 calcium imaging demonstrated that, of the neurotransmitters co-expressed by KNDy neurons, only kisspeptin was able to activate the GnRH neuron dendron. The selective deletion of kisspeptin from KNDy neurons resulted in mice in which the synchronized behavior of the KNDy neurons was maintained but their ability to drive episodic hormone secretion was abolished. This indicates that KNDy neurons drive episodic hormone secretion through converse modes of highly redundant neuropeptide co-transmission orchestrated by differential postsynaptic neuropeptide receptor expression at their two target sites.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.08.25.265975v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>The human visual system can rapidly extract regularities from our visual environment, generating predictive context. It has been shown that spatial predictive context can be used during visual search. We set out to see whether observers can additionally exploit temporal predictive context, using an extended version of a contextual cueing paradigm. Though we replicated the contextual cueing effect, repeating search scenes in a structured order versus a random order yielded no additional behavioural benefit. This was true both for participants who were sensitive to spatial predictive context, and for those who were not. We argue that spatial predictive context during visual search is more readily learned and subsequently exploited than temporal predictive context, potentially rendering the latter redundant. In conclusion, unlike spatial context, temporal context is not automatically extracted and used during visual search.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Self-operated stimuli improve subsequent visual motion processing</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.08.25.265918v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Proper interpretation of visual information requires capturing the structural regularities in the visual signal and this frequently occurs in conjunction with movement. Perceptual interpretation is complicated both by transient perceptual changes that accompany motor activity, and as found in audition and somatosensation, by more persistent changes that accompany the learning of new movements. Here we asked whether motor learning also results in sustained changes to visual perception. We designed a reaching task in which participants directly controlled the visual information they received, which we term self-operated stimuli. Specifically, they trained to make movements in a number of directions. Directional information was provided by the motion of an intrinsically ambiguous moving stimulus which was directly tied to motion of the hand. We find that movement training improves perception of coherent stimulus motion, and that changes in movement are correlated with the perceptual change. No perceptual changes are observed in passive observers even when they are provided with an explicit strategy to solve perceptual grouping. Comparison of empirical perceptual data with simulations based on a Bayesian generative model of motion perception suggests that movement training promotes the fine-tuning of the internal representation of stimulus geometry. These results emphasize the role of sensorimotor interaction in determining the persistent properties in space and time that define a percept.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Transcutaneous vagus nerve stimulation in humans induces pupil dilation and attenuates alpha oscillations</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.08.25.265876v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) is widely used to treat drug-resistant epilepsy and depression. While the precise mechanisms mediating its long-term therapeutic effects are not fully resolved, they likely involve Locus Coeruleus (LC) stimulation via the nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS) that receives afferent vagal inputs. In rats, VNS elevates LC firing and forebrain noradrenaline (NE) levels, whereas LC lesions suppress VNS therapeutic efficacy. Non-invasive transcutaneous VNS (tVNS) employs electrical stimulation targeting the auricular branch of the vagus nerve at the Cymba Conchae of the ear, but it remains unclear to what extent tVNS mimics VNS. Here, we investigated the short-term effects of tVNS in healthy human male volunteers (n=24) using high-density EEG and pupillometry during visual fixation at rest, comparing short (3.4s) trials of tVNS to sham electrical stimulation at the earlobe (far from the vagus nerve branch) to control for somatosensory stimulation. Although tVNS and sham stimulation did not differ in subjective intensity ratings, tVNS led to robust pupil dilation (peaking 4-5s after trial onset) that was significantly higher than following sham stimulation. We further quantified how tVNS modulates idle occipital alpha (8-13Hz) activity, identified in each participant using parallel factor analysis. We found that tVNS attenuates alpha oscillations to a greater extent than does sham stimulation. Thus, tVNS reliably induces pupillary and EEG markers of arousal beyond the effects of somatosensory stimulation, supporting the hypothesis that it elevates noradrenaline and acetylcholine signaling and mimics invasive VNS.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: On stability of Canonical Correlation Analysis and Partial Least Squares with application to brain-behavior associations</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.08.25.265546v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Associations between high-dimensional datasets, each comprising many features, can be discovered through multivariate statistical methods, like Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) or Partial Least Squares (PLS). CCA and PLS are widely used methods which reveal which features carry the association. Despite the longevity and popularity of CCA/PLS approaches, their application to high-dimensional datasets raises critical questions about the reliability of CCA/PLS solutions. In particular, overfitting can produce solutions that are not stable across datasets, which severely hinders their interpretability and generalizability. To study these issues, we developed a generative model to simulate synthetic datasets with multivariate associations, parameterized by feature dimensionality, data variance structure, and assumed latent association strength. We found that resulting CCA/PLS associations could be highly inaccurate when the number of samples per feature is relatively small. For PLS, the profiles of feature weights exhibit detrimental bias toward leading principal component axes. We confirmed these model trends in state-of-the-art datasets containing neuroimaging and behavioral measurements in large numbers of subjects, namely the Human Connectome Project (n {approx} 1000) and UK Biobank (n = 20000), where we found that only the latter comprised enough samples to obtain stable estimates. Analysis of the neuroimaging literature using CCA to map brain-behavior relationships revealed that the commonly employed sample sizes yield unstable CCA solutions. Our generative modeling framework provides a calculator of dataset properties required for stable estimates. Collectively, our study characterizes dataset properties needed to limit the potentially detrimental effects of overfitting on stability of CCA/PLS solutions, and provides practical recommendations for future studies.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.08.25.265520v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>The sleep-wake cycle is constituted by three behavioral states: wakefulness (W), non-REM (NREM) and REM sleep. These states are associated with drastic changes in cognitive capacities, mostly determined by the function of the thalamo-cortical system. Thalamo-cortical activity can be examined by means of the intra-cranial electroencephalogram (iEEG). With the purpose to study in depth the basal activity of the iEEG in adult rats, we analyzed the spectral power and coherence of the iEEG during W and sleep in the paleocortex (olfactory bulb), as well as in motor, somatosensory and visual neocortical areas. We also analyzed the laterality (right Vs. left hemispheres) of the signals, as well as the iEEG in function of the light and dark phases. We found that the iEEG power and coherence of the whole spectrum were largely affected by behavioral states and were highly dependent on the cortical areas recorded. We also determined that there are night/day differences in power and coherence during sleep, but not in W. Finally, while we did not find right/left differences in power either in W or sleep, we observed that during REM sleep intra-hemispheric coherence differs between both hemispheres. We conclude that the iEEG dynamics is highly dependent on the cortical area and behavioral states. We also determine that there are light/dark phases disparities in the iEEG that emerge during sleep, and that intra-hemispheric connectivity differs between both hemispheres only during REM sleep.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.08.25.264382v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Rhythmic neural activity synchronizes with certain rhythmic behaviors, such as breathing, sniffing, saccades, and speech. The extent to which neural oscillations synchronize with higher-level and more complex behaviors is largely unknown. Here we investigated electrophysiological synchronization with keyboard typing, which is an omnipresent behavior daily engaged by an uncountably large number of people. Keyboard typing is rhythmic with frequency characteristics roughly the same as neural oscillatory dynamics associated with cognitive control, notably through midfrontal theta (4 -7 Hz) oscillations. We tested the hypothesis that synchronization occurs between typing and midfrontal theta, and breaks down when errors are committed. Thirty healthy participants typed words and sentences on a keyboard without visual feedback, while EEG was recorded. Typing rhythmicity was investigated by inter-keystroke interval analyses and by a kernel density estimation method. We used a multivariate spatial filtering technique to investigate frequency-specific synchronization between typing and neuronal oscillations. Our results demonstrate theta rhythmicity in typing (around 6.5 Hz) through the two different behavioral analyses. Synchronization between typing and neuronal oscillations occurred at frequencies ranging from 4 to 15 Hz, but to a larger extent for lower frequencies. However, peak synchronization frequency was idiosyncratic across subjects, therefore not specific to theta nor to midfrontal regions, and correlated somewhat with peak typing frequency. Errors and trials associated with stronger cognitive control were not associated with changes in synchronization at any frequency. As a whole, this study shows that brain-behavior synchronization does occur during keyboard typing but is not specific to midfrontal theta.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.08.25.264200v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Loud noise-exposure generates tinnitus in both humans and animals. Macroscopic studies show that noise exposure affects the auditory cortex; however, cellular mechanisms of tinnitus generation are unclear. Here we compare membrane properties of layer 5 (L5) pyramidal cells (PCs) of the primary auditory cortex (A1) from control and noise-exposed mice. PCs were previously classified in type A or type B based on connectivity and firing properties. Our analysis based on a logistic regression model predicted that afterhyperpolatization and afterdepolarization following the injection of inward and outward current are enough to predict cell type and these features are preserved after noise trauma. One week after a noise-exposure (4-18kHz, 90dB, 1.5 hr, followed by 1.5hr silence) no passive membrane properties of type A or B PCs were altered but principal component analysis showed greater separation between control/noise-exposure recordings for type A neurons. When comparing individual firing properties, noise exposure differentially affected type A and B PC firing frequency in response to depolarizing current steps. Specifically, type A PCs decreased both initial and steady state firing frequency and type B PCs significantly increased steady state firing frequency following noise exposure. These results show that loud noise can cause distinct effects on type A and B L5 auditory cortex PCs one week following noise exposure. As the type A PC electrophysiological profile is correlated to corticofugal L5 neurons, and type B PCs correlate to contralateral projecting PCs these alterations could partially explain the reorganization of the auditory cortex observed in tinnitus patients.</content:encoded>

Arterial growth and remodeling at the tissue level is driven by mechanobiological processes at cellular and sub-cellular levels. Although it is widely accepted that cells seek to promote tissue homeostasis in response to biochemical and biomechanical cues—such as increased wall stress in hypertension—the ways by which these cues translate into tissue maintenance, adaptation, or maladaptation are far from understood. In this paper, we present a logic-based computational model for cell signaling within the arterial wall, aiming to predict changes in extracellular matrix turnover and cell phenotype in response to pressure-induced wall stress, flow-induced wall shear stress, and exogenous sources of angiotensin II, with particular interest in mouse models of hypertension. We simulate a number of experiments from the literature at both the cell and tissue level, involving single or combined inputs, and achieve high qualitative agreement in most cases. Additionally, we demonstrate the utility of this modeling approach for simulating alterations (in this case knockdowns) of individual nodes within the signaling network. Continued modeling of cellular signaling will enable improved mechanistic understanding of arterial growth and remodeling in health and disease, and will be crucial when considering potential pharmacological interventions.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/4OLENivxTvA&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Breast cancer prognosis is challenging due to the heterogeneity of the disease. Various computational methods using bulk RNA-seq data have been proposed for breast cancer prognosis. However, these methods suffer from limited performances or ambiguous biological relevance, as a result of the neglect of intra-tumor heterogeneity. Recently, single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) has emerged for studying tumor heterogeneity at cellular levels. In this paper, we propose a novel method, &lt;i&gt;scPrognosis&lt;/i&gt;, to improve breast cancer prognosis with scRNA-seq data. &lt;i&gt;scPrognosis&lt;/i&gt; uses the scRNA-seq data of the biological process Epithelial-to-Mesenchymal Transition (EMT). It firstly infers the EMT pseudotime and a dynamic gene co-expression network, then uses an integrative model to select genes important in EMT based on their expression variation and differentiation in different stages of EMT, and their roles in the dynamic gene co-expression network. To validate and apply the selected signatures to breast cancer prognosis, we use them as the features to build a prediction model with bulk RNA-seq data. The experimental results show that &lt;i&gt;scPrognosis&lt;/i&gt; outperforms other benchmark breast cancer prognosis methods that use bulk RNA-seq data. Moreover, the dynamic changes in the expression of the selected signature genes in EMT may provide clues to the link between EMT and clinical outcomes of breast cancer. &lt;i&gt;scPrognosis&lt;/i&gt; will also be useful when applied to scRNA-seq datasets of different biological processes other than EMT.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/H_btbruXGNk&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Tiago Monteiro, Marco Vasconcelos, Alex Kacelnik&lt;/p&gt;

The integration of normative and descriptive analyses of decision processes in humans struggles with the fact that measuring preferences by different procedures yields different rankings and that humans appear irrationally impulsive (namely, show maladaptive preference for immediacy). Failure of procedure invariance has led to the widespread hypothesis that preferences are constructed “on the spot” by cognitive evaluations performed at choice time, implying that choices should take extra time in order to perform the necessary comparisons. We examine this issue in experiments with starlings (&lt;i&gt;Sturnus vulgaris&lt;/i&gt;) and show that integrating normative and descriptive arguments is possible and may help reinterpreting human decision results. Our main findings are that (1) ranking alternatives through direct rating (response time) accurately predicts preference in choice, overcoming failures of procedure invariance; (2) preference is not constructed at choice time nor does it involve extra time (we show that the opposite is true); and (3) starlings’ choices are not irrationally impulsive but are instead directly interpretable in terms of profitability ranking. Like all nonhuman research, our protocols examine decisions by experience rather than by description, and hence support the conjecture that irrationalities that prevail in research with humans may not be observed in decisions by experience protocols.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/CMiBQ8bKMe8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

In eukaryotes, conserved mechanisms ensure that cell growth is coordinated with nutrient availability. Overactive growth during nutrient limitation (“nutrient–growth dysregulation”) can lead to rapid cell death. Here, we demonstrate that cells can adapt to nutrient–growth dysregulation by evolving major metabolic defects. Specifically, when yeast lysine-auxotrophic mutant &lt;i&gt;lys&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; encountered lysine limitation, an evolutionarily novel stress, cells suffered nutrient–growth dysregulation. A subpopulation repeatedly evolved to lose the ability to synthesize organosulfurs (&lt;i&gt;lys&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;orgS&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;). Organosulfurs, mainly reduced glutathione (GSH) and GSH conjugates, were released by &lt;i&gt;lys&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; cells during lysine limitation when growth was dysregulated, but not during glucose limitation when growth was regulated. Limiting organosulfurs conferred a frequency-dependent fitness advantage to &lt;i&gt;lys&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;orgS&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; by eliciting a proper slow growth program, including autophagy. Thus, nutrient–growth dysregulation is associated with rapid organosulfur release, which enables the selection of organosulfur auxotrophy to better tune cell growth to the metabolic environment. We speculate that evolutionarily novel stresses can trigger atypical release of certain metabolites, setting the stage for the evolution of new ecological interactions.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/jxdMs7q_oR0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Hippocampus: The history of long‐term potentiation as a memory mechanism: Controversies, confirmation, and some lessons to remember</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/hipo.23213?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The discovery of long‐term potentiation (LTP) provided the first, direct evidence for long‐lasting synaptic plasticity in the living brain. Consequently, LTP was proposed to serve as a mechanism for information storage among neurons, thus providing the basis for the behavioral and psychological phenomena of learning and long‐term memory formation. However, for several decades, the LTP‐memory hypothesis remained highly controversial, with inconsistent and contradictory evidence providing a barrier to its general acceptance. This review summarizes the history of these early debates, challenges, and experimental strategies (successful and unsuccessful) to establish a link between LTP and memory. Together, the empirical evidence, gathered over a period of about four decades, strongly suggests that LTP serves as one of the mechanisms affording learning and memory storage in neuronal circuits. Notably, this body of work also offers some important lessons that apply to the broader fields of behavioral and cognitive neuroscience. As such, the history of LTP as a learning mechanism provides valuable insights to neuroscientists exploring the relations between brain and psychological states.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Hippocampus: Differential propagation of ripples along the proximodistal and septotemporal axes of dorsal CA1 of rats</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/hipo.23211?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The functional connectivity of the hippocampus with its primary cortical input, the entorhinal cortex, is organized topographically. In area CA1 of the hippocampus, this leads to different functional gradients along the proximodistal and septotemporal axes of spatial/sensory responsivity and spatial resolution respectively. CA1 ripples, a network phenomenon, allow us to test whether the hippocampal neural network shows corresponding gradients in functional connectivity along the two axes. We studied the occurrence and propagation of ripples across the entire proximodistal axis along with a comparable spatial range of the septotemporal axis of dorsal CA1. We observed that ripples could occur at any location, and their amplitudes were independent of the tetrode location along the proximodistal and septotemporal axes. When a ripple was detected on a particular tetrode (“reference tetrode”), however, the probability of cooccurrence of ripples and ripple amplitude observed on the other tetrodes decreased as a function of distance from the reference tetrode. This reduction was greater along the proximodistal axis than the septotemporal axis. Furthermore, we found that ripples propagate primarily along the proximodistal axis. Thus, over a spatial scale of ∼1.5 mm, the network is anisotropic along the two axes, complementing the topographically organized cortico‐hippocampal connections.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Hippocampus: Toll‐like receptor 4 differentially regulates adult hippocampal neurogenesis in an age‐ and sex‐dependent manner</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/hipo.23209?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Toll‐like receptor 4 (TLR4) is primarily responsible for initiating an immune response following pathogen recognition. However, TLR4 is also expressed on neural progenitor cells and has been reported to regulate hippocampal neurogenesis as young male TLR4 knockout mice show increases in cell proliferation and doublecortin positive cells. Whether these effects occur in both sexes and are sustained with normal aging is currently unknown. The present study evaluated whether TLR4 deficiency alters adult hippocampal neurogenesis in young (3–4 months) and aged (18–20 months), male and female, TLR4 deficient (TLR4−/−; B6.B10ScN‐Tlr4lps‐del/JthJ) and wild type (WT) mice. Additionally, neurogenesis within the dorsal and the ventral hippocampal subdivisions was evaluated to determine if TLR4 has differential effects across the hippocampus. Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) was administered to quantify new cell survival as well as cell differentiation. Ki‐67 was measured to evaluate cell proliferation. Results show that young TLR4−/− females had higher rates of proliferation and neuronal differentiation in both the dorsal and ventral hippocampus relative to WT females. Young TLR4−/− males show elevated proliferation and neuronal differentiation mainly in the ventral hippocampus. While young TLR4−/− mice show enhanced neurogenesis compared to young WT mice, the increase was not apparent in the aged TLR4−/− mice. Both aged WT and TLR4−/− mice showed a decrease in proliferation, new cell survival, and neuronal differentiation compared to young WT and TLR4−/− mice. The data collectively indicate that TLR4 regulates hippocampal neurogenesis in young adults, but that these effects are region‐specific in males and that females show broader changes in neurogenesis throughout the hippocampus.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Hippocampus: Small lesions of the dorsal or ventral hippocampus subregions are associated with distinct impairments in working memory and reference memory retrieval, and combining them attenuates the acquisition rate of spatial reference memory</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/hipo.23207?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The importance of the hippocampus in spatial learning is well established, but the precise relative contributions by the dorsal (septal) and ventral (temporal) subregions remain unresolved. One debate revolves around the extent to which the ventral hippocampus contributes to spatial navigation and learning. Here, separate small subtotal lesions of dorsal hippocampus or ventral hippocampus alone (destroying 18.9 and 28.5% of total hippocampal volume, respectively) spared reference memory acquisition in the water maze. By contrast, combining the two subtotal lesions significantly reduced the rate of acquisition across days. This constitutes evidence for synergistic integration between dorsal and ventral hippocampus in mice. Evidence that ventral hippocampus contributes to spatial/navigation learning also emerged early on during the retention probe test as search preference was reduced in mice with ventral lesions alone or combined lesions. The small ventral lesions also led to anxiolysis in the elevated plus maze and over‐generalization of the conditioned freezing response to a neutral context. Similar effects of comparable magnitudes were seen in mice with combined lesions, suggesting that they were largely due to the small ventral damage. By contrast, small dorsal lesions were uniquely associated with a severe spatial working memory deficit in the water maze. Taken together, both dorsal and ventral poles of the hippocampus contribute to efficient spatial navigation in mice: While the integrity of dorsal hippocampus is necessary for spatial working memory, the acquisition and retrieval of spatial reference memory are modulated by the ventral hippocampus. Although the impairments following ventral damage (alone or in combination with dorsal damage) were less substantial, a wider spectrum of spatial learning, including context conditioning, was implicated. Our results encourage the search for integrative mechanism between dorsal and ventral hippocampus in spatial learning. Candidate neural substrates may include dorsoventral longitudinal connections and reciprocal modulation via overlapping polysynaptic networks beyond hippocampus.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Hippocampus: Hippocampal‐striatal functional connectivity supports processing of temporal expectations from associative memory</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/hipo.23205?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hippocampus and dorsal striatum are both associated with temporal processing, but they are thought to play distinct roles. The hippocampus has been reported to contribute to storing temporal structure of events in memory, whereas the striatum contributes to temporal motor preparation and reward anticipation. Here, we asked whether the striatum cooperates with the hippocampus in processing the temporal context of memorized visual associations. In our task, participants were trained to implicitly form temporal expectations for one of two possible time intervals associated to specific cue‐target associations, and subsequently were scanned using ultra‐high‐field 7T functional magnetic resonance imaging. During scanning, learned temporal expectations could be violated when the pairs were presented at either the associated or not‐associated time intervals. When temporal expectations were met during testing trials, activity in left and right hippocampal subfields and right putamen decreased, compared to when temporal expectations were not met. Further, psycho‐physiological interactions showed that functional connectivity between left hippocampal subfields and caudate decreased when temporal expectations were not met. Our results indicate that the hippocampus and striatum cooperate to process implicit temporal expectation from mnemonic associations. Our findings provide further support for a hippocampal‐striatal network in temporal associative processing.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Hippocampus: Ventral hippocampus inactivation enhances the extinction of active avoidance responses in the presence of safety signals but leaves discrete trial operant active avoidance performance intact</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/hipo.23202?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The acquisition of active avoidance (AA) behavior is typically aided by the presence of two signals—the warning signal, which predicts the future occurrence of an aversive event (e.g., shocks), and the safety signal, which is presented upon successful avoidance of oncoming shocks. While the warning signal could be conceived to act as a Pavlovian fear cue, and is likely mediated by brain areas that underlie Pavlovian fear cue conditioning, the neural substrates underlying safety signaling are less clear, largely due to the unavailability of AA tasks that are devoid of an explicit warning signal. The present study sought to investigate the role of the ventral hippocampus (VH) in safety signaled AA performance acquired without an explicit warning signal, using a novel discrete trial paradigm. Adult male Long Evans rats were divided into two groups and trained to acquire AA responses with, or without a safety signal. Analysis of the acquisition and stable state performance data revealed that the availability of a safety signal alone did not improve the acquisition or performance of AA responses. Furthermore, post‐training, reversible VH inactivation did not impact stable state avoidance behavior. However, extinction of avoidance responses was facilitated in the group trained with a safety signal, and this effect was further potentiated by VH inactivation. Additional elevated plus maze (EPM), light–dark box, and locomotor tests demonstrated that VH inactivation reduced anxiety without affecting locomotor activity. Taken together, these results demonstrate the importance of VH in the extinction of persistent pathological avoidance behavior when safety is signaled.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

&lt;p&gt;Validation of [3H] CP‐55,940 for autoradiography of endocannabinoid receptors in prairie vole brains. Three adjacent sections of brain tissue were incubated with [3H] CP‐55,940 with or without an unlabeled receptor competitor. Coincubation of the radioligand with the CB2 blocker (HU308) had no discernible impact on binding in the hippocampus but increased binding in the prefrontal cortex relative to control. Coincubation of the radioligand with the CB1 blocker (AM251) significantly decreased signal in both regions.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Across many species, endocannabinoids play an important role in regulating social play, reward, and anxiety. These processes are mediated through at least two distinct cannabinoid receptors (CB), CB1 and CB2. CB1 expression is found in appreciable densities across regions of the brain that integrate memory with socio‐spatial information; many of these regions have been directly linked to the neurobiology of pair bonding in monogamous species. Using receptor autoradiography, we provide the first distributional map of CB1 within the brains of closely related monogamous prairie voles and promiscuous meadow voles, and compare receptor densities across sexes and species in limbic regions. We observe CB1‐specific signal using [3H] CP‐55,940 and [3H] SR141716A, though the latter exhibited a lower signal to noise ratio. We confirmed the presence of CB2 in prairie vole spleen tissue using [3H] CP‐55,940. However, we found no evidence of CB2 in the brain using either [3H] CP‐55,940 or [3H] A‐836,339. The overall distribution of putative CB1 in the brain was similar across vole species and followed the pattern of CB1 expression observed in other species—high intensity binding within the telencephalon, moderate binding within the diencephalon, and mild binding within the mesencephalon and metencephalon (aside from the cerebellar cortex). However, we found profound differences in CB1 densities across species, with prairie voles having higher CB1 binding in regions implicated in social attachment and spatial memory (e.g., periaqueductal gray, hippocampus). These findings suggest that CB1 densities, but not distribution, correlate with the social systems of vole species.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Sleep disruption in epilepsy: Ictal and interictal epileptic activity matter</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25884?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disturbed sleep is common in epilepsy. The direct influence of nocturnal epileptic activity on sleep fragmentation remains poorly understood. Stereo‐electroencephalography paired with polysomnography is the ideal tool to study this relationship. We investigated whether sleep‐related epileptic activity is associated with sleep disruption.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We visually marked sleep stages, arousals, seizures and epileptic bursts in 36 patients with focal drug‐resistant epilepsy who underwent combined stereo‐electroencephalography/polysomnography during pre‐surgical evaluation. Epileptic spikes were detected automatically. Spike and burst indices (n/sec/channel) were computed across four 3‐second time windows (baseline sleep, pre‐arousal, arousal, post‐arousal). Sleep stage and anatomical localization were tested as modulating factors. We assessed the intra‐arousal dynamics of spikes and their relationship with the slow wave component of non‐rapid‐eye‐movement sleep (NR) arousals.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The vast majority of sleep‐related seizures (82.4%; 76.5% asymptomatic) were followed by awakenings or arousals. The epileptic burst index increased significantly before arousals as compared to baseline and post‐arousal, irrespective of sleep stage or brain area. A similar pre‐arousal increase was observed for the spike index in NR stage 2 and rapid‐eye‐movement sleep. In addition, the spike index increased during the arousal itself in neocortical channels, and was strongly correlated with the slow wave component of NR arousals (r=0.99, p&amp;lt;0.0001).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Interpretation&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sleep fragmentation in focal drug‐resistant epilepsy is associated with ictal and interictal epileptic activity. The increase in interictal epileptic activity before arousals suggests its participation in sleep disruption. An additional increase in the spike rate during arousals may result from a sleep‐wake boundary instability, suggesting a bidirectional relationship.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Hippocampus: The function of medial temporal lobe and posterior middle temporal gyrus in forming creative associations</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/hipo.23253?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the function of the hippocampus and adjacent medial temporal lobe (MTL) areas in forming associations is generally recognized, how MTL contributes to form creative associations that could result in novel and appropriate functions or meanings remains unclear. In this study, we compared highly creative combinations (HCCs) of two objects (e.g., that of “lifejacket” and “distress signal device”) that resulted in genuine innovative designs comprising additionally unprecedented functions (the “1 + 1 &amp;gt; 2” effects) with the lowly creative combinations (LCCs, e.g., the combination of “set‐top box” and “jewelry box”) that resulted in nothing more than simple “1 + 1 = 2” effects. The event‐related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study found that during the “early binding phase,” when the combinations of the two objects were initially encoded, the right parahippocampus was more intensively activated during the encoding of HCC relative to LCC trials. However, during the “late integration phase,” when participants finally formed a holistic mental representation of new products based on the two‐object combinations, both HCCs and LCCs were found to be associated with significantly increased hippocampal and parahippocampal activation relative to the baseline condition, but at a similar level. In this “late integration phase,” the functional areas appeared to be more intensively activated in HCCs relative to LCCs located in the posterior middle temporal gyrus (pMTG), the area known to mediate category‐related processing. Consistently, our supplementary behavioral study found that, relative to LCCs, HCCs had a higher possibility of resulting in some new conceptual expansions that differed from each of the original two objects that constituted the combinations. These findings indicate that the formation of creative combinations not only require MTL‐based novel association‐formation, but also pMTG‐based novel concept‐expansion.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Hippocampus: The ratio of posterior–anterior medial temporal lobe volumes predicts source memory performance in healthy young adults</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/hipo.23251?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A functional gradient has been proposed across the medial temporal lobes (MTL) such that the anterior MTL is thought to support processing of individual items (e.g., item memory and complex object perception), whereas the posterior MTL is thought to support item‐context retrieval (e.g., source memory). Whereas functional imaging studies have provided evidence supporting this anatomical organization, results from structural analyses remain inconclusive. The current study examined the relationship between volume of MTL regions of interest (ROIs), and performance on a source memory task and a fine‐grain complex object perception task, in healthy young adults (mean age = 21.5, range = 18–29). Using a semiautomated procedure, we segmented the parahippocampal and perirhinal cortices (PHC, PRC), posteromedial and anterolateral entorhinal cortices (pmERC, alERC), and posterior and anterior hippocampus (postHC, antHC) on high‐resolution T2‐weighted MRIs. Regional volumes were computed as proportions of intracranial volume, and as posterior–anterior volumetric ratios (PHC:PRC, pmERC:alERC, postHC:antHC). Partial‐least squares regressions were applied to predict source and item memory, and perceptual discrimination accuracy, based on ROI and ratio volumes. In our ROI regressions, we found that postHC volume was positively correlated with a latent factor predicting source memory, and PRC and antHC volumes were negatively correlated to this latent factor. In our ratio regressions, we observed an effect relating the posterior–anterior distribution of gray matter across the MTL with source memory. Our results demonstrate differential associations between anterior and posterior MTL and source memory performance. Findings from this study highlight the importance of considering patterns of structure–behavior associations in the neurobiology of episodic memory.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>arXiv: Computer Science: Neural and Evolutionary Computing: Robust and Efficient Swarm Communication Topologies for Hostile Environments. (arXiv:2008.09575v1 [cs.NE])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2008.09575</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Swarm Intelligence-based optimization techniques combine systematic
exploration of the search space with information available from neighbors and
rely strongly on communication among agents. These algorithms are typically
employed to solve problems where the function landscape is not adequately known
and there are multiple local optima that could result in premature convergence
for other algorithms. Applications of such algorithms can be found in
communication systems involving design of networks for efficient information
dissemination to a target group, targeted drug-delivery where drug molecules
search for the affected site before diffusing, and high-value target
localization with a network of drones. In several of such applications, the
agents face a hostile environment that can result in loss of agents during the
search. Such a loss changes the communication topology of the agents and hence
the information available to agents, ultimately influencing the performance of
the algorithm. In this paper, we present a study of the impact of loss of
agents on the performance of such algorithms as a function of the initial
network configuration. We use particle swarm optimization to optimize an
objective function with multiple sub-optimal regions in a hostile environment
and study its performance for a range of network topologies with loss of
agents. The results reveal interesting trade-offs between efficiency,
robustness, and performance for different topologies that are subsequently
leveraged to discover general properties of networks that maximize performance.
Moreover, networks with small-world properties are seen to maximize performance
under hostile conditions.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2008.09574</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;There is growing effort in the &quot;physics of behavior&quot; that aims at complete
quantitative characterization of animal movements under more complex,
naturalistic conditions. One reaction to the resulting explosion of data is the
search for low dimensional structure. Here I try to define more clearly what we
mean by the dimensionality of behavior, where observable behavior may consist
either of continuous trajectories or sequences of discrete states. This
discussion also serves to isolate situations in which the dimensionality of
behavior is effectively infinite. I conclude with some more general
perspectives about the importance of quantitative phenomenology.

	<title>arXiv: Quantitative Biology: Neurons and Cognition: Bits and Pieces: Understanding Information Decomposition from Part-whole Relationships and Formal Logic. (arXiv:2008.09535v1 [cs.AI])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2008.09535</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Partial information decomposition (PID) seeks to decompose the multivariate
mutual information that a set of source variables contains about a target
variable into basic pieces, the so called &quot;atoms of information&quot;. Each atom
describes a distinct way in which the sources may contain information about the
target. In this paper we show, first, that the entire theory of partial
information decomposition can be derived from considerations of elementary
parthood relationships between information contributions. This way of
approaching the problem has the advantage of directly characterizing the atoms
of information, instead of taking an indirect approach via the concept of
redundancy. Secondly, we describe several intriguing links between PID and
formal logic. In particular, we show how to define a measure of PID based on
the information provided by certain statements about source realizations.
Furthermore, we show how the mathematical lattice structure underlying PID
theory can be translated into an isomorphic structure of logical statements
with a particularly simple ordering relation: logical implication. The
conclusion to be drawn from these considerations is that there are three
isomorphic &quot;worlds&quot; of partial information decomposition, i.e. three equivalent
ways to mathematically describe the decomposition of the information carried by
a set of sources about a target: the world of parthood relationships, the world
of logical statements, and the world of antichains that was utilized by
Williams and Beer in their original exposition of PID theory. We additionally
show how the parthood perspective provides a systematic way to answer a type of
question that has been much discussed in the PID field: whether a partial
information decomposition can be uniquely determined based on concepts other
than redundant information.

	<title>arXiv: Computer Science: Neural and Evolutionary Computing: A constrained recursion algorithm for batch normalization of tree-sturctured LSTM. (arXiv:2008.09409v1 [cs.LG])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2008.09409</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Tree-structured LSTM is promising way to consider long-distance interaction
over hierarchies. However, there have been few research efforts on the
hyperparameter tuning of the construction and traversal of tree-structured
LSTM. To name a few, hyperparamters such as the interval of state
initialization, the number of batches for normalization have been left
unexplored specifically in applying batch normalization for reducing training
cost and parallelization. In this paper, we propose a novel recursive algorithm
for traversing batch normalized tree-structured LSTM. In proposal method, we
impose the constraint on the recursion algorithm for the depth-first search of
binary tree representation of LSTM for which batch normalization is applied.
With our constrained recursion, we can control the hyperparameter in the
traversal of several tree-structured LSTMs which is generated in the process of
batch normalization. The tree traversal is divided into two steps. At first
stage, the width-first search over models is applied for discover the start
point of the latest tree-structured LSTM block. Then, the depth-first search is
run to traverse tree-structured LSTM. Proposed method enables us to explore the
optimized selection of hyperparameters of recursive neural network
implementation by changing the constraints of our recursion algorithm. In
experiment, we measure and plot the validation loss and computing time with
changing the length of internal of state initialization of tree-structured
LSTM. It has been turned out that proposal method is effective for
hyperparameter tuning such as the number of batches and length of interval of
state initialization of tree-structured LSTM.

	<title>arXiv: Computer Science: Neural and Evolutionary Computing: Curriculum Learning with Hindsight Experience Replay for Sequential Object Manipulation Tasks. (arXiv:2008.09377v1 [cs.LG])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2008.09377</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Learning complex tasks from scratch is challenging and often impossible for
humans as well as for artificial agents. A curriculum can be used instead,
which decomposes a complex task (target task) into a sequence of source tasks
(the curriculum). Each source task is a simplified version of the next source
task with increasing complexity. Learning then occurs gradually by training on
each source task while using knowledge from the curriculum's prior source
tasks. In this study, we present a new algorithm that combines curriculum
learning with Hindsight Experience Replay (HER), to learn sequential object
manipulation tasks for multiple goals and sparse feedback. The algorithm
exploits the recurrent structure inherent in many object manipulation tasks and
implements the entire learning process in the original simulation without
adjusting it to each source task. We have tested our algorithm on three
challenging throwing tasks and show vast improvements compared to vanilla-HER.

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Intracortical Circuits in the Contralesional Primary Motor Cortex in Patients With Chronic Stroke After Botulinum Toxin Type A Injection: Case Studies</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00342</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Spasticity and motor recovery are both related to neural plasticity after stroke. A balance of activity in the primary motor cortex (M1) in both hemispheres is essential for functional recovery. In this study, we assessed the intracortical inhibitory and facilitatory circuits in the contralesional M1 area in four patients with severe upper limb spasticity after chronic stroke and treated with botulinum toxin-A (BoNT-A) injection and 12 weeks of upper limb rehabilitation. There was little to no change in the level of spasticity post-injection, and only one participant experienced a small improvement in arm function. All reported improvements in quality of life. However, the levels of intracortical inhibition and facilitation in the contralesional hemisphere were different at baseline for all four participants, and there was no clear pattern in the response to the intervention. Further investigation is needed to understand how BoNT-A injections affect inhibitory and facilitatory circuits in the contralesional hemisphere, the severity of spasticity, and functional improvement.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: Responding to preconditioned cues is devaluation sensitive and requires orbitofrontal cortex during cue-cue learning</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/59998</link>
	<content:encoded>The orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) is necessary for inferring value in tests of model-based reasoning, including in sensory preconditioning. This involvement could be accounted for by representation of value or by representation of broader associative structure. We recently reported neural correlates of such broader associative structure in OFC during the initial phase of sensory preconditioning (Sadacca et al., 2018). Here, we used optogenetic inhibition of OFC to test whether these correlates might be necessary for value inference during later probe testing. We found that inhibition of OFC during cue-cue learning abolished value inference during the probe test, inference subsequently shown in control rats to be sensitive to devaluation of the expected reward. These results demonstrate that OFC must be online during cue-cue learning, consistent with the argument that the correlates previously observed are not simply downstream readouts of sensory processing and instead contribute to building the associative model supporting later behavior.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: Identification of specific Tie2 cleavage sites and therapeutic modulation in experimental sepsis</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/59520</link>
	<content:encoded>Endothelial Tie2 signaling plays a pivotal role in vascular barrier maintenance at baseline and after injury. We previously demonstrated that a sharp drop in Tie2 expression observed across various murine models of critical illnesses is associated with increased vascular permeability and mortality. Matrix metalloprotease (MMP)−14-mediated Tie2 ectodomain shedding has recently been recognized as a possible mechanism for Tie2 downregulation in sepsis. Here, we identified the exact MMP14-mediated Tie2 ectodomain cleavage sites and could show that pharmacological MMP14 blockade in experimental murine sepsis exerts barrier protective and anti-inflammatory effects predominantly through the attenuation of Tie2 cleavage to improve survival both in a pre-treatment and rescue approach. Overall, we show that protecting Tie2 shedding might offer a new therapeutic opportunity for the treatment of septic vascular leakage.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: The contribution of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections to transmission on the Diamond Princess cruise ship</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/58699</link>
	<content:encoded>A key unknown for SARS-CoV-2 is how asymptomatic infections contribute to transmission. We used a transmission model with asymptomatic and presymptomatic states, calibrated to data on disease onset and test frequency from the Diamond Princess cruise ship outbreak, to quantify the contribution of asymptomatic infections to transmission. The model estimated that 74% (70-78%, 95% posterior interval) of infections proceeded asymptomatically. Despite intense testing, 53% (51-56%) of infections remained undetected, most of them asymptomatic. Asymptomatic individuals were the source for 69% (20-85%) of all infections. The data did not allow identification of the infectiousness of asymptomatic infections, however low ranges (0-25%) required a net reproduction number for individuals progressing through presymptomatic and symptomatic stages of at least 15. Asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections may contribute substantially to transmission. Control measures, and models projecting their potential impact, need to look beyond the symptomatic cases if they are to understand and address ongoing transmission.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: A stepped-wedge randomized trial on the impact of early ART initiation on HIV patients' economic welfare in Eswatini</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/58487</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Background:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Since 2015, the World Health Organisation (WHO) recommends immediate initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART) for all HIV-positive patients. Epidemiological evidence points to important health benefits of immediate ART initiation; however, the policy's economic impact remains unknown. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Methods:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; We conducted a stepped-wedge cluster-randomised controlled trial in Eswatini to determine the causal impact of immediate ART initiation on patients' economic welfare. Fourteen healthcare facilities were non-randomly matched in pairs and then randomly allocated to transition from the standard of care (ART eligibility at CD4 counts of &amp;lt; 350 cells/mm3 until September 2016 and &amp;lt;500 cells/mm3 thereafter) to the 'Early Initiation of ART for All' (EAAA) intervention at one of seven timepoints. Patients, healthcare personnel, and outcome assessors remained unblinded. Data was collected via standardised paper-based surveys with HIV-positive, ART-naïve adults who were neither pregnant nor breastfeeding. Outcomes were patients' time use, employment status, household expenditures and household wealth. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Results:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; A total sample of 3,019 participants were interviewed over the duration of the study. The mean number of participants approached at each facility and time step varied from 4 to 112 participants. Using mixed-effects negative binomial regressions accounting for time trends and clustering, we found no significant difference between study arms for any economic outcome. Specifically, the EAAA intervention had no significant effect on non-resting time use (RR= 1.00, [CI: 0.96, 1.05, p=0.93]) or income-generating time use (RR= 0.94, [CI: 0.73,1.20, p=0.61]). Employment and household expenditures decreased slightly but not significantly in the EAAA group, with risk ratios of 0.93 [CI: 0.82, 1.04, p=0.21] and 0.92 [CI: 0.79, 1.06, p=0.26], respectively. We also found no significant treatment effect on households' asset ownership and living standards (RR=0.96, [CI 0.92, 1.00, p=0.253]). Lastly, there was no evidence of heterogeneity in effect estimates by patients' sex, age, education, timing of HIV diagnosis and ART initiation. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Given the neutral effect on patients' economic welfare but positive effects on health, our findings support further investments into scaling-up immediate ART for all HIV patients. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Trial Registration: &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02909218 and NCT03789448; ethical approval: Eswatini National Health Service Review Board &amp;amp; Harvard T.H.

&lt;p&gt;Cartoon depicting evolution of endogenous opioid systems. Our findings in this paper show the identification of an authentic mammalian‐like endogenous opioid system in the Pacific Hagfish with no evidence for opioid systems in invertebrate genomes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The actions of endogenous opioids and nociceptin/orphanin FQ are mediated by four homologous G protein‐coupled receptors that constitute the opioid receptor family. However, little is known about opioid systems in cyclostomes (living jawless fish) and how opioid systems might have evolved from invertebrates. Here, we leveraged de novo transcriptome and low‐coverage whole‐genome assembly in the Pacific hagfish (&lt;i&gt;Eptatretus stoutii&lt;/i&gt;) to identify and characterize the first full‐length coding sequence for a functional opioid receptor in a cyclostome. Additionally, we define two novel endogenous opioid precursors in this species that predict several novel opioid peptides. Bioinformatic analysis shows no closely related opioid receptor genes in invertebrates with regard either to the genomic organization or to conserved opioid receptor‐specific sequences that are common in all vertebrates. Furthermore, no proteins analogous to vertebrate opioid precursors could be identified by genomic searches despite previous claims of protein or RNA‐derived sequences in several invertebrate species. The presence of an expressed orthologous receptor and opioid precursors in the Pacific hagfish confirms that a functional opioid system was likely present in the common ancestor of all extant vertebrates some 550 million years ago, earlier than all previous authenticated accounts. We discuss the premise that the cyclostome and vertebrate opioid systems evolved from invertebrate systems concerned with antimicrobial defense and speculate that the high concentrations of opioid precursors in tissues such as the testes, gut, and activated immune cells are key remnants of this evolutionary role.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Plasma NT1 Tau is a Specific and Early Marker of Alzheimer’s Disease</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25885?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is an urgent need for sensitive, widely available, blood‐based screening tests to identify pre‐symptomatic individuals destined to develop Alzheimer’s disease (AD). We investigated whether tau detected in plasma by our in‐house NT1 assay is specifically altered in AD, and when applied to patients with subjective cognitive decline (SCD) or mild cognitive impairment (MCI) can serve to predict progression to AD dementia. The predictive value of NT1 versus tau measured using assays from Quanterix and Roche, and the specificity of NT1 for AD versus a non‐specific marker of neurodegeneration (neurofilament light, NfL) were also examined.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NT1 tau and NfL were measured in plasma from prospectively followed patients with SCD or MCI who remained cognitively stable, converted to AD dementia, or converted to non‐AD dementias, and in cognitively unimpaired participants. Tau was measured using Quanterix and Roche assays in baseline SCD and MCI subjects.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plasma NT1 tau was specifically elevated in AD, but not in non‐AD dementia compared to controls, whereas NfL was increased in both AD and non‐AD dementias. Baseline specimens from individuals who had SCD or MCI revealed that NT1 tau, but not tau measured using Quanterix or Roche assays, is elevated in subjects who progress to AD dementia. As expected, baseline plasma NfL is elevated in those who progress to AD and non‐AD dementias.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plasma NT1 tau is a specific marker of AD which is elevated early in disease and may prove useful as a first round screen to identify individuals at risk of developing AD.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Temporal lobe epilepsy surgical outcomes can be inferred based on structural connectome hubs: a machine learning study</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25888?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Medial temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is the most common form of medication‐resistant focal epilepsy in adults. Despite removal of medial temporal structures, over a third of patients continue to have disabling seizures post‐operatively. Seizure refractoriness implies that extra‐medial regions are capable of influencing the brain network and generating seizures. We tested whether abnormalities of structural network integration could be associated with surgical outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Presurgical magnetic resonance images from 121 patients with drug‐resistant TLE across three independent epilepsy centers were used to train feed‐forward neural network models based on tissue volume or graph‐theory measures from whole‐brain diffusion tensor imaging structural connectomes. An independent dataset of 47 patients with TLE from three other epilepsy centers was used to assess the predictive values of each model and regional anatomical contributions towards surgical treatment results.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The receiver‐operating characteristic (ROC) area under the curve (AUC) based on regional betweenness centrality was 0.88, significantly higher than a random model or models based on gray matter volumes, degree, strength, and clustering coefficient. Nodes most strongly contributing to the predictive models involved the bilateral parahippocampal gyri, as well as the superior temporal gyri.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Network integration in the medial and lateral temporal regions was related to surgical outcomes. Patients with abnormally integrated structural network nodes were less likely to achieve seizure freedom. These findings are in line with previous observations related to network abnormalities in TLE and expand on the notion of underlying aberrant plasticity. Our findings provide additional information on the mechanisms of surgical refractoriness.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Transcranial magnetic stimulation promotes gait training in Parkinson's disease</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25881?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To determine whether priming with 1 Hz or 25 Hz repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) will enhance the benefits from treadmill training up to three‐month post‐intervention in people with Parkinson's disease (PD), and to evaluate the underlying changes in cortical excitability.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This randomized double‐blind, placebo‐controlled trial was conducted between Oct 2016 and Dec 2018. Fifty‐one participants with PD were randomized to receive 12 sessions of rTMS (25 Hz, 1 Hz or sham) followed by treadmill training. All participants were assessed at baseline, one‐day, one‐month and three‐month post‐intervention. Primary outcome was fastest walking speed and secondary outcomes were timed up‐and‐go test (TUG), dual‐task TUG (DT‐TUG), motor section of the Movement Disorder Society‐Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS‐UPDRS‐III), and electrophysiological evaluation of cortical excitability by TMS.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 1 Hz and 25 Hz rTMS groups produced a greater improvement in fastest walking speed at one‐day and three‐month post‐intervention than the sham group. Only 1 and 25 Hz rTMS groups sustained the improvements in TUG, and had a significant improvement in DT‐TUG and MDS‐UPDRS‐III for up to three months. Behavioral improvements correlated with increased cortical silent period and short‐interval intracortical inhibition in both groups receiving real rTMS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interpretation&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Priming with 1 Hz and 25 Hz rTMS can augment the benefits of treadmill training and led to long‐term motor improvement up to three‐month post‐intervention. The motor improvement at follow‐up was associated with a normalization of cortical excitability, which in turn suggests an alteration of the homeostatic plasticity range. Rebalancing cortical excitability by rTMS appears critical for plasticity induction.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Annals of Neurology: DBS for chronic cluster headache: meta‐analysis of individual patient data</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25887?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is a treatment alternative for refractory chronic Cluster headache (CCH). Despite several recent prospective case series reporting on good outcome, the effectiveness and the optimal stimulation target of DBS for CCH remain unclear. We aimed to obtain precise estimates and predictors of long‐term pain relief in an individual patient data meta‐analysis. Further, we aimed to construct a probabilistic stimulation map of effective DBS.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We invited investigators of published cohorts of patients undergoing DBS for CCH, identified by a systematic review of MEDLINE from inception to Febuary 15, 2019, to provide individual patient data on baseline covariates, pre‐ and postoperative headache scores at median (12‐month) and long‐term follow‐up as well as individual imaging data to obtain individual electrode positions. We calculated a stimulation map using voxel‐wise statistical analysis. We used multiple regression analysis to estimate predictors of pain‐relief.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among 40 patients from four different cohorts representing about 50% of all previously published cases, we found a significant 77% mean reduction in headache attack frequency over a mean follow‐up of 44 months with an overall 75% response rate. Positive outcome was not associated with baseline covariates. We identified two hotspots of stimulation covering the midbrain ventral and retrorubral tegmentum.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study supports that DBS provides long‐term pain relief for the majority of CCH patients. Our stimulation map of the region of influence of therapeutic DBS identified an optimal anatomical target site that can help surgeons guide their surgical planning in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Implantable Cardiac Monitoring in the Secondary Prevention of Cryptogenic Stroke</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25886?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We sought to evaluate the impact of implantable cardiac monitoring (ICM) in the prevention of stroke recurrence after a cryptogenic ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We evaluated consecutive patients with cryptogenic ischemic stroke or TIA admitted in a comprehensive stroke center during an eight‐year period. We compared the baseline characteristics and outcomes between patients receiving conventional cardiac monitoring with repeated 24‐hour Holter‐monitoring during the first five years in the outpatient setting and those receiving continuous cardiac monitoring with ICM during the last three years. Associations on the outcomes of interest were further assessed in multivariable regression models adjusting for potential confounders.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We identified a total of 373 patients receiving conventional cardiac monitoring and 123 patients receiving ICM. PAF detection was higher in the ICM cohort compared to the conventional cardiac monitoring cohort (21.1% vs. 7.5%, p&amp;lt;0.001). ICM was independently associated with an increased likelihood of PAF detection during follow‐up (HR=1.94, 95%CI: 1.16‐3.24) in multivariable analyses. Patients receiving ICM were also found to have significantly higher rates of anticoagulation initiation (18.7% vs. 6.4%, p&amp;lt;0.001) and lower risk of stroke recurrence (4.1% vs. 11.8%, p=0.013). ICM was independently associated with a lower risk of stroke recurrence during follow‐up (HR=0.32, 95%CI: 0.11‐0.90) in multivariable analyses.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ICM appears to be independently associated with a higher likelihood of PAF detection and anticoagulation initiation after a cryptogenic ischemic stroke or TIA. ICM was also independently related to lower risk of stroke recurrence in our cryptogenic stroke/TIA cohort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hypomyelination with atrophy of the basal ganglia and cerebellum is a neurodegenerative disease due to mutations in TUBB4A. Auditory evoked potentials are abnormal in this disease. Human mutation D249N impairs central function. A302T‐mutant &lt;i&gt;taiep&lt;/i&gt; rats presents longer latencies in central waves. Both mutations severely impair the central hearing pathway by progressive central white matter degeneration.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hypomyelination with atrophy of the basal ganglia and cerebellum (H‐ABC) is a neurodegenerative disease due to mutations in TUBB4A. Patients suffer from extrapyramidal movements, spasticity, ataxia, and cognitive deficits. Magnetic resonance imaging features are hypomyelination and atrophy of the striatum and cerebellum. A correlation between the mutations and their cellular, tissue and organic effects is largely missing. The effects of these mutations on sensory functions have not been described so far. We have previously reported a rat carrying a TUBB4A (A302T) mutation and sharing most of the clinical and radiological signs with H‐ABC patients. Here, for the first time, we did a comparative study of the hearing function in an H‐ABC patient and in this mutant model. By analyzing hearing function, we found that there are no significant differences in the auditory brainstem response (ABR) thresholds between mutant rats and WT controls. Nevertheless, ABRs show longer latencies in central waves (II–IV) that in some cases disappear when compared to WT. The patient also shows abnormal AEPs presenting only Waves I and II. Distortion product of otoacoustic emissions and immunohistochemistry in the rat show that the peripheral hearing function and morphology of the organ of Corti are normal. We conclude that the tubulin mutation severely impairs the central hearing pathway most probably by progressive central white matter degeneration. Hearing function might be affected in a significant fraction of patients with H‐ABC; therefore, screening for auditory function should be done on patients with tubulinopathies to evaluate hearing support therapies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Management strategies for control of vector-borne diseases, for example Zika or dengue, include using larvicide and/or adulticide, either through large-scale application by truck or plane or through door-to-door efforts that require obtaining permission to access private property and spray yards. The efficacy of the latter strategy is highly dependent on the compliance of local residents. Here we develop a model for vector-borne disease transmission between mosquitoes and humans in a neighborhood setting, considering a network of houses connected via nearest-neighbor mosquito movement. We incorporate large-scale application of adulticide via aerial spraying through a uniform increase in vector death rates in all sites, and door-to-door application of larval source reduction and adulticide through a decrease in vector emergence rates and an increase in vector death rates in compliant sites only, where control efficacies are directly connected to real-world experimentally measurable control parameters, application frequencies, and control costs. To develop mechanistic insight into the influence of vector motion and compliance clustering on disease controllability, we determine the the basic reproduction number &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; for the system, provide analytic results for the extreme cases of no mosquito movement, infinite hopping rates, and utilize degenerate perturbation theory for the case of slow but non-zero hopping rates. We then determine the application frequencies required for each strategy (alone and combined) in order to reduce &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; to unity, along with the associated costs. Cost-optimal strategies are found to depend strongly on mosquito hopping rates, levels of door-to-door compliance, and spatial clustering of compliant houses, and can include aerial spray alone, door-to-door treatment alone, or a combination of both. The optimization scheme developed here provides a flexible tool for disease management planners which translates modeling results into actionable control advice adaptable to system-specific details.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/5-4Cq1nPXDU&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Tissue morphogenesis relies on repeated use of dynamic behaviors at the levels of intracellular structures, individual cells, and cell groups. Rapidly accumulating live imaging datasets make it increasingly important to formalize and automate the task of mapping recurrent dynamic behaviors (motifs), as it is done in speech recognition and other data mining applications. Here, we present a “template-based search” approach for accurate mapping of sub- to multi-cellular morphogenetic motifs using a time series data mining framework. We formulated the task of motif mapping as a subsequence matching problem and solved it using dynamic time warping, while relying on high throughput graph-theoretic algorithms for efficient exploration of the search space. This formulation allows our algorithm to accurately identify the complete duration of each instance and automatically label different stages throughout its progress, such as cell cycle phases during cell division. To illustrate our approach, we mapped cell intercalations during germband extension in the early &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; embryo. Our framework enabled statistical analysis of intercalary cell behaviors in wild-type and mutant embryos, comparison of temporal dynamics in contracting and growing junctions in different genotypes, and the identification of a novel mode of iterative cell intercalation. Our formulation of tissue morphogenesis using time series opens new avenues for systematic decomposition of tissue morphogenesis.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/TK83tSWZtVg&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Simulating flow induced migration in vascular remodelling</title>

Shear stress induces directed endothelial cell (EC) migration in blood vessels leading to vessel diameter increase and induction of vascular maturation. Other factors, such as EC elongation and interaction between ECs and non-vascular areas are also important. Computational models have previously been used to study collective cell migration. These models can be used to predict EC migration and its effect on vascular remodelling during embryogenesis. We combined live time-lapse imaging of the remodelling vasculature of the quail embryo yolk sac with flow quantification using a combination of micro-Particle Image Velocimetry and computational fluid dynamics. We then used the flow and remodelling data to inform a model of EC migration during remodelling. To obtain the relation between shear stress and velocity &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; for EC cells, we developed a flow chamber to assess how confluent sheets of ECs migrate in response to shear stress. Using these data as an input, we developed a multiphase, self-propelled particles (SPP) model where individual agents are driven to migrate based on the level of shear stress while maintaining appropriate spatial relationship to nearby agents. These agents elongate, interact with each other, and with avascular agents at each time-step of the model. We compared predicted vascular shape to real vascular shape after 4 hours from our time-lapse movies and performed sensitivity analysis on the various model parameters. Our model shows that shear stress has the largest effect on the remodelling process. Importantly, however, elongation played an especially important part in remodelling. This model provides a powerful tool to study the input of different biological processes on remodelling.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/jh8yMFKwZnU&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Genomic epidemiology can provide a unique, real-time understanding of SARS-CoV-2 transmission patterns. Yet the potential for genomic analyses to guide local policy and community-based behavioral decisions is limited because they are often oriented towards specially trained scientists and conducted on a national or global scale. Here, we propose a new paradigm: Phylogenetic analyses performed on a local level (municipal, county, or state), with results communicated in a clear, timely, and actionable manner to strengthen public health responses. We believe that presenting results rapidly, and tailored to a non-expert audience, can serve as a template for effective public health response to COVID-19 and other emerging viral diseases.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/QU8piv4kS-E&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

High levels of the amyloid-beta (Aβ) peptide have been shown to disrupt neuronal function and induce hyperexcitability, but it is unclear what effects Aβ-associated hyperexcitability may have on tauopathy pathogenesis or propagation in vivo. Using a novel transgenic mouse line to model the impact of human APP (hAPP)/Aβ accumulation on tauopathy in the entorhinal cortex–hippocampal (EC-HIPP) network, we demonstrate that hAPP overexpression aggravates EC-Tau aggregation and accelerates pathological tau spread into the hippocampus. In vivo recordings revealed a strong role for hAPP/Aβ, but not tau, in the emergence of EC neuronal hyperactivity and impaired theta rhythmicity. Chronic chemogenetic attenuation of EC neuronal hyperactivity led to reduced hAPP/Aβ accumulation and reduced pathological tau spread into downstream hippocampus. These data strongly support the hypothesis that in Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Aβ-associated hyperactivity accelerates the progression of pathological tau along vulnerable neuronal circuits, and demonstrates the utility of chronic, neuromodulatory approaches in ameliorating AD pathology in vivo.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/72Wsaso3B-M&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience: Dissecting Brainstem Locomotor Circuits: Converging Evidence for Cuneiform Nucleus Stimulation</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2020.00064</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;There are a pressing and unmet need for effective therapies for freezing of gait (FOG) and other neurological gait disorders. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of a midbrain target known as the pedunculopontine nucleus (PPN) was proposed as a potential treatment based on its postulated involvement in locomotor control as part of the mesencephalic locomotor region (MLR). However, DBS trials fell short of expectations, leading many clinicians to abandon this strategy. Here, we discuss the potential reasons for this failure and review recent clinical data along with preclinical optogenetics evidence to argue that another nearby nucleus, the cuneiform nucleus (CnF), may be a superior target.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Synaptic Neuroscience: Psychedelics as a Treatment for Alzheimer’s Disease Dementia</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsyn.2020.00034</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Currently, there are no disease-modifying treatments for Alzheimer’s disease (AD) or any other dementia subtype. The renaissance in psychedelic research in recent years, in particular studies involving psilocybin and lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), coupled with anecdotal reports of cognitive benefits from micro-dosing, suggests that they may have a therapeutic role in a range of psychiatric and neurological conditions due to their potential to stimulate neurogenesis, provoke neuroplastic changes and reduce neuroinflammation. This inevitably makes them interesting candidates for therapeutics in dementia. This mini-review will look at the basic science and current clinical evidence for the role of psychedelics in treating dementia, especially early AD, with a particular focus on micro-dosing of the classical psychedelics LSD and psilocybin.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: MicroRNAs in Alzheimer’s Disease: Function and Potential Applications as Diagnostic Biomarkers</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2020.00160</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia. Although the incidence of AD is high, the rates of diagnosis and treatment are relatively low. Moreover, effective means for the diagnosis and treatment of AD are still lacking. MicroRNAs (miRNAs, miRs) are non-coding RNAs that play regulatory roles by targeting mRNAs. The expression of miRNAs is conserved, temporal, and tissue-specific. Impairment of microRNA function is closely related to AD pathogenesis, including the beta-amyloid and tau hallmarks of AD, and there is evidence that the expression of some microRNAs differs significantly between healthy people and AD patients. These properties of miRNAs endow them with potential diagnostic and therapeutic value in the treatment of this debilitating disease. This review provides comprehensive information about the regulatory function of miRNAs in AD, as well as potential applications as diagnostic biomarkers.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Tau-Mediated Dysregulation of Neuroplasticity and Glial Plasticity</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2020.00151</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The inability of individual neurons to compensate for aging-related damage leads to a gradual loss of functional plasticity in the brain accompanied by progressive impairment in learning and memory. Whereas this loss in neuroplasticity is gradual during normal aging, in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD), this loss is accelerated dramatically, leading to the incapacitation of patients within a decade of onset of cognitive symptoms. The mechanisms that underlie this accelerated loss of neuroplasticity in AD are still not completely understood. While the progressively increasing proteinopathy burden, such as amyloid β (Aβ) plaques and tau tangles, definitely contribute directly to a neuron’s functional demise, the role of non-neuronal cells in controlling neuroplasticity is slowly being recognized as another major factor. These non-neuronal cells include astrocytes, microglia, and oligodendrocytes, which through regulating brain homeostasis, structural stability, and trophic support, play a key role in maintaining normal functioning and resilience of the neuronal network. It is believed that chronic signaling from these cells affects the homeostatic network of neuronal and non-neuronal cells to an extent to destabilize this harmonious milieu in neurodegenerative diseases like AD. Here, we will examine the experimental evidence regarding the direct and indirect pathways through which astrocytes and microglia can alter brain plasticity in AD, specifically as they relate to the development and progression of tauopathy. In this review article, we describe the concepts of neuroplasticity and glial plasticity in healthy aging, delineate possible mechanisms underlying tau-induced plasticity dysfunction, and discuss current clinical trials as well as future disease-modifying approaches.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Integrative Neuroscience: The Contribution of Plasma and Brain Vitamin C on Age and Gender-Related Cognitive Differences: A Mini-Review of the Literature</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnint.2020.00047</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;There is increasing evidence that sex differences in the brain may contribute to gender-related behavioral differences, including cognitive function. Literature has revealed gender dimorphisms in cognitive function between males and females. Additionally, several risk factors associated with cognitive decline depend on chronological age. It is well recognized that the process of aging is associated with a decline in cognitive ability and brain function. Various explanations may account for these gender-related cognitive differences and age-associated cognitive changes. Recent investigations have highlighted the importance of vitamin C in maintaining brain health and its association with cognitive function in both cognitively intact and impaired cohorts. The present review explores previous literature that has evaluated differences in plasma/brain vitamin C between genders and during aging. It then assesses whether these age and gender-related differences may affect the relationship between plasma/brain vitamin C and cognition. The purpose of this review was to examine the evidence for a link between plasma/brain vitamin C and cognition and the impact of gender and age on this relationship. Epidemiological studies have frequently shown higher vitamin C plasma concentrations in women. Similarly, aging has been systematically associated with reductions in plasma vitamin C levels. A range of animal studies has demonstrated potential gender and age-related differences in vitamin C brain distribution and utilization. The reviewed literature suggests that gender differences in plasma and brain vitamin C may potentially contribute to differences in gender-associated cognitive ability, particularly while females are pre-menopausal. Additionally, we can propose that age-associated differences in plasma and brain vitamin C may be potentially linked to age-associated cognitive differences, with older cohorts appearing more vulnerable to experience declines in plasma vitamin C concentrations alongside compromised vitamin C brain regulation. This review encourages future investigations to take into account both gender and age when assessing the link between plasma vitamin C concentrations and cognitive function. Further large scale investigations are required to assess whether differences in cognitive function between genders and age groups may be causally attributed to plasma vitamin C status and brain distribution and utilization.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurogenesis: Progression of Fetal Brain Lesions in Tuberous Sclerosis Complex</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00899</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Tuberous sclerosis (TSC) is a multisystem autosomal dominant genetic disorder due to loss of function of TSC1/TSC2 resulting in increased mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) signaling. In the brain, TSC is characterized by the formation of specific lesions that include subependymal and white matter nodules and cortical tubers. Cells that constitute TSC lesions are mainly Giant cells and dysmorphic neurons and astrocytes, but normal cells also populate the tubers. Although considered as a developmental disorder, the histopathological features of brain lesions have been described in only a limited number of fetal cases, providing little information on how these lesions develop. In this report we characterized the development of TSC lesions in 14 fetal brains ranging from 19 gestational weeks (GW) to term and 2 postnatal cases. The study focused on the telencephalon at the level of the caudothalamic notch. Our data indicate that subcortical lesions, forming within and at the vicinity of germinative zones, are the first alterations (already detected in 19GW brains), characterized by the presence of numerous dysmorphic astrocytes and Giant, balloon-like, cells. Our data show that cortical tuber formation is a long process that initiates with the presence of dysmorphic astrocytes (by 19–21GW), progress with the apparition of Giant cells (by 24GW) and mature with the appearance of dysmorphic neurons by the end of gestation (by 36GW). Furthermore, the typical tuberal aspect of cortical lesions is only reached when bundles of neurofilament positive extensions delineate the bottom of the cortical lesion (by 36GW). In addition, our study reveals the presence of Giant cells and dysmorphic neurons immunopositive for interneuron markers such as calbindin and parvalbumin, suggesting that TSC lesions would be mosaic lesions generated from different classes of progenitors.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Ophthalmic Manifestations and Genetics of the Polyglutamine Autosomal Dominant Spinocerebellar Ataxias: A Review</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00892</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) is a part of the cerebellar neurodegenerative disease group that is diverse in genetics and phenotypes. It usually shows autosomal dominant inheritance. SCAs, always together with the cerebellar degeneration, may exhibit clinical deficits in brainstem or eye, especially retina or optic nerve. Interestingly, autosomal dominant SCAs share a common genetic mechanism; the length of the glutamine chain is abnormally expanded due to the increase in the cytosine–adenine–guanine (CAG) repeats of the disease causing gene. Studies have suggested that the mutant ataxin induces alteration of protein conformation and abnormal aggregation resulting in nuclear inclusions, and causes cellular loss of photoreceptors through a toxic effect. As a result, these pathologic changes induce a downregulation of genes involved in the phototransduction, development, and differentiation of photoreceptors such as CRX, one of the photoreceptor transcription factors. However, the exact mechanism of neuronal degeneration by mutant ataxin restricted to only certain type of neuronal cell including cerebellar Purkinje neurons and photoreceptor is still unclear. The most common SCAs are types 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, and 17 which contain about 80% of autosomal dominant SCA cases. Various aspects of eye movement abnormalities are evident depending on the degree of cerebellar and brainstem degeneration in SCAs. In addition, certain types of SCAs such as SCA7 are characterized by both cerebellar ataxia and visual loss mainly due to retinal degeneration. The severity of the retinopathy can vary from occult macular photoreceptor disruption to extensive retinal atrophy and is correlated with the number of CAG repeats. The value of using optical coherence tomography in conjunction with electrodiagnostic and genetic testing is emphasized as the combination of these tests can provide critical information regarding the etiology, morphological evaluation, and functional significances. Therefore, ophthalmologists need to recognize and differentiate SCAs in order to properly diagnose and evaluate the disease. In this review, we have described and discussed SCAs showing ophthalmic abnormalities with particular attention to their ophthalmic features, neurodegenerative mechanisms, genetics, and future perspectives.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Objective&lt;p&gt;To evaluate whether introducing gamification in BCI rehabilitation of the upper limbs of post-stroke patients has a positive impact on their experience without altering their efficacy in creating motor mental images (MI).&lt;/p&gt;Design&lt;p&gt;A game was designed purposely adapted to the pace and goals of an established BCI-rehabilitation protocol. Rehabilitation was based on a double feedback: functional electrostimulation and animation of a virtual avatar of the patient’s limbs. The game introduced a narrative on top of this visual feedback with an external goal to achieve (protecting bits of cheese from a rat character). A pilot study was performed with 10 patients and a control group of six volunteers. Two rehabilitation sessions were done, each made up of one stage of calibration and two training stages, some stages with the game and others without. The accuracy of the classification computed was taken as a measure to compare the efficacy of MI. Users’ opinions were gathered through a questionnaire. No potentially identifiable human images or data are presented in this study.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;The gamified rehabilitation presented in the pilot study does not impact on the efficacy of MI, but it improves users experience making it more fun.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;These preliminary results are encouraging to continue investigating how game narratives can be introduced in BCI rehabilitation to make it more gratifying and engaging.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Transcutaneous Spinal Cord Direct-Current Stimulation Modulates Functional Activity and Integration in Idiopathic Restless Legs Syndrome</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00873</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Idiopathic restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a sensorimotor disorder and is suggested to be caused by central nervous system abnormalities. Non-invasive transcutaneous spinal direct-current stimulation (tsDCS) was recently used for RLS therapy. However, the neurophysiological basis of tsDCS treatment is still unknown. In this study, we explored the neural basis of tsDCS in 15 RLS patients and 20 gender- and age-matched healthy controls using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging. We calculated the whole-brain voxel-wise fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (fALFF), regional homogeneity (ReHo), and weighted degree centrality (DC) to characterize the intrinsic functional activities and the local and global functional integration. We found that tsDCS can effectively improve the sleep and RLS symptoms in RLS patients. Moreover, after tsDCS therapy, the RLS patients showed decreased fALFF in the right anterior insula/temporal pole, decreased ReHo in the supplementary motor area, increased weighted DC in the left primary visual cortex, and decreased weighted DC in the right posterior cerebellum. The changed patterns were consistent with that found between RLS patients and healthy controls. The weighted DC in the left primary visual cortex after treatment and the fALFF in the right anterior insula/temporal pole before treatment were significantly and marginally correlated with sleep and RLS symptom scores, respectively. These results revealed that tsDCS can normalize the functional patterns of RLS patients and is an effective way for RLS therapy. Our findings provide the neurophysiological basis for tsDCS treatment and may facilitate understanding the neuropathology of RLS and directing other neuromodulation treatments.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Background&lt;p&gt;Observation of a goal-directed motor action can excite the respective mirror neurons, and this is the theoretical basis for action observation (AO) as a novel tool for functional recovery during stroke rehabilitation. To explore the therapeutic potential of AO for dysphagia, we conducted a task-based functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study to identify the brain areas activated during observation and execution of swallowing in healthy participants.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;Twenty-nine healthy volunteers viewed the following stimuli during fMRI scanning: an action-video of swallowing (condition 1, defined as AO), a neutral image with a Chinese word for “watching” (condition 2), and a neutral image with a Chinese word for “swallowing” (condition 3). Action execution (AE) was defined as condition 3 minus condition 2. One-sample t-tests were performed to define the brain regions activated during AO and AE.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Many brain regions were activated during AO, including the middle temporal gyrus, inferior frontal gyrus, pre- and postcentral gyrus, supplementary motor area, hippocampus, brainstem, and pons. AE resulted in activation of motor areas as well as other brain areas, including the inferior parietal lobule, vermis, middle frontal gyrus, and middle temporal gyrus. Two brain areas, BA6 and BA21, were activated with both AO and AE.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;The left supplementary motor area (BA6) and left middle temporal gyrus (BA21), which contains mirror neurons, were activated in both AO and AE of swallowing. In this study, AO activated mirror neurons and the swallowing network in healthy participants, supporting its potential value in the treatment of dysphagia.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Entorhinal and Transentorhinal Atrophy in Preclinical Alzheimer's Disease</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00804</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;This study examines the atrophy patterns in the entorhinal and transentorhinal cortices of subjects that converted from normal cognition to mild cognitive impairment. The regions were manually segmented from 3T MRI, then corrected for variability in boundary definition over time using an automated approach called longitudinal diffeomorphometry. Cortical thickness was calculated by deforming the gray matter-white matter boundary surface to the pial surface using an approach called normal geodesic flow. The surface was parcellated based on four atlases using large deformation diffeomorphic metric mapping. Average cortical thickness was calculated for (1) manually-defined entorhinal cortex, and (2) manually-defined transentorhinal cortex. Group-wise difference analysis was applied to determine where atrophy occurred, and change point analysis was applied to determine when atrophy started to occur. The results showed that by the time a diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment is made, the transentorhinal cortex and entorhinal cortex was up to 0.6 mm thinner than a control with normal cognition. A change point in atrophy rate was detected in the transentorhinal cortex 9–14 years prior to a diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment, and in the entorhinal cortex 8–11 years prior. The findings are consistent with autopsy findings that demonstrate neuronal changes in the transentorhinal cortex before the entorhinal cortex.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Cerebral Modifications and Visual Pathway Reorganization in Maculopathy: A Systematic Review</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00755</link>
	<content:encoded>Background&lt;p&gt;Macular degeneration (MD) is one of the most frequent causes of visual deficit, resulting in alterations affecting not only the retina but also the entire visual pathway up to the brain areas. This would seem related not just to signal deprivation but also to a compensatory neuronal reorganization, having significant implications in terms of potential rehabilitation of the patient and therapeutic perspectives.&lt;/p&gt;Objective&lt;p&gt;This paper aimed to outline, by analyzing the existing literature, the current understanding of brain structural and functional changes detected with neuroimaging techniques in subjects affected by juvenile and age-related maculopathy.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;Articles using various typologies of central nervous system (CNS) imaging in at least six patients affected by juvenile or age-related maculopathy were considered. A total of 142 were initially screened. Non-pertinent articles and duplicates were rejected. Finally, 19 articles, including 649 patients, were identified.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;In these sources, both structural and functional modifications were found in MD subjects’ CNS. Changes in visual cortex gray matter volume were observed in both age-related MD (AMD) and juvenile MD (JMD); in particular, an involvement of not only its posterior part but also the anterior one suggests further causes besides an input-deprivation mechanism only. White matter degeneration was also found, more severe in JMD than in AMD. Moreover, functional analysis revealed differences in cortical activation patterns between MD and controls, suggesting neuronal circuit reorganization. Interestingly, attention and oculomotor training allowed better visual performances and correlated to a stronger cortical activation, even of the area normally receiving inputs from lesioned macula.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;In MD, structural and functional changes in cerebral circuits and visual pathway can happen, involving both cerebral volume and activation patterns. These modifications, possibly due to neuronal plasticity (already observed and described for several brain areas), can allow patients to compensate for macular damage and gives therapeutic perspectives which could be achievable through an association between oculomotor training and biochemical stimulation of neuronal plasticity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroinformatics: Nutil: A Pre- and Post-processing Toolbox for Histological Rodent Brain Section Images</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fninf.2020.00037</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;With recent technological advances in microscopy and image acquisition of tissue sections, further developments of tools are required for viewing, transforming, and analyzing the ever-increasing amounts of high-resolution data produced. In the field of neuroscience, histological images of whole rodent brain sections are commonly used for investigating brain connections as well as cellular and molecular organization in the normal and diseased brain, but present a problem for the typical neuroscientist with no or limited programming experience in terms of the pre- and post-processing steps needed for analysis. To meet this need we have designed Nutil, an open access and stand-alone executable software that enables automated transformations, post-processing, and analyses of 2D section images using multi-core processing (OpenMP). The software is written in C++ for efficiency, and provides the user with a clean and easy graphical user interface for specifying the input and output parameters. Nutil currently contains four separate tools: (1) A transformation toolchain named “Transform” that allows for rotation, mirroring and scaling, resizing, and renaming of very large tiled tiff images. (2) “TiffCreator” enables the generation of tiled TIFF images from other image formats such as PNG and JPEG. (3) A “Resize” tool completes the preprocessing toolset and allows downscaling of PNG and JPEG images with output in PNG format. (4) The fourth tool is a post-processing method called “Quantifier” that enables the quantification of segmented objects in the context of regions defined by brain atlas maps generated with the QuickNII software based on a 3D reference atlas (mouse or rat). The output consists of a set of report files, point cloud coordinate files for visualization in reference atlas space, and reference atlas images superimposed with color-coded objects. The Nutil software is made available by the Human Brain Project (https://www.humanbrainproject.eu) at https://www.nitrc.org/projects/nutil/.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Long-Term Musical Training Alters Auditory Cortical Activity to the Frequency Change</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00329</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Objective: The ability to detect frequency variation is a fundamental skill necessary for speech perception. It is known that musical expertise is associated with a range of auditory perceptual skills, including discriminating frequency change, which suggests the neural encoding of spectral features can be enhanced by musical training. In this study, we measured auditory cortical responses to frequency change in musicians to examine the relationships between N1/P2 responses and behavioral performance/musical training.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Behavioral and electrophysiological data were obtained from professional musicians and age-matched non-musician participants. Behavioral data included frequency discrimination detection thresholds for no threshold-equalizing noise (TEN), +5, 0, and −5 signal-to-noise ratio settings. Auditory-evoked responses were measured using a 64-channel electroencephalogram (EEG) system in response to frequency changes in ongoing pure tones consisting of 250 and 4,000 Hz, and the magnitudes of frequency change were 10%, 25% or 50% from the base frequencies. N1 and P2 amplitudes and latencies as well as dipole source activation in the left and right hemispheres were measured for each condition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Compared to the non-musician group, behavioral thresholds in the musician group were lower for frequency discrimination in quiet conditions only. The scalp-recorded N1 amplitudes were modulated as a function of frequency change. P2 amplitudes in the musician group were larger than in the non-musician group. Dipole source analysis showed that P2 dipole activity to frequency changes was lateralized to the right hemisphere, with greater activity in the musician group regardless of the hemisphere side. Additionally, N1 amplitudes to frequency changes were positively related to behavioral thresholds for frequency discrimination while enhanced P2 amplitudes were associated with a longer duration of musical training.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: Our results demonstrate that auditory cortical potentials evoked by frequency change are related to behavioral thresholds for frequency discrimination in musicians. Larger P2 amplitudes in musicians compared to non-musicians reflects musical training-induced neural plasticity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Changes in Empathy in Patients With Chronic Low Back Pain: A Structural–Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging Study</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00326</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Objective: Many pieces of research have focused on pain within individuals, but little attention has been paid to whether pain can change an individual’s empathic ability and affect social relationships. The purpose of this study is to explore how chronic low back pain changes empathy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Twenty-four chronic low back pain patients and 22 healthy controls were recruited. We set up an experimental pain-exposed model for each healthy subject. All subjects received a painful-empathic magnetic resonance scan. After the scan, all subjects rated the pain intensity and multiple empathy-related indicators. The clinical assessment scale was the 20-item Basic Empathy Scale in Adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Result: The chronic low back pain patients reported lower scores on the total scores of BES-A, the subscale scores of emotional disconnection and cognitive empathy, and the discomfort rating. The fMRI results in the chronic low back pain patients showed that there were multiple abnormal brain pathways centered on the anterior insula. The DTI results in the chronic low back pain patients showed that there were reduced fractional anisotropy values in the corpus callosum, bilateral anterior thalamic radiation (ATR), right posterior thalamic radiation (PTR), right superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF), and left anterior corona radiate (ACR).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: Our study found that patients with chronic low back pain have impaired empathy ability. The abnormal functional connectivity of multiple brain networks, multiple damaged white matter tracts, and the lower behavioral scores in chronic low back pain patients supported our findings.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00278</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Glia, a non-excitable cell type once considered merely as the connective tissue between neurons, is nowadays acknowledged for its essential contribution to multiple physiological processes including learning, memory formation, excitability, synaptic plasticity, ion homeostasis, and energy metabolism. Moreover, as glia are key players in the brain immune system and provide structural and nutritional support for neurons, they are intimately involved in multiple neurological disorders. Recent advances have demonstrated that glial cells, specifically microglia and astroglia, are involved in several neurodegenerative diseases including Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Epilepsy, Parkinson’s disease (PD), Alzheimer’s disease (AD), and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). While there is compelling evidence for glial modulation of synaptic formation and regulation that affect neuronal signal processing and activity, in this manuscript we will review recent findings on neuronal activity that affect glial function, specifically during neurodegenerative disorders. We will discuss the nature of each glial malfunction, its specificity to each disorder, overall contribution to the disease progression and assess its potential as a future therapeutic target.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: NLRP3 Is Involved in the Maintenance of Cerebral Pericytes</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00276</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Pericytes play a central role in regulating the structure and function of capillaries in the brain. However, molecular mechanisms that drive pericyte proliferation and differentiation are unclear. In our study, we immunostained NACHT, LRR and PYD domains-containing protein 3 (NLRP3)-deficient and wild-type littermate mice and observed that NLRP3 deficiency reduced platelet-derived growth factor receptor β (PDGFRβ)-positive pericytes and collagen type IV immunoreactive vasculature in the brain. In Western blot analysis, PDGFRβ and CD13 proteins in isolated cerebral microvessels from the NLRP3-deficient mouse brain were decreased. We further treated cultured pericytes with NLRP3 inhibitor, MCC950, and demonstrated that NLRP3 inhibition attenuated cell proliferation but did not induce apoptosis. NLRP3 inhibition also decreased protein levels of PDGFRβ and CD13 in cultured pericytes. On the contrary, treatments with IL-1β, the major product of NLRP3-contained inflammasome, increased protein levels of PDGFRβ, and CD13 in cultured cells. The alteration of PDGFRβ and CD13 protein levels were correlated with the phosphorylation of AKT. Inhibition of AKT reduced both protein markers and abolished the effect of IL-1β activation in cultured pericytes. Thus, NLRP3 activation might be essential to maintain pericytes in the healthy brain through phosphorylating AKT. The potential adverse effects on the cerebral vascular pericytes should be considered in clinical therapies with NLRP3 inhibitors.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Expression and Function of GABA Receptors in Myelinating Cells</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00256</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Myelin facilitates the fast transmission of nerve impulses and provides metabolic support to axons. Differentiation of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) and Schwann cell (SC) precursors is critical for myelination during development and myelin repair in demyelinating disorders. Myelination is tightly controlled by neuron-glia communication and requires the participation of a wide repertoire of signals, including neurotransmitters such as glutamate, ATP, adenosine, or γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA). GABA is the main inhibitory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system (CNS) and it is also present in the peripheral nervous system (PNS). The composition and function of GABA receptors (GABARs) are well studied in neurons, while their nature and role in glial cells are still incipient. Recent studies demonstrate that GABA-mediated signaling mechanisms play relevant roles in OPC and SC precursor development and function, and stand out the implication of GABARs in oligodendrocyte (OL) and SC maturation and myelination. In this review, we highlight the evidence supporting the novel role of GABA with an emphasis on the molecular identity of the receptors expressed in these glial cells and the possible signaling pathways involved in their actions. GABAergic signaling in myelinating cells may have potential implications for developing novel reparative therapies in demyelinating diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroanatomy: Dissociated Pmch and Cre Expression in Lactating Pmch-Cre BAC Transgenic Mice</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnana.2020.00060</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH) system plays a role in many physiological processes including reproduction and lactation. However, research regarding the function of MCH on different aspects of the reproductive function lags, due in part to a lack of validated genetic models with which to interrogate the system. This is particularly true in the case of female reproduction, as the anatomy and function of the MCH system is not well-characterized in the female mouse. We set out to determine whether the commercially available Pmch-Cre transgenic mouse line is a viable model to study the role of MCH neurons in distinct female reproductive states. We found that Pmch is transiently expressed in several nuclei of the rostral forebrain at the end of lactation. This includes the medial subdivision of the medial preoptic nucleus, the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus, the ventral subdivision of the lateral septum, the anterodorsal preoptic nucleus and the anterodorsal nucleus of the thalamus. The Pmch expression in these sites, however, does not reliably induce Cre expression in the Pmch-Cre (BAC) transgenic mouse, making this line an inadequate model with which to study the role of MCH in behavioral and/or neuroendocrine adaptations of lactation. We also contribute to the general knowledge of the anatomy of the murine MCH system by showing that lactation-induced Pmch expression in the rostral forebrain is mostly observed in GABAergic (VGAT) neurons, in contrast to the typical MCH neurons of the tuberal and posterior hypothalamus which are glutamatergic (VGLUT2).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The high synaptic density in the nervous system results from the ability of neurites to branch. Neuronal cell surface molecules play central roles during neurite branch formation. The underlying mechanisms of surface molecule activity have often been elucidated using invertebrates with simple nervous systems. Here, we review recent advances in understanding the molecular mechanisms of neurite branching in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. We discuss how cell surface receptor complexes link to and modulate actin dynamics to regulate dendritic and axonal branch formation. The mechanisms of neurite branching are often coupled with other neural circuit developmental processes, such as synapse formation and axon guidance, via the same cell-cell surface molecular interactions. We also cover ectopic and sex-specific neurite branching in C. elegans in an attempt to illustrate the importance of these studies in contributing to our understanding of conserved cell surface molecule regulation of neurite branch formation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnana.2020.00055</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The evolution of the brain in apes and man followed a joint pathway stemming from common ancestors 5–10 million years ago. However, although apparently sharing similar organization and neurochemical properties, association areas of the isocortex remain one of the cornerstones of what sets humans aside from other primates. Brodmann’s area 44, the area of Broca, is known for its implication in speech, and thus indirectly is a key mark of human uniqueness. This latero-caudal part of the frontal lobe shows a marked functional asymmetry in humans, and takes part in other complex functions, including learning and imitation, tool use, music and contains the mirror neuron system (MNS). Since the main features in the cytoarchitecture of Broca’s area remains relatively constant in hominids, including in our closest relative, the chimpanzee Pan troglodytes, investigations on the finer structure, cellular organization, connectivity and eventual asymmetry of area 44 have a direct bearing on the understanding of the neural mechanisms at the base of our language. The semi-automated image analysis technology that we employed in the current study showed that the structure of the cortical layers of the chimpanzee contains elements of asymmetry that are discussed in relation to the corresponding human areas and the putative resulting disparity of function.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroanatomy: The Melanocortin System in Atlantic Salmon (Salmo salar L.) and Its Role in Appetite Control</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnana.2020.00048</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The melanocortin system is a key neuroendocrine network involved in the control of food intake and energy homeostasis in vertebrates. Within the hypothalamus, the system comprises two main distinct neuronal cell populations that express the neuropeptides proopiomelanocortin (POMC; anorexigenic) or agouti-related protein (AGRP; orexigenic). Both bind to the melanocortin-4 receptor (MC4R) in higher order neurons that control both food intake and energy expenditure. This system is relatively well-conserved among vertebrates. However, in Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.), the salmonid-specific fourth round whole-genome duplication led to the presence of several paralog genes which might result in divergent functions of the duplicated genes. In the current study, we report the first comprehensive comparative identification and characterization of Mc4r and extend the knowledge of Pomc and Agrp in appetite control in Atlantic salmon. In silico analysis revealed multiple paralogs for mc4r (a1, a2, b1, and b2) in the Atlantic salmon genome and confirmed the paralogs previously described for pomc (a1, a2, and b) and agrp (1 and 2). All Mc4r paralogs are relatively well-conserved with the human homolog, sharing at least 63% amino acid sequence identity. We analyzed the mRNA expression of mc4r, pomc, and agrp genes in eight brain regions of Atlantic salmon post-smolt under two feeding states: normally fed and fasted for 4 days. The mc4ra2 and b1 mRNAs were predominantly and equally abundant in the hypothalamus and telencephalon, the mc4rb2 in the hypothalamus, and a1 in the telencephalon. All pomc genes were highly expressed in the pituitary, followed by the hypothalamus and saccus vasculosus. The agrp genes showed a completely different expression pattern from each other, with prevalent expression of the agrp1 in the hypothalamus and agrp2 in the telencephalon. Fasting did not induce any significant changes in the mRNA level of mc4r, agrp, or pomc paralogs in the hypothalamus or in other highly expressed regions between fed and fasted states. The identification and wide distribution of multiple paralogs of mc4r, pomc, and agrp in Atlantic salmon brain provide new insights and give rise to new questions of the melanocortin system in the appetite regulation in Atlantic salmon.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: α-Lipoic Acid Maintains Brain Glucose Metabolism via BDNF/TrkB/HIF-1α Signaling Pathway in P301S Mice</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00262</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The microtubule-associated protein tau is closely correlated with hypometabolism in Alzheimer’s disease (AD). α-lipoic acid (LA), which is a naturally occurring cofactor in mitochondrial, has been shown to have properties that can inhibit the tau pathology and neuronal damage in our previous research. However, if LA affects glucose metabolism when it reverses tau pathology remains unclear, especially concerning the potential mechanism. Therefore, we make a further study using the P301S mouse model (a tauopathy and AD mouse model which overexpressing fibrillary tau) to gain a clear idea of the aforementioned problems. Here, we found chronic LA administration significantly increased glucose availability by elevating glucose transporter 3 (GLUT3), GLUT4, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) protein and mRNA level, and heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) protein level in P301S mouse brains. Meanwhile, we found that LA also promoted glycolysis by directly upregulating hexokinase (HK) activity, indirectly by increasing proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha (PGC-1α) and DNA repair enzymes (OGG1/2 and MTH1). Further, we found the underlying mechanism of restored glucose metabolism might involve in the activation of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)/tyrosine Kinase receptor B (TrkB)/hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) signaling pathway by LA treatment.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Antenatal Hypoxia Accelerates the Onset of Alzheimer’s Disease Pathology in 5xFAD Mouse Model</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00251</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a chronic neurodegenerative disorder associated with cognitive impairment and later dementia among the elderly. Mounting evidence shows that adverse maternal environments during the fetal development increase the risk of diseases later in life including neurological disorders, and suggests an early origin in the development of AD-related dementia (ADRD) in utero. In the present study, we investigated the impact of antenatal hypoxia and fetal stress on the initiation of AD-related pathology in offspring of 5xFAD mice. We showed that fetal hypoxia significantly reduced brain and body weight in the fetal and the early postnatal period, which recovered in young adult mice. Using spontaneous Y-maze, novel object recognition (NOR), and open field (OF) tasks, we found that antenatal hypoxia exacerbated cognitive decline in offspring of 5xFAD compared with normoxia control. Of interest, fetal hypoxia did not alter intraneuronal soluble amyloid-β (Aβ) oligomer accumulation in the cortex and hippocampus in 5xFAD mouse offspring, indicating that antenatal hypoxia increased the vulnerability of the brain to synaptotoxic Aβ in the disease onset later in life. Consistent with the early occurrence of cognitive decline, we found synapse loss but not neuronal death in the cerebral cortex in 5xFAD but not wild-type (WT) offspring exposed to antenatal hypoxia. Furthermore, we also demonstrated that antenatal hypoxia significantly increased microglial number and activation, and reactive astrogliosis in the cerebral cortex in WT offspring. Moreover, antenatal hypoxia resulted in an exacerbated increase of microgliosis and astrogliosis in the early stage of AD in 5xFAD offspring. Together, our study reveals a causative link between fetal stress and the accelerated onset of AD-related pathology, and provides mechanistic insights into the developmental origin of aging-related neurodegenerative disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Chronic Periodontitis and Alzheimer Disease: A Putative Link of Serum Proteins Identification by 2D-DIGE Proteomics</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00248</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Increasing evidence indicates Chronic Periodontitis (CP) is a comorbidity of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), which is the most common form of age-related dementia, and for the latter, effective diagnostic and treatment strategies are lacking. Although inflammation is present in both diseases, the exact mechanisms and cross-links between CP and AD are poorly understood; and a direct association between the two has not been reported. This study aimed to identify a direct serum proteins link between AD and CP. Two-dimensional differential in-gel electrophoresis was employed to analyze serum samples from 12 CP patients and 12 age-matched controls. Furthermore, to determine the molecular link between CP and AD, neuroblastoma SK-N-SH APPwt cells were treated with 1 μg/ml of lipopolysaccharide from Porphyromonas gingivalis (P.g-LPS). Ten differentially expressed proteins were identified in CP patients. Among them, nine proteins were up-regulated, and one protein was down-regulated. Of the 10 differentially expressed proteins, five proteins were reportedly involved in the pathology of AD: Cofilin-2, Cathepsin B, Clusterin, Triosephosphate isomerase, and inter-alpha-trypsin inhibitor heavy chain H4 (ITI-H4). Western blotting indicated significantly higher expression of Cofilin-2, Cathepsin B, and Clusterin and lower expression of ITI-H4 in the CP group than in the Control group. The serum concentration of Cathepsin B has a good correlation with MMSE scores. Moreover, the protein level of Cathepsin B (but not that of ADAM10 and BACE1) increased significantly along with a prominent increase in Aβ&lt;sub&gt;1–40&lt;/sub&gt; and Aβ&lt;sub&gt;1–42&lt;/sub&gt; in the cell lysates of P.g-LPS-treated SK-N-SH APPwt cells. Cathepsin B inhibition resulted in a sharp decrease in Aβ&lt;sub&gt;1–40&lt;/sub&gt; and Aβ&lt;sub&gt;1–42&lt;/sub&gt; in the cell lysates. Furthermore, TNF-α was one of the most important inflammatory cytokines for the P.g-LPS-induced Cathepsin B upregulation in SK-N-SH APPwt cells. These results show that CP and AD share an association, while Cathepsin B could be a key link between the two diseases. The discovery of the identical serum proteins provides a potential mechanism underlying the increased risk of AD in CP patients, which could be critical for elucidating the pathophysiology of AD.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Tumor vascular status controls oxygen delivery facilitated by infused polymerized hemoglobins with varying oxygen affinity</title>

Oxygen (O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) delivery facilitated by hemoglobin (Hb)-based O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; carriers (HBOCs) is a promising strategy to increase the effectiveness of chemotherapeutics for treatment of solid tumors. However, the heterogeneous vascular structures present within tumors complicates evaluating the oxygenation potential of HBOCs within the tumor microenvironment. To account for spatial variations in the vasculature and tumor tissue that occur during tumor growth, we used a computational model to develop artificial tumor constructs. With these simulated tumors, we performed a polymerized human hemoglobin (hHb) (PolyhHb) enhanced oxygenation simulation accounting for differences in the physiologic characteristics of human and mouse blood. The results from this model were used to determine the potential effectiveness of different treatment options including a top load (low volume) and exchange (large volume) infusion of a tense quaternary state (T-State) PolyhHb, relaxed quaternary state (R-State) PolyhHb, and a non O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; carrying control. Principal component analysis (PCA) revealed correlations between the different regimes of effectiveness within the different simulated dosage options. In general, we found that infusion of T-State PolyhHb is more likely to decrease tissue hypoxia and modulate the metabolic rate of O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; consumption. Though the developed models are not a definitive descriptor of O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; carrier interaction in tumor capillary networks, we accounted for factors such as non-uniform vascular density and permeability that limit the applicability of O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; carriers during infusion. Finally, we have used these validated computational models to establish potential benchmarks to guide tumor treatment during translation of PolyhHb mediated therapies into clinical applications.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/62H5xwpG7gw&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Epithelial organ shape is generated by patterned actomyosin contractility and maintained by the extracellular matrix</title>

Epithelial sheets define organ architecture during development. Here, we employed an iterative multiscale computational modeling and quantitative experimental approach to decouple direct and indirect effects of actomyosin-generated forces, nuclear positioning, extracellular matrix, and cell-cell adhesion in shaping &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; wing imaginal discs. Basally generated actomyosin forces generate epithelial bending of the wing disc pouch. Surprisingly, acute pharmacological inhibition of ROCK-driven actomyosin contractility does not impact the maintenance of tissue height or curved shape. Computational simulations show that ECM tautness provides only a minor contribution to modulating tissue shape. Instead, passive ECM pre-strain serves to maintain the shape independent from actomyosin contractility. These results provide general insight into how the subcellular forces are generated and maintained within individual cells to induce tissue curvature. Thus, the results suggest an important design principle of separable contributions from ECM prestrain and actomyosin tension during epithelial organogenesis and homeostasis.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/LhJdXPmSWBs&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Early exposure to broadly neutralizing antibodies may trigger a dynamical switch from progressive disease to lasting control of SHIV infection</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/rgRAYva8jdg/article</link>

Antiretroviral therapy (ART) for HIV-1 infection is life-long. Stopping therapy typically leads to the reignition of infection and progressive disease. In a major breakthrough, recent studies have shown that early initiation of ART can lead to sustained post-treatment control of viremia, raising hopes of long-term HIV-1 remission. ART, however, elicits post-treatment control in a small fraction of individuals treated. Strikingly, passive immunization with broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) of HIV-1 early in infection was found recently to elicit long-term control in a majority of SHIV-infected macaques, suggesting that HIV-1 remission may be more widely achievable. The mechanisms underlying the control elicited by bNAb therapy, however, remain unclear. Untreated infection typically leads to progressive disease. We hypothesized that viremic control represents an alternative but rarely realized outcome of the infection and that early bNAb therapy triggers a dynamical switch to this outcome. To test this hypothesis, we constructed a model of viral dynamics with bNAb therapy and applied it to analyse clinical data. The model fit quantitatively the complex longitudinal viral load data from macaques that achieved lasting control. The model predicted, consistently with our hypothesis, that the underlying system exhibited bistability, indicating two potential outcomes of infection. The first had high viremia, weak cytotoxic effector responses, and high effector exhaustion, marking progressive disease. The second had low viremia, strong effector responses, and low effector exhaustion, indicating lasting viremic control. Further, model predictions suggest that early bNAb therapy elicited lasting control via pleiotropic effects. bNAb therapy lowers viremia, which would also limit immune exhaustion. Simultaneously, it can improve effector stimulation via cross-presentation. Consequently, viremia may resurge post-therapy, but would encounter a primed effector population and eventually get controlled. ART suppresses viremia but does not enhance effector stimulation, explaining its limited ability to elicit post-treatment control relative to bNAb therapy.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/rgRAYva8jdg&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Biology: Klf5 down-regulation induces vascular senescence through eIF5a depletion and mitochondrial fission</title>

Although dysregulation of mitochondrial dynamics has been linked to cellular senescence, which contributes to advanced age-related disorders, it is unclear how Krüppel-like factor 5 (Klf5), an essential transcriptional factor of cardiovascular remodeling, mediates the link between mitochondrial dynamics and vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) senescence. Here, we show that Klf5 down-regulation in VSMCs is correlated with rupture of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA), an age-related vascular disease. Mice lacking Klf5 in VSMCs exacerbate vascular senescence and progression of angiotensin II (Ang II)–induced AAA by facilitating reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation. Klf5 knockdown enhances, while Klf5 overexpression suppresses mitochondrial fission. Mechanistically, Klf5 activates eukaryotic translation initiation factor 5a (eIF5a) transcription through binding to the promoter of eIF5a, which in turn preserves mitochondrial integrity by interacting with mitofusin 1 (Mfn1). Accordingly, decreased expression of eIF5a elicited by Klf5 down-regulation leads to mitochondrial fission and excessive ROS production. Inhibition of mitochondrial fission decreases ROS production and VSMC senescence. Our studies provide a potential therapeutic target for age-related vascular disorders.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/oIAVlUnNIbk&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

&lt;p&gt;We used multiple methods for examining the arginine vasotocin (AVT) system in female African cichlid fish &lt;i&gt;Astatotilapia burtoni&lt;/i&gt;. AVT‐ir cell size varied with female reproductive state in a cell type‐dependent manner. Ovulated females had larger magnocellular and gigantocelluar cells than brooding females, and gigantocellular AVT‐ir cell size correlated with the number of days brooding. Overall, our data indicate that AVT neurons change across the reproductive cycle in female fishes, similar to that seen in males.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nonapeptides play a crucial role in mediating reproduction, aggression, and parental care across taxa. In fishes, &lt;i&gt;arginine vasotocin&lt;/i&gt; (AVT) expression is related to social and/or reproductive status in most male fishes studied to date, and is linked to territorial defense, paternal care, and courtship. Despite a plethora of studies examining AVT in male fishes, relatively little is known about how AVT expression varies with female reproductive state or its role in female social behaviors. We used multiple methods for examining the AVT system in female African cichlid fish &lt;i&gt;Astatotilapia burtoni&lt;/i&gt;, including immunohistochemistry for AVT, in situ hybridization for &lt;i&gt;avt&lt;/i&gt;‐mRNA, and quantitative PCR. Ovulated and mouthbrooding females had similar numbers of parvocellular, magnocellular, and gigantocellular AVT cells in the preoptic area. However, ovulated females had larger magnocellular and gigantocellular cells compared to mouthbrooding females, and gigantocellular AVT cell size correlated with the number of days brooding, such that late‐stage brooding females had larger AVT cells than mid‐stage brooding females. In addition, we found that ventral hypothalamic cells were more prominent in females compared to males, and were larger in mouthbrooding compared to ovulated females, suggesting a role in maternal care. Together, these data indicate that AVT neurons change across the reproductive cycle in female fishes, similar to that seen in males. These data on females complement studies in male &lt;i&gt;A&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;burtoni&lt;/i&gt;, providing a comprehensive picture of the regulation and potential function of different AVT cell types in reproduction and social behaviors in both sexes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Hippocampus: Hebbian and non‐Hebbian timing‐dependent plasticity in the hippocampal CA3 region</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/hipo.23252?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The timing between synaptic inputs has been proposed to play a role in the induction of plastic changes that enable neural circuits to store information. In the case of spike timing‐dependent plasticity (STDP), this relates to the interval between a synaptic input and a postsynaptic spike, thus providing a conceptual link to the Hebb learning rule. Experiments have documented STDP in many synapses and brain regions, and computational models have tested its utility in many neural network functions. However, questions remain about whether timing plays a role in plasticity during natural activity, and whether it can function in information storage. The present study used imaging with voltage sensitive dye to investigate the effectiveness of input timing in the plasticity of responses in the CA3 region of hippocampal slices. Plasticity was induced by sequential dual‐site stimulation at 10 ms intervals of either synaptic inputs and cell bodies (synaptic–somatic induction) or of two sets of synaptic inputs (synaptic–synaptic induction). Both protocols potentiated responses, with greater potentiation of responses to the first stimulation of the sequence than the second. Neither of these protocols induced depression. Synaptic–somatic stimulation was much more effective than synaptic–synaptic stimulation in evoking somatic action potentials, but both protocols potentiated responses equally well. This suggests that sequential dual‐site stimulation can potentiate equally well with very different degrees of somatic action potential firing. With synaptic–somatic induction, potentiation was focused at the sites of stimulation. In contrast, with synaptic–synaptic induction, the distribution of potentiation varied greatly. Changes in the spatial distribution of responses indicated that sequential dual‐site stimulation functions poorly in the storage of activity patterns. These results suggest that in the hippocampal CA3 region, timed sequential activation of two inputs is less effective than theta bursts, both in the induction of LTP and in the storage of information.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience Research: Beyond barrier functions: Roles of pericytes in homeostasis and regulation of neuroinflammation</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jnr.24715?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pericytes are contractile cells that extend along the vasculature to mediate key homeostatic functions of endothelial barriers within the body. In the central nervous system (CNS), pericytes are important contributors to the structure and function of the neurovascular unit, which includes endothelial cells, astrocytes and neurons. The understanding of pericytes has been marred by an inability to accurately distinguish pericytes from other stromal cells with similar expression of identifying markers. Evidence is now growing in favor of pericytes being actively involved in both CNS homeostasis and pathology of neurological diseases, including multiple sclerosis, spinal cord injury, and Alzheimer's disease among others. In this review, we discuss the current understanding on the characterization of pericytes, their roles in maintaining the integrity of the blood–brain barrier, and their contributions to neuroinflammation and neurorepair. Owing to its plethora of surface receptors, pericytes respond to inflammatory mediators such as CCL2 (monocyte chemoattractant protein‐1) and tumor necrosis factor‐α, in turn secreting CCL2, nitric oxide, and several cytokines. Pericytes can therefore act as promoters of both the innate and adaptive arms of the immune system. Much like professional phagocytes, pericytes also have the ability to clear up cellular debris and macromolecular plaques. Moreover, pericytes promote the activities of CNS glia, including in maturation of oligodendrocyte lineage cells for myelination. Conversely, pericytes can impair regenerative processes by contributing to scar formation. A better characterization of CNS pericytes and their functions would bode well for therapeutics aimed at alleviating their undesirable properties and enhancing their benefits.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Understanding the Pathophysiological Actions of Tau Oligomers: A Critical Review of Current Electrophysiological Approaches</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2020.00155</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Tau is a predominantly neuronal protein that is normally bound to microtubules, where it acts to modulate neuronal and axonal stability. In humans, pathological forms of tau are implicated in a range of diseases that are collectively known as tauopathies. Kinases and phosphatases are responsible for maintaining the correct balance of tau phosphorylation to enable axons to be both stable and labile enough to function properly. In the early stages of tauopathies, this balance is interrupted leading to dissociation of tau from microtubules. This leaves microtubules prone to damage and phosphorylated tau prone to aggregation. Initially, phosphorylated tau forms oligomers, then fibrils, and ultimately neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs). It is widely accepted that the initial soluble oligomeric forms of tau are probably the most pathologically relevant species but there is relatively little quantitative information to explain exactly what their toxic effects are at the individual neuron level. Electrophysiology provides a valuable tool to help uncover the mechanisms of action of tau oligomers on synaptic transmission within single neurons. Understanding the concentration-, time-, and neuronal compartment-dependent actions of soluble tau oligomers on neuronal and synaptic properties are essential to understanding how best to counteract its effects and to develop effective treatment strategies. Here, we briefly discuss the standard approaches used to elucidate these actions, focusing on the advantages and shortcomings of the experimental procedures. Subsequently, we will describe a new approach that addresses specific challenges with the current methods, thus allowing real-time toxicity evaluation at the single-neuron level.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Activation of Type 4 Metabotropic Glutamate Receptor Regulates Proliferation and Neuronal Differentiation in a Cultured Rat Retinal Progenitor Cell Through the Suppression of the cAMP/PTEN/AKT Pathway</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2020.00141</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Retinal progenitor cells (RPCs) remain in the eye throughout life and can be characterized by their ability for self-renewal as well as their specialization into different cell types. A recent study has suggested that metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) participate in the processes of multiple types of stem cells. Therefore, clarifying the functions of different subtypes of mGluRs in RPCs may provide a novel treatment strategy for regulating the proliferation and differentiation of endogenous RPCs after retinal degeneration. In this study, we observed that mGluR4 was functionally expressed in RPCs, with an effect on cell viability and intracellular cAMP concentration. The activation of mGluR4 by VU0155041 (VU, mGluR4 positive allosteric selective modulator) reduced the number of BrdU&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/Pax6&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; double-positive cells and Cyclin D1 expression levels while increasing the number of neuron-specific class III beta-tubulin (Tuj1)- and Doublecortin (DCX)-positive cells. The knockdown of mGluR4 by target-specific siRNA abolished the effects of VU on RPC proliferation and neuronal differentiation. Further investigation demonstrated that mGluR4 activation inhibited AKT phosphorylation and up-regulated PTEN protein expression. Moreover, the VU0155041-induced inhibition of proliferation and enhancement of neuronal differentiation in RPCs were significantly hampered by Forskolin (adenylyl cyclase activator) and VO-OHpic trihydrate (PTEN inhibitor). In contrast, the effect of LY294002 (a highly selective Akt inhibitor) on proliferation and differentiation was similar to that of VU. These results indicate that mGluR4 activation can suppress proliferation and promote the neural differentiation of cultured rat RPCs through the cAMP/PTEN/AKT pathway. Our research lays the foundation for further pharmacological work exploring a novel potential therapy for several retinal diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Integrative Neuroscience: Neurophysiological and Genetic Findings in Patients With Juvenile Myoclonic Epilepsy</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnint.2020.00045</link>
	<content:encoded>Objective&lt;p&gt;Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), a non-invasive procedure, stimulates the cortex evaluating the central motor pathways. The response is called motor evoked potential (MEP). Polyphasia results when the response crosses the baseline more than twice (zero crossing). Recent research shows MEP polyphasia in patients with generalized genetic epilepsy (GGE) and their first-degree relatives compared with controls. Juvenile Myoclonic Epilepsy (JME), a GGE type, is not well studied regarding polyphasia. In our study, we assessed polyphasia appearance probability with TMS in JME patients, their healthy first-degree relatives and controls. Two genetic approaches were applied to uncover genetic association with polyphasia.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;20 JME patients, 23 first-degree relatives and 30 controls underwent TMS, obtaining 10–15 MEPs per participant. We evaluated MEP mean number of phases, proportion of MEP trials displaying polyphasia for each subject and variability between groups. Participants underwent whole exome sequencing (WES) via trio-based analysis and two-case scenario. Extensive bioinformatics analysis was applied.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;We identified increased polyphasia in patients (85%) and relatives (70%) compared to controls (47%) and significantly higher mean number of zero crossings (i.e., occurrence of phases) (patients 1.49, relatives 1.46, controls 1.22; p &amp;lt; 0.05). Trio-based analysis revealed a candidate polymorphism, p.Glu270del,in SYT14 (Synaptotagmin 14), in JME patients and their relatives presenting polyphasia. Sanger sequencing analysis in remaining participants showed no significant association. In two-case scenario, a machine learning approach was applied in variants identified from odds ratio analysis and risk prediction scores were obtained for polyphasia. The results revealed 61 variants of which none was associated with polyphasia. Risk prediction scores indeed showed lower probability for non-polyphasic subjects on having polyphasia and higher probability for polyphasic subjects on having polyphasia.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;Polyphasia was present in JME patients and relatives in contrast to controls. Although no known clinical symptoms are linked to polyphasia this neurophysiological phenomenon is likely due to common cerebral electrophysiological abnormality. We did not discover direct association between genetic variants obtained and polyphasia. It is likely these genetic traits alone cannot provoke polyphasia, however, this predisposition combined with disturbed brain-electrical activity and tendency to generate seizures may increase the risk of developing polyphasia, mainly in patients and relatives.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Novel Therapeutic Approaches for the Treatment of Retinal Degenerative Diseases: Focus on CRISPR/Cas-Based Gene Editing</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00838</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Inherited retinal diseases encompass a highly heterogenous group of disorders caused by a wide range of genetic variants and with diverse clinical symptoms that converge in the common trait of retinal degeneration. Indeed, mutations in over 270 genes have been associated with some form of retinal degenerative phenotype. Given the immune privileged status of the eye, cell replacement and gene augmentation therapies have been envisioned. While some of these approaches, such as delivery of genes through recombinant adeno-associated viral vectors, have been successfully tested in clinical trials, not all patients will benefit from current advancements due to their underlying genotype or phenotypic traits. Gene editing arises as an alternative therapeutic strategy seeking to correct mutations at the endogenous locus and rescue normal gene expression. Hence, gene editing technologies can in principle be tailored for treating retinal degeneration. Here we provide an overview of the different gene editing strategies that are being developed to overcome the challenges imposed by the post-mitotic nature of retinal cell types. We further discuss their advantages and drawbacks as well as the hurdles for their implementation in treating retinal diseases, which include the broad range of mutations and, in some instances, the size of the affected genes. Although therapeutic gene editing is at an early stage of development, it has the potential of enriching the portfolio of personalized molecular medicines directed at treating genetic diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neural Technology: EEG Changes in Time and Time-Frequency Domain During Movement Preparation and Execution in Stroke Patients</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00827</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;This study investigated electroencephalogram (EEG) changes during movement preparation and execution in stroke patients. EEG-based event-related potential (ERP) technology was used to measure brain activity changes. Seventeen stroke patients participated in this study and completed ERP tests that were designed to measure EEG changes during unilateral upper limb movements in preparation and execution stages, with Instruction Response Movement (IRM) and Cued Instruction Response Movement (CIRM) paradigms. EEG data were analyzed using motor potential (MP) in the time domain and the mu-rhythm and beta frequency band response mean value (R-means) in the time–frequency domain. In IRM, the MP amplitude at Cz was higher during hemiplegic arm movement than during unaffected arm movement. MP latency was shorter at Cz and the contralesional motor cortex during hemiplegic arm movement in CIRM compared to IRM. No significant differences were found in R-means among locations, between movement sides in both ERP tests. This study presents the brain activity changes in the time and time–frequency domains in stroke patients during movement preparation and execution and supports the contralesional compensation and adjacent-region compensation mechanism of post-stroke brain reconstruction. These findings may contribute to future rehabilitation research about neuroplasticity and technology development such as the brain–computer interface.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Mitochondrial Function in Hereditary Spastic Paraplegia: Deficits in SPG7 but Not SPAST Patient-Derived Stem Cells</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00820</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Mutations in SPG7 and SPAST are common causes of hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP). While some SPG7 mutations cause paraplegin deficiency, other SPG7 mutations cause increased paraplegin expression. Mitochondrial function has been studied in models that are paraplegin-deficient (human, mouse, and Drosophila models with large exonic deletions, null mutations, or knockout models) but not in models of mutations that express paraplegin. Here, we evaluated mitochondrial function in olfactory neurosphere-derived cells, derived from patients with a variety of SPG7 mutations that express paraplegin and compared them to cells derived from healthy controls and HSP patients with SPAST mutations, as a disease control. We quantified paraplegin expression and an extensive range of mitochondrial morphology measures (fragmentation, interconnectivity, and mass), mitochondrial function measures (membrane potential, oxidative phosphorylation, and oxidative stress), and cell proliferation. Compared to control cells, SPG7 patient cells had increased paraplegin expression, fragmented mitochondria with low interconnectivity, reduced mitochondrial mass, decreased mitochondrial membrane potential, reduced oxidative phosphorylation, reduced ATP content, increased mitochondrial oxidative stress, and reduced cellular proliferation. Mitochondrial dysfunction was specific to SPG7 patient cells and not present in SPAST patient cells, which displayed mitochondrial functions similar to control cells. The mitochondrial dysfunction observed here in SPG7 patient cells that express paraplegin was similar to the dysfunction reported in cell models without paraplegin expression. The p.A510V mutation was common to all patients and was the likely species associated with increased expression, albeit seemingly non-functional. The lack of a mitochondrial phenotype in SPAST patient cells indicates genotype-specific mechanisms of disease in these HSP patients.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroinformatics: Development and Reorganization of Orientation Representation in the Cat Visual Cortex: Experience-Dependent Synaptic Rewiring in Early Life</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fninf.2020.00041</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;To date, numerous mathematical models have been proposed on the basis of some types of Hebbian synaptic learning to account for the activity-dependent development of orientation maps as well as neuronal orientation selectivity. These models successfully reproduced orientation map-like spatial patterns. Nevertheless, we still have questions: (1) How does synaptic rewiring occur in the visual cortex during the formation of orderly orientation maps in early life? (2) How does visual experience contribute to the maturation of orientation selectivity of visual cortical neurons and reorganize orientation maps? (3) How does the sensitive period for orientation plasticity end? In this study, we performed animal experiments and mathematical modeling to understand the mechanisms underlying synaptic rewiring for experience-dependent formation and reorganization of orientation maps. At first, we visualized orientation maps from the intrinsic signal optical imaging in area 17 of kittens reared under single-orientation exposure through cylindrical-lens-fitted goggles. The experiments revealed that the degree of expansion of cortical domains representing the experienced orientation depends on the age at which the single-orientation exposure starts. As a result, we obtained the sensitive period profile for orientation plasticity. Next, we refined our previously proposed mathematical model for the activity-dependent self-organization of thalamo-cortical inputs on the assumption that rewiring is caused by the competitive interactions among transient synaptic contacts on the same dendritic spine. Although various kinds of molecules have been reported to be involved in such interactions, we attempt to build a mathematical model to describe synaptic rewiring focusing on brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and its related molecules. Performing computer simulations based on the refined model, we successfully reproduced orientation maps reorganized in kittens reared under single-orientation exposure as well as normal visual experience. We also reproduced the experimentally obtained sensitive period profile for orientation plasticity. The excellent agreement between experimental observations and theoretical reproductions suggests that the BDNF-induced competitive interaction among synaptic contacts from different axons on the same spine is an important factor for the experience-dependent formation and reorganization of orientation selectivity and orientation maps.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00307</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Objectives: To investigate the long-term effects on cognition and brain function after installing treadmill workstations in offices for 13 months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Eighty healthy overweight or obese office workers aged 40–67 years were individually randomized to an intervention group, receiving a treadmill workstation and encouraging emails, or to a control group, continuing to work as usual. Effects on cognitive function, hippocampal volume, prefrontal cortex (PFC) thickness, and circulating brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) were analyzed. Further, mediation analyses between changes in walking time and light-intensity physical activity (LPA) on changes in BDNF and hippocampal volume between baseline and 13 months, and multivariate analyses of the baseline data with percentage sitting time as the response variable, were performed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: No group by time interactions were observed for any of the outcomes. In the mediation analyses, positive associations between changes in walking time and LPA on changes in hippocampal volume were observed, although not mediated by changes in BDNF levels. In the multivariate analyses, a negative association between percentage sitting time and hippocampal volume was observed, however only among those older than 51 years of age.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: Although no group by time interactions were observed, our analyses suggest that increased walking and LPA may have positive effects on hippocampal volume and that sedentary behavior is associated with brain structures of importance for memory functions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trial Registration: www.ClinicalTrials.gov as NCT01997970.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Dynamic Responses of Microglia in Animal Models of Multiple Sclerosis</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00269</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Microglia play an essential role in maintaining central nervous system (CNS) homeostasis, as well as responding to injury and disease. Most neurological disorders feature microglial activation, a process whereby microglia undergo profound morphological and transcriptional changes aimed at containing CNS damage and promoting repair, but often resulting in overt inflammation that sustains and propagates the neurodegenerative process. This is especially evident in multiple sclerosis (MS), were microglial activation and microglia-driven neuroinflammation are considered key events in the onset, progression, and resolution of the disease. Our understanding of microglial functions in MS has widened exponentially in the last decade by way of new tools and markers to discriminate microglia from other myeloid populations. Consequently, the complex functional and phenotypical diversity of microglia can now be appreciated. This, in combination with a variety of animal models that mimic specific features and processes of MS, has contributed to filling the gap of knowledge in the cascade of events underlying MS pathophysiology. The purpose of this review is to present the most up to date knowledge of the dynamic responses of microglia in the commonly used animal models of MS, specifically the immune-mediated experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) model, and the chemically-induced cuprizone and lysolecithin models. Elucidating the spectrum of microglial functions in these models, from detrimental to protective, is essential to identify emerging targets for therapy and guide drug discovery efforts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00265</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Approximately one-third of childhood blindness is attributed to developmental eye disorders, of which 80% have a genetic cause. Eye morphogenesis is tightly regulated by a highly conserved network of transcription factors when disrupted by genetic mutations can result in severe ocular malformation. Human-induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) are an attractive tool to study early eye development as they are more physiologically relevant than animal models, can be patient-specific and their use does not elicit the ethical concerns associated with human embryonic stem cells. The generation of self-organizing hiPSC-derived optic cups is a major advancement to understanding mechanisms of ocular development and disease. Their development in vitro has been found to mirror that of the human eye and these early organoids have been used to effectively model microphthalmia caused by a VSX2 variant. hiPSC-derived optic cups, retina, and cornea organoids are powerful tools for future modeling of disease phenotypes and will enable a greater understanding of the pathophysiology of many other developmental eye disorders. These models will also provide an effective platform for identifying molecular therapeutic targets and for future clinical applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: The Role of Cold-Sensitive Ion Channels in Peripheral Thermosensation</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00262</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The detection of ambient cold is critical for mammals, who use this information to avoid tissue damage by cold and to maintain stable body temperature. The transduction of information about the environmental cold is mediated by cold-sensitive ion channels expressed in peripheral sensory nerve endings in the skin. Most transduction mechanisms for detecting temperature changes identified to date depend on transient receptor potential (TRP) ion channels. Mild cooling is detected by the menthol-sensitive TRPM8 ion channel, but how painful cold is detected remains unclear. The TRPA1 ion channel, which is activated by cold in expression systems, seemed to provide an answer to this question, but whether TRPA1 is activated by cold in neurons and contributes to the sensation of cold pain continues to be a matter of debate. Recent advances have been made in this area of investigation with the identification of several potential cold-sensitive ion channels in thermosensory neurons, including two-pore domain potassium channels (K2P), GluK2 glutamate receptors, and CNGA3 cyclic nucleotide-gated ion channels. This mini-review gives a brief overview of the way by which ion channels contribute to cold sensation, discusses the controversy around the cold-sensitivity of TRPA1, and provides an assessment of some recently-proposed novel cold-transduction mechanisms. Evidence for another unidentified cold-transduction mechanism is also presented.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnana.2020.00057</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Objective: To identify the novel projections received by the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)-contacting nucleus from the subcortex and limbic system to understand the biological functions of the nucleus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: The cholera toxin subunit B (CB), a retrograde tracer, was injected into the CSF-contacting nucleus in Sprague–Dawley rats. After 7–10 days, the surviving rats were perfused, and the whole brain and spinal cord were sliced for CB immunofluorescence detection. The CB-positive neurons in the subcortex and limbic system were observed under a fluorescence microscope, followed by 3D reconstructed with the imaris software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: CB-positive neurons were found in the basal forebrain, septum, periventricular organs, preoptic area, and amygdaloid structures. Five functional areas including 46 sub-regions sent projections to the CSF-contacting nucleus. However, the projections had different densities, ranging from sparse to moderate, to dense.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: According to the projections from the subcortex and limbic system, we hypothesize that the CSF-contacting nucleus participates in emotion, cognition, homeostasis regulation, visceral activity, pain, and addiction. In this study, we illustrate the novel projections from the subcortex and limbic system to the CSF-contacting nucleus, which underlies the diverse and complicated circuits of the nucleus in body regulations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Determinants of Quality of Life According to Cognitive Status in Parkinson’s Disease</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00269</link>
	<content:encoded>Background&lt;p&gt;Quality of life (QoL) was worse in Parkinson’s disease patients with mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI) or dementia (PDD) than PD patients with normal cognition (PD-NC). The aim of this study was to investigate and compare the potential heterogeneous determinants of QoL in PD patients with different cognitive statuses.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;We recruited 600 PD patients, including 185 PD-NC patients, 336 PD-MCI patients and 79 PDD patients, in this cross-sectional study. All patients completed the QoL assessment by the 39-item Parkinson’s Disease Questionnaire (PDQ-39), as well as clinical evaluations and neuropsychological tests. The determinants of the QoL were analyzed by multiple stepwise regression analysis.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;QoL was more impaired across the three groups (PD-NC &amp;lt; PD-MCI &amp;lt; PDD). The Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale part III (UPDRS-III) score, Geriatric Depression Rating Scale (GDS) score and daily levodopa equivalent dose (LED) were independent variables of PDQ-39 in PD-NC patients. The GDS score, disease duration, UPDRS-III score, Epworth Sleepiness Score (ESS) and sex were independent variables of PDQ-39 in PD-MCI patients. The GDS score and disease duration were independent variables of PDQ-39 in PDD patients.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;The determinants of QoL in PD-NC, PD-MCI and PDD patients were heterogeneous. Motor function was considered to be the most crucial determinant for QoL in PD-NC, while depression was indicated to be the most vital determinant for PD-MCI and PDD. For QoL improvement, clinicians might need to focus more on motor function in PD-NC patients and on depression in PD-MCI and PDD patients.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Mitochondrial Dysfunction and Alzheimer’s Disease: Role of Microglia</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00252</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In 1907, Alois Alzheimer observed, as he quoted, development of “numerous fibers” and “adipose saccules” in the brain of his diseased patient Auguste Deter. The neurodegenerative disease became known as Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and is the most common cause of dementia worldwide. AD normally develops with aging and is mostly initiated because of the imbalance between the formation and clearance of amyloid-β (Aβ). Formation of neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) of hyperphosphorylated tau is another hallmark of AD. Neuroinflammation plays a significant role in the development and pathology of AD. This chapter explores the role of mitochondrial dysfunction in microglia in case of AD. Mitochondrial oxidative stress in microglia has been linked to the development of AD. Elevated generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and loss of mitochondrial membrane potential through various mechanisms have been observed in AD. Aβ interacts with microglial receptors, such as triggering receptor expressed in myeloid cells 2 (TREM2), activating downstream pathways causing mitochondrial damage and aggravating inflammation and cytotoxicity. Fibrillar Aβ activates nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase in microglia leading to elevated induction of mitochondrial ROS which further causes neurotoxicity. Elevated ROS in microglia causes activation of inflammatory and cell death pathways. Production of ATP, regulation of mitochondrial health, autophagy, and mitophagy in microglia play significant roles in the AD pathology. Understanding microglial physiology and mitochondrial dysfunction will enable better therapeutic interventions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Dynamic estimation of auditory temporal response functions via state-space models with Gaussian mixture process noise</title>

Estimating the latent dynamics underlying biological processes is a central problem in computational biology. State-space models with Gaussian statistics are widely used for estimation of such latent dynamics and have been successfully utilized in the analysis of biological data. Gaussian statistics, however, fail to capture several key features of the dynamics of biological processes (e.g., brain dynamics) such as abrupt state changes and exogenous processes that affect the states in a structured fashion. Although Gaussian mixture process noise models have been considered as an alternative to capture such effects, data-driven inference of their parameters is not well-established in the literature. The objective of this paper is to develop efficient algorithms for inferring the parameters of a general class of Gaussian mixture process noise models from noisy and limited observations, and to utilize them in extracting the neural dynamics that underlie auditory processing from magnetoencephalography (MEG) data in a cocktail party setting. We develop an algorithm based on Expectation-Maximization to estimate the process noise parameters from state-space observations. We apply our algorithm to simulated and experimentally-recorded MEG data from auditory experiments in the cocktail party paradigm to estimate the underlying dynamic Temporal Response Functions (TRFs). Our simulation results show that the richer representation of the process noise as a Gaussian mixture significantly improves state estimation and capturing the heterogeneity of the TRF dynamics. Application to MEG data reveals improvements over existing TRF estimation techniques, and provides a reliable alternative to current approaches for probing neural dynamics in a cocktail party scenario, as well as attention decoding in emerging applications such as smart hearing aids. Our proposed methodology provides a framework for efficient inference of Gaussian mixture process noise models, with application to a wide range of biological data with underlying heterogeneous and latent dynamics.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Z3L-FPE_fPY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Visually inferring material properties is crucial for many tasks, yet poses significant computational challenges for biological vision. Liquids and gels are particularly challenging due to their extreme variability and complex behaviour. We reasoned that measuring and modelling viscosity perception is a useful case study for identifying general principles of complex visual inferences. In recent years, artificial Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have yielded breakthroughs in challenging real-world vision tasks. However, to model human vision, the emphasis lies not on best possible performance, but on mimicking the specific pattern of successes and errors humans make. We trained a DNN to estimate the viscosity of liquids using 100.000 simulations depicting liquids with sixteen different viscosities interacting in ten different scenes (stirring, pouring, splashing, etc). We find that a shallow feedforward network trained for only 30 epochs predicts mean observer performance better than most individual observers. This is the first successful image-computable model of human viscosity perception. Further training improved accuracy, but predicted human perception less well. We analysed the network’s features using representational similarity analysis (RSA) and a range of image descriptors (e.g. optic flow, colour saturation, GIST). This revealed clusters of units sensitive to specific classes of feature. We also find a distinct population of units that are poorly explained by hand-engineered features, but which are particularly important both for physical viscosity estimation, and for the specific pattern of human responses. The final layers represent many distinct stimulus characteristics—not just viscosity, which the network was trained on. Retraining the fully-connected layer with a reduced number of units achieves practically identical performance, but results in representations focused on viscosity, suggesting that network capacity is a crucial parameter determining whether artificial or biological neural networks use distributed vs. localized representations.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/CX0itcUkkbU&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Alexander Woglar, Kei Yamaya, Baptiste Roelens, Alistair Boettiger, Simone Köhler, Anne M. Villeneuve&lt;/p&gt;

During meiosis, chromosomes adopt a specialized organization involving assembly of a cohesin-based axis along their lengths, with DNA loops emanating from this axis. We applied novel, quantitative, and widely applicable cytogenetic strategies to elucidate the molecular bases of this organization using &lt;i&gt;Caenorhabditis elegans&lt;/i&gt;. Analyses of wild-type (WT) chromosomes and de novo circular minichromosomes revealed that meiosis-specific HORMA-domain proteins assemble into cohorts in defined numbers and co-organize the axis together with 2 functionally distinct cohesin complexes (REC-8 and COH-3/4) in defined stoichiometry. We further found that REC-8 cohesins, which load during S phase and mediate sister-chromatid cohesion, usually occur as individual complexes, supporting a model wherein sister cohesion is mediated locally by a single cohesin ring. REC-8 complexes are interspersed in an alternating pattern with cohorts of axis-organizing COH-3/4 complexes (averaging 3 per cohort), which are insufficient to confer cohesion but can bind to individual chromatids, suggesting a mechanism to enable formation of asymmetric sister-chromatid loops. Indeed, immunofluorescence fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) assays demonstrate frequent asymmetry in genomic content between the loops formed on sister chromatids. We discuss how features of chromosome axis/loop architecture inferred from our data can help to explain enigmatic, yet essential, aspects of the meiotic program.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/dEDkOdULF6w&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Ivanova et al&lt;/i&gt;. use sparse labeling of mural cells in the retina to identify pericyte diversity and to selectively manipulate capillary blood flow

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pericytes are a unique class of mural cells essential for angiogenesis, maintenance of the vasculature and are key players in microvascular pathology. However, their diversity and specific roles are poorly understood, limiting our insight into vascular physiology and the ability to develop effective therapies. Here, in the mouse retina, a tractable model of the CNS, we evaluated distinct classes of mural cells along the vascular tree for both structural characterization and physiological manipulation of blood flow. To accomplish this, we first tested three inducible mural cell‐specific mouse lines using a sensitive Ai14 reporter and tamoxifen application either by a systemic injection, or by local administration in the form of eye drops. The specificity and pattern of cre activation varied significantly across the three lines, under either the PDGFRβ or NG2 promoter (Pdgfrβ‐CreRha, Pdgfrβ‐CreCsln, Cspg4‐Cre). In particular, a mouse line with Cre under the NG2 promoter resulted in sparse TdTomato labeling of mural cells, allowing for an unambiguous characterization of anatomical features of individual sphincter cells and capillary pericytes. Furthermore, in one PDGFRβ line, we found that focal eye drop application of tamoxifen led to an exclusive Cre‐activation in pericytes, without affecting arterial mural cells. We then used this approach to boost capillary blood flow by selective expression of Halorhodopsin, a highly precise hyperpolarizing optogenetic actuator. The ability to exclusively target capillary pericytes may prove a precise and potentially powerful tool to treat microcirculation deficits, a common pathology in numerous diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

&lt;p&gt;The activity of PXT864, a combination of acamprosate and baclofen, was assessed in cellular models relevant for ALS disease. PXT864 protected neuro muscular junctions in co‐cultures of primary rat neurons and human muscle cells, as well as motoneurons derived from SOD1&lt;sup&gt;G93A&lt;/sup&gt; rodents against glutamate toxicity. When combined with riluzole, PXT864 exerted larger protective effects, highlighting the potential use of PXT864 with the standard of care. Importantly, PXT864 reduced TDP‐43 toxic accumulation in cells after insulting stimuli such as glutamate or oxidative stress inducers. An improved maturity of cultured primary SOD1&lt;sup&gt;G93A&lt;/sup&gt; motoneurons was also found after PXT864 treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is currently no therapy impacting the course of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). The only approved treatments are riluzole and edaravone, but their efficacy is modest and short‐lasting, highlighting the need for innovative therapies. We previously demonstrated the ability of PXT864, a combination of low doses of acamprosate and baclofen, to synergistically restore cellular and behavioral activity in Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease models. The overlapping genetic, molecular, and cellular characteristics of these neurodegenerative diseases supported investigating the effectiveness of PXT864 in ALS. As neuromuscular junction (NMJ) alterations is a key feature of ALS, the effects of PXT864 in primary neuron‐muscle cocultures injured by glutamate were studied. PXT864 significantly and synergistically preserved NMJ and motoneuron integrity following glutamate excitotoxicity. PXT864 added to riluzole significantly improved such protection. PXT864 activity was then assessed in primary cultures of motoneurons derived from SOD1&lt;sup&gt;G93A&lt;/sup&gt; rat embryos. These motoneurons presented severe maturation defects that were significantly improved by PXT864. In this model, glutamate application induced an accumulation of TDP‐43 protein in the cytoplasm, a hallmark that was completely prevented by PXT864. The anti‐TDP‐43 aggregation effect was also confirmed in a cell line expressing TDP‐43 fused to GFP. These results demonstrate the value of PXT864 as a promising therapeutic strategy for the treatment of ALS.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

&lt;p&gt;Immunohistochemical staining for parvalbumin reveals the various nuclei of the superior olivary complex and trapezoid body within the brain of the African wild dog. We could identify the medial and lateral superior olivary nuclei, the superior, medioventral, and lateroventral periolivary nuclei, the nucleus of the trapezoid body (Tz), and the fiber bundles forming the trapezoid body (tz). Scale bar = 1 mm.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The large external pinnae and extensive vocal repertoire of the African wild dog (&lt;i&gt;Lycaon pictus&lt;/i&gt;) has led to the assumption that the auditory system of this unique canid may be specialized. Here, using cytoarchitecture, myeloarchitecture, and a range of immunohistochemical stains, we describe the systems‐level anatomy of the auditory system of the African wild dog. We observed the cochlear nuclear complex, superior olivary nuclear complex, lateral lemniscus, inferior colliculus, medial geniculate body, and auditory cortex all being in their expected locations, and exhibiting the standard subdivisions of this system. While located in the ectosylvian gyri, the auditory cortex includes several areas, resembling the parcellation observed in cats and ferrets, although not all of the auditory areas known from these species could be identified in the African wild dog. These observations suggest that, broadly speaking, the systems‐level anatomy of the auditory system, and by extension the processing of auditory information, within the brain of the African wild dog closely resembles that observed in other carnivores. Our findings indicate that it is likely that the extraction of the semantic content of the vocalizations of African wild dogs, and the behaviors generated, occurs beyond the classically defined auditory system, in limbic or association neocortical regions involved in cognitive functions. Thus, to obtain a deeper understanding of how auditory stimuli are processed, and how communication is achieved, in the African wild dog compared to other canids, cortical regions beyond the primary sensory areas will need to be examined in detail.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: The CNS Myelin Proteome: Deep Profile and Persistence After Post-mortem Delay</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00239</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Myelin membranes are dominated by lipids while the complexity of their protein composition has long been considered to be low. However, numerous additional myelin proteins have been identified since. Here we revisit the proteome of myelin biochemically purified from the brains of healthy c56Bl/6N-mice utilizing complementary proteomic approaches for deep qualitative and quantitative coverage. By gel-free, label-free mass spectrometry, the most abundant myelin proteins PLP, MBP, CNP, and MOG constitute 38, 30, 5, and 1% of the total myelin protein, respectively. The relative abundance of myelin proteins displays a dynamic range of over four orders of magnitude, implying that PLP and MBP have overshadowed less abundant myelin constituents in initial gel-based approaches. By comparisons with published datasets we evaluate to which degree the CNS myelin proteome correlates with the mRNA and protein abundance profiles of myelin and oligodendrocytes. Notably, the myelin proteome displays only minor changes if assessed after a post-mortem delay of 6 h. These data provide the most comprehensive proteome resource of CNS myelin so far and a basis for addressing proteomic heterogeneity of myelin in mouse models and human patients with white matter disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>The evolutionary expansion of the mammalian neocortex is widely considered to be a basis of increased cognitive abilities. This expansion is a consequence of the enhanced production of neurons during the fetal/embryonic development of the neocortex, which in turn reflects an increased proliferative capacity of neural progenitor cells; in particular basal progenitors (BPs). The remarkable heterogeneity of BP subtypes across mammals, notably their various morphotypes and molecular fingerprints, which has recently been revealed, corroborates the importance of BPs for neocortical expansion.</content:encoded>

Listening in challenging situations, or when the auditory system is damaged, strains cortical resources, and this may change how the brain responds to cognitively demanding situations more generally. We review the effects of ARHL on brain areas involved in speech perception, from the auditory cortex, through attentional networks, to the motor system.</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Understanding multivariate brain activity: Evaluating the effect of voxelwise noise correlations on population codes in functional magnetic resonance imaging</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/7PQVk9e8O_U/article</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Ru-Yuan Zhang, Xue-Xin Wei, Kendrick Kay&lt;/p&gt;

Previous studies in neurophysiology have shown that neurons exhibit trial-by-trial correlated activity and that such noise correlations (NCs) greatly impact the accuracy of population codes. Meanwhile, multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) has become a mainstream approach in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), but it remains unclear how NCs between voxels influence MVPA performance. Here, we tackle this issue by combining voxel-encoding modeling and MVPA. We focus on a well-established form of NC, tuning-compatible noise correlation (TCNC), whose sign and magnitude are systematically related to the tuning similarity between two units. We show that this form of voxelwise NCs can improve MVPA performance if NCs are sufficiently strong. We also confirm these results using standard information-theoretic analyses in computational neuroscience. In the same theoretical framework, we further demonstrate that the effects of noise correlations at both the neuronal level and the voxel level may manifest differently in typical fMRI data, and their effects are modulated by tuning heterogeneity. Our results provide a theoretical foundation to understand the effect of correlated activity on population codes in macroscopic fMRI data. Our results also suggest that future fMRI research could benefit from a closer examination of the correlational structure of multivariate responses, which is not directly revealed by conventional MVPA approaches.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/7PQVk9e8O_U&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Modeling microbial cross-feeding at intermediate scale portrays community dynamics and species coexistence</title>

Social interaction between microbes can be described at many levels of details: from the biochemistry of cell-cell interactions to the ecological dynamics of populations. Choosing an appropriate level to model microbial communities without losing generality remains a challenge. Here we show that modeling cross-feeding interactions at an intermediate level between genome-scale metabolic models of individual species and consumer-resource models of ecosystems is suitable to experimental data. We applied our modeling framework to three published examples of multi-strain &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; communities with increasing complexity: uni-, bi-, and multi-directional cross-feeding of either substitutable metabolic byproducts or essential nutrients. The intermediate-scale model accurately fit empirical data and quantified metabolic exchange rates that are hard to measure experimentally, even for a complex community of 14 amino acid auxotrophies. By studying the conditions of species coexistence, the ecological outcomes of cross-feeding interactions, and each community’s robustness to perturbations, we extracted new quantitative insights from these three published experimental datasets. Our analysis provides a foundation to quantify cross-feeding interactions from experimental data, and highlights the importance of metabolic exchanges in the dynamics and stability of microbial communities.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/WgFVhHNcU5g&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Standard treatment for active tuberculosis (TB) requires drug treatment with at least four drugs over six months. Shorter-duration therapy would mean less need for strict adherence, and reduced risk of bacterial resistance. A system pharmacology model of TB infection, and drug therapy was developed and used to simulate the outcome of different drug therapy scenarios. The model incorporated human immune response, granuloma lesions, multi-drug antimicrobial chemotherapy, and bacterial resistance. A dynamic population pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) simulation model including rifampin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol was developed and parameters aligned with previous experimental data. Population therapy outcomes for simulations were found to be generally consistent with summary results from previous clinical trials, for a range of drug dose and duration scenarios. An online tool developed from this model is released as open source software. The TB simulation tool could support analysis of new therapy options, novel drug types, and combinations, incorporating factors such as patient adherence behavior.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Dx3oCUCRX-I&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Mathematical modelling reveals cellular dynamics within tumour spheroids</title>

Tumour spheroids are widely used as an &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; assay for characterising the dynamics and response to treatment of different cancer cell lines. Their popularity is largely due to the reproducible manner in which spheroids grow: the diffusion of nutrients and oxygen from the surrounding culture medium, and their consumption by tumour cells, causes proliferation to be localised at the spheroid boundary. As the spheroid grows, cells at the spheroid centre may become hypoxic and die, forming a necrotic core. The pressure created by the localisation of tumour cell proliferation and death generates an cellular flow of tumour cells from the spheroid rim towards its core. Experiments by Dorie &lt;i&gt;et al&lt;/i&gt;. showed that this flow causes inert microspheres to infiltrate into tumour spheroids via advection from the spheroid surface, by adding microbeads to the surface of tumour spheroids and observing the distribution over time. We use an off-lattice hybrid agent-based model to re-assess these experiments and establish the extent to which the spatio-temporal data generated by microspheres can be used to infer kinetic parameters associated with the tumour spheroids that they infiltrate. Variation in these parameters, such as the rate of tumour cell proliferation or sensitivity to hypoxia, can produce spheroids with similar bulk growth dynamics but differing internal compositions (the proportion of the tumour which is proliferating, hypoxic/quiescent and necrotic/nutrient-deficient). We use this model to show that the types of experiment conducted by Dorie &lt;i&gt;et al&lt;/i&gt;. could be used to infer spheroid composition and parameters associated with tumour cell lines such as their sensitivity to hypoxia or average rate of proliferation, and note that these observations cannot be conducted within previous continuum models of microbead infiltration into tumour spheroids as they rely on resolving the trajectories of individual microbeads.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/UboktnJLXIM&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Biology: Strigolactone signaling regulates specialized metabolism in tobacco stems and interactions with stem-feeding herbivores</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~3/bMR1GCtaSzI/article</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Suhua Li, Youngsung Joo, Dechang Cao, Ran Li, Gisuk Lee, Rayko Halitschke, Gundega Baldwin, Ian T. Baldwin, Ming Wang&lt;/p&gt;

Plants are attacked by herbivores, which often specialize on different tissues, and in response, have evolved sophisticated resistance strategies that involve different types of chemical defenses frequently targeted to different tissues. Most known phytohormones have been implicated in regulating these defenses, with jasmonates (JAs) playing a pivotal role in complex regulatory networks of signaling interactions, often generically referred to as “cross talk.” The newly identified class of phytohormones, strigolactones (SLs), known to regulate the shoot architecture, remain unstudied with regard to plant–herbivore interactions. We explored the role of SL signaling in resistance to a specialist weevil (&lt;i&gt;Trichobaris mucorea&lt;/i&gt;) herbivore of the native tobacco, &lt;i&gt;Nicotiana attenuata&lt;/i&gt;, that attacks the root–shoot junction (RSJ), the part of the plant most strongly influenced by alterations in SL signaling (increased branching). As SL signaling shares molecular components, such as the core F-box protein more axillary growth 2 (MAX2), with another new class of phytohormones, the karrikins (KARs), which promote seed germination and seedling growth, we generated transformed lines, individually silenced in the expression of &lt;i&gt;NaMAX2&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;dwarf 14&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;NaD14&lt;/i&gt;: the receptor for SL) and &lt;i&gt;carotenoid cleavage dioxygenase 7&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;NaCCD7&lt;/i&gt;: a key enzyme in SL biosynthesis), and &lt;i&gt;karrikin insensitive 2&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;NaKAI2&lt;/i&gt;: the KAR receptor). The mature stems of all transgenic lines impaired in the SL, but not the KAR signaling pathway, overaccumulated anthocyanins, as did the stems of plants attacked by the larvae of weevil, which burrow into the RSJs to feed on the pith of &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;attenuata&lt;/i&gt; stems. &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;mucorea&lt;/i&gt; larvae grew larger in the plants silenced in the SL pathway, but again, not in the &lt;i&gt;KAI2&lt;/i&gt;-silenced plants. These phenotypes were associated with elevated JA and auxin (indole-3-acetic acid [IAA]) levels and significant changes in the accumulation of defensive compounds, including phenolamides and nicotine. The overaccumulation of phenolamides and anthocyanins in the SL pathway–silenced plants likely resulted from antagonism between the SL and JA pathway in &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;attenuata&lt;/i&gt;. We show that the repressors of SL signaling, suppressor of max2-like (NaSMXL6/7), and JA signaling, jasmonate zim-domain (NaJAZs), physically interact, promoting NaJAZb degradation and releasing jasmonate insensitive 1 (JIN1/MYC2) (NaMYC2), a critical transcription factor promoting JA responses. However, the increased performance of &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;mucorea&lt;/i&gt; larvae resulted from lower pith nicotine levels, which were inhibited by increased IAA levels in SL pathway–silenced plants. This inference was confirmed by decapitation and auxin transport inhibitor treatments that decreased pith IAA and increased nicotine levels. In summary, SL signaling tunes specific sectors of specialized metabolism in stems, such as phenylpropanoid and nicotine biosynthesis, by tailoring the cross talk among phytohormones, including JA and IAA, to mediate herbivore resistance of stems. The metabolic consequences of the interplay of SL, JA, and IAA signaling revealed here could provide a mechanism for the commonly observed pattern of herbivore tolerance/resistance trade-offs.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/bMR1GCtaSzI&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Biology: Combining antibiotics with antivirulence compounds can have synergistic effects and reverse selection for antibiotic resistance in &lt;i&gt;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&lt;/i&gt;</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~3/o41AexYYLAs/article</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Chiara Rezzoagli, Martina Archetti, Ingrid Mignot, Michael Baumgartner, Rolf Kümmerli&lt;/p&gt;

Antibiotics are losing efficacy due to the rapid evolution and spread of resistance. Treatments targeting bacterial virulence factors have been considered as alternatives because they target virulence instead of pathogen viability, and should therefore exert weaker selection for resistance than conventional antibiotics. However, antivirulence treatments rarely clear infections, which compromises their clinical applications. Here, we explore the potential of combining antivirulence drugs with antibiotics against the opportunistic human pathogen &lt;i&gt;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&lt;/i&gt;. We combined two antivirulence compounds (gallium, a siderophore quencher, and furanone C-30, a quorum sensing [QS] inhibitor) together with four clinically relevant antibiotics (ciprofloxacin, colistin, meropenem, tobramycin) in 9×9 drug concentration matrices. We found that drug-interaction patterns were concentration dependent, with promising levels of synergies occurring at intermediate drug concentrations for certain drug pairs. We then tested whether antivirulence compounds are potent adjuvants, especially when treating antibiotic resistant (AtbR) clones. We found that the addition of antivirulence compounds to antibiotics could restore growth inhibition for most AtbR clones, and even abrogate or reverse selection for resistance in five drug combination cases. Molecular analyses suggest that selection against resistant clones occurs when resistance mechanisms involve restoration of protein synthesis, but not when efflux pumps are up-regulated. Altogether, our work provides a first systematic analysis of antivirulence-antibiotic combinatorial treatments and suggests that such combinations have the potential to be both effective in treating infections and in limiting the spread of antibiotic resistance.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/o41AexYYLAs&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Biology: Decelerated dinosaur skull evolution with the origin of birds</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~3/rDGe3-2SUPo/article</link>

The evolutionary radiation of birds has produced incredible morphological variation, including a huge range of skull form and function. Investigating how this variation arose with respect to non-avian dinosaurs is key to understanding how birds achieved their remarkable success after the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event. Using a high-dimensional geometric morphometric approach, we quantified the shape of the skull in unprecedented detail across 354 extant and 37 extinct avian and non-avian dinosaurs. Comparative analyses reveal fundamental differences in how skull shape evolved in birds and non-avian dinosaurs. We find that the overall skull shape evolved faster in non-avian dinosaurs than in birds across all regions of the cranium. In birds, the anterior rostrum is the most rapidly evolving skull region, whereas more posterior regions—such as the parietal, squamosal, and quadrate—exhibited high rates in non-avian dinosaurs. These fast-evolving elements in dinosaurs are strongly associated with feeding biomechanics, forming the jaw joint and supporting the jaw adductor muscles. Rapid pulses of skull evolution coincide with changes to food acquisition strategies and diets, as well as the proliferation of bony skull ornaments. In contrast to the appendicular skeleton, which has been shown to evolve more rapidly in birds, avian cranial morphology is characterised by a striking deceleration in morphological evolution relative to non-avian dinosaurs. These results may be due to the reorganisation of skull structure in birds—including loss of a separate postorbital bone in adults and the emergence of new trade-offs with development and neurosensory demands. Taken together, the remarkable cranial shape diversity in birds was not a product of accelerated evolution from their non-avian relatives, despite their frequent portrayal as an icon of adaptive radiations.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/rDGe3-2SUPo&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;img alt=&quot;Fluctuations of consciousness, mood, and science: The interhemispheric switch and sticky switch models two decades on&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/8c5f1342-4379-4ea3-a435-e871546025ee/cne24943-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two decades ago Jack Pettigrew and I proposed the interhemispheric switch model of binocular rivalry and the sticky switch model of bipolar disorder. Here I describe the genesis, development, supporting data, and current status of these models. I also reflect on doing science with Pettigrew, his remarkable life in science, and how perspectives in science and medicine can fluctuate like the very phenomena on which we worked.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Science and medicine aim to identify verifiable and replicable truths. However, the paths to such truths are frequently characterized by swinging pendulums of opposing perspectives. This is especially so in human neuroscience and the brain‐based clinical sciences, where the target of investigation is the most complex of all biological systems. This article overviews a set of interrelated neuroscientific and clinical hypotheses, models, experiments, and predictions with which I have been involved for the last two decades. Traversing visual neuroscience, consciousness science, genetics, chronobiology, and biological and clinical psychiatry, the work illustrates how developments in science and medicine can occur through a combination of synthesis, serendipity, and experimentation. The article also reflects on doing science with the inimitable John “Jack” Pettigrew, and outlines how Pettigrew and I conceived, proposed, tested, and developed two new scientific models—one on neural mechanisms of binocular rivalry, the other on the pathophysiology of bipolar disorder. I also provide an update on various aspects of our models and data, and describe lessons learned from Pettigrew on how perspectives in science exhibit their own fluctuations, ironically like the very phenomena on which we worked.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Hippocampus: Spatial encoding in dorsomedial prefrontal cortex and hippocampus is related during deliberation</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/hipo.23250?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deliberation is thought to involve the internal simulation of the outcomes of candidate actions, the valuation of those outcomes, and the selection of the actions with the highest expected value. While it is known that deliberation involves prefrontal cortical areas, specifically the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC), as well as the hippocampus (HPC) and other brain regions, how these areas process prospective information and select actions is not well understood. We recorded simultaneously from ensembles in dmPFC and CA1 of dorsal HPC in rats during performance of a spatial contingency switching task, and examined the relationships between spatial and reward encoding in these two areas during deliberation at the choice point. We found that CA1 and dmPFC represented either goal locations or the current position simultaneously, but that when goal locations were encoded, HPC and dmPFC did not always represent the same goal location. Ensemble activity in dmPFC predicted when HPC would represent goal locations, but on a broad timescale on the order of seconds. Also, reward encoding in dmPFC increased during hippocampal theta cycles where CA1 ensembles represented the goal location. These results suggest that dmPFC and HPC share prospective information during deliberation, that dmPFC may influence whether HPC represents prospective information, and that information recalled about goal locations by HPC may be integrated into dmPFC reward representations on fast timescales.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Rest‐Activity Pattern Alterations in Idiopathic REM Sleep Behavior Disorder</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25853?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The purpose of this study was to investigate the differences in actigraphy‐measured rest‐activity patterns (eg, sleep–wake cycle, circadian rest‐activity rhythm, and physical activity) across different stages of α‐synucleinopathy.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We compared alterations in 7‐day actigraphy‐measured rest‐activity patterns among patients with clinically diagnosed α‐synucleinopathies (n = 44), and their age‐, sex‐, and body mass index (BMI)‐matched patients with idiopathic rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder (iRBD, n = 88), and non‐rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder (RBD) controls (n = 44) in a case–control study (study 1) and between convertors (n = 22) and their age‐, sex‐, BMI‐, iRBD‐duration, and follow‐up duration‐matched non‐convertors (n = 66) in a prospective nested case–control study (study 2).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In study 1, there were significant increases (all &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; values were adjusted by false discovery rate &amp;lt; 0.01) in probable napping behaviors (percentage, duration, and episodes), activity fragmentation (estimated by k&lt;sub&gt;AR&lt;/sub&gt;), and physical inactivity during active periods across controls, and iRBD, to clinically diagnosed α‐synucleinopathies. In study 2, higher levels (all &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; values were adjusted by false discovery rate &amp;lt; 0.05) of baseline objective probable napping, activity fragmentation, and physical inactivity during active periods were associated with the conversion of patients with iRBD into clinically diagnosed α‐synucleinopathies at 2 years of follow‐up with medium to large effect sizes (Cohen's d: 0.56 to 0.80). These findings were further supported by functional linear modeling analyses.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rest‐activity pattern alterations, mainly objective probable napping behaviors, activity fragmentation, and physical inactivity during active period, emerge as early as at the stage of iRBD, which serves as early and robust prodromal markers of the conversion of iRBD into clinically diagnosed α‐synucleinopathies.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Loss‐of‐function variants in HOPS complex genes VPS16 and VPS41 cause early‐onset dystonia associated with lysosomal abnormalities</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25879?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Objectives&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The majority of people with suspected genetic dystonia remain undiagnosed after maximal investigation, implying that a number of causative genes have not yet been recognised. We aimed to investigate this paucity of diagnoses.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We undertook weighted burden analysis of whole‐exome sequencing data from 138 individuals with unresolved generalised dystonia of suspected genetic aetiology, followed by additional case‐finding from international databases, first for the gene implicated by the burden analysis (&lt;i&gt;VPS16&lt;/i&gt;), then for other functionally related genes. Electron microscopy was performed on patient‐derived cells.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Analysis revealed a significant burden for &lt;i&gt;VPS16&lt;/i&gt; (Fisher's exact test p‐value, 6.9x10&lt;sup&gt;−9&lt;/sup&gt;). &lt;i&gt;VPS16&lt;/i&gt; encodes a subunit of the homotypic fusion and vacuole protein sorting (HOPS) complex, which plays a key role in autophagosome‐lysosome fusion. A total of 18 individuals harbouring heterozygous loss‐of‐function &lt;i&gt;VPS16&lt;/i&gt; variants, and one with a microdeletion, were identified. These individuals experienced early‐onset progressive dystonia with predominant cervical, bulbar, orofacial and upper limb involvement. Some patients had a more complex phenotype with additional neuropsychiatric and/or developmental comorbidities. We also identified biallelic loss‐of‐function variants in &lt;i&gt;VPS41&lt;/i&gt;, another HOPS‐complex encoding genes, in an individual with infantile‐onset generalised dystonia. Electron microscopy of patient‐derived lymphocytes and fibroblasts from both &lt;i&gt;VPS16&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;VPS41&lt;/i&gt; patients showed vacuolar abnormalities suggestive of impaired lysosomal function.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our study strongly supports a role for HOPS complex dysfunction in the pathogenesis of dystonia, though variants in different subunits display different phenotypic and inheritance characteristics.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience: Prior Practice Affects Movement-Related Beta Modulation and Quiet Wake Restores It to Baseline</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2020.00061</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Beta oscillations (13.5−25 Hz) over the sensorimotor areas are characterized by a power decrease during movement execution (event-related desynchronization, ERD) and a sharp rebound after the movement end (event-related synchronization, ERS). In previous studies, we demonstrated that movement-related beta modulation depth (peak ERS-ERD) during reaching increases within 1-h practice. This increase may represent plasticity processes within the sensorimotor network. If so, beta modulation during a reaching test should be affected by previous learning activity that engages the sensorimotor system but not by learning involving other systems. We thus recorded high-density EEG activity in a group of healthy subjects performing three 45-min blocks of motor adaptation task to a visually rotated display (ROT) and in another performing three blocks of visual sequence-learning (VSEQ). Each block of either ROT or VSEQ was followed by a simple reaching test (mov) without rotation. We found that beta modulation depth increased with practice across mov tests. However, such an increase was greater in the group performing ROT over both the left and frontal areas previously involved in ROT. Importantly, beta modulation values returned to baseline values after a 90-min of either nap or quiet wake. These results show that previous practice leaves a trace in movement-related beta modulation and therefore such increases are cumulative. Furthermore, as sleep is not necessary to bring beta modulation values to baseline, they could reflect local increases of neuronal activity and decrease of energy and supplies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Synaptic Neuroscience: Reducing Glutamate Uptake in Rat Hippocampal Slices Enhances Astrocytic Membrane Depolarization While Down-Regulating CA3–CA1 Synaptic Response</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsyn.2020.00037</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The majority of synaptic activity in the brain consists of glutamatergic transmission, and there are numerous mechanisms, both intra- and inter-cellular that regulate this excitatory synaptic activity. Importantly, uptake of glutamate plays an important role and a reduced level of astrocytic glutamate transporters affect the normally balanced neurotransmission and is observed in many mental disorders. However, reduced glutamate uptake affects many different synaptic mechanisms in the astrocyte as well as in the neuron, and the effects are challenging to delineate. Combining electrophysiological recordings from neurons and astrocytes as well as extracellular glutamate recordings in rat hippocampal slices, we confirmed previous work showing that synaptic stimulation induces a long-lasting depolarization of the astrocytic membrane that is dependent on inward-rectifier potassium channels. We further showed that when glutamate transporters are blocked, this astrocytic depolarization is greatly enhanced although synaptic responses are reduced. We propose that increasing the levels of synaptic glutamate through blocking glutamate transporters reduces the AMPA-mediated synaptic response while the NMDA receptor current increases, contributing to a rise in extracellular K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; leading to enhanced astrocytic depolarization.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: A Deep Network Model on Dynamic Functional Connectivity With Applications to Gender Classification and Intelligence Prediction</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00881</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Increasing evidence has suggested that the dynamic properties of functional brain networks are related to individual behaviors and cognition traits. However, current fMRI-based approaches mostly focus on statistical characteristics of the windowed correlation time course, potentially overlooking subtle time-varying patterns in dynamic functional connectivity (dFC). Here, we proposed the use of an end-to-end deep learning model that combines the convolutional neural network (CNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM) network to capture temporal and spatial features of functional connectivity sequences simultaneously. The results on a large cohort (Human Connectome Project, n = 1,050) demonstrated that our model could achieve a high classification accuracy of about 93% in a gender classification task and prediction accuracies of 0.31 and 0.49 (Pearson’s correlation coefficient) in fluid and crystallized intelligence prediction tasks, significantly outperforming previously reported models. Furthermore, we demonstrated that our model could effectively learn spatiotemporal dynamics underlying dFC with high statistical significance based on the null hypothesis estimated using surrogate data. Overall, this study suggests the advantages of a deep learning model in making full use of dynamic information in resting-state functional connectivity, and highlights the potential of time-varying connectivity patterns in improving the prediction of individualized characterization of demographics and cognition traits.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neural Technology: Hypoxia-Associated Changes in Striatal Tonic Dopamine Release: Real-Time in vivo Measurements With a Novel Voltammetry Technique</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00869</link>
	<content:encoded>Introduction&lt;p&gt; Striatal tonic dopamine increases rapidly during global cerebral hypoxia. This phenomenon has previously been studied using microdialysis techniques which have relatively poor spatio-temporal resolution. In this study, we measured changes in tonic dopamine during hypoxia (death) in real time with high spatio-temporal resolution using novel multiple cyclic square wave voltammetry (MCSWV) and conventional fast scan cyclic voltammetry (FSCV) techniques.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;MCSWV and FSCV were used to measure dopamine release at baseline and during hypoxia induced by euthanasia, with and without prior alpha-methyl-p-tyrosine (AMPT) treatment, in urethane anesthetized male Sprague-Dawley rats.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Baseline tonic dopamine levels were found to be 274.1 ± 49.4 nM (n = 5; mean ± SEM). Following intracardiac urethane injection, the tonic levels increased to a peak concentration of 1753.8 ± 95.7 nM within 3.6 ± 0.6 min (n = 5), followed by a decline to 50.7 ± 21.5 nM (n = 4) at 20 min. AMPT pre-treatment significantly reduced this dopamine peak to 677.9 ± 185.7 nM (n = 3). FSCV showed a significantly higher (p = 0.0079) peak dopamine release of 6430.4 ± 1805.7 nM (n = 5) during euthanasia-induced cerebral hypoxia.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;MCSWV is a novel tool to study rapid changes in tonic dopamine release in vivo during hypoxia. We found a 6-fold increase in peak dopamine levels during hypoxia which was attenuated with AMPT pre-treatment. These changes are much lower compared to those found with microdialysis. This could be due to improved estimation of baseline tonic dopamine with MCSWV. Higher dopamine response measured with FSCV could be due to an increased oxidation current from electroactive interferents.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: The Current State-of-the Art of LRRK2-Based Biomarker Assay Development in Parkinson’s Disease</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00865</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Evidence is mounting that LRRK2 function, particularly its kinase activity, is elevated in multiple forms of Parkinson’s disease, both idiopathic as well as familial forms linked to mutations in the LRRK2 gene. However, sensitive quantitative markers of LRRK2 activation in clinical samples remain at the early stages of development. There are several measures of LRRK2 activity that could potentially be used in longitudinal studies of disease progression, as inclusion/exclusion criteria for clinical trials, to predict response to therapy, or as markers of target engagement. Among these are levels of LRRK2, phosphorylation of LRRK2 itself, either by other kinases or via auto-phosphorylation, its in vitro kinase activity, or phosphorylation of downstream substrates. This is advantageous on many levels, in that multiple indices of elevated kinase activity clearly strengthen the rationale for targeting this kinase with novel therapeutic candidates, and provide alternate markers of activation in certain tissues or biofluids for which specific measures are not detectable. However, this can also complicate interpretation of findings from different studies using disparate measures. In this review we discuss the current state of LRRK2-focused biomarkers, the advantages and disadvantages of the current pallet of outcome measures, the gaps that need to be addressed, and the priorities that the field has defined.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Melatonin Enhances the Therapeutic Effect of Plasma Exosomes Against Cerebral Ischemia-Induced Pyroptosis Through the TLR4/NF-κB Pathway</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00848</link>
	<content:encoded>Introduction&lt;p&gt;Ischemic stroke-induced inflammation and inflammasome-dependent pyroptotic neural death cause serious neurological injury. Nano-sized plasma exosomes have exhibited therapeutic potential against ischemia and reperfusion injury by ameliorating inflammation. To enhance its therapeutic potential in patients with ischemic injury, we isolated exosomes from melatonin-treated rat plasma and assessed the neurological protective effect in a rat model of focal cerebral ischemia.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;Basal plasma exosomes and melatonin-treated plasma exosomes were isolated and intravenously injected into a rat model of focal cerebral ischemia. Neurological recovery was evaluated by determining the modified neurological severity score (mNSS), infarct volume, and brain water content. Pyroptosis in the ischemic cortex was detected through dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) assay, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release, and gasdermin D (GSDMD) cleavage. NLRP3 inflammasome assembly and global inflammatory cytokine secretion were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and Western blot assay. In immunized Sprague–Dawley rats, microglia pyroptosis was determined through a positive percentage of IBA1&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and caspase-1 (p20)&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cells. Finally, the microRNA (miRNA) profiles in melatonin-treated plasma exosomes were analyzed by exosome miRNA microarray analysis.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Melatonin treatment enhanced plasma exosome therapeutic effects against ischemia-induced inflammatory responses and inflammasome-mediated pyroptosis. In addition, we confirmed that ischemic stroke-induced pyroptotic cell death occurred in the microglia and neuron, while the administration of melatonin-treated exosomes further effectively decreased the infarct volume and improved recovery of function via regulation of the TLR4/NF-κB signaling pathway. Finally, the altered miRNA profiles in the melatonin-treated plasma exosomes demonstrated the regulatory mechanisms involved in neurological recovery after ischemic injury.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;This study suggests that nano-sized plasma exosomes with melatonin pretreatment might be a more effective strategy for patients with ischemic brain injury. Further exploration of key molecules in the plasma exosome may provide increased therapeutic value for cerebral ischemic injury.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neural Technology: Non-invasive Brain Stimulation for Gambling Disorder: A Systematic Review</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00729</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Background: Gambling disorder (GD) is the most common behavioral addiction and shares pathophysiological and clinical features with substance use disorders (SUDs). Effective therapeutic interventions for GD are lacking. Non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) may represent a promising treatment option for GD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Objective: This systematic review aimed to provide a comprehensive and structured overview of studies applying NIBS techniques to GD and problem gambling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: A literature search using Pubmed, Web of Science, and Science Direct was conducted from databases inception to December 19, 2019, for studies assessing the effects of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) and transcranial direct current stimulation (t-DCS) on subjects with GD or problem gambling. Studies using NIBS techniques on healthy subjects and those without therapeutic goals but only aiming to assess basic neurophysiology measures were excluded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: A total of 269 articles were title and abstract screened, 13 full texts were assessed, and 11 were included, of which six were controlled and five were uncontrolled. Most studies showed a reduction of gambling behavior, craving for gambling, and gambling-related symptoms. NIBS effects on psychiatric symptoms were less consistent. A decrease of the behavioral activation related to gambling was also reported. Some studies reported modulation of behavioral measures (i.e., impulsivity, cognitive and attentional control, decision making, cognitive flexibility). Studies were not consistent in terms of NIBS protocol, site of stimulation, clinical and surrogate outcome measures, and duration of treatment and follow-up. Sample size was small in most studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: The clinical and methodological heterogeneity of the included studies prevented us from drawing any firm conclusion on the efficacy of NIBS interventions for GD. Further methodologically sound, robust, and well-powered studies are needed.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Delayed Functional Networks Development and Altered Fast Oscillation Dynamics in a Rat Model of Cortical Malformation</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00711</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Malformations of cortical development (MCD) is associated with a wide range of developmental delay and drug resistant epilepsy in children. By using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (RS-fMRI) and event-related spectral perturbation (ERSP) of cortical electroencephalography (EEG) data, we tried to investigate the neural changes of spatiotemporal functional connectivity (FC) and fast oscillation (FO) dynamics in a rat model of methylazoxymethanol (MAM)-induced MCD. A total of 28 infant rats with prenatal exposure to MAM and those of age matched 28 controls with prenatal saline exposure were used. RS-fMRI were acquired at postnatal day 15 (P15) and 29 (P29), and correlation coefficient analysis of eleven region of interests (ROI) was done to find the differences of functional networks between four groups. Two hour-cortical EEGs were also recorded at P15 and P29 and the ERSP of gamma (30–80 Hz) and ripples (80–200 Hz) were analyzed. The rats with MCD showed significantly delayed development of superior colliculus-brainstem network compared to control rats at P15. In contrast to marked maturation of default mode network (DMN) in controls from P15 to P29, there was no clear development in MCD rats. The MCD rats showed significantly higher cortical gamma and ripples-ERSP at P15 and lower cortical ripples-ERSP at P29 than those of control rats. This study demonstrated delayed development of FC and altered cortical FO dynamics in rats with malformed brain. The results should be further investigated in terms of the epileptogenesis and cognitive dysfunction in patients with MCD.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroinformatics: Creating Neuroscientific Knowledge Organization System Based on Word Representation and Agglomerative Clustering Algorithm</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fninf.2020.00038</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The literature on neuroscience has grown rapidly in recent years with the emergence of new domains of research. In the context of this progress, creating a knowledge organization system (KOS) that can quickly incorporate terms of a given domain is an important aim in the area. In this article, we develop a systematic method based on word representation and the agglomerative clustering algorithm to semi-automatically build a hierarchical KOS. We collected 35,832 research keywords and 11,497 research methods from PubMed Central database, and organized them in a hierarchical structure according to semantic distance. We show that the proposed KOS can help find terms related to the given topics, analyze articles related to specific domains of research, and characterize the features of article clusters. The proposed method can significantly reduce the manual work required by experts to organize the KOS.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Proactive Control of Emotional Distraction: Evidence From EEG Alpha Suppression</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00318</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Biased attention towards emotional stimuli is adaptive, as it facilitates responses to important threats and rewards. An unfortunate consequence is that emotional stimuli can become potent distractors when they are irrelevant to current goals. How can this distraction be overcome despite the bias to attend to emotional stimuli? Recent studies show that distraction by irrelevant flankers is reduced when distractor frequency is high, even if they are emotional. A parsimonious explanation is that the expectation of frequent distractors promotes the use of proactive control, whereby attentional control settings can be altered to minimize distraction before it occurs. It is difficult, however, to infer proactive control on the basis of behavioral data alone. We therefore measured neural indices of proactive control while participants performed a target-detection task in which irrelevant peripheral distractors (either emotional or neutral) could appear either frequently (on 75% of trials) or rarely (on 25% of trials). We measured alpha power during the pre-stimulus period to assess proactive control and during the post-stimulus period to determine the consequences of control for subsequent processing. Pre-stimulus alpha power was tonically suppressed in the high, compared to low, distractor frequency condition, regardless of expected distractor valence, indicating sustained use of proactive control. In contrast, post-stimulus alpha suppression was reduced in the high-frequency condition, suggesting that proactive control reduced the need for post-stimulus adjustments. Our findings indicate that a sustained proactive control strategy accounts for the reduction in both emotional and non-emotional distraction when distractors are expected to appear frequently.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience: Revealing the Computational Meaning of Neocortical Interarea Signals</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2020.00074</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;To understand the function of the neocortex, which is a hierarchical distributed network, it is useful giving meaning to the signals transmitted between these areas from the computational viewpoint. The overall anatomical structure or organs related to this network, including the neocortex, thalamus, and basal ganglia, has been roughly revealed, and much physiological knowledge, though often fragmentary, is being accumulated. The computational theories involving the neocortex have also been developed considerably. By introducing the assumption “The signals transmitted by interarea axonal projections of pyramidal cells in the neocortex carry different meanings for each cell type, common to all areas,” derived from its nature as a distributed network in the neocortex, allows us to specify the computational meanings of interarea signals. In this paper, first, the types of signals exchanged between neocortical areas are investigated, taking into account biological constraints, and employing theories such as predictive coding, reinforcement learning, representation emulation theory, and BDI logic as theoretical starting points, two types of feedforward signals (observation and deviation) and three types of feedback signals (prediction, plan, and intention) are identified. Next, based on the anatomical knowledge of the neocortex and thalamus, the pathways connecting the areas are organized and summarized as three corticocortical pathways and two thalamocortical pathways. Using this summation as preparation, this paper proposes a hypothesis that gives meaning to each type of signals transmitted in the different pathways in the neocortex, from the viewpoint of their functions. This hypothesis reckons that the feedforward corticocortical pathway transmits observation signals, the feedback corticocortical pathway transmits prediction signals, and the corticothalamic pathway mediated by core relay cells transmits deviation signals. The thalamocortical pathway, which is mediated by matrix relay cells, would be responsible for transmitting the signals that activate a part of prediction signals as intentions, due to the reason that the nature of the other available feedback pathways are not sufficient for conveying plans and intentions as signals. The corticocortical pathway, which is projected from various IT cells to the first layer, would be responsible for transmitting signals that activate a part of prediction signals as plans.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neural Circuits: Monochromatic Blue Light Activates Suprachiasmatic Nucleus Neuronal Activity and Promotes Arousal in Mice Under Sevoflurane Anesthesia</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncir.2020.00055</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Background: Monochromatic blue light (MBL), with a wavelength between 400–490 nm, can regulate non-image-forming (NIF) functions of light in the central nervous system. The suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) in the brain is involved in the arousal-promoting response to blue light in mice. Animal and human studies showed that the responsiveness of the brain to visual stimuli is partly preserved under general anesthesia. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate whether MBL promotes arousal from sevoflurane anesthesia via activation of the SCN in mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: The induction and emergence time of sevoflurane anesthesia under MBL (460 nm and 800 lux) exposure was measured. Cortical electroencephalograms (EEGs) were recorded and the burst-suppression ratio (BSR) was calculated under MBL during sevoflurane anesthesia. The EEGs and local field potential (LFP) recordings with or without locally electrolytic ablated bilateral SCN were used to further explore the role of SCN in the arousal-promoting effect of MBL under sevoflurane anesthesia. Immunofluorescent staining of c-Fos was conducted to reveal the possible downstream mechanism of SCN activation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Unlike the lack of effect on the induction time, MBL shortened the emergence time and the EEG recordings showed cortical arousal during the recovery period. MBL resulted in a significant decrease in BSR and a marked increase in EEG power at all frequency bands except for the spindle band during 2.5% sevoflurane anesthesia. MBL exposure under sevoflurane anesthesia enhances the neuronal activity of the SCN. These responses to MBL were abolished in SCN lesioned (SCNx) mice. MBL evoked a high level of c-Fos expression in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and lateral hypothalamus (LH) compared to polychromatic white light (PWL) under sevoflurane anesthesia, while it exerted no effect on c-Fos expression in the ventrolateral preoptic area (VLPO) and locus coeruleus (LC) c-Fos expression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: MBL promotes behavioral and electroencephalographic arousal from sevoflurane anesthesia via the activation of the SCN and its associated downstream wake-related nuclei. The clinical implications of this study warrant further study.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Perioperative neurocognitive disorder (PND) is a common phenomenon associated with anesthesia and surgery and has been frequently described in the elderly and susceptible individuals. Microglia, which are the brain’s major resident immune cells, play critical roles in maintaining neuronal homeostasis and synaptic plasticity. Accumulating evidence suggests microglial dysfunction occurring after anesthesia and surgery might perturb neuronal function and induce PND. This review aims to provide an overview of the involvement of microglia in PND to date. Possible cellular and molecular mechanisms regarding the connection between microglial activation and PND are discussed.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Progranulin Administration Attenuates β-Amyloid Deposition in the Hippocampus of 5xFAD Mice Through Modulating BACE1 Expression and Microglial Phagocytosis</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00260</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Loss of function mutations in the progranulin (PGRN) gene is a risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Previous works reported that the deficiency of PGRN accelerates β-amyloid (Aβ) accumulation in AD transgenic mouse brains while overexpression of PGRN could restrain disease progression. However, mechanisms of PGRN in protecting against Aβ deposition remains unclear. Here, using the 5xFAD AD mouse model, we show that intrahippocampal injection of PGRN protein leads to a reduction of Aβ plaques, downregulation of beta-secretase 1 (BACE1), and enhanced microglia Aβ phagocytosis in the mouse hippocampus. Furthermore, PGRN treatment inhibited BACE1 expression in N2a cells and primary culture neurons and improved the phagocytic capacity of microglia isolated from 5xFAD mouse brains. Collectively, our results provide further evidence that enhancing progranulin could be a promising option for AD therapy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Insight From Animals Resistant to Prion Diseases: Deciphering the Genotype – Morphotype – Phenotype Code for the Prion Protein</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00254</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Prion diseases are a group of neurodegenerative diseases endemic in humans and several ruminants caused by the misfolding of native prion protein (PrP) into pathological conformations. Experimental work and the mad-cow epidemic of the 1980s exposed a wide spectrum of animal susceptibility to prion diseases, including a few highly resistant animals: horses, rabbits, pigs, and dogs/canids. The variable susceptibility to disease offers a unique opportunity to uncover the mechanisms governing PrP misfolding, neurotoxicity, and transmission. Previous work indicates that PrP-intrinsic differences (sequence) are the main contributors to disease susceptibility. Several residues have been cited as critical for encoding PrP conformational stability in prion-resistant animals, including D/E159 in dog, S167 in horse, and S174 in rabbit and pig PrP (all according to human numbering). These amino acids alter PrP properties in a variety of assays, but we still do not clearly understand the structural correlates of PrP toxicity. Additional insight can be extracted from comparative structural studies, followed by molecular dynamics simulations of selected mutations, and testing in manipulable animal models. Our working hypothesis is that protective amino acids generate more compact and stable structures in a C-terminal subdomain of the PrP globular domain. We will explore this idea in this review and identify subdomains within the globular domain that may hold the key to unravel how conformational stability and disease susceptibility are encoded in PrP.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnana.2020.00054</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The first anatomical atlas of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) of white matter pathways in the canine brain was published in 2013; however, the anatomical orientation of the entire visual pathway in the canine brain, from the retina to the cortex, has not yet been studied using DTI. In the present study, 3T DTI magnetic resonance (MR) images of three dogs euthanized for reasons other than neurological disorders were obtained. The process of obtaining combined fractional anisotropy and directional maps was initiated within 1 h of death. The heads were amputated immediately after MR imaging and stored in 10% formalin until dissection and histological sampling was performed. The trajectory of the visual pathway is dissimilar to the horizontal representation in other literature. To our knowledge, ours is the first study to visualize the entire canine visual pathway in its full antero-posterior extension. Fibers from the retina to the cortex passed through the optic nerve, optic chiasm, optic tracts, lateral geniculate nucleus, Meyer’s and Baum’s loops, and pretectal fibers. Their projections to the cortex were similar to those in the human visual pathway. The crossing of fibers at the optic chiasm occurred in 75% of fibers. In addition to advancing our knowledge in this field of study, these results could help plan neurosurgical and radiotherapeutic procedures to avoid unnecessary damage to the visual fiber system.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Huntingtin Aggregates in the Olfactory Bulb in Huntington’s Disease</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00261</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Olfactory deficits are an early and prevalent non-motor symptom of Huntington’s disease (HD). In other neurodegenerative diseases where olfactory deficits occur, such as Alzheimer’s disease and Parkinson’s disease, pathological protein aggregates (tau, β-amyloid, α-synuclein) accumulate in the anterior olfactory nucleus (AON) of the olfactory bulb (OFB). Therefore, in this study we determined whether aggregates are also present in HD OFBs; 13 HD and five normal human OFBs were stained for mutant huntingtin (mHtt), tau, β-amyloid, TDP-43, and α-synuclein. Our results show that mHtt aggregates detected with 1F8 antibody are present within all HD OFBs, and mHtt aggregate load in the OFB does not correlate with Vonsattel grading scores. The majority of the aggregates were located in the AON and in similar abundance in each anatomical segment of the AON. No mHtt aggregates were found in controls; 31% of HD cases also contained tau neurofibrillary tangles within the AON. This work demonstrates HD pathology in the OFB and indicates that disease-specific protein aggregation in the AON is a common feature of neurodegenerative diseases that show olfactory deficits.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: HUCBC Treatment Improves Cognitive Outcome in Rats With Vascular Dementia</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00258</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Background and purpose: Vascular dementia (VaD) is the second common cause of dementia after Alzheimer’s disease in older people. Yet, there are no FDA approved drugs specifically for VaD. In this study, we have investigated the therapeutic effects of human umbilical cord blood cells (HUCBC) treatment on the cognitive outcome, white matter (WM) integrity, and glymphatic system function in rats subject to a multiple microinfarction (MMI) model of VaD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Male, retired breeder rats were subjected to the MMI model (800 ± 100 cholesterol crystals/300 μl injected into the internal carotid artery), and 3 days later were treated with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) or HUCBC (5 × 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;, i.v.). Sham rats were included as naïve control. Following a battery of cognitive tests, rats were sacrificed at 28 days after MMI and brains extracted for immunohistochemical evaluation and Western blot analysis. To evaluate the glymphatic function, fluorescent tracers (Texas Red dextran, MW: 3 kD and FITC-dextran, MW: 500 kD) was injected into the cisterna magna over 30 min at 14 days after MMI. Rats (3–4/group/time point) were sacrificed at 30 min, 3 h, and 6 h, and the tracer movement analyzed using laser scanning confocal microscopy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Compared to control MMI rats, HUCBC treated MMI rats exhibit significantly improved short-term memory and long-term memory exhibited by increased discrimination index in novel object recognition task with retention delay of 4 h and improved novel odor recognition task with retention delay of 24 h, respectively. HUCBC treatment also improves spatial learning and memory as measured using the Morris water maze test compared to control MMI rats. HUCBC treatment significantly increases axon and myelin density increases oligodendrocyte and oligodendrocyte progenitor cell number and increases Synaptophysin expression in the brain compared to control MMI rats. HUCBC treatment of MMI in rats significantly improves glymphatic function by reversing MMI induced delay in the penetration of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) into the brain parenchyma via glymphatic pathways and reversing delayed clearance from the brain. HUCBC treatment significantly increases miR-126 expression in serum, aquaporin-4 (AQP4) expression around cerebral vessels, and decreases transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) protein expression in the brain which may contribute to HUCBC induced improved glymphatic function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: HUCBC treatment of an MMI rat model of VaD promotes WM remodeling and improves glymphatic function which together may aid in the improvement of cognitive function and memory. Thus, HUCBC treatment warrants further investigation as a potential therapy for VaD.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.00211</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;DNA methylation is an essential epigenetic mechanism involving in gene transcription modulation. An age-related increase in promoter methylation has been observed for neuronal activity and memory genes, and participates in neurological disorders. However, the position and precise mechanism of DNA methylation for memory gene modulation in anesthesia related cognitive impairment remained to be determined. Here, we studied the effects of sevoflurane anesthesia on the transcription of memory genes in the aged rat hippocampus. Then, we investigated changes in DNA methylation of involved genes and verified whether dysregulated DNA methylation would contribute to anesthesia induced cognitive impairment. The results indicated that sevoflurane anesthesia down-regulated the mRNA and protein levels of three memory genes, Arc, Bdnf, and Reln, which were accompanied with promoter hypermethylation and increased Dnmt1, Dnmt3a, and Mecp2 expression, and finally impaired hippocampus dependent memory. Furthermore, inhibition of DNA hypermethylation by 5-Aza rescued sevoflurane induced memory gene expression decrease and cognitive impairment.

Genome-scale metabolic models have been utilized extensively in the study and engineering of the organisms they describe. Here we present the analysis of a published dataset from pooled transposon mutant fitness experiments as an approach for improving the accuracy and gene-reaction associations of a metabolic model for &lt;i&gt;Zymomonas mobilis&lt;/i&gt; ZM4, an industrially relevant ethanologenic organism with extremely high glycolytic flux and low biomass yield. Gene essentiality predictions made by the draft model were compared to data from individual pooled mutant experiments to identify areas of the model requiring deeper validation. Subsequent experiments showed that some of the discrepancies between the model and dataset were caused by polar effects, mis-mapped barcodes, or mutants carrying both wild-type and transposon disrupted gene copies—highlighting potential limitations inherent to data from individual mutants in these high-throughput datasets. Therefore, we analyzed correlations in fitness scores across all 492 experiments in the dataset in the context of functionally related metabolic reaction modules identified within the model via flux coupling analysis. These correlations were used to identify candidate genes for a reaction in histidine biosynthesis lacking an annotated gene and highlight metabolic modules with poorly correlated gene fitness scores. Additional genes for reactions involved in biotin, ubiquinone, and pyridoxine biosynthesis in &lt;i&gt;Z&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;mobilis&lt;/i&gt; were identified and confirmed using mutant complementation experiments. These discovered genes, were incorporated into the final model, &lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;ZM4_478, which contains 747 metabolic and transport reactions (of which 612 have gene-protein-reaction associations), 478 genes, and 616 unique metabolites, making it one of the most complete models of &lt;i&gt;Z&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;mobilis&lt;/i&gt; ZM4 to date. The methods of analysis that we applied here with the &lt;i&gt;Z&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;mobilis&lt;/i&gt; transposon mutant dataset, could easily be utilized to improve future genome-scale metabolic reconstructions for organisms where these, or similar, high-throughput datasets are available.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/PsAz6cdGilc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Complexity of cell-type composition has created much skepticism surrounding the interpretation of bulk tissue transcriptomic studies. Recent studies have shown that deconvolution algorithms can be applied to computationally estimate cell-type proportions from gene expression data of bulk blood samples, but their performance when applied to brain tissue is unclear. Here, we have generated an immunohistochemistry (IHC) dataset for five major cell-types from brain tissue of 70 individuals, who also have bulk cortical gene expression data. With the IHC data as the benchmark, this resource enables quantitative assessment of deconvolution algorithms for brain tissue. We apply existing deconvolution algorithms to brain tissue by using marker sets derived from human brain single cell and cell-sorted RNA-seq data. We show that these algorithms can indeed produce informative estimates of constituent cell-type proportions. In fact, neuronal subpopulation can also be estimated from bulk brain tissue samples. Further, we show that including the cell-type proportion estimates as confounding factors is important for reducing false associations between Alzheimer’s disease phenotypes and gene expression. Lastly, we demonstrate that using more accurate marker sets can substantially improve statistical power in detecting cell-type specific expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs).&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/irKCm4qd2IE&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Understanding the behavior of emerging disease outbreaks in, or ahead of, real-time could help healthcare officials better design interventions to mitigate impacts on affected populations. Most healthcare-based disease surveillance systems, however, have significant inherent reporting delays due to data collection, aggregation, and distribution processes. Recent work has shown that machine learning methods leveraging a combination of traditionally collected epidemiological information and novel Internet-based data sources, such as disease-related Internet search activity, can produce meaningful “nowcasts” of disease incidence ahead of healthcare-based estimates, with most successful case studies focusing on endemic and seasonal diseases such as influenza and dengue. Here, we apply similar computational methods to emerging outbreaks in geographic regions where no historical presence of the disease of interest has been observed. By combining limited available historical epidemiological data available with disease-related Internet search activity, we retrospectively estimate disease activity in five recent outbreaks weeks ahead of traditional surveillance methods. We find that the proposed computational methods frequently provide useful real-time incidence estimates that can help fill temporal data gaps resulting from surveillance reporting delays. However, the proposed methods are limited by issues of sample bias and skew in search query volumes, perhaps as a result of media coverage.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/C7qNYE1HPEY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Hongtao Yu, Sanchita Basu, K. Melissa Hallow&lt;/p&gt;

Congestive heart failure is characterized by suppressed cardiac output and arterial filling pressure, leading to renal retention of salt and water, contributing to further volume overload. Mathematical modeling provides a means to investigate the integrated function and dysfunction of heart and kidney in heart failure. This study updates our previously reported integrated model of cardiac and renal functions to account for the fluid exchange between the blood and interstitium across the capillary membrane, allowing the simulation of edema. A state of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HF-rEF) was then produced by altering cardiac parameters reflecting cardiac injury and cardiovascular disease, including heart contractility, myocyte hypertrophy, arterial stiffness, and systemic resistance. After matching baseline characteristics of the SOLVD clinical study, parameters governing rates of cardiac remodeling were calibrated to describe the progression of cardiac hemodynamic variables observed over one year in the placebo arm of the SOLVD clinical study. The model was then validated by reproducing improvements in cardiac function in the enalapril arm of SOLVD. The model was then applied to prospectively predict the response to the sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor dapagliflozin, which has been shown to reduce heart failure events in HF-rEF patients in the recent DAPAHF clinical trial by incompletely understood mechanisms. The simulations predict that dapagliflozin slows cardiac remodeling by reducing preload on the heart, and relieves congestion by clearing interstitial fluid without excessively reducing blood volume. This provides a quantitative mechanistic explanation for the observed benefits of SGLT2i in HF-rEF. The model also provides a tool for further investigation of heart failure drug therapies.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/QHGzKTEFaqE&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

The human body generates a diverse set of high affinity antibodies, the soluble form of B cell receptors (BCRs), that bind to and neutralize invading pathogens. The natural development of BCRs must be understood in order to design vaccines for highly mutable pathogens such as influenza and HIV. BCR diversity is induced by naturally occurring combinatorial “V(D)J” rearrangement, mutation, and selection processes. Most current methods for BCR sequence analysis focus on separately modeling the above processes. Statistical phylogenetic methods are often used to model the mutational dynamics of BCR sequence data, but these techniques do not consider all the complexities associated with B cell diversification such as the V(D)J rearrangement process. In particular, standard phylogenetic approaches assume the DNA bases of the progenitor (or “naive”) sequence arise independently and according to the same distribution, ignoring the complexities of V(D)J rearrangement. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach to Bayesian phylogenetic inference for BCR sequences that is based on a phylogenetic hidden Markov model (phylo-HMM). This technique not only integrates a naive rearrangement model with a phylogenetic model for BCR sequence evolution but also naturally accounts for uncertainty in all unobserved variables, including the phylogenetic tree, via posterior distribution sampling.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/qLRRuowrcjE&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Brain networks are complex dynamical systems in which directed interactions between different areas evolve at the sub-second scale of sensory, cognitive and motor processes. Due to the highly non-stationary nature of neural signals and their unknown noise components, however, modeling dynamic brain networks has remained one of the major challenges in contemporary neuroscience. Here, we present a new algorithm based on an innovative formulation of the Kalman filter that is optimized for tracking rapidly evolving patterns of directed functional connectivity under unknown noise conditions. The Self-Tuning Optimized Kalman filter (STOK) is a novel adaptive filter that embeds a self-tuning memory decay and a recursive regularization to guarantee high network tracking accuracy, temporal precision and robustness to noise. To validate the proposed algorithm, we performed an extensive comparison against the classical Kalman filter, in both realistic surrogate networks and real electroencephalography (EEG) data. In both simulations and real data, we show that the STOK filter estimates time-frequency patterns of directed connectivity with significantly superior performance. The advantages of the STOK filter were even clearer in real EEG data, where the algorithm recovered latent structures of dynamic connectivity from epicranial EEG recordings in rats and human visual evoked potentials, in excellent agreement with known physiology. These results establish the STOK filter as a powerful tool for modeling dynamic network structures in biological systems, with the potential to yield new insights into the rapid evolution of network states from which brain functions emerge.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/ooTHPC5MWFo&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Biology: A comparison of humans and baboons suggests germline mutation rates do not track cell divisions</title>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Felix L. Wu, Alva I. Strand, Laura A. Cox, Carole Ober, Jeffrey D. Wall, Priya Moorjani, Molly Przeworski&lt;/p&gt;

In humans, most germline mutations are inherited from the father. This observation has been widely interpreted as reflecting the replication errors that accrue during spermatogenesis. If so, the male bias in mutation should be substantially lower in a closely related species with similar rates of spermatogonial stem cell divisions but a shorter mean age of reproduction. To test this hypothesis, we resequenced two 3–4 generation nuclear families (totaling 29 individuals) of olive baboons (&lt;i&gt;Papio anubis&lt;/i&gt;), who reproduce at approximately 10 years of age on average, and analyzed the data in parallel with three 3-generation human pedigrees (26 individuals). We estimated a mutation rate per generation in baboons of 0.57×10&lt;sup&gt;−8&lt;/sup&gt; per base pair, approximately half that of humans. Strikingly, however, the degree of male bias in germline mutations is approximately 4:1, similar to that of humans—indeed, a similar male bias is seen across mammals that reproduce months, years, or decades after birth. These results mirror the finding in humans that the male mutation bias is stable with parental ages and cast further doubt on the assumption that germline mutations track cell divisions. Our mutation rate estimates for baboons raise a further puzzle, suggesting a divergence time between apes and Old World monkeys of 65 million years, too old to be consistent with the fossil record; reconciling them now requires not only a slowdown of the mutation rate per generation in humans but also in baboons.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/QGpYdxUwXag&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Biology: Extent and context dependence of pleiotropy revealed by high-throughput single-cell phenotyping</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~3/59QPqP1-vk8/article</link>

Pleiotropy—when a single mutation affects multiple traits—is a controversial topic with far-reaching implications. Pleiotropy plays a central role in debates about how complex traits evolve and whether biological systems are modular or are organized such that every gene has the potential to affect many traits. Pleiotropy is also critical to initiatives in evolutionary medicine that seek to trap infectious microbes or tumors by selecting for mutations that encourage growth in some conditions at the expense of others. Research in these fields, and others, would benefit from understanding the extent to which pleiotropy reflects inherent relationships among phenotypes that correlate no matter the perturbation (vertical pleiotropy). Alternatively, pleiotropy may result from genetic changes that impose correlations between otherwise independent traits (horizontal pleiotropy). We distinguish these possibilities by using clonal populations of yeast cells to quantify the inherent relationships between single-cell morphological features. Then, we demonstrate how often these relationships underlie vertical pleiotropy and how often these relationships are modified by genetic variants (quantitative trait loci [QTL]) acting via horizontal pleiotropy. Our comprehensive screen measures thousands of pairwise trait correlations across hundreds of thousands of yeast cells and reveals ample evidence of both vertical and horizontal pleiotropy. Additionally, we observe that the correlations between traits can change with the environment, genetic background, and cell-cycle position. These changing dependencies suggest a nuanced view of pleiotropy: biological systems demonstrate limited pleiotropy in any given context, but across contexts (e.g., across diverse environments and genetic backgrounds) each genetic change has the potential to influence a larger number of traits. Our method suggests that exploiting pleiotropy for applications in evolutionary medicine would benefit from focusing on traits with correlations that are less dependent on context.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/59QPqP1-vk8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience Research: Role of β3‐adrenergic receptor in the modulation of synaptic transmission and plasticity in mouse cerebellar cortex</title>

	<content:encoded>&lt;img alt=&quot;Role of β3‐adrenergic receptor in the modulation of synaptic transmission and plasticity in mouse cerebellar cortex&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/ecc76698-d57a-417b-b6e5-9dbc43346f7f/jnr24712-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The present study is the first to investigate the localization and function of β3‐adrenoreceptor (AR) in the mouse cerebellum. The immunohistochemical analysis allowed us to demonstrate that β3‐AR is mainly expressed on Purkinje cells. In addition, we found that blocking β3‐AR interfered with motor learning and synaptic plasticity at the parallel fiber–Purkinje cell. The molecular mechanisms underlying the β3‐AR action are likely related to the activation of the PI3K signaling pathway in Purkinje cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Convergent lines of evidence have recently highlighted β3‐adrenoreceptors (ARs) as a potentially critical target in the regulation of nervous and behavioral functions, including memory consolidation, anxiety, and depression. Nevertheless, the role of β3‐ARs in the cerebellum has been never investigated. To address this issue, we first examined the effects of pharmacological manipulation of β3‐ARs on motor learning in mice. We found that blockade of β3‐ARs by SR 59230A impaired the acquisition of the rotarod task with no effect on general locomotion. Since the parallel fiber–Purkinje cell (PF–PC) synapse is considered to be the main cerebellar locus of motor learning, we assessed β3‐AR modulatory action on this synapse as well as its expression in cerebellar slices. We demonstrate, for the first time, a strong expression of β3‐ARs on Purkinje cell soma and dendrites. In addition, whole‐cell patch‐clamp recordings revealed that bath application of β3‐AR agonist CL316,243 depressed the PF–PC excitatory postsynaptic currents via a postsynaptic mechanism mediated by the PI3K signaling pathway. Application of CL316,243 also interfered with the expression of PF long‐term potentiation, whereas SR 59230A prevented the induction of LTD at PF–PC synapse. These results underline the critical role of β3‐AR on cerebellar synaptic transmission and plasticity and provide a new mechanism for adrenergic modulation of motor learning.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neural Circuits: General Distributed Neural Control and Sensory Adaptation for Self-Organized Locomotion and Fast Adaptation to Damage of Walking Robots</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncir.2020.00046</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Walking animals such as invertebrates can effectively perform self-organized and robust locomotion. They can also quickly adapt their gait to deal with injury or damage. Such a complex achievement is mainly performed via coordination between the legs, commonly known as interlimb coordination. Several components underlying the interlimb coordination process (like distributed neural control circuits, local sensory feedback, and body-environment interactions during movement) have been recently identified and applied to the control systems of walking robots. However, while the sensory pathways of biological systems are plastic and can be continuously readjusted (referred to as sensory adaptation), those implemented on robots are typically static. They first need to be manually adjusted or optimized offline to obtain stable locomotion. In this study, we introduce a fast learning mechanism for online sensory adaptation. It can continuously adjust the strength of sensory pathways, thereby introducing flexible plasticity into the connections between sensory feedback and neural control circuits. We combine the sensory adaptation mechanism with distributed neural control circuits to acquire the adaptive and robust interlimb coordination of walking robots. This novel approach is also general and flexible. It can automatically adapt to different walking robots and allow them to perform stable self-organized locomotion as well as quickly deal with damage within a few walking steps. The adaptation of plasticity after damage or injury is considered here as lesion-induced plasticity. We validated our adaptive interlimb coordination approach with continuous online sensory adaptation on simulated 4-, 6-, 8-, and 20-legged robots. This study not only proposes an adaptive neural control system for artificial walking systems but also offers a possibility of invertebrate nervous systems with flexible plasticity for locomotion and adaptation to injury.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Cellular senescence has classically been associated with aging. Intriguingly, recent studies have also unraveled key roles for senescence in embryonic development, regeneration, and reprogramming. Developmental senescence has been reported during embryonic development in different organisms and structures, such as the endolymphatic duct during inner ear development of mammals and birds. However, there is no study addressing the possible role of senescence on otic neurogenesis. TGFβ/SMAD is the best-known pathway linked to the induction of developmentally programmed cell senescence. Here, we studied if TGFβ2 induces cellular senescence during acoustic-vestibular-ganglion (AVG) formation. Using organotypic cultures of AVG, and characterizing different stages of otic neurogenesis in the presence of TGFβ2 and a selective TGF-β receptor type-I inhibitor, we show that TGFβ2 exerts a powerful action in inner ear neurogenesis but, contrary to what we recently observed during endolymphatic duct development, these actions are independent of cellular senescence. We show that TGFβ2 reduces proliferation, and induces differentiation and neuritogenesis of neuroblasts, without altering cell death. Our studies highlight the roles of TGFβ2 and cellular senescence in the precise regulation of cell fate within the developing inner ear and its different cell types, being their mechanisms of action highly cell-type dependent.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Sex mediates relationships between regional tau pathology and cognitive decline</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25878?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal of this study was to examine sex differences in tau distribution across the brain of older adults, using positron emission tomography (PET), and investigate how these differences might associate with cognitive trajectories.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Participants were 343 clinically‐normal individuals (Female,58%; 73.8[8.5] years) and 55 individuals with MCI (Female,38%; 76.9[7.3] years) from the Harvard Aging Brain Study and the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. We examined &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F‐Flortaucipir (FTP)‐PET signal across 41 cortical and subcortical regions of interest (ROIs). Linear regression models estimated the effect of sex on FTP‐signal for each ROI after adjusting for age and cohort. We also examined interactions between sex*Aβ‐PET(+/‐) and sex*APOEε4 status. Linear mixed models estimated the moderating effect of sex on the relationship between a composite of sex‐differentiated tau ROIs and cognitive decline.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Females showed significantly higher FTP‐signal than males across multiple regions of the cortical mantle (p&amp;lt;0.007). Aβ‐moderated sex differences in tau signal were localized to medial and inferio‐lateral temporal regions (p&amp;lt;0.007); Aβ+ females exhibited greater FTP‐signal than other groups. APOEε4‐moderated sex differences in FTP‐signal were only found in the lateral occipital lobe. Females with higher FTP‐signal in composite ROI exhibited faster cognitive decline than males (p=0.04).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tau vulnerability in females is not just limited to the medial temporal lobe and significantly contributed to greater risk of faster cognitive decline. Interactive effects of sex and Aβ were predominantly localized in the temporal lobe, however, sex differences in extra‐temporal tau highlights the possibility of accelerated tau proliferation in females with the onset of clinical symptomatology.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Remote Blood Biomarkers of Longitudinal Cognitive Outcomes in a Population Study</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25874?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The longitudinal association of blood biomarkers of total tau (t‐tau), neurofilament light (Nf‐L), and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) with common sporadic AD and cognitive decline are not established.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using a single molecule array technology, ultrasensitive immunoassays for serum concentrations of total tau (t‐tau), neurofilament light (Nf‐L), and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) were measured in a population sample of 1,327 participants (60% African Americans and women) who had a clinical evaluation for AD, completed in‐home cognitive assessments, and undergone 1.5T structural MRI.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Higher concentrations of serum biomarkers were associated with the development of clinical AD, especially, the time‐specific associations were notable: t‐tau 8–16 years, and Nf‐L and GFAP 4–8 years prior to clinical AD. Serum biomarkers were associated with faster cognitive decline over 16 years: baseline t‐tau above 0.40 pg/mL had 30% faster decline, Nf‐L above 25.5 pg/mL had 110% faster decline, and GFAP above 232 pg/mL had 130% faster decline compared to those in the lowest quartile. Participants with baseline GFAP above 232 pg/mL showed 160% faster decline in hippocampal volume compared to those below 160 pg/mL. Additionally, higher baseline t‐tau was associated with faster increase in third ventricular volume, and baseline Nf‐L and GFAP were associated with faster decline in cortical thickness.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Serum t‐tau, Nf‐L, and GFAP predict the development of sporadic AD and cognitive decline, and changes in structural brain characteristics, suggesting their usefulness not only as screening and predictive biomarkers, but also in capturing the pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s dementia&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Application of the central nervous system (CNS)‐infiltrated immune cells induces a rapid increase in intracellular Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; in cultured naïve astrocytes through glial purinergic receptor‐mediated signaling. This provides an insight into the astroglial response to the immune cells in their local environment in CNS autoimmunity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interaction between autoreactive immune cells and astroglia is an important part of the pathologic processes that fuel neurodegeneration in multiple sclerosis. In this inflammatory disease, immune cells enter into the central nervous system (CNS) and they spread through CNS parenchyma, but the impact of these autoreactive immune cells on the activity pattern of astrocytes has not been defined. By exploiting naïve astrocytes in culture and CNS‐infiltrated immune cells (CNS IICs) isolated from rat with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), here we demonstrate previously unrecognized properties of immune cell–astrocyte interaction. We show that CNS IICs but not the peripheral immune cell application, evokes a rapid and vigorous intracellular Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; increase in astrocytes by promoting glial release of ATP. ATP propagated Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; elevation through glial purinergic P2X7 receptor activation by the hemichannel‐dependent nucleotide release mechanism. Astrocyte Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; increase is specifically triggered by the autoreactive CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T‐cell application and these two cell types exhibit close spatial interaction in EAE. Therefore, Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; signals may mediate a rapid astroglial response to the autoreactive immune cells in their local environment. This property of immune cell–astrocyte interaction may be important to consider in studies interrogating CNS autoimmune disease.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In multiple sclerosis (MS), a subset of chronic active white matter lesions are identifiable on MRI by their paramagnetic rims, and increasing evidence supports their association with clinical disease severity. Here we study their potential role in differential diagnosis, screening an international multicenter clinical research‐based sample of 438 individuals affected by different neurological conditions (MS, other inflammatory, infectious, and non‐inflammatory). Paramagnetic rim lesion detection, rarely occurring in other neurological conditions (52% of MS vs 7% of non‐MS cases), yielded high specificity (93%) in differentiating MS from non‐MS. Future prospective multicenter studies should further validate its role as a diagnostic biomarker.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Immunohistochemical staining for vesicular glutamate transporter 2 reveals the glomeruli in the main olfactory bulb of the brain of the African wild dog. Stereological estimates of the numbers of glomeruli reveal that the African wild dog has up to 1700 glomeruli. Scale bar = 250 μm.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Employing a range of neuroanatomical stains, we detail the organization of the main and accessory olfactory systems of the African wild dog. The organization of both these systems follow that typically observed in mammals, but variations of interest were noted. Within the main olfactory bulb, the size of the glomeruli, at approximately 350 μm in diameter, are on the larger end of the range observed across mammals. In addition, we estimate that approximately 3,500 glomeruli are present in each main olfactory bulb. This larger main olfactory bulb glomerular size and number of glomeruli indicates that enhanced peripheral processing of a broad range of odorants is occurring in the main olfactory bulb of the African wild dog. Within the accessory olfactory bulb, the glomeruli did not appear distinct, rather forming a homogenous syncytia‐like arrangement as seen in the domestic dog. In addition, the laminar organization of the deeper layers of the accessory olfactory bulb was indistinct, perhaps as a consequence of the altered architecture of the glomeruli. This arrangement of glomeruli indicates that rather than parcellating the processing of semiochemicals peripherally, these odorants may be processed in a more nuanced and combinatorial manner in the periphery, allowing for more rapid and precise behavioural responses as required in the highly social group structure observed in the African wild dog. While having a similar organization to that of other mammals, the olfactory system of the African wild dog has certain features that appear to correlate to their environmental niche.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Vector control has been a key component in the fight against malaria for decades, and chemical insecticides are critical to the success of vector control programs worldwide. However, increasing resistance to insecticides threatens to undermine these efforts. Understanding the evolution and propagation of resistance is thus imperative to mitigating loss of intervention effectiveness. Additionally, accelerated research and development of new tools that can be deployed alongside existing vector control strategies is key to eradicating malaria in the near future. Methods such as gene drives that aim to genetically modify large mosquito populations in the wild to either render them refractory to malaria or impair their reproduction may prove invaluable tools. Mathematical models of gene flow in populations, which is the transfer of genetic information from one population to another through migration, can offer invaluable insight into the behavior and potential impact of gene drives as well as the spread of insecticide resistance in the wild. Here, we present the first multi-locus, agent-based model of vector genetics that accounts for mutations and a many-to-many mapping cardinality of genotypes to phenotypes to investigate gene flow, and the propagation of gene drives in Anopheline populations. This model is embedded within a large scale individual-based model of malaria transmission representative of a high burden, high transmission setting characteristic of the Sahel. Results are presented for the selection of insecticide-resistant vectors and the spread of resistance through repeated deployment of insecticide treated nets (ITNs), in addition to scenarios where gene drives act in concert with existing vector control tools such as ITNs. The roles of seasonality, spatial distribution of vector habitat and feed sites, and existing vector control in propagating alleles that confer phenotypic traits via gene drives that result in reduced transmission are explored. The ability to model a spectrum of vector species with different genotypes and phenotypes in the context of malaria transmission allows us to test deployment strategies for existing interventions that reduce the deleterious effects of resistance and allows exploration of the impact of new tools being proposed or developed.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/bTY4nEQilzM&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: A computational model of induced pluripotent stem-cell derived cardiomyocytes for high throughput risk stratification of KCNQ1 genetic variants</title>

In the last decade, there has been tremendous progress in identifying genetic anomalies linked to clinical disease. New experimental platforms have connected genetic variants to mechanisms underlying disruption of cellular and organ behavior and the emergence of proarrhythmic cardiac phenotypes. The development of induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (iPSC-CMs) signifies an important advance in the study of genetic disease in a patient-specific context. However, considerable limitations of iPSC-CM technologies have not been addressed: 1) phenotypic variability in apparently identical genotype perturbations, 2) low-throughput electrophysiological measurements, and 3) an immature phenotype which may impact translation to adult cardiac response. We have developed a computational approach intended to address these problems. We applied our recent iPSC-CM computational model to predict the proarrhythmic risk of 40 KCNQ1 genetic variants. An I&lt;sub&gt;Ks&lt;/sub&gt; computational model was fit to experimental data for each mutation, and the impact of each mutation was simulated in a population of iPSC-CM models. Using a test set of 15 KCNQ1 mutations with known clinical long QT phenotypes, we developed a method to stratify the effects of KCNQ1 mutations based on proarrhythmic markers. We utilized this method to predict the severity of the remaining 25 KCNQ1 mutations with unknown clinical significance. Tremendous phenotypic variability was observed in the iPSC-CM model population following mutant perturbations. A key novelty is our reporting of the impact of individual KCNQ1 mutant models on adult ventricular cardiomyocyte electrophysiology, allowing for prediction of mutant impact across the continuum of aging. This serves as a first step toward translating predicted response in the iPSC-CM model to predicted response of the adult ventricular myocyte given the same genetic mutation. As a whole, this study presents a new computational framework that serves as a high throughput method to evaluate risk of genetic mutations based-on proarrhythmic behavior in phenotypically variable populations.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/cDA4WPN2SKQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Antibiotic resistance is rising and we urgently need to gain a better quantitative understanding of how antibiotics act, which in turn would also speed up the development of new antibiotics. Here, we describe a computational model (COMBAT-COmputational Model of Bacterial Antibiotic Target-binding) that can quantitatively predict antibiotic dose-response relationships. Our goal is dual: We address a fundamental biological question and investigate how drug-target binding shapes antibiotic action. We also create a tool that can predict antibiotic efficacy a priori. COMBAT requires measurable biochemical parameters of drug-target interaction and can be directly fitted to time-kill curves. As a proof-of-concept, we first investigate the utility of COMBAT with antibiotics belonging to the widely used quinolone class. COMBAT can predict antibiotic efficacy in clinical isolates for quinolones from drug affinity (R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;gt;0.9). To further challenge our approach, we also do the reverse: estimate the magnitude of changes in drug-target binding based on antibiotic dose-response curves. We overexpress target molecules to infer changes in antibiotic-target binding from changes in antimicrobial efficacy of ciprofloxacin with 92–94% accuracy. To test the generality of our approach, we use the beta-lactam ampicillin to predict target molecule occupancy at MIC from antimicrobial action with 90% accuracy. Finally, we apply COMBAT to predict antibiotic concentrations that can select for resistance due to novel resistance mutations. Using ciprofloxacin and ampicillin as well defined test cases, our work demonstrates that drug-target binding is a major predictor of bacterial responses to antibiotics. This is surprising because antibiotic action involves many additional effects downstream of drug-target binding. In addition, COMBAT provides a framework to inform optimal antibiotic dose levels that maximize efficacy and minimize the rise of resistant mutants.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/RlDIbe95eSM&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Inference of admixture proportions is a classical statistical problem in population genetics. Standard methods implicitly assume that both parents of an individual have the same admixture fraction. However, this is rarely the case in real data. In this paper we show that the distribution of admixture tract lengths in a genome contains information about the admixture proportions of the ancestors of an individual. We develop a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) framework for estimating the admixture proportions of the immediate ancestors of an individual, i.e. a type of decomposition of an individual’s admixture proportions into further subsets of ancestral proportions in the ancestors. Based on a genealogical model for admixture tracts, we develop an efficient algorithm for computing the sampling probability of the genome from a single individual, as a function of the admixture proportions of the ancestors of this individual. This allows us to perform probabilistic inference of admixture proportions of ancestors only using the genome of an extant individual. We perform extensive simulations to quantify the error in the estimation of ancestral admixture proportions under various conditions. To illustrate the utility of the method, we apply it to real genetic data.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/QimDbNlEa14&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Genetic studies have recently highlighted the importance of fat distribution, as well as overall adiposity, in the pathogenesis of obesity-associated diseases. Using a large study (n = 1,288) from 4 independent cohorts, we aimed to investigate the relationship between mean adipocyte area and obesity-related traits, and identify genetic factors associated with adipocyte cell size. To perform the first large-scale study of automatic adipocyte phenotyping using both histological and genetic data, we developed a deep learning-based method, the Adipocyte U-Net, to rapidly derive mean adipocyte area estimates from histology images. We validate our method using three state-of-the-art approaches; CellProfiler, Adiposoft and floating adipocytes fractions, all run blindly on two external cohorts. We observe high concordance between our method and the state-of-the-art approaches (Adipocyte U-net vs. CellProfiler: &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;visceral&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.94, &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 2.2 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−16&lt;/sup&gt;, &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;subcutaneous&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.91, &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 2.2 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−16&lt;/sup&gt;), and faster run times (10,000 images: 6mins vs 3.5hrs). We applied the Adipocyte U-Net to 4 cohorts with histology, genetic, and phenotypic data (total N = 820). After meta-analysis, we found that mean adipocyte area positively correlated with body mass index (BMI) (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;subq&lt;/sub&gt; = 8.13 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−69&lt;/sup&gt;, β&lt;sub&gt;subq&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.45; &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;visc&lt;/sub&gt; = 2.5 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−55&lt;/sup&gt;, β&lt;sub&gt;visc&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.49; average &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; across cohorts = 0.49) and that adipocytes in subcutaneous depots are larger than their visceral counterparts (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;meta&lt;/sub&gt; = 9.8 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−7&lt;/sup&gt;). Lastly, we performed the largest GWAS and subsequent meta-analysis of mean adipocyte area and intra-individual adipocyte variation (N = 820). Despite having twice the number of samples than any similar study, we found no genome-wide significant associations, suggesting that larger sample sizes and a homogenous collection of adipose tissue are likely needed to identify robust genetic associations.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/2gUxo07LOqU&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Information transmission from NFkB signaling dynamics to gene expression</title>

The dynamic signal encoding paradigm suggests that information flows from the extracellular environment into specific signaling patterns (encoding) that are then read by downstream effectors to control cellular behavior. Previous work empirically quantified the information content of dynamic signaling patterns. However, whether this information can be faithfully transmitted to the gene expression level is unclear. Here we used NFkB signaling as a model to understand the accuracy of information transmission from signaling dynamics into gene expression. Using a detailed mathematical model, we simulated realistic NFkB signaling patterns with different degrees of variability. The NFkB patterns were used as an input to a simple gene expression model. Analysis of information transmission between ligand and NFkB and ligand and gene expression allows us to determine information loss in transmission between receptors to dynamic signaling patterns and between signaling dynamics to gene expression. Information loss could occur due to biochemical noise or due to a lack of specificity. We found that noise-free gene expression has very little information loss suggesting that gene expression can preserve specificity in NFkB patterns. As expected, the addition of noise to the gene expression model results in information loss. Interestingly, this effect can be mitigated by a specific choice of parameters that can substantially reduce information loss due to biochemical noise during gene expression. Overall our results show that the cellular capacity for information transmission from dynamic signaling patterns to gene expression can be high enough to preserve ligand specificity and thereby the accuracy of cellular response to environmental cues.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/wDtY4jRy0Sw&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Biology: Ratiometric quorum sensing governs the trade-off between bacterial vertical and horizontal antibiotic resistance propagation</title>

Plasmid-mediated horizontal gene transfer of antibiotic resistance and virulence in pathogenic bacteria underlies a major public health issue. Understanding how, in the absence of antibiotic-mediated selection, plasmid-bearing cells avoid being outnumbered by plasmid-free cells is key to developing counterstrategies. Here, we quantified the induction of the plasmidial sex pheromone pathway of &lt;i&gt;Enterococcus faecalis&lt;/i&gt; to show that the integration of the stimulatory (mate-sensing) and inhibitory (self-sensing) signaling modules from the pCF10 conjugative plasmid provides a precise measure of the recipient-to-donor ratio, agnostic to variations in population size. Such ratiometric control of conjugation favors vertical plasmid transfer under low mating likelihood and allows activation of conjugation functions only under high mating likelihood. We further show that this strategy constitutes a cost-effective investment into mating effort because overstimulation produces unproductive self-aggregation and growth rate reduction. A mathematical model suggests that ratiometric control of conjugation increases plasmid fitness and predicts a robust long-term, stable coexistence of donors and recipients. Our results demonstrate how population-level parameters can control transfer of antibiotic resistance in bacteria, opening the door for biotic control strategies.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/RVMc99MAxj4&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Is Rapid Eye Movement Sleep Behavior Disorder a Risk Factor for Impulse Control Disorder in Parkinson Disease?</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25798?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To assess the association between rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (RBD) and other determinants and incident impulse control disorder behaviors (ICBs) in patients with early Parkinson disease (PD) using longitudinal data from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Four hundred one newly diagnosed PD patients were prospectively evaluated at baseline (BL), month 6, and annually for 5 years. Probable RBD (pRBD) was assessed with the RBD Screening Questionnaire (RBDSQ) and dichotomized using a cutoff value of ≥6. The association of BL and time‐dependent (TD) pRBD and other covariates with the development of ICB symptoms was evaluated using Cox proportional hazards regression and general estimating equation logistic regression. Models considered adjustment for age, sex, Movement Disorders Society Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale part III, Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS‐15), RBD medication use, total levodopa equivalent daily dose, and dopamine agonist (DA) and antidepressant medication use.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both BL pRBD and TD pRBD were not associated with an increased risk for incident ICB symptoms after adjustment for covariates (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] = 1.17, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.458 and HR = 1.27, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.257, respectively). In a modified TD pRBD model (ie, considering subjects as pRBD onward from the first time point with RBDSQ score ≥ 6), the risk for incident ICB symptoms was higher in pRBD in unadjusted (HR = 1.48, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.038) but not adjusted (HR = 1.29, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.203) models. TD DA use (HR = 1.64, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.039), TD GDS‐15 score (HR = 1.12, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001), and male sex (year 3: HR = 2.10, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.009; year 4: HR = 3.04, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.006; year 5: HR = 4.40, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.007) were associated with increased ICB symptom risk.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;pRBD is not clearly associated with ICB symptom development in early PD, in contrast to DA use, depression, and male sex. ANN NEUROL 2020&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Pathomechanisms and Clinical Implications of Myasthenic Syndromes Exacerbated and Induced by Medical Treatments</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2020.00156</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Myasthenic syndromes are typically characterized by muscle weakness and increased fatigability due to an impaired transmission at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ). Most cases are caused by acquired autoimmune conditions such as myasthenia gravis (MG), typically with antibodies against the acetylcholine receptor (AChR). Different drugs are among the major factors that may complicate pre-existing autoimmune myasthenic conditions by further impairing transmission at the NMJ. Some clinical observations are substantiated by experimental data, indicating that presynaptic, postsynaptic or more complex pathomechanisms at the NMJ may be involved, depending on the individual compound. Most robust data exist for the risks associated with some antibiotics (e.g., aminoglycosides, ketolides, fluoroquinolones) and cardiovascular medications (e.g., class Ia antiarrhythmics, beta blockers). Apart from primarily autoimmune-mediated disorders of the NMJ, de novo myasthenic manifestations may also be triggered by medical treatments that induce an autoimmune reaction. Most notably, there is growing evidence that the immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI), a modern class of drugs to treat various malignancies, represent a relevant risk factor to develop severe and progressive medication-induced myasthenia via an immune-mediated mechanism. From a clinical perspective, it is of utmost importance for the treating physicians to be aware of such adverse treatment effects and their consequences. In this article, we aim to summarize existing evidence regarding the key molecular and immunological mechanisms as well as the clinical implications of medication-aggravated and medication-induced myasthenic syndromes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Neuronal Signaling Involved in Neuronal Polarization and Growth: Lipid Rafts and Phosphorylation</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2020.00150</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Neuronal polarization and growth are developmental processes that occur during neuronal cell differentiation. The molecular signaling mechanisms involved in these events in in vivo mammalian brain remain unclear. Also, cellular events of the neuronal polarization process within a given neuron are thought to be constituted of many independent intracellular signal transduction pathways (the “tug-of-war” model). However, in vivo results suggest that such pathways should be cooperative with one another among a given group of neurons in a region of the brain. Lipid rafts, specific membrane domains with low fluidity, are candidates for the hotspots of such intracellular signaling. Among the signals reported to be involved in polarization, a number are thought to be present or translocated to the lipid rafts in response to extracellular signals. As part of our analysis, we discuss how such novel molecular mechanisms are combined for effective regulation of neuronal polarization and growth, focusing on the significance of the lipid rafts, including results based on recently introduced methods.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>
