	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1803.04738</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Inferring directional connectivity from point process data of multiple
elements is desired in various scientific fields such as neuroscience,
geography, economics, etc. Here, we propose an inference procedure for this
goal based on the kinetic Ising model. The procedure is composed of two steps:
(1) determination of the time-bin size for transforming the point-process data
to discrete time binary data and (2) screening of relevant couplings from the
estimated networks. For these, we develop simple methods based on information
theory and computational statistics. Applications to data from artificial and
\textit{in vitro} neuronal networks show that the proposed procedure performs
fairly well when identifying relevant couplings, including the discrimination
of their signs, with low computational cost. These results highlight the
potential utility of the kinetic Ising model to analyze real interacting
systems with event occurrences.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Compact Convolutional Neural Networks for Classification of Asynchronous Steady-state Visual Evoked Potentials. (arXiv:1803.04566v1 [cs.LG])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1803.04566</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Steady-State Visual Evoked Potentials (SSVEPs) are neural oscillations from
the parietal and occipital regions of the brain that are evoked from flickering
visual stimuli. SSVEPs are robust signals measurable in the
electroencephalogram (EEG) and are commonly used in brain-computer interfaces
(BCIs). However, methods for high-accuracy decoding of SSVEPs usually require
hand-crafted approaches that leverage domain-specific knowledge of the stimulus
signals, such as specific temporal frequencies in the visual stimuli and their
relative spatial arrangement. When this knowledge is unavailable, such as when
SSVEP signals are acquired asynchronously, such approaches tend to fail. In
this paper, we show how a compact convolutional neural network (Compact-CNN),
which only requires raw EEG signals for automatic feature extraction, can be
used to decode signals from a 12-class SSVEP dataset without the need for any
domain-specific knowledge or calibration data. We report across subject mean
accuracy of approximately 80% (chance being 8.3%) and show this is
substantially better than current state-of-the-art hand-crafted approaches
using canonical correlation analysis (CCA) and Combined-CCA. Furthermore, we
analyze our Compact-CNN to examine the underlying feature representation,
discovering that the deep learner extracts additional phase and amplitude
related features associated with the structure of the dataset. We discuss how
our Compact-CNN shows promise for BCI applications that allow users to freely
gaze/attend to any stimulus at any time (e.g., asynchronous BCI) as well as
provides a method for analyzing SSVEP signals in a way that might augment our
understanding about the basic processing in the visual cortex.

	<content:encoded>&lt;h3&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Objectives&lt;/b&gt;: Friedreich's ataxia is an incurable inherited neurological disease caused by frataxin deficiency. Here we report the neuro-reparative effects of myeloablative allogeneic bone marrow transplantation in a humanised murine model of the disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Methods&lt;/b&gt;: Mice received a transplant of fluorescently-tagged sex mis-matched bone marrow cells expressing wild-type frataxin and were assessed at monthly intervals using a range of behavioural motor performance tests. At six months post-transplant, mice were sacrificed for protein and histological analysis. In an attempt to augment numbers of bone marrow-derived cells integrating within the nervous system and improve therapeutic efficacy, a sub-group of transplanted mice also received monthly subcutaneous infusions of cytokines granulocyte-colony stimulating factor and stem cell factor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Results&lt;/b&gt;: Transplantation caused improvements in several indicators of motor coordination and locomotor activity. Elevations in frataxin levels and anti-oxidant defences were detected. Abrogation of disease pathology throughout the nervous system was apparent, together with extensive integration of bone marrow-derived cells in areas of nervous tissue injury that contributed genetic material to mature neurons, satellite-like cells and myelinating Schwann cells by processes including cell fusion. Elevations in circulating bone marrow-derived cell numbers were detected post-cytokine administration and were associated with increased frequencies of Purkinje cell fusion and bone marrow-derived dorsal root ganglion satellite-like cells. Further improvements in motor coordination and activity were evident.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Interpretation&lt;/b&gt;: Our data provide proof-of-concept of gene replacement therapy, via allogeneic bone marrow transplantation, that reverses neurological features of Friedreich's ataxia with the potential for rapid clinical translation.

	<content:encoded>&lt;h3&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neurosurgery is an under-utilised treatment that can potentially cure drug-refractory epilepsy. Careful, multidisciplinary pre-surgical evaluation is vital for selecting patients and ensure optimal outcomes. Advances in neuroimaging have improved diagnosis and guide surgical intervention. Invasive electroencephalography allows the evaluation of complex patients who would otherwise not be candidates for neurosurgery. We review the current state of the assessment and selection of patients and consider established and novel surgical procedures, and associated outcome data. We aim to dispel myths that may inhibit physicians from referring and patients from considering neurosurgical intervention for drug-refractory focal epilepsies.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: De Novo Hotspot Variants in CYFIP2 Cause Early-Onset Epileptic Encephalopathy</title>
	<link>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25208</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h3&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Objective&lt;/b&gt;: The cytoplasmic fragile X mental retardation 1 interacting proteins 2 (CYFIP2) is a component of the WAVE regulatory complex, which is involved in actin dynamics. An obvious association of &lt;em&gt;CYFIP2&lt;/em&gt; variants with human neurological disorders has never been reported. Here, we identified &lt;em&gt;de novo&lt;/em&gt; hotspot &lt;em&gt;CYFIP2&lt;/em&gt; variants in neurodevelopmental disorders and explore the possible involvement of the CYFIP2 mutants in the WAVE signaling pathway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Methods&lt;/b&gt;: We performed trio-based whole exome sequencing (WES) in 210 families and case-only WES in 489 individuals with epileptic encephalopathies. The functional effect of &lt;em&gt;CYFIP2&lt;/em&gt; variants on WAVE signaling was evaluated by computational structural analysis and in vitro transfection experiments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Results&lt;/b&gt;: We identified three &lt;em&gt;de novo CYFIP2&lt;/em&gt; variants at the Arg87 residue in four unrelated individuals with early-onset epileptic encephalopathy. Structural analysis indicated that the Arg87 residue is buried at an interface between CYFIP2 and WAVE1, and the Arg87 variant may disrupt hydrogen bonding, leading to structural instability and aberrant activation of the WAVE regulatory complex. All mutant CYFIP2 showed comparatively weaker interactions to the VCA domain than wild type CYFIP2. Immunofluorescence revealed that ectopic speckled accumulation of actin and CYFIP2 was significantly increased in cells transfected with mutant CYFIP2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Interpretation&lt;/b&gt;: Our findings suggest that &lt;em&gt;de novo&lt;/em&gt; Arg87 variants in &lt;em&gt;CYFIP2&lt;/em&gt; have gain-of-function effects on the WAVE signaling pathway, and are associated with severe neurological disorders.

Studies using anatomical, electrophysiological, imaging and optogenetic approaches revealed that the CEA network consists of recurrent inhibitory circuits comprised of precisely connected functionally and genetically defined cell types that can select and control specific behavioral outputs [3,4,5&lt;sup&gt;•&lt;/sup&gt;,6&lt;sup&gt;•&lt;/sup&gt;,7–9,11,12]. While bivalent functionality of the CEA in adaptive behavior has been clearly demonstrated, we are just beginning to understand to which degree individual CEA circuit elements are functionally segregated or overlapping. Importantly, recent studies seem to suggest that optogenetic manipulations of the same, or overlapping cell populations can give rise to distinct, or sometimes even opposite, behavioral phenotypes [5&lt;sup&gt;•&lt;/sup&gt;,6&lt;sup&gt;•&lt;/sup&gt;,9–12]. In this review, we discuss recent progress in our understanding of how defined CEA circuits can control defensive and appetitive behaviors, and how seemingly contradictory results could point to an integrated concept of CEA function. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content:encoded>

These limitations reflect what has been dichotomy between the structure and mechanical properties of living brain tissue and non-living neural probes. To bridge the gap between neural and electronic networks, we have introduced the new concept of mesh electronics probes designed with structural and mechanical properties such that the implant begins to ‘look and behave’ like neural tissue. Syringe-implanted mesh electronics have led to the realization of probes that are neuro-attractive and free of the chronic immune response, as well as capable of stable long-term mapping and modulation of brain activity at the single-neuron level. This review provides a historical overview of a 10-year development of mesh electronics by highlighting the tissue-like design, syringe-assisted delivery, seamless neural tissue integration, and single-neuron level chronic recording stability of mesh electronics. We also offer insights on unique near-term opportunities and future directions for neuroscience and neurology that now are available or expected for mesh electronics neurotechnologies. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content:encoded>

Human neuroimaging studies consistently show a hunger-dependent, selective enhancement of responses to images of food in association cortex and amygdala. More recently, cellular-resolution imaging combined with circuit mapping experiments in behaving mice have revealed underlying neuronal population dynamics and enabled tracing of pathways by which hunger circuits influence the assignment of value to visual objects in visual association cortex, insular cortex, and amygdala. These experiments begin to provide a mechanistic understanding of motivation-specific neural processing of need-relevant cues in healthy humans and in disease states such as obesity and other eating disorders. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content:encoded>

A recent explosion of technical advances in genome-editing and single-cell sequencing has enabled lineage analysis in an unprecedented scale, speed, and depth across different species.

Recent research has focused on defining the neural circuits that mediate separable features of depression in patients and preclinical animal models, and connections between frontal cortex and brainstem neuromodulators have emerged as candidate targets. The development of methods permitting recording and manipulation of neural circuits defined by connectivity has enabled the investigation of prefrontal-neuromodulatory circuit dynamics in animal models of depression with exquisite precision, a systems-level approach that has brought new insights by integrating these fields of depression research. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content:encoded>

Safe propagation of action potentials relies on specific ion channel expression at strategic points of the axon such as nodes of Ranvier or axonal branch points. However, while action potentials are generally considered as the quantum of neuronal information, their signaling is not entirely digital. In fact, both their shape and their conduction speed have been shown to be modulated by activity, leading to regulations of synaptic latency and synaptic strength. We report here newly identified mechanisms of (1) safe spike propagation along the axon, (2) compartmentalization of action potential shape in the axon, (3) analog modulation of spike-evoked synaptic transmission and (4) alteration in conduction time after persistent regulation of axon morphology in central neurons. We discuss the contribution of these regulations in information processing. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content:encoded>

This neural activity reflects internal processes by which the brain plans and executes volitional movements. The study of motor planning offers an opportunity to understand how the structure and dynamics of neural circuits support persistent internal states and how these states influence behavior. Recent advances in large-scale neural recordings are beginning to decipher the relationship of the dynamics of populations of neurons during motor planning and movements. New behavioral tasks in rodents, together with quantified perturbations, link dynamics in specific nodes of neural circuits to behavior. These studies reveal a neural network distributed across multiple brain regions that collectively supports motor planning. We review recent advances and highlight areas where further work is needed to achieve a deeper understanding of the mechanisms underlying motor planning and related cognitive processes. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content:encoded>

To be effective, these systems must be able to simultaneously record and stimulate neural activity, a task made difficult by persistent stimulation artifacts that distort and obscure underlying biomarkers. To enable simultaneous stimulation and recording, several techniques have been proposed. These techniques involve artifact-preventing system configurations, resilient recording front-ends, and back-end signal processing for removing recorded artifacts. Co-designing and integrating these artifact cancellation techniques will be key to enabling neuromodulation systems to stimulate and record at the same time. Here, we review the state-of-the-art for these techniques and their role in achieving artifact-free neuromodulation. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content:encoded>

Microelectrode arrays based on complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) technology, such as Neuropixels probes, look set to transform these methods. Neuropixels probes provide ∼1000 recording sites on an extremely narrow shank, with on-board amplification, digitization, and multiplexing. They deliver low-noise recordings from hundreds of neurons, providing a step change in the type of data available to neuroscientists. Here we discuss the opportunities afforded by these probes for large-scale electrophysiology, the challenges associated with data processing and anatomical localization, and avenues for further improvements of the technology. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content:encoded>

With vast cell number and diversity, mammalian nervous systems present a daunting challenge for achieving specific and comprehensive cell type access—prerequisite to circuit analysis. Genetic approaches in the mouse have relied on germline engineering to access marker-defined cell populations. Combinatorial strategies that engage marker intersection, anatomy and projection pattern (e.g. antero-grade and retro-grade viral vectors), and developmental lineage substantially increase the specificity of cell type targeting. While increasing number of mouse cell types are becoming experimentally accessible, comprehensive coverage requires larger coordinated efforts with strategic infrastructural and fiscal planning. CRISPR-based genome editing may enable cell type access in other species, but issues of time, cost and ethics remain, especially for primates. Novel approaches that bypass the germline, such as somatic cell engineering and cell surface-based gene delivery, may reduce the barrier of genetic access to mammalian cell types. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content:encoded>

Despite extensive characterization of individual brain areas involved in parental care, we do not fully understand how discrete aspects of this behavior are orchestrated at the neural circuit level. Recent progress in identifying genetically specified neuronal populations critical for parenting, and the use of genetic and viral tools for circuit-cracking now allow us to deconstruct the underlying circuitry and, thus, to elucidate how different aspects of parental care are controlled. Here we review the latest advances, outline possible organizational principles of parental circuits and discuss future challenges. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content:encoded>

Pre-clinical investigations implicate modulation of the cortico-basal ganglia network in these therapeutic effects, and this mechanistic understanding is necessary to optimize stimulation paradigms. Recently, the principle that neuromodulation can reverse drug-evoked synaptic plasticity and reduce behavioral symptoms of addiction has inspired novel stimulation paradigms that have long-term effects in animal models. Pre-clinical studies have also raised the possibility that tailoring neuromodulation protocols can modulate distinct symptoms of addiction. Combining mechanistic knowledge of circuit dysfunction with emerging technologies for non-invasive neuromodulation holds promise for developing therapies for addiction and related disorders. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content:encoded>

We review recent research through this lens, and provide practical guidance for researchers in the decision-making field. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content:encoded>

These platforms leverage basic advances in biocompatible materials, semiconductor device designs and systems engineering concepts to afford modes of operation that are qualitatively distinct from those of conventional approaches that tether animals to external hardware by means of optical fibers, electrical cables and/or fluidic tubing. Neuroscience studies that exploit the unique features of these technologies enable insights into neural function through targeted stimulation, inhibition and recording, with spatially and genetically precise manipulation of neural circuit activity. Experimental possibilities include studies in naturalistic, three dimensional environments, investigations of pair-wise or group related social interactions and many other scenarios of interest that cannot be addressed using traditional hardware. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content:encoded>

In this review, we will discuss recent human and rodent studies showing the sex-specific involvement of the neuropeptides vasopressin and oxytocin in social and anxiety-related behaviors. We discuss that sex differences can be evident at pre-pubertal ages as seen in the sex-specific regulation of social recognition, social play, and anxiety by the vasopressin system in juvenile rats. We further discuss that the oxytocin system in humans and rodents alters brain activation, anxiety, and sociosexual motivation in sex-specific ways. Finally, we propose that knowledge of vasopressin and oxytocin mediated sex-specific brain mechanisms can provide essential insights into how these neuropeptide systems contribute to sex-specific vulnerability as well as resilience to perturbations, with subsequent relevance to social and emotional disorders. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content:encoded>

Individual network components in the mushroom bodies of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster represent cues, learning signals and behavioral outcomes of learned experience. Recent findings have highlighted the importance of dopamine-driven plasticity and activity in feedback and feedforward connections, between various elements of the mushroom body neural network. These computational motifs have been shown to be crucial for long term olfactory memory consolidation, integration of internal states, re-evaluation and updating of learned information. The often recurrent circuit anatomy and a prolonged requirement for activity in parts of these underlying networks, suggest that self-sustained and precisely timed activity is a fundamental feature of network computations in the insect brain. Together these processes allow flies to continuously adjust the content of their learned knowledge and direct their behavior in a way that best represents learned expectations and serves their most pressing current needs. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content:encoded>

These devices, usually sensing cell activity via microelectrodes, should be characterized by safe working conditions in the biological milieu together with a well-controlled operation-life. The stable device/neuronal electrical coupling at the interface requires tight interactions between the electrode surface and the cell membrane. This neuro-electrode hybrid represents the hyphen between the soft nature of neural tissue, generating electrical signals via ion motions, and the rigid realm of microelectronics and medical devices, dealing with electrons in motion. Efficient integration of these entities is essential for monitoring, analyzing and controlling neuronal signaling but poses significant technological challenges. Improving the cell/electrode interaction and thus the interface performance requires novel engineering of (nano)materials: tuning at the nanoscale electrode's properties may lead to engineer interfacing probes that better camouflaged with their biological target. In this brief review, we highlight the most recent concepts in nanotechnologies and nanomaterials that might help reducing the mismatch between tissue and electrode, focusing on the device's mechanical properties and its biological integration with the tissue. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content:encoded>

Many such works posit that input from entorhinal grid cells is critical to the formation of place fields, a prediction that has received mixed experimental support. Potentially reconciling seemingly conflicting findings is recent work indicating that subpopulations of pyramidal neurons are functionally distinct and may be driven to varying degrees by different inputs. Additionally, new studies have demonstrated that hippocampal principal neurons encode a myriad of features extending beyond current position. Here, we highlight recent evidence for how extensive heterogeneity in connectivity and genetic expression could interact with membrane biophysics to enable place cells to encode a diverse range of stimuli. These recent findings highlight the need for more computational models that integrate these heterogeneous features of hippocampal principal neurons. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content:encoded>

Excitability of neuronal networks is particularly sensitive to ion and water homeostasis. In line with this, reports of seizures and epilepsy in MLC patients exist. However, systematic assessment and mechanistic understanding of seizures in MLC are lacking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25190-sec-0002&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;We analyzed an MLC patient inventory to study occurrence of seizures in MLC. We used two distinct genetic mouse models of MLC to further study epileptiform activity and seizure threshold through wireless extracellular field potential recordings. Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings and K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-sensitive electrode recordings in mouse brain slices were used to explore the underlying mechanisms of epilepsy in MLC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25190-sec-0003&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;An early onset of seizures is common in MLC. Similarly, in MLC mice, we uncovered spontaneous epileptiform brain activity and a lowered threshold for induced seizures. At the cellular level, we found that although passive and active properties of individual pyramidal neurons are unchanged, extracellular K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; dynamics and neuronal network activity are abnormal in MLC mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25190-sec-0004&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disturbed astrocyte regulation of ion and water homeostasis in MLC causes hyperexcitability of neuronal networks and seizures. These findings suggest a role for defective astrocyte volume regulation in epilepsy. Ann Neurol 2018&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Activation of pial and dural macrophages and dendritic cells by cortical spreading depression</title>
	<link>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1002%2Fana.25169</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25169-sec-0001&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Objective&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cortical spreading depression (CSD) has long been implicated in migraine attacks with aura. The process by which CSD, a cortical event that occurs within the blood–brain barrier (BBB), results in nociceptor activation outside the BBB is likely mediated by multiple molecules and cells. The objective of this study was to determine whether CSD activates immune cells inside the BBB (pia), outside the BBB (dura), or in both, and if so, when.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25169-sec-0002&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investigating cellular events in the meninges shortly after CSD, we used &lt;em&gt;in vivo&lt;/em&gt; two-photon imaging to identify changes in macrophages and dendritic cells (DCs) that reside in the pia, arachnoid, and dura and their anatomical relationship to TRPV1 axons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25169-sec-0003&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;We found that activated meningeal macrophages retract their processes and become circular, and that activated meningeal DCs stop migrating. We found that CSD activates pial macrophages instantaneously, pial, subarachnoid, and dural DCs 6-12 minutes later, and dural macrophages 20 minutes later. Dural macrophages and DCs can appear in close proximity to TRPV1-positive axons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25169-sec-0004&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The findings suggest that activation of pial macrophages may be more relevant to cases where aura and migraine begin simultaneously, that activation of dural macrophages may be more relevant to cases where headache begins 20 to 30 minutes after aura, and that activation of dural macrophages may be mediated by activation of migratory DCs in the subarachnoid space and dura. The anatomical relationship between TRPV1-positive meningeal nociceptors, and dural macrophages and DCs supports a role for these immune cells in the modulation of head pain.

	<content:encoded>&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25167-sec-0001&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Objective&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Autosomal-dominant lateral temporal epilepsy (ADLTE) is a genetic focal epilepsy characterized by auditory symptoms. Two genes, &lt;em&gt;LGI1&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;RELN&lt;/em&gt;, encoding secreted proteins, are implicated in the etiology of ADLTE, but half of the affected families remain genetically unsolved, and the underlying molecular mechanisms are yet to be clarified. We aimed to identify additional genes causing ADLTE to better understand the genetic basis and molecular pathway underlying this epileptic disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25167-sec-0002&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;A cohort of Italian ADLTE families was examined by whole exome sequencing combined with genome-wide single-nucleotide polymorphism-array linkage analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25167-sec-0003&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Results&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;We identified two ADLTE-causing variants in the &lt;em&gt;MICAL-1&lt;/em&gt; gene: a p.Gly150Ser substitution occurring in the enzymatically active monooxygenase (MO) domain and a p.Ala1065fs frameshift indel in the C-terminal domain, which inhibits the oxidoreductase activity of the MO domain. Each variant segregated with ADLTE in a single family. Examination of candidate variants in additional genes excluded their implication in ADLTE. In cell-based assays, both variants significantly increased MICAL-1 oxidoreductase activity and induced cell contraction in COS7 cells, which likely resulted from deregulation of F-actin dynamics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25167-sec-0004&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;MICAL-1 oxidoreductase activity induces disassembly of actin filaments, thereby regulating the organization of the actin cytoskeleton in developing and adult neurons and in other cell types. This suggests that dysregulation of the actin cytoskeleton dynamics is a likely mechanism by which &lt;em&gt;MICAL-1&lt;/em&gt; pathogenic variants lead to ADLTE.

Perfecting this prediction is integral to the search for disease modifying therapies. This study aimed to identify an imaging marker capable of reliably predicting real-life clinical diagnosis in HD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25171-sec-0002&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Method&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;A multivariate machine learning approach was applied to resting-state and structural magnetic resonance imaging scans from 19 premanifest HD gene carriers (preHD, 8 of whom developed clinical disease in the 5 years postscanning) and 21 healthy controls. A classification model was developed using cross-group comparisons between preHD and controls, and within the preHD group in relation to “estimated” and “actual” proximity to disease onset. Imaging measures were modeled individually, and combined, and permutation modeling robustly tested classification accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Maturation Trajectories of Cortical Resting-State Networks Depend on the Mediating Frequency Band. (arXiv:1803.04364v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1803.04364</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The functional significance of resting state networks and their abnormal
manifestations in psychiatric disorders are firmly established, as is the
importance of the cortical rhythms in mediating these networks. Resting state
networks are known to undergo substantial reorganization from childhood to
adulthood, but whether distinct cortical rhythms, which are generated by
separable neural mechanisms and are often manifested abnormally in psychiatric
conditions, mediate maturation differentially, remains unknown. Using
magnetoencephalography (MEG) to map frequency band specific maturation of
resting state networks from age 7 to 29 in 162 participants (31 independent),
we found significant changes with age in networks mediated by the beta
(13-30Hz) and gamma (31-80Hz) bands. More specifically, gamma band mediated
networks followed an expected asymptotic trajectory, but beta band mediated
networks followed a linear trajectory. Network integration increased with age
in gamma band mediated networks, while local segregation increased with age in
beta band mediated networks. Spatially, the hubs that changed in importance
with age in the beta band mediated networks had relatively little overlap with
those that showed the greatest changes in the gamma band mediated networks.
These findings are relevant for our understanding of the neural mechanisms of
cortical maturation, in both typical and atypical development.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1803.04363</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The epileptic mechanism is postulated as that an animal's neurons gradually
diminish their inhibition function coupled with enhanced excitation when an
epileptic event is approaching. Calcium imaging technique is designed to
directly record brain-wide neurons activity in order to discover the underlying
epileptic mechanism. In this paper, using one brain-wide calcium imaging video
of Zebrafish, we compute dynamic pattern information of the epileptic
mechanism, and devise three graphical displays to show the visible functional
aspect of epileptic mechanism over five inter-ictal periods. The foundation of
our data-driven computations for such dynamic patterns relies on one universal
phenomenon discovered across 696 informative pixels. This universality is that
each pixel's progressive 5-percentile process oscillates in an irregular
fashion at first, but, after the middle point of inter-ictal period, the
oscillation is replaced by a steady increasing trend. Such dynamic patterns are
collectively transformed into a visible systemic change-point as an early
warning signal (EWS) of an incoming epileptic event. We conclude through the
graphic displays that pattern information extracted from the calcium imaging
video realistically reveals the Zebrafish's authentic epileptic mechanism.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In this paper, the parameter estimation problem for a multi-timescale
adaptive threshold (MAT) neuronal model is investigated. By manipulating the
system dynamics, which comprise of a non-resetting leaky integrator coupled
with an adaptive threshold, the threshold voltage can be obtained as a
realizable model that is linear in the unknown parameters. This linearly
parametrized realizable model is then utilized inside a prediction error based
framework to identify the threshold parameters with the purpose of predicting
single neuron precise firing times. The iterative linear least squares
estimation scheme is evaluated using both synthetic data obtained from an exact
model as well as experimental data obtained from in vitro rat somatosensory
cortical neurons. Results show the ability of this approach to fit the MAT
model to different types of fluctuating reference data. The performance of the
proposed approach is seen to be superior when comparing with existing
identification approaches used by the neuronal community.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A quantitative understanding of how sensory signals are transformed into
motor outputs places useful constraints on brain function and helps reveal the
brain's underlying computations. We investigate how the nematode C. elegans
responds to time-varying mechanosensory signals using a high-throughput
optogenetic assay and automated behavior quantification. In the prevailing
picture of the touch circuit, the animal's behavior is determined by which
neurons are stimulated and by the stimulus amplitude. In contrast, we find that
the nervous system is tuned to temporal properties of mechanosensory signals,
like its integral and derivative, that extend over many seconds. Mechanosensory
signals, even in the same neurons, can be tailored to elicit different
behavioral responses. Moreover, we find that the animal's response also depends
on its behavioral context. Most dramatically, the animal ignores all tested
mechanosensory stimuli during turns. Finally, we present a linear-nonlinear
model that predicts the animal's behavioral response to stimulus.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1803.03940</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The current-voltage (I-V) conversion characterizes the physiology of cellular
microdomains and reflects cellular communication, excitability, and electrical
transduction. Yet deriving such I-V laws remains a major challenge in most
cellular microdomains due to their small sizes and the difficulty of accessing
voltage with a high nanometer precision. We present here novel analytical
relations derived for different numbers of ionic species inside a neuronal
micro/nano-domains, such as dendritic spines. When a steady-state current is
injected, we find a large deviation from the classical Ohm's law, showing that
the spine neck resistance is insuficent to characterize electrical properties.
For a constricted spine neck, modeled by a hyperboloid, we obtain a new I-V law
that illustrates the consequences of narrow passages on electrical conduction.
Finally, during a fast current transient, the local voltage is modulated by the
distance between activated voltage-gated channels. To conclude,
electro-diffusion laws can now be used to interpret voltage distribution in
neuronal microdomains.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: K-shell decomposition reveals hierarchical cortical organization of the human brain. (arXiv:1803.03742v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1803.03742</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In recent years numerous attempts to understand the human brain were
undertaken from a network point of view. A network framework takes into account
the relationships between the different parts of the system and enables to
examine how global and complex functions might emerge from network topology.
Previous work revealed that the human brain features 'small world'
characteristics and that cortical hubs tend to interconnect among themselves.
However, in order to fully understand the topological structure of hubs one
needs to go beyond the properties of a specific hub and examine the various
structural layers of the network. To address this topic further, we applied an
analysis known in statistical physics and network theory as k-shell
decomposition analysis. The analysis was applied on a human cortical network,
derived from MRI\DSI data of six participants. Such analysis enables us to
portray a detailed account of cortical connectivity focusing on different
neighborhoods of interconnected layers across the cortex. Our findings reveal
that the human cortex is highly connected and efficient, and unlike the
internet network contains no isolated nodes. The cortical network is comprised
of a nucleus alongside shells of increasing connectivity that formed one
connected giant component. All these components were further categorized into
three hierarchies in accordance with their connectivity profile, with each
hierarchy reflecting different functional roles. Such a model may explain an
efficient flow of information from the lowest hierarchy to the highest one,
with each step enabling increased data integration. At the top, the highest
hierarchy (the nucleus) serves as a global interconnected collective and
demonstrates high correlation with consciousness related regions, suggesting
that the nucleus might serve as a platform for consciousness to emerge.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;There is growing evidence regarding the importance of spike timing in neural
information processing, with even a small number of spikes carrying
information, but computational models lag significantly behind those for rate
coding. Experimental evidence on neuronal behavior is consistent with the
dynamical and state dependent behavior provided by recurrent connections. This
motivates the minimalistic abstraction investigated in this paper, aimed at
providing insight into information encoding in spike timing via recurrent
connections. We employ information-theoretic techniques for a simple reservoir
model which encodes input spatiotemporal patterns into a sparse neural code,
translating the polychronous groups introduced by Izhikevich into codewords on
which we can perform standard vector operations. We show that the distance
properties of the code are similar to those for (optimal) random codes. In
particular, the code meets benchmarks associated with both linear
classification and capacity, with the latter scaling exponentially with
reservoir size.

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/281675v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Neural crest stem cells (NCPCs) have been shown to differentiate into various cell types and tissues during embryonic development, including sensory neurons. The few studies addressing the generation of NCPCs and peripheral sensory neurons (PSNs) from human induced Pluripotent Stem Cells (hiPSCs), generated sensory cells without displaying robust activity. Here, we describe an efficient strategy for hiPSCs differentiation into NCPCs and functional PSNs using chemically defined media and factors to achieve efficient differentiation, confirmed by the expression of specific markers. After 10 days hiPSCs differentiated into NCPCs, cells were then maintained in neural induction medium containing defined growth factors for PSNs differentiation, followed by 10 days in neonatal human epidermal keratinocytes- (HEKn-) conditioned medium. We observed a further increase in PSN markers expression and neurites length after conditioned medium treatment. The resulting neurons released substance P (SP) in response to nociceptive agents such as anandamide and resiniferatoxin. Anandamide induced substance P release via activation of TRPV1 and not CB1. Transcriptomic analysis of the PSNs revealed the main dorsal root ganglia (DRG) neuronal markers and a transcriptional profile compatible with C-LTMR. TRPV1 was detected by immunofluorescence and RNA-Seq in multiple experiments. In conclusion, the developed strategy generated PSNs useful for drug screening that could be applied to patient-derived hiPSCs, consisting in a powerful tool to model human diseases in vitro.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>A technology to record membrane potential from multiple neurons, simultaneously, in behaving animals will have a transformative impact on neuroscience research. Parallel recordings could reveal the subthreshold potentials and intercellular correlations that underlie network behavior. Paired stimulation and recording can further reveal the input-output properties of individual cells or networks in the context of different brain states. Genetically encoded voltage indicators are a promising tool for these purposes, but were so far limited to single-cell recordings with marginal signal to noise ratio (SNR) in vivo. We developed improved near infrared voltage indicators, high speed microscopes and targeted gene expression schemes which enabled recordings of supra- and subthreshold voltage dynamics from multiple neurons simultaneously in mouse hippocampus, in vivo. The reporters revealed sub-cellular details of back-propagating action potentials, correlations in sub-threshold voltage between multiple cells, and changes in dynamics associated with transitions from resting to locomotion. In combination with optogenetic stimulation, the reporters revealed brain state-dependent changes in neuronal excitability, reflecting the interplay of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs. These tools open the possibility for detailed explorations of network dynamics in the context of behavior.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Distinctive human behaviors from tool-making to language are thought to rely on a uniquely evolved capacity for hierarchical action sequencing. Unfortunately, testing of this idea has been hampered by a lack of objective, generalizable methods for measuring the structural complexity of real-world behaviors. Here we present a data-driven approach for quantifying hierarchical structure by extracting action grammars from basic ethograms. We apply this method to the evolutionarily-relevant behavior of stone tool-making by comparing sequences from the experimental replication of ~2.5 Mya Oldowan vs. more recent ~0.5 Mya Achuelean tools. Results show that, while using the same 'alphabet' of elementary actions, Acheulean sequences are structurally more complex. Beyond its specific evolutionary implications, this finding illustrates the broader applicability of our method to investigate the structure of naturalistic human behaviors and cognition. We demonstrate one application by using our complexity measures to re-analyze data from an fMRI study of tool-making action observation.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/281451v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Pharmacological treatment facilitating locomotor expression also modulates reflex expression through the re-arrangement of spinal networks. Buspirone, a partial serotonin receptor agonist (5-HT1A), was recently shown to facilitate and even trigger locomotor movements in mice after complete spinal lesion (Tx). Here, we studied its effect on the H-reflex after acute Tx in adult mice. To avoid possible impacts of anesthetics on H-reflex depression, experiments were performed after decerebration in un-anesthetized mice (N=13). The H-reflex in plantar muscles of the hind-paw was recorded after tibial nerve stimulation 2 h after Tx at the 8th thoracic vertebrae. Average H/M ratio was compared before and every 10 min after buspirone (8 mg/kg, i.p.) for 60 min. Frequency-dependent depression (FDD) of the H-reflex was assessed before and 50 min after buspirone. Before buspirone, a stable H-reflex could be elicited in acute spinal mice and FDD of the H-reflex was observed at 5Hz (68%) and 10Hz (70%) relative to 0.2Hz. After buspirone, the H/M ratio was initially significantly decreased to 69% of pre-treatment. It then increased significantly 30 to 60 min after exposure to buspirone, reaching 170% 60 min after injection. FDD 50 min after buspirone was not significantly different that FDD without treatment. Altogether results suggest that the reported pro-locomotor effect of buspirone occurs at a time where there is a reflex depression followed by a second phase marked by enhancement of reflex excitability, denoting functional inhibitory control.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Internal gain modulations, but not changes in stimulus contrast, preserve the neural code</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/281444v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Neurons in primary visual cortex (V1) are strongly modulated both by stimulus contrast and by fluctuations of internal inputs. An important question is whether population codes are preserved under these conditions. Changes in stimulus contrast are thought to leave population codes invariant, whereas the effect of internal gain modulations remains unknown. To address these questions we studied how the direction-of-motion of oriented gratings is encoded in layer 2/3 of mouse V1. Surprisingly, we found that, because contrast gain responses across cells are heterogeneous, a change in contrast alters the information distribution profile across cells leading to the failure of contrast invariance. Remarkably, internal input fluctuations that cause commensurate firing rate modulations at the single-cell level, do respect population code invariance. These observations have important implications for visual information encoding, and argue that the brain strives to maintain the stability of the neural code in the face of fluctuating internal inputs.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Physiological Significance of R-fMRI Indices in Detecting Structural Brain Lesions</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/281352v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Resting-state functional MRI (R-fMRI) research has recently entered the era of &quot;big data&quot;, however, the physiological underpinnings of R-fMRI indices were rarely validated. Although studies have reported various neuropsychiatric disorders exhibit R-fMRI abnormalities, these &quot;biomarkers&quot; have not been validated in detecting structural lesions (brain tumors) as a concept proof. We enrolled 60 patients with intracranial tumors located in the unilateral cranial cavity and 60 matched normal controls to test whether R-fMRI indices can differentiate tumors. Common R-fMRI indices of tumors and the contralateral normal areas (for amplitude of low frequency fluctuations (ALFF), fractional ALFF (fALFF), regional homogeneity (ReHo) and degree centrality (DC)) and ipsilateral regions surrounding the tumors (for voxel-mirrored homotopic connectivity (VMHC)), were comprehensively assessed. According to paired t-tests, ReHo and DC failed in distinguishing tumors from their counterpart control regions in the cases without Z-standardization (subtracting the brain mean and dividing by the brain standard deviation (SD)). With Z-standardization, all measures can differentiate substantial tumors from normal neural regions in patients. To validate the lower power in the between-subject design than in the within-subject design, each metric was calculated in a matched control group, and two-sample t-tests were used to compare the patient tumors and the normal controls at the same area. ReHo and DC failed to detect significant differences between tumors and the sham tumors areas of normal controls, even with Z-standardization. This study tested the premise of R-fMRI biomarkers for detecting lesions and brings a new understanding to physical significance of the Z-standardization.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/281345v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>The decoding of selective auditory attention from noninvasive electroencephalogram (EEG) data is of interest in brain computer interface and auditory perception research. The current state-of-the-art approaches for decoding the attentional selection of listeners are based on temporal response functions (TRFs). In the current context, a TRF is a function that facilitates a mapping between features of sound streams and EEG responses. It has been shown that when the envelope of attended speech and EEG responses are used to derive TRF mapping functions, the TRF model predictions can be used to discriminate between attended and unattended talkers. However, the predictive performance of the TRF models is dependent on how the TRF model parameters are estimated. There exist a number of TRF estimation methods that have been published, along with a variety of datasets. It is currently unclear if any of these methods perform better than others, as they have not yet been compared side by side on a single standardized dataset in a controlled fashion. Here, we present a comparative study of the ability of different TRF estimation methods to classify attended speakers from multi-channel EEG data. The performance of the TRF estimation methods is evaluated using different performance metrics on a set of labeled EEG data from 18 subjects listening to mixtures of two speech streams.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Reactivation renders consolidated memory labile again, and the ensuing temporary reconsolidation process is highly susceptible to mnemonic modification. Here, we show that memories in such an unstable state could be reprogrammed by sheer behavioral means, bypassing the need for pharmacological intervention. In two experiments using a 'face-location association' paradigm in which participants experienced a 'Learning - New-learning - Final-test' programme, we demonstrate that reactivated memory traces were robustly hampered when the new learning was strategically administered within a critical 20-minute time window. Using fMRI, we further advance our theoretical understanding that this lability can be mechanistically explained by the differential activation in the hippocampal-amygdala memory system implicated by the new-learning whereas the mnemonic intrusion caused by newly learned memories is efficaciously reconciled by the left inferior frontal gyrus. Our findings provide important implications for educational and clinical practices in devising effective strategies for memory integration.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/281097v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Early-life experiences can shape adult behavior, with consequences for fitness and health, yet fundamental questions about how early social environments, and the concomitant experiences, are translated into individual variation in brain and behavior remain unanswered. Here, we investigate whether early-life social environments generate variation in behavior and neuroendocrine gene expression by rearing juvenile Astatotilapia burtoni cichlids in either social groups or pairs. This species is well-studied for its nuanced, plastic social behavior in adulthood. We find that juvenile behavior and neuroendocrine function are both sensitive to early-life social effects. Behavior correlates across multiple assays (open field test, social cue investigation, and dominance behavior) to form a behavioral syndrome, and rearing environment significantly shifts pair-reared juveniles towards the end of syndrome that is less active and socially interactive. Pair-reared juveniles also submit more readily as subordinates. In a separate cohort of juveniles, we then measured neural expression for stress and sex hormone genes, because these signaling systems are known to translate environmental conditions into biological responses, are sensitive to early-life effects, and regulate adult social behavior. Rearing environment causes striking differences in neural gene co-expression networks. Specifically, gene expression was tightly correlated for pair-reared juveniles, but not group-reared or isolated juveniles. Glucocorticoid receptor subtypes 1a, 1b, and 2, as well as androgen receptor , drive the significant differences between treatment groups, which supports a highly-conserved role for the stress axis mediating early-life effects. Together, this research demonstrates the important developmental origins of behavioral phenotypes and identifies potential behavioral and neuroendocrine mechanisms.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Inferring synaptic inputs from spikes with a conductance-based neural encoding model</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/281089v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>A popular approach to the study of information processing in the nervous system is to characterize neural responses in terms of a cascade of linear and nonlinear stages: a linear filter to describe the neuron's stimulus integration properties, followed by a rectifying nonlinearity to convert filter output to spike rate. However, real neurons integrate stimuli via the modulation of nonlinear excitatory and inhibitory synaptic conductances. Here we introduce a biophysically inspired point process model with conductance-based inputs. The model provides a novel interpretation of the popular Poisson generalized linear model (GLM) as a special kind of conductance-based model, where excitatory and inhibitory conductances are modulated in a &quot;push-pull&quot; manner so that total conductance remains constant. We relax this constraint to obtain a more general and flexible &quot;conductance-based encoding model&quot; (CBEM), which can exhibit stimulus-dependent fluctuations in gain and dynamics. We fit the model to spike trains of macaque retinal ganglion cells and show that, remarkably, we can accurately infer underlying inhibitory and excitatory conductances, using comparisons to intracellularly measured conductances. Using extracellular data, we corroborate the intracellular finding that synaptic excitation temporally precedes inhibition in retina. We show that the CBEM outperforms the classic GLM at predicting retinal ganglion cell responses to full-field stimuli, generalizes better across contrast levels, and captures inhibition-dependent response properties to spatially structured stimuli. The CBEM provides a powerful tool for gaining insights into the intracellular variables governing spiking, and forges an important link between extracellular characterization methods and biophysically detailed response models.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/281071v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Most organisms possess an ability to differentiate unexpected or surprising sensory stimuli from those that are repeatedly encountered. How is this sensory computation performed? We examined this issue in the locust olfactory system. We found that odor-evoked responses in the antennal lobe (downstream to sensory neurons) systematically reduced upon repeated encounters of a temporally discontinuous stimulus. Rather than confounding information about stimulus identity and intensity, neural representations were optimized to encode equivalent stimulus-specific information with fewer spikes. Further, spontaneous activity of the antennal lobe network also changed systematically and became negatively correlated with the response elicited by the repetitive stimulus (i.e. 'a negative image'). Notably, while response to the repetitive stimulus reduced, exposure to an unexpected/deviant cue generated undamped and even exaggerated spiking responses in several neurons. In sum, our results reveal how expectation regarding a stimulus is encoded in a neural circuit to allow response optimization and preferential filtering.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/281055v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>The prevailing model of cerebellar learning states that climbing fibers (CFs) are both driven by, and serve to correct erroneous motor output. However, this model is grounded largely in studies of reflexive behaviors where CFs respond with high fidelity to the same unconditioned stimuli that evoke erroneous movement. To test whether this model applies to more flexible learning regimes, we have developed a cerebellar-dependent voluntary motor learning paradigm compatible with both mesoscale and single dendrite resolution calcium imaging in mice. Here, we find that CFs are preferentially driven by, and more time-locked to correctly executed movements, exhibiting widespread correlated activity within parasagittal processing zones that depends on behavioral context. Together, these complimentary CF activity patterns are well-suited to drive learning based on successful movement, and suggest that classical supervised learning models must be extended to account for the context-dependent gating of olivary signaling independent from motor errors.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/280974v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>In studies of human episodic memory, the phenomenon of reactivation has traditionally been observed in regions of occipitotemporal cortex (OTC) involved in sensory experience. However, reactivation also occurs in lateral parietal cortex (LPC), and recent evidence indicates that reactivation of stimulus-specific information may be stronger in LPC than in OTC. These observations raise a number of questions about the nature of memory representations in LPC and their relation to representations in OTC. Here, we report two fMRI experiments that quantify stimulus feature information (color and object category) within LPC and OTC, separately during perception and memory retrieval, in male and female human subjects. Across both experiments, we show a clear dissociation between OTC and LPC: while feature information in OTC is relatively stronger during perception than memory, feature information in LPC is relatively stronger during memory than perception. Thus, while OTC and LPC represent common stimulus features, they preferentially represent this information during different stages. We show that this transformation of feature information across regions co-occurs with stimulus-level reinstatement within LPC and high-level OTC. In Experiment 2, we consider whether feature information in LPC during memory retrieval is flexibly and dynamically shaped by top-down goals. Indeed, we find that dorsal LPC preferentially represents retrieved feature information that addresses current goals. In contrast, ventral LPC represents retrieved features independent of current goals. Collectively, these findings provide insight into the nature and significance of mnemonic representations in LPC and constitute an important bridge between putative mnemonic and control functions of parietal cortex.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/280842v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>The use of Navigation Assistance Systems for spatial orienting has become increasingly popular. Such automated navigation support, however, comes with a reduced processing of the surrounding environment and often with a decline of spatial orienting ability. To prevent such deskilling and to support spatial learning, the present study investigated incidental spatial learning by comparing standard navigation instructions with two modified navigation instruction conditions. The first modified instruction condition highlighted landmarks and provided additional redundant information regarding the landmark (contrast condition), while the second highlighted landmarks and included personal relevant information regarding the landmark (personal-reference condition). Participants' spatial knowledge of the previously unknown virtual city was tested three weeks later. Behavioral and electroencephalographic (EEG) data demonstrated enhanced memory performance for participants in the modified navigation instruction conditions without further differentiating between modified instructions. Recognition performance of landmarks was better and the late positive complex of the event-related potential (ERP) revealed amplitude differences reflecting an increased amount of recollected information for modified navigation instructions. The results indicate a significant long-term spatial learning effect when landmarks are highlighted during navigation instructions.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/279935v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Visual neuroscientists have long characterized attention as inducing a scaling or additive effect on fixed parametric functions describing neural responses (e.g., contrast response functions). Here, we instead propose that top-down effects are more complex and manifest in ways that depend not only on attention but also other cognitive processes involved in executing a task. To substantiate this theory, we analyze fMRI responses in human ventral temporal cortex (VTC) in a study where stimulus eccentricity and cognitive task are varied. We find that as stimuli are presented farther into the periphery, bottom-up stimulus-driven responses decline but top-down attentional enhancement increases substantially. This disproportionate enhancement of weak responses cannot be easily explained by conventional models of attention. Furthermore, we find that attentional effects depend on the specific cognitive task performed by the subject, indicating the influence of additional cognitive processes other than attention (e.g., decision-making). The effects we observe replicate in an independent experiment from the same study, and also generalize to a separate study involving different stimulus manipulations (contrast, phase coherence). Our results suggest that a quantitative understanding of top-down modulation of sensory responses requires more nuanced and more precise characterization of the multiple cognitive factors involved in completing a perceptual task.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/273680v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Goal directed behavior depends on both sensory mechanisms that gather information from the outside world and decision-making mechanisms that select appropriate behavior based on that sensory information. Psychophysical reverse correlation is commonly used to quantify how fluctuations of sensory stimuli influence behavior and is generally believed to uncover the spatiotemporal weighting functions of sensory processes. Here we show that reverse correlations also reflect decision-making processes and can deviate significantly from the true sensory filters. Specifically, sensory and motor delays and trial-to-trial variability of decision times cause systematic distortions in psychophysical kernels that should not be attributed to sensory mechanisms. Similarly, changes of decision bound and mechanisms of evidence integration systematically alter psychophysical reverse correlations. We show that ignoring details of the decision-making process results in misinterpretation of reverse correlations, but proper use of these details turns reverse correlation into a powerful method for studying both sensory and decision-making mechanisms.</content:encoded>

Chemokine receptors, a subclass of G protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), play essential roles in the human immune system, they are involved in cancer metastasis as well as in HIV-infection. A plethora of studies show that homo- and heterodimers or even higher order oligomers of the chemokine receptors CXCR4, CCR5, and CCR2 modulate receptor function. In addition, membrane cholesterol affects chemokine receptor activity. However, structural information about homo- and heterodimers formed by chemokine receptors and their interplay with cholesterol is limited. Here, we report homo- and heterodimer configurations of the chemokine receptors CXCR4, CCR5, and CCR2 at atomistic detail, as obtained from thousands of molecular dynamics simulations. The observed homodimerization patterns were similar for the closely related CC chemokine receptors, yet they differed significantly between the CC receptors and CXCR4. Despite their high sequence identity, cholesterol modulated the CC homodimer interfaces in a subtype-specific manner. Chemokine receptor heterodimers display distinct dimerization patterns for CXCR4/CCR5 and CXCR4/CCR2. Furthermore, associations between CXCR4 and CCR5 reveal an increased cholesterol-sensitivity as compared to CXCR4/CCR2 heterodimerization patterns. This work provides a first comprehensive structural overview over the complex interaction network between chemokine receptors and indicates how heterodimerization and the interaction with the membrane environment diversifies the function of closely related GPCRs.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Hs4EV4VzCNk&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

In order to access and filter content of life-science databases, full text search is a widely applied query interface. But its high flexibility and intuitiveness is paid for with potentially imprecise and incomplete query results. To reduce this drawback, query assistance systems suggest those combinations of keywords with the highest potential to match most of the relevant data records. Widespread approaches are syntactic query corrections that avoid misspelling and support expansion of words by suffixes and prefixes. Synonym expansion approaches apply thesauri, ontologies, and query logs. All need laborious curation and maintenance. Furthermore, access to query logs is in general restricted. Approaches that infer related queries by their query profile like research field, geographic location, co-authorship, affiliation etc. require user’s registration and its public accessibility that contradict privacy concerns. To overcome these drawbacks, we implemented LAILAPS-QSM, a machine learning approach that reconstruct possible linguistic contexts of a given keyword query. The context is referred from the text records that are stored in the databases that are going to be queried or extracted for a general purpose query suggestion from PubMed abstracts and UniProt data. The supplied tool suite enables the pre-processing of these text records and the further computation of customized distributed word vectors. The latter are used to suggest alternative keyword queries. An evaluated of the query suggestion quality was done for plant science use cases. Locally present experts enable a cost-efficient quality assessment in the categories trait, biological entity, taxonomy, affiliation, and metabolic function which has been performed using ontology term similarities. LAILAPS-QSM mean information content similarity for 15 representative queries is 0.70, whereas 34% have a score above 0.80. In comparison, the information content similarity for human expert made query suggestions is 0.90. The software is either available as tool set to build and train dedicated query suggestion services or as already trained general purpose RESTful web service. The service uses open interfaces to be seamless embeddable into database frontends. The JAVA implementation uses highly optimized data structures and streamlined code to provide fast and scalable response for web service calls.

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Relatively slow stochastic gene-state switching in the presence of positive feedback significantly broadens the region of bimodality through stabilizing the uninduced phenotypic state</title>

Within an isogenic population, even in the same extracellular environment, individual cells can exhibit various phenotypic states. The exact role of stochastic gene-state switching regulating the transition among these phenotypic states in a single cell is not fully understood, especially in the presence of positive feedback. Recent high-precision single-cell measurements showed that, at least in bacteria, switching in gene states is slow relative to the typical rates of active transcription and translation. Hence using the &lt;i&gt;lac&lt;/i&gt; operon as an archetype, in such a region of operon-state switching, we present a fluctuating-rate model for this classical gene regulation module, incorporating the more realistic operon-state switching mechanism that was recently elucidated. We found that the positive feedback mechanism induces bistability (referred to as deterministic bistability), and that the parameter range for its occurrence is significantly broadened by stochastic operon-state switching. We further show that in the absence of positive feedback, operon-state switching must be extremely slow to trigger bistability by itself. However, in the presence of positive feedback, which stabilizes the induced state, the relatively slow operon-state switching kinetics within the physiological region are sufficient to stabilize the uninduced state, together generating a broadened parameter region of bistability (referred to as stochastic bistability). We illustrate the opposite phenotype-transition rate dependence upon the operon-state switching rates in the two types of bistability, with the aid of a recently proposed rate formula for fluctuating-rate models. The rate formula also predicts a maximal transition rate in the intermediate region of operon-state switching, which is validated by numerical simulations in our model. Overall, our findings suggest a biological function of transcriptional “variations” among genetically identical cells, for the emergence of bistability and transition between phenotypic states.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/jYGTBzywAD4&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Cortical oscillations are thought to be involved in many cognitive functions and processes. Several mechanisms have been proposed to regulate oscillations. One prominent but understudied mechanism is gap junction coupling. Gap junctions are ubiquitous in cortex between GABAergic interneurons. Moreover, recent experiments indicate their strength can be modified in an activity-dependent manner, similar to chemical synapses. We hypothesized that activity-dependent gap junction plasticity acts as a mechanism to regulate oscillations in the cortex. We developed a computational model of gap junction plasticity in a recurrent cortical network based on recent experimental findings. We showed that gap junction plasticity can serve as a homeostatic mechanism for oscillations by maintaining a tight balance between two network states: asynchronous irregular activity and synchronized oscillations. This homeostatic mechanism allows for robust communication between neuronal assemblies through two different mechanisms: transient oscillations and frequency modulation. This implies a direct functional role for gap junction plasticity in information transmission in cortex.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/fShLgpxE30I&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Particle-based simulations of polarity establishment reveal stochastic promotion of turing pattern formation</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/_ccfBadz21A/article</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Michael Pablo, Samuel A. Ramirez, Timothy C. Elston&lt;/p&gt;

Polarity establishment, the spontaneous generation of asymmetric molecular distributions, is a crucial component of many cellular functions. &lt;i&gt;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&lt;/i&gt; (yeast) undergoes directed growth during budding and mating, and is an ideal model organism for studying polarization. In yeast and many other cell types, the Rho GTPase Cdc42 is the key molecular player in polarity establishment. During yeast polarization, multiple patches of Cdc42 initially form, then resolve into a single front. Because polarization relies on strong positive feedback, it is likely that the amplification of molecular-level fluctuations underlies the generation of multiple nascent patches. In the absence of spatial cues, these fluctuations may be key to driving polarization. Here we used particle-based simulations to investigate the role of stochastic effects in a Turing-type model of yeast polarity establishment. In the model, reactions take place either between two molecules on the membrane, or between a cytosolic and a membrane-bound molecule. Thus, we developed a computational platform that explicitly simulates molecules at and near the cell membrane, and implicitly handles molecules away from the membrane. To evaluate stochastic effects, we compared particle simulations to deterministic reaction-diffusion equation simulations. Defining macroscopic rate constants that are consistent with the microscopic parameters for this system is challenging, because diffusion occurs in two dimensions and particles exchange between the membrane and cytoplasm. We address this problem by empirically estimating macroscopic rate constants from appropriately designed particle-based simulations. Ultimately, we find that stochastic fluctuations speed polarity establishment and permit polarization in parameter regions predicted to be Turing stable. These effects can operate at Cdc42 abundances expected of yeast cells, and promote polarization on timescales consistent with experimental results. To our knowledge, our work represents the first particle-based simulations of a model for yeast polarization that is based on a Turing mechanism.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/_ccfBadz21A&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

The biological pacemaker approach is an alternative to cardiac electronic pacemakers. Its main objective is to create pacemaking activity from added or modified distribution of spontaneous cells in the myocardium. This paper aims to assess how automaticity strength of pacemaker cells (i.e. their ability to maintain robust spontaneous activity with fast rate and to drive neighboring quiescent cells) and structural linear anisotropy, combined with density and spatial distribution of pacemaker cells, may affect the macroscopic behavior of the biological pacemaker. A stochastic algorithm was used to randomly distribute pacemaker cells, with various densities and spatial distributions, in a semi-continuous mathematical model. Simulations of the model showed that stronger automaticity allows onset of spontaneous activity for lower densities and more homogeneous spatial distributions, displayed more central foci, less variability in cycle lengths and synchronization of electrical activation for similar spatial patterns, but more variability in those same variables for dissimilar spatial patterns. Compared their isotropic counterparts, &lt;i&gt;in silico&lt;/i&gt; anisotropic monolayers had less central foci and displayed more variability in cycle lengths and synchronization of electrical activation for both similar and dissimilar spatial patterns. The present study established a link between microscopic structure and macroscopic behavior of the biological pacemaker, and may provide crucial information for optimized biological pacemaker therapies.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/LN7ks_yuF74&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Across-subjects classification of stimulus modality from human MEG high frequency activity</title>

Single-trial analyses have the potential to uncover meaningful brain dynamics that are obscured when averaging across trials. However, low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) can impede the use of single-trial analyses and decoding methods. In this study, we investigate the applicability of a single-trial approach to decode stimulus modality from magnetoencephalographic (MEG) high frequency activity. In order to classify the auditory versus visual presentation of words, we combine beamformer source reconstruction with the random forest classification method. To enable group level inference, the classification is embedded in an across-subjects framework. We show that single-trial gamma SNR allows for good classification performance (accuracy across subjects: 66.44%). This implies that the characteristics of high frequency activity have a high consistency across trials and subjects. The random forest classifier assigned informational value to activity in both auditory and visual cortex with high spatial specificity. Across time, gamma power was most informative during stimulus presentation. Among all frequency bands, the 75 Hz 95 Hz band was the most informative frequency band in visual as well as in auditory areas. Especially in visual areas, a broad range of gamma frequencies (55 Hz 125 Hz) contributed to the successful classification. Thus, we demonstrate the feasibility of single-trial approaches for decoding the stimulus modality across subjects from high frequency activity and describe the discriminative gamma activity in time, frequency, and space.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/oy2L5cnKlBc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>RSS PAP: Brain Activity during Methamphetamine Anticipation in a Non-Invasive Self-Administration Paradigm in Mice</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0433-17.2018v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;The ability to sense time and anticipate events is critical for survival. Learned responses that allow anticipation of the availability of food or water have been intensively studied. While anticipatory behaviors also occur prior to availability of regularly available rewards, there has been relatively little work on anticipation of drugs of abuse, specifically methamphetamine (MA). In the present study, we used a protocol that avoided possible CNS effects of stresses of handling or surgery by testing anticipation of MA availability in animals living in their home cages, with daily voluntary access to the drug at a fixed time of day. Anticipation was operationalized as the amount of wheel running prior to MA availability. Mice were divided into four groups given access to either nebulized MA or water, in early or late day. Animals with access to MA, but not water controls, showed anticipatory activity, with more anticipation in early compared to late day and significant interaction effects. Next, we explored the neural basis of the MA anticipation, using c-FOS expression, in animals euthanized at the usual time of nebulization access. In the dorsomedial hypothalamus and orbitofrontal cortex, the pattern of c-FOS expression paralleled that of anticipatory behavior, with significant main and interaction effects of treatment and time of day. The results for the lateral septum were significant for main effects and marginally significant for interaction effects. These studies suggest that anticipation of MA is associated with activation of brain regions important in circadian timing, emotional regulation and decision-making.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; A primary function of the brain is to predict future events. Brain regions regulating anticipation of drugs have received little analysis. We studied methamphetamine anticipation in mice living in their home cage and having access to nebulized methamphetamine for 1hr daily via a tunnel to a nebulizing chamber. Mice spontaneously awakened from sleep ~2hr before methamphetamine availability and voluntarily entered the chamber when accessible. This protocol avoided the potential CNS effects associated with handling, injections and surgery. c-FOS expression before methamphetamine availability was observed in the dorsomedial hypothalamus, lateral septum, and orbitofrontal cortex, suggesting that anticipation of regularly scheduled methamphetamine is associated with activation of brain regions important in circadian timing, emotional regulation and decision-making.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Isoflurane Impairs Low-Frequency Feedback but Leaves High-Frequency Feedforward Connectivity Intact in the Fly Brain</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/5/1/ENEURO.0329-17.2018?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Hierarchically organized brains communicate through feedforward (FF) and feedback (FB) pathways. In mammals, FF and FB are mediated by higher and lower frequencies during wakefulness. FB is preferentially impaired by general anesthetics in multiple mammalian species. This suggests FB serves critical functions in waking brains. The brain of &lt;i&gt;Drosophila melanogaster&lt;/i&gt; (fruit fly) is also hierarchically organized, but the presence of FB in these brains is not established. Here, we studied FB in the fly brain, by simultaneously recording local field potentials (LFPs) from low-order peripheral structures and higher-order central structures. We analyzed the data using Granger causality (GC), the first application of this analysis technique to recordings from the insect brain. Our analysis revealed that low frequencies (0.1–5 Hz) mediated FB from the center to the periphery, while higher frequencies (10–45 Hz) mediated FF in the opposite direction. Further, isoflurane anesthesia preferentially reduced FB. Our results imply that the spectral characteristics of FF and FB may be a signature of hierarchically organized brains that is conserved from insects to mammals. We speculate that general anesthetics may induce unresponsiveness across species by targeting the mechanisms that support FB.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>RSS PAP: Measuring and Validating the Levels of Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor in Human Serum</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0419-17.2018v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) secreted by neurons is a significant component of synaptic plasticity. In humans, it is also present in blood platelets where it accumulates following its biosynthesis in megakaryocytes. BDNF levels are thus readily detectable in human serum and it has been abundantly speculated that they may somehow serve as an indicator of brain function. However, there is a great deal of uncertainty with regard to the range of BDNF levels that can be considered normal, how stable these values are over time and even whether BDNF levels can be reliably measured in serum. Using monoclonal antibodies and a sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), this study reports on BDNF levels in the serum of 259 volunteers with a mean value of 32.69 ± 8.33 ng/ml (SD). The mean value for the same cohort after 12 months was not significantly different (N = 226, 32.97 ± 8.36 ng/ml SD, p = 0.19). Power analysis of these values indicates that relatively large cohorts are necessary to identify significant differences, requiring a group size of 60 to detect a 20% change. The levels determined by ELISA could be validated by Western blot analyses using a BDNF monoclonal antibody. Whilst no association was observed with gender, a weak, &lt;i&gt;positive&lt;/i&gt; correlation was found with age. The overall conclusions are that BDNF levels can be reliably measured in human serum, that these levels are quite stable over one year, and that comparisons between two populations may only be meaningful if cohorts of sufficient sizes are assembled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; The presence of BDNF in human blood has generated considerable interest as illustrated by the very large number of publications associating BDNF levels with various conditions affecting brain function, including depression and neurodegeneration. Yet a range of technical issues, together with a lack of plausible mechanisms explaining this association, raise questions as to the meaning and value of such measurements. This contribution deals with the feasibility of reliably measuring BDNF levels in human serum and gives indications of the size of cohorts to be recruited for meaningful differences to be observed between populations of interest.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1803.03304</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Many recent studies of the motor system are divided into two distinct
approaches: Those that investigate how motor responses are encoded in cortical
neurons' firing rate dynamics and those that study the learning rules by which
mammals and songbirds develop reliable motor responses. Computationally, the
first approach is encapsulated by reservoir computing models, which can learn
intricate motor tasks and produce internal dynamics strikingly similar to those
of motor cortical neurons, but rely on biologically unrealistic learning rules.
The more realistic learning rules developed by the second approach are often
derived for simplified, discrete tasks in contrast to the intricate dynamics
that characterize real motor responses. We bridge these two approaches to
develop a biologically realistic learning rule for reservoir computing. Our
algorithm learns simulated motor tasks on which previous reservoir computing
algorithms fail, and reproduces experimental findings including those that
relate motor learning to Parkinson's disease and its treatment.

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: GABA promotes survival and axonal regeneration in identifiable descending neurons after spinal cord injury in larval lampreys</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/280891v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>In mammals, spinal cord injury (SCI) causes permanent disability. The poor regenerative capacity of descending neurons is one of the main causes of the lack of recovery after SCI. In addition, the prevention of retrograde degeneration leading to the atrophy or death of descending neurons is an obvious prerequisite for the activation of axonal regeneration. Lampreys show an amazing regenerative capacity after SCI. Recent histological work in lampreys suggested that GABA, which is massively released after a SCI, could promote the survival of descending neurons. Here, we aimed to study if GABA, acting through GABAB receptors, promotes the survival and axonal regeneration of descending neurons of larval sea lampreys after a complete SCI. First, we used in situ hybridization to confirm that identifiable descending neurons of late stage larvae express the gabab1 subunit of the sea lamprey GABAB receptor. We also observed an acute increase in the expression of this subunit in descending neurons after a complete SCI, which further supported the possible role of GABA and GABAB receptors in promoting the survival and regeneration of these neurons. So, we performed gain and loss of function experiments to confirm this hypothesis. Treatments with GABA and baclofen (GABAB agonist) significantly reduced caspase activation in descending neurons 2 weeks after a complete SCI. Long-term treatments with GABOB (a GABA analogue) and baclofen significantly promoted axonal regeneration of descending neurons after SCI. These data indicate that GABAergic signalling through GABAB receptors promotes the survival and regeneration of descending neurons after SCI. Finally, we used morpholinos against the gabab1 subunit to specifically knockdown the expression of the GABAB receptor in descending neurons. Long-term morpholino treatments caused a significant inhibition of axonal regeneration, which shows that endogenous GABA promotes axonal regeneration after a complete SCI in lampreys by activating GABAB receptors expressed in descending neurons. These data implicate GABAB receptors in spinal cord regeneration in lampreys and further provide a new target of interest for SCI.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Causal evidence for mnemonic metacognition in human precuneus</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/280750v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Metacognition is the capacity to introspectively monitor and control one's own cognitive processes. Previous anatomical and functional neuroimaging findings implicated the important role of precuneus in metacognition processing, especially during mnemonic tasks. However, the issue of whether this medial parietal cortex is a domain-specific region that supports mnemonic metacognition remains controversial. Here, we focally disrupted this parietal area with repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation in healthy participants of both sexes, seeking to ascertain its functional necessity for metacognition for memory versus perceptual decisions. Perturbing the precuneal activity impaired the metacognitive efficiency selectively in the memory judgment of temporal-order, but not in perceptual discrimination. Moreover, the correlation in individuals' metacognitive efficiency between the domains disappeared when the precuneus was perturbed. Together with the previous finding that lesion to the anterior prefrontal cortex impairs perceptual but not mnemonic metacognition, we double dissociated the macro-anatomical underpinnings for the two kinds of metacognitive capacity in an interconnected network of brain regions.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Neuronal signature of social novelty exploration in the VTA: implication for Autism Spectrum Disorder</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/280537v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Novel stimuli attract our attention, promote exploratory behavior, and facilitate learning. Atypical habituation and aberrant novelty exploration have been related with the severity of Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) but the underlying neuronal circuits are unknown. Here, we report that dopamine (DA) neurons of the ventral tegmental area (VTA) promote the behavioral responses to novel social stimuli, support preference for social novelty, and mediate the reinforcing properties of novel social interaction. Social novelty exploration is associated with the insertion of calcium-permeable GluA2-lacking AMPA-type glutamate receptors at excitatory synapses on VTA DA neurons. These novelty-dependent synaptic adaptations only persist upon repeated exposure to social stimuli and sustain social interaction. Global or DA neuron-specific inactivation of the ASD risk gene Neuroligin3 alters both social novelty exploration and the reinforcing properties of social stimuli. These behavioral deficits are accompanied by an aberrant expression of non-canonical GluA2-lacking AMPA-receptors at excitatory synapses on VTA DA neurons and an occlusion of novelty-induced synaptic plasticity. Altogether, these findings causally link impaired novelty exploration in an ASD mouse model to VTA DA circuit dysfunction.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Synaptic plasticity onto inhibitory neurons as a mechanism for ocular dominance plasticity.</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/280511v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Ocular dominance plasticity is a well-documented phenomenon allowing us to study properties of cortical maturation. Understanding this maturation could be an important step towards unravelling how cortical circuits function. It is still not fully understood which mechanisms are responsible for the opening and closing of the critical period for ocular dominance and how changes in cortical responsiveness arise after visual deprivation. In this article, we present a theory for these mechanisms. Following recent experimental work, we hypothesize that in both juvenile and adult animals a reduction in inhibition is necessary for ocular dominance plasticity. We modelled how excitatory-to-inhibitory synaptic plasticity enables a drop in inhibition which in turn permits the shift in ocular dominance. Our model also provides a possible explanation to why some neurons shift counter-intuitively towards the closed eye. Finally, we discuss possible mechanisms underlying the opening and closing of the critical period.</content:encoded>

The remaining 24 patients had preserved sympathetic activation and their OH was classified as nonneurogenic, due to volume depletion, anemia, or polypharmacy. Patients with neurogenic OH had twice the fall in systolic blood pressure (SBP; −44 ± 25 vs −21 ± 14 mmHg [mean ± standard deviation], &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.0001) but only one-third of the increase in HR of those with nonneurogenic OH (8 ± 8 vs 25 ± 11 beats per minute [bpm], &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.0001). A ΔHR/ΔSBP ratio of 0.492 bpm/mmHg had excellent sensitivity (91.3%) and specificity (88.4%) to distinguish between patients with neurogenic from nonneurogenic OH (area under the curve = 0.96, &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.0001).

Increased inward rectification in the current-threshold relationship was reproducible in a mouse model of mild SMA, and the abnormality preceded the decline of compound motor action potential amplitudes. Furthermore, quantitative PCR of spinal cord tissues and western blotting of the spinal cord and sciatic nerves showed increased HCN1 and HCN2 expression in SMA mice, and voltage-clamp recording in dissociated spinal motor neurons from SMA mice also showed increased HCN current density. Treatment with ZD7288, an HCN channel blocker, also reduced early mortality, improved motor function, and restored neuromuscular junction architecture in a mouse model of severe SMA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

In vitro experiments showed that hsa-miR-34a downregulates &lt;em&gt;NEUROG2&lt;/em&gt; by binding to its 5′-untranslated region. Moreover, we observed strong nuclear expression of &lt;em&gt;NEUROG2&lt;/em&gt; in balloon cells and dysmorphic neurons and found that 28.5% of our patients presented brain somatic mutations in genes of the mTOR pathway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Amygdala-stimulation-induced apnea is attention and nasal-breathing dependent</title>

To that end, evaluating structures that are activated by seizures and can activate brain regions that produce cardiorespiratory changes can further our understanding of the pathophysiology of SUDEP. Past preclinical studies have shown that electrical stimulation of the human amygdala induces apnea, suggesting a role for the amygdala in controlling respiration. In this study, we aimed to both confirm these findings in a larger group of patients with intractable temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) and also further explore the anatomical and cognitive properties of this effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Finally, stimulation-induced apnea occurred only when stimulating the medial-most amygdalar contacts located in the central nucleus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Moreover, they suggest specific amygdalar nuclei may be critical in mediating this effect and that attentional state is critical to apnea mediated by amygdala activation—perhaps alluding to future development of strategies for the prevention of SUDEP.

We aimed to identify patient and lesion characteristics that together predict the best naming outcome in 4 studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;section&quot; id=&quot;ana25184-sec-0002&quot;&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Methods&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;para&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;We report 2 longitudinal studies that identified 2 variables at onset that were strongly associated with good recovery of naming (the most common residual deficit in aphasia) in the first 6 months after stroke: damage to left posterior superior temporal gyrus (pSTG) and/or superior longitudinal fasciculus/arcuate fasciculus (SLF/AF), and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) use. We then tested these variables in 2 independent cohorts of chronic left hemisphere stroke patients, using chi-square tests and multivariate logistic regression for dichotomous outcomes and &lt;em&gt;t&lt;/em&gt; tests for continuous outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Preservation of these areas and use of SSRIs were associated with naming recovery, independent of lesion volume, time since stroke, and depression. Patients with damage to these critical areas showed better naming outcome if they took SSRIs for 3 months after stroke. Those with preservation of these critical areas achieved good recovery of naming regardless of SSRI use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Although based on a small number of patients, our preliminary results suggest outcome might be modulated by SSRIs, but these associations need to be confirmed in a larger randomized controlled trial.

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: The importance of geometry in the corneal micropocket angiogenesis assay</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/wlGrLwmrFRo/article</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by James A. Grogan, Anthony J. Connor, Joe M. Pitt-Francis, Philip K. Maini, Helen M. Byrne&lt;/p&gt;

The corneal micropocket angiogenesis assay is an experimental protocol for studying vessel network formation, or neovascularization, &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. The assay is attractive due to the ease with which the developing vessel network can be observed in the same animal over time. Measurements from the assay have been used in combination with mathematical modeling to gain insights into the mechanisms of angiogenesis. While previous modeling studies have adopted planar domains to represent the assay, the hemispherical shape of the cornea and asymmetric positioning of the angiogenic source can be seen to affect vascular patterning in experimental images. As such, we aim to better understand: i) how the geometry of the assay influences vessel network formation and ii) how to relate observations from planar domains to those in the hemispherical cornea. To do so, we develop a three-dimensional, off-lattice mathematical model of neovascularization in the cornea, using a spatially resolved representation of the assay for the first time. Relative to the detailed model, we predict that the adoption of planar geometries has a noticeable impact on vascular patterning, leading to increased vessel ‘merging’, or anastomosis, in particular when circular geometries are adopted. Significant differences in the dynamics of diffusible aniogenesis simulators are also predicted between different domains. In terms of comparing predictions across domains, the ‘distance of the vascular front to the limbus’ metric is found to have low sensitivity to domain choice, while metrics such as densities of tip cells and vessels and ‘vascularized fraction’ are sensitive to domain choice. Given the widespread adoption and attractive simplicity of planar tissue domains, both &lt;i&gt;in silico&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt;, the differences identified in the present study should prove useful in relating the results of previous and future theoretical studies of neovascularization to &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; observations in the cornea.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/wlGrLwmrFRo&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Ecological and laboratory studies have demonstrated that temperature modulates West Nile virus (WNV) transmission dynamics and spillover infection to humans. Here we explore whether inclusion of temperature forcing in a model depicting WNV transmission improves WNV forecast accuracy relative to a baseline model depicting WNV transmission without temperature forcing. Both models are optimized using a data assimilation method and two observed data streams: mosquito infection rates and reported human WNV cases. Each coupled model-inference framework is then used to generate retrospective ensemble forecasts of WNV for 110 outbreak years from among 12 geographically diverse United States counties. The temperature-forced model improves forecast accuracy for much of the outbreak season. From the end of July until the beginning of October, a timespan during which 70% of human cases are reported, the temperature-forced model generated forecasts of the total number of human cases over the next 3 weeks, total number of human cases over the season, the week with the highest percentage of infectious mosquitoes, and the peak percentage of infectious mosquitoes that on average increased absolute forecast accuracy 5%, 10%, 12%, and 6%, respectively, over the non-temperature forced baseline model. These results indicate that use of temperature forcing improves WNV forecast accuracy and provide further evidence that temperature influences rates of WNV transmission. The findings provide a foundation for implementation of a statistically rigorous system for real-time forecast of seasonal WNV outbreaks and their use as a quantitative decision support tool for public health officials and mosquito control programs.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/9oxjUwJGPVY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

The use of 3C-based methods has revealed the importance of the 3D organization of the chromatin for key aspects of genome biology. However, the different caveats of the variants of 3C techniques have limited their scope and the range of scientific fields that could benefit from these approaches. To address these limitations, we present 4Cin, a method to generate 3D models and derive virtual Hi-C (vHi-C) heat maps of genomic loci based on 4C-seq or any kind of 4C-seq-like data, such as those derived from NG Capture-C. 3D genome organization is determined by integrative consideration of the spatial distances derived from as few as four 4C-seq experiments. The 3D models obtained from 4C-seq data, together with their associated vHi-C maps, allow the inference of all chromosomal contacts within a given genomic region, facilitating the identification of Topological Associating Domains (TAD) boundaries. Thus, 4Cin offers a much cheaper, accessible and versatile alternative to other available techniques while providing a comprehensive 3D topological profiling. By studying TAD modifications in genomic structural variants associated to disease phenotypes and performing cross-species evolutionary comparisons of 3D chromatin structures in a quantitative manner, we demonstrate the broad potential and novel range of applications of our method.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/0r_nU8GIe4g&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Neuronal gain modulability is determined by dendritic morphology: A computational optogenetic study</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/1YQd4XrcVE4/article</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Sarah Jarvis, Konstantin Nikolic, Simon R. Schultz&lt;/p&gt;

The mechanisms by which the gain of the neuronal input-output function may be modulated have been the subject of much investigation. However, little is known of the role of dendrites in neuronal gain control. New optogenetic experimental paradigms based on spatial profiles or patterns of light stimulation offer the prospect of elucidating many aspects of single cell function, including the role of dendrites in gain control. We thus developed a model to investigate how competing excitatory and inhibitory input within the dendritic arbor alters neuronal gain, incorporating kinetic models of opsins into our modeling to ensure it is experimentally testable. To investigate how different topologies of the neuronal dendritic tree affect the neuron’s input-output characteristics we generate branching geometries which replicate morphological features of most common neurons, but keep the number of branches and overall area of dendrites approximately constant. We found a relationship between a neuron’s gain modulability and its dendritic morphology, with neurons with bipolar dendrites with a moderate degree of branching being most receptive to control of the gain of their input-output relationship. The theory was then tested and confirmed on two examples of realistic neurons: 1) layer V pyramidal cells—confirming their role in neural circuits as a regulator of the gain in the circuit in addition to acting as the primary excitatory neurons, and 2) stellate cells. In addition to providing testable predictions and a novel application of dual-opsins, our model suggests that innervation of all dendritic subdomains is required for full gain modulation, revealing the importance of dendritic targeting in the generation of neuronal gain control and the functions that it subserves. Finally, our study also demonstrates that neurophysiological investigations which use direct current injection into the soma and bypass the dendrites may miss some important neuronal functions, such as gain modulation.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/1YQd4XrcVE4&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

The 3D structure of chromatin plays a key role in genome function, including gene expression, DNA replication, chromosome segregation, and DNA repair. Furthermore the location of genomic loci within the nucleus, especially relative to each other and nuclear structures such as the nuclear envelope and nuclear bodies strongly correlates with aspects of function such as gene expression. Therefore, determining the 3D position of the 6 billion DNA base pairs in each of the 23 chromosomes inside the nucleus of a human cell is a central challenge of biology. Recent advances of super-resolution microscopy in principle enable the mapping of specific molecular features with nanometer precision inside cells. Combined with highly specific, sensitive and multiplexed fluorescence labeling of DNA sequences this opens up the possibility of mapping the 3D path of the genome sequence in situ. Here we develop computational methodologies to reconstruct the sequence configuration of all human chromosomes in the nucleus from a super-resolution image of a set of fluorescent in situ probes hybridized to the genome in a cell. To test our approach, we develop a method for the simulation of DNA in an idealized human nucleus. Our reconstruction method, ChromoTrace, uses suffix trees to assign a known linear ordering of in situ probes on the genome to an unknown set of 3D in-situ probe positions in the nucleus from super-resolved images using the known genomic probe spacing as a set of physical distance constraints between probes. We find that ChromoTrace can assign the 3D positions of the majority of loci with high accuracy and reasonable sensitivity to specific genome sequences. By simulating appropriate spatial resolution, label multiplexing and noise scenarios we assess our algorithms performance. Our study shows that it is feasible to achieve genome-wide reconstruction of the 3D DNA path based on super-resolution microscopy images.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/VJh9lTsZKRE&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>RSS PAP: Susceptibility to Oxidative Stress Is Determined by Genetic Background in Neuronal Cell Cultures</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0335-17.2018v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Traumatic brain injury (TBI) leads to a deleterious and multifactorial secondary inflammatory response in the brain. Oxidative stress from the inflammation likely contributes to the brain damage although it is unclear to which extent. A largely unexplored approach is to consider phenotypic regulation of oxidative stress levels. Genetic polymorphism influences inflammation in the central nervous system and it is possible that the antioxidative response differs between phenotypes and affects the severity of the secondary injury. We therefore compared the antioxidative response in inbred rat strains Dark Agouti (DA) to Piebald Viral Glaxo (PVG). DA has high susceptibility to inflammatory challenges and PVG is protected. Primary neuronal cell cultures were exposed to peroxynitrite (ONOO&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;), nitric oxide (NO), superoxide (O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;) and 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE). Our findings demonstrated a phenotypic control of the neuronal antioxidative response, specific to manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD). DA neurons had increased levels of MnSOD, equal levels of peroxiredoxin 5, decreased oxidative stress markers 3-Nitrotyrosine and 4-HNE and decreased neuronal death detected by lactate dehydrogenase release after 24h, and higher oxidative stress levels by CellROX than PVG after 2h. It is possible that DA neurons had a phenotypic adaptation to a fiercer inflammatory environment. Peroxynitrite was confirmed as the most powerful oxidative damage mediator, while 4-HNE caused few oxidative effects. iNOS was not induced, suggesting that inflammatory, while not oxidative stimulation was required. These findings indicate that phenotypic antioxidative regulation affects the secondary inflammation, which should be considered in future individualized treatments and when evaluating antioxidative pharmacological interventions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Neurotrauma leads to inflammation and oxidative stress in the brain. The outcome differs between individuals and it is largely unknown what causes this diversity. It is possible that the brain phenotype is linked to oxidative stress levels, and that some individuals acquire less oxidative stress than others. We therefore tested the oxidative stress reaction patterns in rat neurons from two strains with different susceptibility to inflammation. We found that the phenotypes have different regulation of antioxidative enzymes and oxidative stress. While further studies are needed to corroborate the findings &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;, it is a proof of concept of genetic regulation of direct oxidative stress, which may impact outcome after TBI and interact with future antioxidative treatment trials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Strengthening Relationships between Neural Ideals and Receptive Fields. (arXiv:1803.03204v1 [math.AC])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1803.03204</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Neural codes are collections of binary vectors that represent the firing
patterns of neurons. The information given by a neural code $C$ can be
represented by its neural ideal $J_C$. In turn, the polynomials in $J_C$ can be
used to determine the relationships among the receptive fields of the neurons.
In a paper by Curto et al., three such relationships, known as the Type 1-3
relations, were linked to the neural ideal by three if-and-only-if statements.
Later, Garcia et al. discovered the Type 4-6 relations. These new relations
differed from the first three in that they were related to $J_C$ by one-way
implications. In this paper, we first show that the converses of these new
implications are false at the level of both the neural ideal $J_C$ and the
larger ideal $I(C)$ of a code. We then present modified statements of these
relations that, like the first three, can be related by if-and-only-if
statements to both $J_C$ and $I(C)$. Using the modified relations, we uncover a
new relationship involving $J_C$, $I(C)$, and the Type 1-6 relations.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A family of stochastic processes has quasi-cycle oscillations if its
otherwise-damped oscillations are sustained by noise. Such a family forms the
reaction part of a stochastic reaction-diffusion system when we insert a local
Mexican Hat-type, difference of Gaussians, coupling on a one-dimensional and on
a two-dimensional lattice. We find spatial patterns of oscillating quasi-cycles
that resemble Turing patterns, called quasi-patterns. Specific properties of
these patterns, such as local phase synchronization, can be predicted from the
parameters of the reaction and of the Mexican Hat coupling. When the damping
parameters of the reaction and diffusion parts are small and balanced, phase
synchronization vanishes but amplitude patterns persist. These results extend
our knowledge of the behaviour of coupled neural field equations and its
dependence on stochastic fluctuations.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: A Novel Model of Cancer-Induced Peripheral Neuropathy and the Role of TRPA1 in Pain Transduction. (arXiv:1803.02905v1 [q-bio.TO])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1803.02905</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Background. Models of cancer-induced neuropathy are designed by injecting
cancer cells near the peripheral nerves. The interference of tissue-resident
immune cells does not allow a direct contact with nerve fibres which affects
the tumor microenvironment and the invasion process. Methods. Anaplastic
tumor-1 (AT-1) cells were inoculated within the sciatic nerves (SNs) of male
Copenhagen rats. Lumbar dorsal root ganglia (DRGs) and the SNs were collected
on days 3, 7, 14, and 21. SN tissues were examined for morphological changes
and DRG tissues for immunofluorescence, electrophoretic tendency, and mRNA
quantification. Hypersensitivities to cold, mechanical, and thermal stimuli
were determined. HC-030031, a selective TRPA1 antagonist, was used to treat
cold allodynia. Results. Nociception thresholds were identified on day 6.
Immunofluorescent micrographs showed overexpression of TRPA1 on days 7 and 14
and of CGRP on day 14 until day 21. Both TRPA1 and CGRP were coexpressed on the
same cells. Immunoblots exhibited an increase in TRPA1 expression on day 14.
TRPA1 mRNA underwent an increase on day 7 (normalized to 18S). Injection of
HC-030031 transiently reversed the cold allodynia. Conclusion. A novel and a
promising model of cancer-induced neuropathy was established, and the role of
TRPA1 and CGRP in pain transduction was examined.

	<content:encoded>Neurons are dynamic cells that respond and adapt to stimuli throughout their long postmitotic lives. The structural and functional plasticity of neurons requires the regulated transcription of new gene products, and dysregulation of transcription in either the developing or adult brain impairs cognition.

We review how chromatin regulation acts locally to modulate the expression of specific genes and more broadly to coordinate gene expression programs during transitions between cellular states.</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Stoichiometric balance of protein copy numbers is measurable and functionally significant in a protein-protein interaction network for yeast endocytosis</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/Zan2QIqtr3g/article</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by David O. Holland, Margaret E. Johnson&lt;/p&gt;

Stoichiometric balance, or dosage balance, implies that proteins that are subunits of obligate complexes (e.g. the ribosome) should have copy numbers expressed to match their stoichiometry in that complex. Establishing balance (or imbalance) is an important tool for inferring subunit function and assembly bottlenecks. We show here that these correlations in protein copy numbers can extend beyond complex subunits to larger protein-protein interactions networks (PPIN) involving a range of reversible binding interactions. We develop a simple method for quantifying balance in any interface-resolved PPINs based on network structure and experimentally observed protein copy numbers. By analyzing such a network for the clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) system in yeast, we found that the real protein copy numbers were significantly more balanced in relation to their binding partners compared to randomly sampled sets of yeast copy numbers. The observed balance is not perfect, highlighting both under and overexpressed proteins. We evaluate the potential cost and benefits of imbalance using two criteria. First, a potential cost to imbalance is that ‘leftover’ proteins without remaining functional partners are free to misinteract. We systematically quantify how this misinteraction cost is most dangerous for strong-binding protein interactions and for network topologies observed in biological PPINs. Second, a more direct consequence of imbalance is that the formation of specific functional complexes depends on relative copy numbers. We therefore construct simple kinetic models of two sub-networks in the CME network to assess multi-protein assembly of the ARP2/3 complex and a minimal, nine-protein clathrin-coated vesicle forming module. We find that the observed, imperfectly balanced copy numbers are less effective than balanced copy numbers in producing fast and complete multi-protein assemblies. However, we speculate that strategic imbalance in the vesicle forming module allows cells to tune where endocytosis occurs, providing sensitive control over cargo uptake via clathrin-coated vesicles.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Zan2QIqtr3g&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Passive acoustic sensing has emerged as a powerful tool for quantifying anthropogenic impacts on biodiversity, especially for echolocating bat species. To better assess bat population trends there is a critical need for accurate, reliable, and open source tools that allow the detection and classification of bat calls in large collections of audio recordings. The majority of existing tools are commercial or have focused on the species classification task, neglecting the important problem of first localizing echolocation calls in audio which is particularly problematic in noisy recordings. We developed a convolutional neural network based open-source pipeline for detecting ultrasonic, full-spectrum, search-phase calls produced by echolocating bats. Our deep learning algorithms were trained on full-spectrum ultrasonic audio collected along road-transects across Europe and labelled by citizen scientists from www.batdetective.org. When compared to other existing algorithms and commercial systems, we show significantly higher detection performance of search-phase echolocation calls with our test sets. As an example application, we ran our detection pipeline on bat monitoring data collected over five years from Jersey (UK), and compared results to a widely-used commercial system. Our detection pipeline can be used for the automatic detection and monitoring of bat populations, and further facilitates their use as indicator species on a large scale. Our proposed pipeline makes only a small number of bat specific design decisions, and with appropriate training data it could be applied to detecting other species in audio. A crucial novelty of our work is showing that with careful, non-trivial, design and implementation considerations, state-of-the-art deep learning methods can be used for accurate and efficient monitoring in audio.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/R2S9Qu9T6Rk&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

We present a simple physically based quantitative model of blood platelet shape and its evolution during agonist-induced activation. The model is based on the consideration of two major cytoskeletal elements: the marginal band of microtubules and the submembrane cortex. Mathematically, we consider the problem of minimization of surface area constrained to confine the marginal band and a certain cellular volume. For resting platelets, the marginal band appears as a peripheral ring, allowing for the analytical solution of the minimization problem. Upon activation, the marginal band coils out of plane and forms 3D convoluted structure. We show that its shape is well approximated by an overcurved circle, a mathematical concept of closed curve with constant excessive curvature. Possible mechanisms leading to such marginal band coiling are discussed, resulting in simple parametric expression for the marginal band shape during platelet activation. The excessive curvature of marginal band is a convenient state variable which tracks the progress of activation. The cell surface is determined using numerical optimization. The shapes are strictly mathematically defined by only three parameters and show good agreement with literature data. They can be utilized in simulation of platelets interaction with different physical fields, e.g. for the description of hydrodynamic and mechanical properties of platelets, leading to better understanding of platelets margination and adhesion and thrombus formation in blood flow. It would also facilitate precise characterization of platelets in clinical diagnosis, where a novel optical model is needed for the correct solution of inverse light-scattering problem.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/iMp85U5tcWQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/5/1/ENEURO.0383-17.2018?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;To understand the hippocampus, it is necessary to understand the subiculum. Unlike other hippocampal subfields, the subiculum projects to almost all distal hippocampal targets, highlighting its critical importance for external networks. The present studies, in male rats and mice, reveal a new category of dorsal subiculum neurons that innervate both the mammillary bodies (MBs) and the retrosplenial cortex (RSP). These bifurcating neurons comprise almost half of the hippocampal cells that project to RSP. The termination of these numerous collateral projections was visualized within the medial mammillary nucleus and the granular RSP (area 29). These collateral projections included subiculum efferents that cross to the contralateral MBs. Within the granular RSP, the collateral projections form a particularly dense plexus in deep Layer II and Layer III. This retrosplenial termination site colocalized with markers for VGluT2 and neurotensin. While efferents from the hippocampal CA fields standardly collateralize, subiculum projections often have only one target site. Consequently, the many collateral projections involving the RSP and the MBs present a relatively unusual pattern for the subiculum, which presumably relates to how both targets have complementary roles in spatial processing. Furthermore, along with the anterior thalamic nuclei, the MBs and RSP are key members of a memory circuit, which is usually described as both starting and finishing in the hippocampus. The present findings reveal how the hippocampus simultaneously engages different parts of this circuit, so forcing an important revision of this network.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Losing Control in Social Situations: How the Presence of Others Affects Neural Processes Related to Sense of Agency</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/5/1/ENEURO.0336-17.2018?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Social contexts substantially influence individual behavior, but little is known about how they affect cognitive processes related to voluntary action. Previously, it has been shown that social context reduces participants’ sense of agency over the outcomes of their actions and outcome monitoring. In this fMRI study on human volunteers, we investigated the neural mechanisms by which social context alters sense of agency. Participants made costly actions to stop inflating a balloon before it burst. On &quot;social&quot; trials, another player could act in their stead, but we analyzed only trials in which the other player remained passive. We hypothesized that mentalizing processes during social trials would affect decision-making fluency and lead to a decreased sense of agency. In line with this hypothesis, we found increased activity in the bilateral temporo-parietal junction (TPJ), precuneus, and middle frontal gyrus during social trials compared with nonsocial trials. Activity in the precuneus was, in turn, negatively related to sense of agency at a single-trial level. We further found a double dissociation between TPJ and angular gyrus (AG): activity in the left AG was not sensitive to social context but was negatively related to sense of agency. In contrast, activity in the TPJ was modulated by social context but was not sensitive to sense of agency.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Reliability-Weighted Integration of Audiovisual Signals Can Be Modulated by Top-down Attention</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/5/1/ENEURO.0315-17.2018?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Behaviorally, it is well established that human observers integrate signals near-optimally weighted in proportion to their reliabilities as predicted by maximum likelihood estimation. Yet, despite abundant behavioral evidence, it is unclear how the human brain accomplishes this feat. In a spatial ventriloquist paradigm, participants were presented with auditory, visual, and audiovisual signals and reported the location of the auditory or the visual signal. Combining psychophysics, multivariate functional MRI (fMRI) decoding, and models of maximum likelihood estimation (MLE), we characterized the computational operations underlying audiovisual integration at distinct cortical levels. We estimated observers’ behavioral weights by fitting psychometric functions to participants’ localization responses. Likewise, we estimated the neural weights by fitting neurometric functions to spatial locations decoded from regional fMRI activation patterns. Our results demonstrate that low-level auditory and visual areas encode predominantly the spatial location of the signal component of a region’s preferred auditory (or visual) modality. By contrast, intraparietal sulcus forms spatial representations by integrating auditory and visual signals weighted by their reliabilities. Critically, the neural and behavioral weights and the variance of the spatial representations depended not only on the sensory reliabilities as predicted by the MLE model but also on participants’ modality-specific attention and report (i.e., visual vs. auditory). These results suggest that audiovisual integration is not exclusively determined by bottom-up sensory reliabilities. Instead, modality-specific attention and report can flexibly modulate how intraparietal sulcus integrates sensory signals into spatial representations to guide behavioral responses (e.g., localization and orienting).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Dopamine D2 Receptors in Dopaminergic Neurons Modulate Performance in a Reversal Learning Task in Mice</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/5/1/ENEURO.0229-17.2018?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Neuroimaging studies in animal models and human subjects have each revealed that relatively low striatal dopamine D2-like receptor binding potential is associated with poor impulse control and with vulnerability for addiction-related behaviors. These studies cannot, however, disambiguate the roles for various pools of D2 receptors found in the striatum (e.g., those expressed on medium spiny striato-pallidal neurons vs on dopamine-releasing nerve terminals) in these behavioral outcomes. To clarify the role of the latter pool, namely, D2 autoreceptors, we studied mice carrying a conditional DRD2 gene, with or without Cre-recombinase expressed under the transcriptional control of the dopamine transporter gene locus (autoDrd2-KO, &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 19 and controls, &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 21). These mice were tested for locomotor response to cocaine, and spatial reversal learning was assessed in operant conditioning chambers. As predicted, compared to control mice, autoDrd2-KO animals demonstrated heightened sensitivity to the locomotor stimulating effect of cocaine (10 mg/kg, i.p.), confirming previous research using a similar genetic model. In the spatial reversal learning task, autoDrd2-KO mice were slower to reach a learning criterion and had difficulty sustaining a prolonged nose poke response, measurements conceptually related to impaired response inhibition. Rate of learning of the initial discrimination and latencies to collect rewards, to initiate trials and to produce a response were unaffected by genetic deletion of D2 autoreceptors, discarding possible motor and motivational factors. Together, these findings confirm the role of D2 autoreceptors in reversal learning and suggest a broader involvement in behavioral inhibition mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Sulcal Polymorphisms of the IFC and ACC Contribute to Inhibitory Control Variability in Children and Adults</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/5/1/ENEURO.0197-17.2018?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Inhibitory control (IC) is a core executive function that enables humans to resist habits, temptations, or distractions. IC efficiency in childhood is a strong predictor of academic and professional success later in life. Based on analysis of the sulcal pattern, a qualitative feature of cortex anatomy determined during fetal life and stable during development, we searched for evidence that interindividual differences in IC partly trace back to prenatal processes. Using anatomical magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), we analyzed the sulcal pattern of two key regions of the IC neural network, the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and the inferior frontal cortex (IFC), which limits the inferior frontal gyrus. We found that the sulcal pattern asymmetry of both the ACC and IFC contributes to IC (Stroop score) in children and adults: participants with asymmetrical ACC or IFC sulcal patterns had better IC efficiency than participants with symmetrical ACC or IFC sulcal patterns. Such additive effects of IFC and ACC sulcal patterns on IC efficiency suggest that distinct early neurodevelopmental mechanisms targeting different brain regions likely contribute to IC efficiency. This view shares some analogies with the &quot;common variant–small effect&quot; model in genetics, which states that frequent genetic polymorphisms have small effects but collectively account for a large portion of the variance. Similarly, each sulcal polymorphism has a small but additive effect: IFC and ACC sulcal patterns, respectively, explained 3% and 14% of the variance of the Stroop interference scores.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Mean field repulsive Kuramoto models: Phase locking and spatial signs. (arXiv:1803.02647v1 [nlin.AO])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1803.02647</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The phenomenon of self-synchronization in populations of oscillatory units
appears naturally in neurosciences. However, in some situations, the formation
of a coherent state is damaging. In this article we study a repulsive
mean-field Kuramoto model that describes the time evolution of n points on the
unit circle, which are transformed into incoherent phase-locked states. It has
been recently shown that such systems can be reduced to a three-dimensional
system of ordinary differential equations, whose mathematical structure is
strongly related to hyperbolic geometry. The orbits of the Kuramoto dynamical
system are then described by a ow of M\&quot;obius transformations. We show this
underlying dynamic performs statistical inference by computing dynamically
M-estimates of scatter matrices. We also describe the limiting phase-locked
states for random initial conditions using Tyler's transformation matrix.
Moreover, we show the repulsive Kuramoto model performs dynamically not only
robust covariance matrix estimation, but also data processing: the initial
configuration of the n points is transformed by the dynamic into a limiting
phase-locked state that surprisingly equals the spatial signs from
nonparametric statistics. That makes the sign empirical covariance matrix to
equal 1 2 id2, the variance-covariance matrix of a random vector that is
uniformly distributed on the unit circle.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1803.02626</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Automated classification methods for disease diagnosis are currently in the
limelight, especially for imaging data. Classification does not fully meet a
clinician's needs, however: in order to combine the results of multiple tests
and decide on a course of treatment, a clinician needs the likelihood of a
given health condition rather than binary classification yielded by such
methods. We illustrate how likelihoods can be derived step by step from first
principles and approximations, and how they can be assessed and selected,
illustrating our approach using fMRI data from a publicly available data set
containing schizophrenic and healthy control subjects. We start from the basic
assumption of partial exchangeability, and then the notion of sufficient
statistics and the &quot;method of translation&quot; (Edgeworth, 1898) combined with
conjugate priors. This method can be used to construct a likelihood that can be
used to compare different data-reduction algorithms. Despite the
simplifications and possibly unrealistic assumptions used to illustrate the
method, we obtain classification results comparable to previous, more realistic
studies about schizophrenia, whilst yielding likelihoods that can naturally be
combined with the results of other diagnostic tests.

used to generate N binary spins independently. This allows to approximate the
Ising distribution by a simpler model where the latent variables follow a
multivariate normal distribution. The resulting approximation bears
similarities with the Thouless Anderson Palmer (TAP) solution from mean field
theory, but retains a broader range of applicability when the coupling weights
are not independently distributed. Moreover, unlike classic mean field
approaches, the approximation can be used to generate correlated spin patterns.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: VOCSMAT: a connectionist-inspired treatment proposal for relational traumas. (arXiv:1701.04675v2 [q-bio.NC] UPDATED)</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.04675</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Psychological traumas are thought to be present in a wide range of
conditions, including post-traumatic stress disorder, disorganised attachment,
personality disorders, dissociative identity disorder and psychosis. This work
presents a new psychotherapy for psychological traumas, based on a functional
model of the mind, built with elements borrowed from the fields of computer
science, artificial intelligence and neural networks. The model revolves around
the concept of hierarchical value and explains the emergence of dissociation
and splitting in response to emotional pain. The key intuition is that traumas
are caused by too strong negative emotions, which are in turn made possible by
a low-value self, which is in turn determined by low-value self-associated
ideas. The therapeutic method compiles a list of patient's traumas, identifies
for each trauma a list of low-value self-associated ideas, and provides for
each idea a list of counterexamples, to raise the self value and solve the
trauma. Since the psychotherapy proposed has not been clinically tested,
statements on its effectiveness are premature. However, since the conceptual
basis is solid and traumas are hypothesised to be present in many psychological
disorders, the potential gain may be substantial.

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Deploying digital health data to optimize influenza surveillance at national and local scales</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/98sZCdNsIU0/article</link>

The surveillance of influenza activity is critical to early detection of epidemics and pandemics and the design of disease control strategies. Case reporting through a voluntary network of sentinel physicians is a commonly used method of passive surveillance for monitoring rates of influenza-like illness (ILI) worldwide. Despite its ubiquity, little attention has been given to the processes underlying the observation, collection, and spatial aggregation of sentinel surveillance data, and its subsequent effects on epidemiological understanding. We harnessed the high specificity of diagnosis codes in medical claims from a database that represented 2.5 billion visits from upwards of 120,000 United States healthcare providers each year. Among influenza seasons from 2002-2009 and the 2009 pandemic, we simulated limitations of sentinel surveillance systems such as low coverage and coarse spatial resolution, and performed Bayesian inference to probe the robustness of ecological inference and spatial prediction of disease burden. Our models suggest that a number of socio-environmental factors, in addition to local population interactions, state-specific health policies, as well as sampling effort may be responsible for the spatial patterns in U.S. sentinel ILI surveillance. In addition, we find that biases related to spatial aggregation were accentuated among areas with more heterogeneous disease risk, and sentinel systems designed with fixed reporting locations across seasons provided robust inference and prediction. With the growing availability of health-associated big data worldwide, our results suggest mechanisms for optimizing digital data streams to complement traditional surveillance in developed settings and enhance surveillance opportunities in developing countries.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/98sZCdNsIU0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Neural Mechanisms for Adaptive Learned Avoidance of Mental Effort</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/10/2631?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Humans tend to avoid mental effort. Previous studies have demonstrated this tendency using various demand-selection tasks; participants generally avoid options associated with higher cognitive demand. However, it remains unclear whether humans avoid mental effort adaptively in uncertain and nonstationary environments. If so, it also remains unclear what neural mechanisms underlie such learned avoidance and whether they remain the same regardless of cognitive-demand types. We addressed these issues by developing novel demand-selection tasks where associations between choice options and cognitive-demand levels change over time, with two variations using mental arithmetic and spatial reasoning problems (males/females: 29:4 and 18:2). Most participants showed avoidance, and their choices depended on the demand experienced on multiple preceding trials. We assumed that participants updated the expected cost of mental effort through experience, and fitted their choices by reinforcement learning models, comparing several possibilities. Model-based fMRI analyses revealed that activity in the dorsomedial and lateral frontal cortices was positively correlated with the trial-by-trial expected cost for the chosen option commonly across the different types of cognitive demand. Analyses also revealed a trend of negative correlation in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex. We further identified correlates of cost-prediction error at time of problem presentation or answering the problem, the latter of which partially overlapped with or were proximal to the correlates of expected cost at time of choice cue in the dorsomedial frontal cortex. These results suggest that humans adaptively learn to avoid mental effort, having neural mechanisms to represent expected cost and cost-prediction error, and the same mechanisms operate for various types of cognitive demand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; In daily life, humans encounter various cognitive demands and tend to avoid high-demand options. However, it remains unclear whether humans avoid mental effort adaptively under dynamically changing environments. If so, it also remains unclear what the underlying neural mechanisms are and whether they operate regardless of cognitive-demand types. To address these issues, we developed novel tasks where participants could learn to avoid high-demand options under uncertain and nonstationary environments. Through model-based fMRI analyses, we found regions whose activity was correlated with the expected mental effort cost, or cost-prediction error, regardless of demand type. These regions overlap, or are adjacent with each other, in the dorsomedial frontal cortex. This finding helps clarify the mechanisms for cognitive-demand avoidance, and provides empirical building blocks for the emerging computational theory of mental effort.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Overlapping Role of SCYL1 and SCYL3 in Maintaining Motor Neuron Viability</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/10/2615?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Members of the SCY1-like (SCYL) family of protein kinases are evolutionarily conserved and ubiquitously expressed proteins characterized by an N-terminal pseudokinase domain, centrally located Huntingtin, elongation factor 3, protein phosphatase 2A, yeast kinase TOR1 repeats, and an overall disorganized C-terminal segment. In mammals, three family members encoded by genes &lt;i&gt;Scyl1&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Scyl2&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;Scyl3&lt;/i&gt; have been described. Studies have pointed to a role for SCYL1 and SCYL2 in regulating neuronal function and viability in mice and humans, but little is known about the biological function of SCYL3. Here, we show that the biochemical and cell biological properties of SCYL3 are similar to those of SCYL1 and both proteins work in conjunction to maintain motor neuron viability. Specifically, although lack of &lt;i&gt;Scyl3&lt;/i&gt; in mice has no apparent effect on embryogenesis and postnatal life, it accelerates the onset of the motor neuron disorder caused by &lt;i&gt;Scyl1&lt;/i&gt; deficiency. Growth abnormalities, motor dysfunction, hindlimb paralysis, muscle wasting, neurogenic atrophy, motor neuron degeneration, and loss of large-caliber axons in peripheral nerves occurred at an earlier age in &lt;i&gt;Scyl1&lt;/i&gt;/S&lt;i&gt;cyl3&lt;/i&gt; double-deficient mice than in &lt;i&gt;Scyl1&lt;/i&gt;-deficient mice. Disease onset also correlated with the mislocalization of TDP-43 in spinal motor neurons, suggesting that SCYL1 and SCYL3 regulate TDP-43 proteostasis. Together, our results demonstrate an overlapping role for SCYL1 and SCYL3 &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; and highlight the importance the SCYL family of proteins in regulating neuronal function and survival. Only male mice were used in this study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; SCYL1 and SCYL2, members of the SCY1-like family of pseudokinases, have well established roles in neuronal function. Herein, we uncover the role of SCYL3 in maintaining motor neuron viability. Although targeted disruption of &lt;i&gt;Scyl3&lt;/i&gt; in mice had little or no effect on embryonic development and postnatal life, it accelerated disease onset associated with the loss of &lt;i&gt;Scyl1&lt;/i&gt;, a novel motor neuron disease gene in humans. &lt;i&gt;Scyl1&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Scyl3&lt;/i&gt; double-deficient mice had neuronal defects characteristic of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, including TDP-43 pathology, at an earlier age than did &lt;i&gt;Scyl1&lt;/i&gt;-deficient mice. Thus, we show that SCYL1 and SCYL3 play overlapping roles in maintaining motor neuronal viability &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; and confirm that SCYL family members are critical regulators of neuronal function and survival.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Abstract Memory Representations in the Ventromedial Prefrontal Cortex and Hippocampus Support Concept Generalization</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/10/2605?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Memory function involves both the ability to remember details of individual experiences and the ability to link information across events to create new knowledge. Prior research has identified the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (VMPFC) and the hippocampus as important for integrating across events in the service of generalization in episodic memory. The degree to which these memory integration mechanisms contribute to other forms of generalization, such as concept learning, is unclear. The present study used a concept-learning task in humans (both sexes) coupled with model-based fMRI to test whether VMPFC and hippocampus contribute to concept generalization, and whether they do so by maintaining specific category exemplars or abstract category representations. Two formal categorization models were fit to individual subject data: a prototype model that posits abstract category representations and an exemplar model that posits category representations based on individual category members. Latent variables from each of these models were entered into neuroimaging analyses to determine whether VMPFC and the hippocampus track prototype or exemplar information during concept generalization. Behavioral model fits indicated that almost three-quarters of the subjects relied on prototype information when making judgments about new category members. Paralleling prototype dominance in behavior, correlates of the prototype model were identified in VMPFC and the anterior hippocampus with no significant exemplar correlates. These results indicate that the VMPFC and portions of the hippocampus play a broad role in memory generalization and that they do so by representing abstract information integrated from multiple events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Whether people represent concepts as a set of individual category members or by deriving generalized concept representations abstracted across exemplars has been debated. In episodic memory, generalized memory representations have been shown to arise through integration across events supported by the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (VMPFC) and hippocampus. The current study combined formal categorization models with fMRI data analysis to show that the VMPFC and anterior hippocampus represent abstract prototype information during concept generalization, contributing novel evidence of generalized concept representations in the brain. Results indicate that VMPFC–hippocampal memory integration mechanisms contribute to knowledge generalization across multiple cognitive domains, with the degree of abstraction of memory representations varying along the long axis of the hippocampus.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: The Soluble Form of LOTUS inhibits Nogo Receptor-Mediated Signaling by Interfering with the Interaction Between Nogo Receptor Type 1 and p75 Neurotrophin Receptor</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/10/2589?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Nogo receptor type 1 (NgR1) is known to inhibit neuronal regeneration in the CNS. Previously, we have shown that lateral olfactory tract usher substance (LOTUS) interacts with NgR1 and inhibits its function by blocking its ligand binding. Therefore, LOTUS is expected to have therapeutic potential for the promotion of neuronal regeneration. However, it remains unknown whether the soluble form of LOTUS (s-LOTUS) also has an inhibitory action on NgR1 function as a candidate for therapeutic agents. Here, we show that s-LOTUS inhibits NgR1-mediated signaling by inhibiting the molecular interaction between NgR1 and its coreceptor, p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75&lt;sup&gt;NTR&lt;/sup&gt;). In contrast to the membrane-bound form of LOTUS, s-LOTUS did not block ligand binding to NgR1. However, we identified p75&lt;sup&gt;NTR&lt;/sup&gt; as a novel LOTUS binding partner and found that s-LOTUS suppressed the interaction between p75&lt;sup&gt;NTR&lt;/sup&gt; and NgR1. s-LOTUS inhibited myelin-associated inhibitor (MAI)-induced RhoA activation in murine cortical neurons. Functional analyses revealed that s-LOTUS inhibited MAI-induced growth cone collapse and neurite outgrowth inhibition in chick DRG neurons. In addition, whereas olfactory bulb neurons of &lt;i&gt;lotus&lt;/i&gt;-KO mice are sensitive to MAI due to a lack of LOTUS expression, treatment with s-LOTUS inhibited MAI-induced growth cone collapse in these neurons. Finally, we observed that s-LOTUS promoted axonal regeneration in optic nerve crush injury of mice (either sex). These findings suggest that s-LOTUS inhibits NgR1-mediated signaling, possibly by interfering with the interaction between NgR1 and p75&lt;sup&gt;NTR&lt;/sup&gt;. Therefore, s-LOTUS may have potential as a therapeutic agent for neuronal regeneration in the damaged CNS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Nogo receptor type 1 (NgR1) is a receptor well known to inhibit neuronal regeneration in the CNS. Because the membrane-bound form of lateral olfactory tract usher substance (LOTUS) antagonizes NgR1 through a &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt;-type molecular interaction between LOTUS and NgR1, the soluble form of LOTUS (s-LOTUS) is expected to be a therapeutic agent for neuronal regeneration. In our present study, we show that s-LOTUS inhibits the interaction between NgR1 and p75&lt;sup&gt;NTR&lt;/sup&gt;, NgR1 ligand-induced RhoA activation, growth cone collapse, and neurite outgrowth inhibition and promotes axonal regeneration. Our results indicate that s-LOTUS inhibits NgR1-mediated signaling through a &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;-type molecular interaction between LOTUS and NgR1 and, therefore, s-LOTUS may have therapeutic potential for neuronal regeneration.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Induction and Relief of Curiosity Elicit Parietal and Frontal Activity</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/10/2579?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Curiosity is a basic biological drive, but little is known about its behavioral and neural mechanisms. We can be curious about several types of information. On the one hand, curiosity is a function of the expected value of information, serving primarily to help us maximize reward. On the other hand, curiosity can be a function of the uncertainty of information, helping us to update what we know. In the current studies, we aimed to disentangle the contribution of information uncertainty and expected value of rewards to curiosity in humans. To this end, we designed a lottery task in which uncertainty and expected value of trial outcomes were manipulated independently and examined how neural activity and behavioral measures of curiosity were modulated by these factors. Curiosity increased linearly with increased outcome uncertainty, both when curiosity was explicitly probed as well as when it was implicitly tested by people's willingness to wait. Increased expected value, however, did not strongly relate to these curiosity measures. Neuroimaging results showed greater BOLD response with increasing outcome uncertainty in parietal cortex at the time of curiosity induction. Outcome updating when curiosity was relieved resulted in an increased signal in the insula, orbitofrontal cortex, and parietal cortex. Furthermore, the insula showed a linear increase corresponding to the size of the information update. These results suggest that curiosity is monotonically related to the uncertainty about one's current world model, the induction and relief of which are associated with activity in parietal and insular cortices, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Humans are curious by nature. When you hear your phone beep, you probably feel the urge to check the message right away, even though the message itself likely does not give you a direct reward. In this study, we demonstrated that curiosity can be driven by outcome uncertainty, over and above of reward. The induction of curiosity was accompanied by increased activity in the parietal cortex, whereas the information update at the time of curiosity relief was associated with activity in insular cortex. These findings advance our understanding of the behavioral and neural constituents of curiosity, which lies at the core of human information seeking and serves to optimize the individual's current world model.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Roles of Prefrontal Cortex and Mediodorsal Thalamus in Task Engagement and Behavioral Flexibility</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/10/2569?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Behavioral tasks involving auditory cues activate inhibitory neurons within auditory cortex, leading to a reduction in the amplitude of auditory evoked response potentials (ERPs). One hypothesis is that this process, termed &quot;task engagement,&quot; may enable context-dependent behaviors. Here we set out to determine (1) whether the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) plays a role in task engagement and (2) how task engagement relates to the context-dependent processing of auditory cues in male and female mice performing a decision-making task that can be guided by either auditory or visual cues. We found that, in addition to auditory ERP suppression, task engagement is associated with increased mPFC activity and an increase in theta band (4–7 Hz) synchronization between the mPFC and auditory cortex. Optogenetically inhibiting the mPFC eliminates the task engagement-induced auditory ERP suppression, while also preventing mice from switching between auditory and visual cue-based rules. However, mPFC inhibition, which eliminates task engagement-induced auditory ERP suppression, did not prevent mice from making decisions based on auditory cues. Furthermore, a more specific manipulation, selective disruption of mPFC outputs to the mediodorsal (MD) thalamus, is sufficient to prevent switching between auditory and visual rules but does not affect auditory ERPs. Based on these findings, we conclude that (1) the mPFC contributes to both task engagement and behavioral flexibility; (2) mPFC-MD projections are important for behavioral flexibility but not task engagement; and (3) task engagement, evidenced by the suppression of cortical responses to sensory input, is not required for sensory cue-guided decision making.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; When rodents perform choice-selection tasks based on sensory cues, neural responses to these cues are modulated compared with task-free conditions. Here we demonstrate that this phenomenon depends on the prefrontal cortex and thus represents a form of &quot;top-down&quot; regulation. However, we also show that this phenomenon is not critical for task performance, as rodents can make decisions based on specific sensory cues even when the task-dependent modulation of responses to those cues is abolished. Furthermore, disrupting one specific set of prefrontal outputs impairs rule switching but not the task-dependent modulation of sensory responses. These results show that the prefrontal cortex comprises multiple circuits that mediate dissociable functions related to behavioral flexibility and sensory processing.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Noise-Induced Dysregulation of Quaking RNA Binding Proteins Contributes to Auditory Nerve Demyelination and Hearing Loss</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/10/2551?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Noise exposure causes auditory nerve (AN) degeneration and hearing deficiency, though the proximal biological consequences are not entirely understood. Most AN fibers and spiral ganglion neurons are ensheathed by myelinating glia that provide insulation and ensure rapid transmission of nerve impulses from the cochlea to the brain. Here we show that noise exposure administered to mice of either sex rapidly affects myelinating glial cells, causing molecular and cellular consequences that precede nerve degeneration. This response is characterized by demyelination, inflammation, and widespread expression changes in myelin-related genes, including the RNA splicing regulator &lt;i&gt;Quaking&lt;/i&gt; (QKI) and numerous QKI target genes. Analysis of mice deficient in QKI revealed that QKI production in cochlear glial cells is essential for proper myelination of spiral ganglion neurons and AN fibers, and for normal hearing. Our findings implicate QKI dysregulation as a critical early component in the noise response, influencing cochlear glia function that leads to AN demyelination and, ultimately, to hearing deficiency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Auditory glia cells ensheath a majority of spiral ganglion neurons with myelin, protect auditory neurons, and allow for fast conduction of electrical impulses along the auditory nerve. Here we show that noise exposure causes glial dysfunction leading to myelin abnormality and altered expression of numerous genes in the auditory nerve, including QKI, a gene implicated in regulating myelination. Study of a conditional mouse model that specifically depleted QKI in glia showed that QKI deficiency alone was sufficient to elicit myelin-related abnormality and auditory functional declines. These results establish QKI as a key molecular target in the noise response and a causative agent in hearing loss.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;GABA signaling has been implicated in neural development; however, &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; genetic evidence is missing because mutant mice lacking GABA activity die prematurely. Here, we studied synapse development by ablating vesicular GABA transporter (&lt;i&gt;Vgat&lt;/i&gt;) in ErbB4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; interneurons. We show that inhibitory axo–somatic synapses onto pyramidal neurons vary from one cortical layer to another; however, inhibitory synapses on axon initial segments (AISs) were similar across layers. Conversely, parvalbumin-positive (PV&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;)/ErbB4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; interneurons and PV-only interneurons receive a higher number of inhibitory synapses from PV&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;ErbB4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; interneurons compared with ErbB4-only interneurons. &lt;i&gt;Vgat&lt;/i&gt; deletion from ErbB4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; interneurons reduced axo–somatic or axo–axonic synapses from PV&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;ErbB4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; interneurons onto excitatory neurons. This effect was associated with corresponding changes in neurotransmission. However, the &lt;i&gt;Vgat&lt;/i&gt; mutation seemed to have little effect on inhibitory synapses onto PV&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and/or ErbB4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; interneurons. Interestingly, perineuronal nets, extracellular matrix structures implicated in maturation, survival, protection, and plasticity of PV&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; interneurons, were increased in the cortex of ErbB4-Vgat&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt; mice. No apparent difference was observed between males and females. These results demonstrate that &lt;i&gt;Vgat&lt;/i&gt; of ErbB4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; interneurons is essential for the development of inhibitory synapses onto excitatory neurons and suggest a role of GABA in circuit assembly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; GABA has been implicated in neural development, but &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; genetic evidence is missing because mutant mice lacking GABA die prematurely. Here, we ablated &lt;i&gt;Vgat&lt;/i&gt; in ErbB4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; interneurons in an inducible manner. We provide evidence that the formation of inhibitory and excitatory synapses onto excitatory neurons requires &lt;i&gt;Vgat&lt;/i&gt; in interneurons. In particular, inhibitory axo–somatic and axo–axonic synapses are more vulnerable. Our results suggest a role of GABA in circuit assembly.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Identifying the Role of Complement in Triggering Neuroinflammation after Traumatic Brain Injury</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/10/2519?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The complement system is implicated in promoting acute secondary injury after traumatic brain injury (TBI), but its role in chronic post-traumatic neuropathology remains unclear. Using various injury-site targeted complement inhibitors that block different complement pathways and activation products, we investigated how complement is involved in neurodegeneration and chronic neuroinflammation after TBI in a clinically relevant setting of complement inhibition. The current paradigm is that complement propagates post-TBI neuropathology predominantly through the terminal membrane attack complex (MAC), but the focus has been on acute outcomes. Following controlled cortical impact in adult male mice, we demonstrate that although inhibition of the MAC (with CR2-CD59) reduces acute deficits, inhibition of C3 activation is required to prevent chronic inflammation and ongoing neuronal loss. Activation of C3 triggered a sustained degenerative mechanism of microglial and astrocyte activation, reduced dendritic and synaptic density, and inhibited neuroblast migration several weeks after TBI. Moreover, inhibiting all complement pathways (with CR2-Crry), or only the alternative complement pathway (with CR2-fH), provided similar and significant improvements in chronic histological, cognitive, and functional recovery, indicating a key role for the alternative pathway in propagating chronic post-TBI pathology. Although we confirm a role for the MAC in acute neuronal loss after TBI, this study shows that upstream products of complement activation generated predominantly via the alternative pathway propagate chronic neuroinflammation, thus challenging the current concept that the MAC represents a therapeutic target for treating TBI. A humanized version of CR2fH has been shown to be safe and non-immunogenic in clinical trials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Complement, and specifically the terminal membrane attack complex, has been implicated in secondary injury and neuronal loss after TBI. However, we demonstrate here that upstream complement activation products, generated predominantly via the alternative pathway, are responsible for propagating chronic inflammation and injury following CCI. Chronic inflammatory microgliosis is triggered by sustained complement activation after CCI, and is associated with chronic loss of neurons, dendrites and synapses, a process that continues to occur even 30 d after initial impact. Acute and injury-site targeted inhibition of the alternative pathway significantly improves chronic outcomes, and together these findings modify the conceptual paradigm for targeting the complement system to treat TBI.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Sleep Deprivation Distinctly Alters Glutamate Transporter 1 Apposition and Excitatory Transmission to Orexin and MCH Neurons</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/10/2505?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Glutamate transporter 1 (GLT1) is the main astrocytic transporter that shapes glutamatergic transmission in the brain. However, whether this transporter modulates sleep–wake regulatory neurons is unknown. Using quantitative immunohistochemical analysis, we assessed perisomatic GLT1 apposition with sleep–wake neurons in the male rat following 6 h sleep deprivation (SD) or following 6 h undisturbed conditions when animals were mostly asleep (Rest). We found that SD decreased perisomatic GLT1 apposition with wake-promoting orexin neurons in the lateral hypothalamus compared with Rest. Reduced GLT1 apposition was associated with tonic presynaptic inhibition of excitatory transmission to these neurons due to the activation of Group III metabotropic glutamate receptors, an effect mimicked by a GLT1 inhibitor in the Rest condition. In contrast, SD resulted in increased GLT1 apposition with sleep-promoting melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH) neurons in the lateral hypothalamus. Functionally, this decreased the postsynaptic response of MCH neurons to high-frequency synaptic activation without changing presynaptic glutamate release. The changes in GLT1 apposition with orexin and MCH neurons were reversed after 3 h of sleep opportunity following 6 h SD. These SD effects were specific to orexin and MCH neurons, as no change in GLT1 apposition was seen in basal forebrain cholinergic or parvalbumin-positive GABA neurons. Thus, within a single hypothalamic area, GLT1 differentially regulates excitatory transmission to wake- and sleep-promoting neurons depending on sleep history. These processes may constitute novel astrocyte-mediated homeostatic mechanisms controlling sleep–wake behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Sleep–wake cycles are regulated by the alternate activation of sleep- and wake-promoting neurons. Whether and how astrocytes can regulate this reciprocal neuronal activity are unclear. Here we report that, within the lateral hypothalamus, where functionally opposite wake-promoting orexin neurons and sleep-promoting melanin-concentrating hormone neurons codistribute, the glutamate transporter GLT1, mainly present on astrocytes, distinctly modulates excitatory transmission in a cell-type-specific manner and according to sleep history. Specifically, GLT1 is reduced around the somata of orexin neurons while increased around melanin-concentrating hormone neurons following sleep deprivation, resulting in different forms of synaptic plasticity. Thus, astrocytes can fine-tune the excitability of functionally discrete neurons via glutamate transport, which may represent novel regulatory mechanisms for sleep.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Bottom-Up and Top-Down Factors Differentially Influence Stimulus Representations Across Large-Scale Attentional Networks</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/10/2495?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Visual attention is thought to be supported by three large-scale frontoparietal networks: the frontoparietal control network (FPCN), the dorsal attention network (DAN), and the ventral attention network (VAN). The traditional view is that these networks support visual attention by biasing and evaluating sensory representations in visual cortical regions. However, recent evidence suggests that frontoparietal regions actively represent perceptual stimuli. Here, we assessed how perceptual stimuli are represented across large-scale frontoparietal and visual networks. Specifically, we tested whether representations of stimulus features across these networks are differentially sensitive to bottom-up and top-down factors. In a pair of pattern-based fMRI studies, male and female human subjects made perceptual decisions about face images that varied along two independent dimensions: gender and affect. Across studies, we interrupted bottom-up visual input using backward masks. Within studies, we manipulated which stimulus features were goal relevant (i.e., whether gender or affect was relevant) and task switching (i.e., whether the goal on the current trial matched the goal on the prior trial). We found that stimulus features could be reliably decoded from all four networks and, importantly, that subregions within each attentional network maintained coherent representations. Critically, the different attentional manipulations (interruption, goal relevance, and task switching) differentially influenced feature representations across networks. Whereas visual interruption had a relatively greater influence on representations in visual regions, goal relevance and task switching had a relatively greater influence on representations in frontoparietal networks. Therefore, large-scale brain networks can be dissociated according to how attention influences the feature representations that they maintain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Visual attention is supported by multiple frontoparietal attentional networks. However, it remains unclear how stimulus features are represented within these networks and how they are influenced by attention. Here, we assessed feature representations in four large-scale networks using a perceptual decision-making paradigm in which we manipulated top-down and bottom-up factors. We found that top-down manipulations such as goal relevance and task switching modulated feature representations in attentional networks, whereas bottom-up manipulations such as interruption of visual processing had a relatively stronger influence on feature representations in visual regions. Together, these findings indicate that attentional networks actively represent stimulus features and that representations within different large-scale networks are influenced by different forms of attention.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Ketamine Alters Lateral Prefrontal Oscillations in a Rule-Based Working Memory Task</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/10/2482?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Acute administration of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) antagonists in healthy humans and animals produces working memory deficits similar to those observed in schizophrenia. However, it is unclear whether they also lead to altered low-frequency (≤60 Hz) neural oscillatory activities similar to those associated with schizophrenia during working memory processes. Here, we recorded local field potentials (LFPs) and single-unit activity from the lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC) of three male rhesus macaque monkeys while they performed a rule-based prosaccade and antisaccade working memory task both before and after systemic injections of a subanesthetic dose (≤0.7 mg/kg) of ketamine. Accompanying working-memory impairment, ketamine enhanced the low-gamma-band (30–60 Hz) and dampened the beta-band (13–30 Hz) oscillatory activities in the LPFC during both delay periods and intertrial intervals. It also increased task-related alpha-band activities, likely reflecting compromised attention. Beta-band oscillations may be especially relevant to working memory processes because stronger beta power weakly but significantly predicted shorter saccadic reaction time. Also in beta band, ketamine reduced the performance-related oscillation as well as the rule information encoded in the spectral power. Ketamine also reduced rule information in the spike field phase consistency in almost all frequencies up to 60 Hz. Our findings support NMDAR antagonists in nonhuman primates as a meaningful model for altered neural oscillations and synchrony, which reflect a disorganized network underlying the working memory deficits in schizophrenia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Low doses of ketamine, an NMDAR blocker, produce working memory deficits similar to those observed in schizophrenia. In the lateral prefrontal cortex, a key brain region for working memory, we found that ketamine altered neural oscillatory activities in similar ways that differentiate schizophrenic patients and healthy subjects during both task and nontask periods. Ketamine induced stronger gamma (30–60 Hz) and weaker beta (13–30 Hz) oscillations, reflecting local hyperactivity and reduced long-range communications. Furthermore, ketamine reduced performance-related oscillatory activities, as well as the rule information encoded in the oscillations and in the synchrony between single-cell activities and oscillations. The ketamine model helps link the molecular and cellular basis of neural oscillatory changes to the working memory deficit in schizophrenia.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Diminished Cortical Thickness Is Associated with Impulsive Choice in Adolescence</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/10/2471?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Adolescence is characterized by both maturation of brain structure and increased risk of negative outcomes from behaviors associated with impulsive decision-making. One important index of impulsive choice is delay discounting (DD), which measures the tendency to prefer smaller rewards available soon over larger rewards delivered after a delay. However, it remains largely unknown how individual differences in structural brain development may be associated with impulsive choice during adolescence. Leveraging a unique large sample of 427 human youths (208 males and 219 females) imaged as part of the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort, we examined associations between delay discounting and cortical thickness within structural covariance networks. These structural networks were derived using non-negative matrix factorization, an advanced multivariate technique for dimensionality reduction, and analyzed using generalized additive models with penalized splines to capture both linear and nonlinear developmental effects. We found that impulsive choice, as measured by greater discounting, was most strongly associated with diminished cortical thickness in structural brain networks that encompassed the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, orbitofrontal cortex, temporal pole, and temporoparietal junction. Furthermore, structural brain networks predicted DD above and beyond cognitive performance. Together, these results suggest that reduced cortical thickness in regions known to be involved in value-based decision-making is a marker of impulsive choice during the critical period of adolescence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Risky behaviors during adolescence, such as initiation of substance use or reckless driving, are a major source of morbidity and mortality. In this study, we present evidence from a large sample of youths that diminished cortical thickness in specific structural brain networks is associated with impulsive choice. Notably, the strongest association between impulsive choice and brain structure was seen in regions implicated in value-based decision-making; namely, the ventromedial prefrontal and orbitofrontal cortices. Moving forward, such neuroanatomical markers of impulsivity may aid in the development of personalized interventions targeted to reduce risk of negative outcomes resulting from impulsivity during adolescence.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Altered Signaling in the Descending Pain-modulatory System after Short-Term Infusion of the {mu}-Opioid Agonist Remifentanil</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/10/2454?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;μ-Opioid receptor agonists are widely used within the contemporary treatment of pain, but abrupt opioid suspension, even after short-term infusion, can paradoxically increase the sensitivity to noxious stimuli, a phenomenon that has been, for example, reported after application of the fast-acting μ-opioid receptor agonist remifentanil. To investigate the mechanisms underlying the effects of discontinuation of remifentanil application on pain processing in the human CNS, we analyzed neuronal responses to thermal stimuli before and after a short-term infusion of remifentanil (30 min 0.1 μg/kg body weight/min) compared with control in the brain, brainstem, and spinal cord in drug-naive male volunteers using fMRI. Subsequent to remifentanil suspension, we observed reduced heat pain thresholds and increased neuronal responses in pain-encoding as well as in key regions of the descending pain-modulatory system, such as the periaqueductal gray matter, the nucleus cuneiformis, and the rostral ventromedial medulla. Moreover, the spinal pain-related multivoxel activity pattern showed an opioid-specific change after drug suspension. Importantly, remifentanil suspension increased the functional coupling between the nucleus cuneiformis and the rostral anterior cingulate cortex, and the coupling strength between the rostral anterior cingulate cortex and the nucleus cuneiformis correlated negatively with the individual pain threshold after opioid suspension. These findings demonstrate that, already subsequent to a short-term infusion of the μ-opioid receptor agonist remifentanil, signaling in the descending pain-modulatory system is fundamentally altered and that these changes are directly related to the behavioral sensitivity to pain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Opioids are widely used in modern medicine, but, in addition to their known side effects, it is increasingly recognized that opioids can also increase sensitivity to pain subsequent to their use. Using the fast-acting μ-opioid receptor agonist remifentanil and fMRI in healthy male volunteers, this study demonstrates how signaling changes occur along the entire descending pain-modulatory pathway after opioid discontinuation and how these alterations are closely linked to increased behavioral pain sensitivity. Particularly by revealing modified responses in pain-modulatory brainstem regions that have been previously demonstrated to be causally involved in acute opioid withdrawal effects in rodents, the data provide a plausible neuronal mechanism by which the increased sensitivity to pain after opioid suspension is mediated in humans.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Dynamic Flexibility in Striatal-Cortical Circuits Supports Reinforcement Learning</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/10/2442?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Complex learned behaviors must involve the integrated action of distributed brain circuits. Although the contributions of individual regions to learning have been extensively investigated, much less is known about how distributed brain networks orchestrate their activity over the course of learning. To address this gap, we used fMRI combined with tools from dynamic network neuroscience to obtain time-resolved descriptions of network coordination during reinforcement learning in humans. We found that learning to associate visual cues with reward involves dynamic changes in network coupling between the striatum and distributed brain regions, including visual, orbitofrontal, and ventromedial prefrontal cortex (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 22; 13 females). Moreover, we found that this flexibility in striatal network coupling correlates with participants' learning rate and inverse temperature, two parameters derived from reinforcement learning models. Finally, we found that episodic learning, measured separately in the same participants at the same time, was related to dynamic connectivity in distinct brain networks. These results suggest that dynamic changes in striatal-centered networks provide a mechanism for information integration during reinforcement learning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Learning from the outcomes of actions, referred to as &lt;i&gt;reinforcement learning&lt;/i&gt;, is an essential part of life. The roles of individual brain regions in reinforcement learning have been well characterized in terms of updating values for actions or cues. Missing from this account, however, is an understanding of how different brain areas interact during learning to integrate sensory and value information. Here we characterize flexible striatal-cortical network dynamics that relate to reinforcement learning behavior.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Neurons in Primate Entorhinal Cortex Represent Gaze Position in Multiple Spatial Reference Frames</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/10/2430?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Primates rely predominantly on vision to gather information from the environment and neurons representing visual space and gaze position are found in many brain areas. Within the medial temporal lobe, a brain region critical for memory, neurons in the entorhinal cortex of macaque monkeys exhibit spatial selectivity for gaze position. Specifically, the firing rate of single neurons reflects fixation location within a visual image (Killian et al., 2012). In the rodents, entorhinal cells such as grid cells, border cells, and head direction cells show spatial representations aligned to visual environmental features instead of the body (Hafting et al., 2005; Sargolini et al., 2006; Solstad et al., 2008; Diehl et al., 2017). However, it is not known whether similar allocentric representations exist in primate entorhinal cortex. Here, we recorded neural activity in the entorhinal cortex in two male rhesus monkeys during a naturalistic, free-viewing task. Our data reveal that a majority of entorhinal neurons represent gaze position and that simultaneously recorded neurons represent gaze position relative to distinct spatial reference frames, with some neurons aligned to the visual image and others aligned to the monkey's head position. Our results also show that entorhinal neural activity can be used to predict gaze position with a high degree of accuracy. These findings demonstrate that visuospatial representation is a fundamental property of entorhinal neurons in primates and suggest that entorhinal cortex may support relational memory and motor planning by coding attentional locus in distinct, behaviorally relevant frames of reference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The entorhinal cortex, a brain area important for memory, shows striking spatial activity in rodents through grid cells, border cells, head direction cells, and nongrid spatial cells. The majority of entorhinal neurons signal the location of a rodent relative to visual environmental cues, representing the location of the animal relative to space in the world instead of the body. Recently, we found that entorhinal neurons can signal location of gaze while a monkey explores images visually. Here, we report that spatial entorhinal neurons are widespread in the monkey and these neurons are capable of showing a world-based spatial reference frame locked to the bounds of explored images. These results help connect the extensive findings in rodents to the primate.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Adaptive History Biases Result from Confidence-Weighted Accumulation of past Choices</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/38/10/2418?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Perceptual decision-making is biased by previous events, including the history of preceding choices: observers tend to repeat (or alternate) their judgments of the sensory environment more often than expected by chance. Computational models postulate that these so-called choice history biases result from the accumulation of internal decision signals across trials. Here, we provide psychophysical evidence for such a mechanism and its adaptive utility. Male and female human observers performed different variants of a challenging visual motion discrimination task near psychophysical threshold. In a first experiment, we decoupled categorical perceptual choices and motor responses on a trial-by-trial basis. Choice history bias was explained by previous perceptual choices, not motor responses, highlighting the importance of internal decision signals in action-independent formats. In a second experiment, observers performed the task in stimulus environments containing different levels of autocorrelation and providing no external feedback about choice correctness. Despite performing under overall high levels of uncertainty, observers adjusted both the strength and the sign of their choice history biases to these environments. When stimulus sequences were dominated by either repetitions or alternations, the individual degree of this adjustment of history bias was about as good a predictor of individual performance as individual perceptual sensitivity. The history bias adjustment scaled with two proxies for observers' confidence about their previous choices (accuracy and reaction time). Together, our results are consistent with the idea that action-independent, confidence-modulated decision variables are accumulated across choices in a flexible manner that depends on decision-makers' model of their environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Decisions based on sensory input are often influenced by the history of one's preceding choices, manifesting as a bias to systematically repeat (or alternate) choices. We here provide support for the idea that such choice history biases arise from the context-dependent accumulation of a quantity referred to as the decision variable: the variable's sign dictates the choice and its magnitude the confidence about choice correctness. We show that choices are accumulated in an action-independent format and a context-dependent manner, weighted by the confidence about their correctness. This confidence-weighted accumulation of choices enables decision-makers to flexibly adjust their behavior to different sensory environments. The bias adjustment can be as important for optimizing performance as one's sensitivity to the momentary sensory input.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Inhibition of a Descending Prefrontal Circuit Prevents Ketamine-Induced Stress Resilience in Females</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/5/1/ENEURO.0025-18.2018?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Stress is a potent etiological factor in the onset of major depressive disorder and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Therefore, significant efforts have been made to identify factors that produce resilience to the outcomes of a later stressor, in hopes of preventing untoward clinical outcomes. The NMDA receptor antagonist ketamine has recently emerged as a prophylactic capable of preventing neurochemical and behavioral outcomes of a future stressor. Despite promising results of preclinical studies performed in male rats, the effects of proactive ketamine in female rats remains unknown. This is alarming given that stress-related disorders affect females at nearly twice the rate of males. Here we explore the prophylactic effects of ketamine on stress-induced anxiety-like behavior and the neural circuit-level processes that mediate these effects in female rats. Ketamine given one week prior to an uncontrollable stressor (inescapable tailshock; IS) reduced typical stress-induced activation of the serotonergic (5-HT) dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) and eliminated DRN-dependent juvenile social exploration (JSE) deficits 24 h after the stressor. Proactive ketamine altered prelimbic cortex (PL) neural ensembles so that a later experience with IS now activated these cells, which it ordinarily would not. Ketamine acutely activated a PL to DRN (PL-DRN) circuit and inhibition of this circuit with Designer Receptors Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs (DREADDs) at the time of IS one week later prevented stress prophylaxis, suggesting that persistent changes in PL-DRN circuit activity are responsible, at least in part, for mediating long-term effects associated with ketamine.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: miR-214-3p Targets β-Catenin to Regulate Depressive-like Behaviors Induced by Chronic Social Defeat Stress in Mice</title>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy047/4924354?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;β-Catenin has been implicated in major depressive disorder (MDD), which is associated with synaptic plasticity and dendritic arborization. MicroRNAs (miRNA) are small noncoding RNAs containing about 22 nucleotides and involved in a variety of physiological and pathophysiological process, but their roles in MDD remain largely unknown. Here, we investigated the expression and function of miRNAs in the mouse model of chronic social defeat stress (CSDS). The regulation of β-catenin by selected miRNA was validated by silico prediction, target gene luciferase reporter assay, and transfection experiment in neurons. We demonstrated that the levels of miR-214-3p, which targets β-catenin transcripts were significantly increased in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) of CSDS mice. Antagomir-214-3p, a neutralizing inhibitor of miR-214-3p, increased the levels of β-catenin and reversed the depressive-like behavior in CSDS mice. Meanwhile, antagomir-214-3p increased the amplitude of miniature excitatory postsynaptic current (mEPSC) and the number of dendritic spines in mPFC of CSDS mice, which may be related to the elevated expression of &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;cldn1&lt;/span&gt;. Furthermore, intranasal administered antagomir-214-3p also significantly increased the level of β-catenin and reversed the depressive-like behaviors in CSDS mice. These results may represent a new therapeutic target for MDD.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy045/4924353?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Resting-state functional connectivity (FC) has become a major functional magnetic resonance imaging method to study network organization of human brains. There has been recent interest in the temporal fluctuations of FC calculated using short time windows (“dynamic FC”) because this method could provide information inaccessible with conventional “static” FC, which is typically calculated using the entire scan lasting several tens of minutes. Although multiple studies have revealed considerable temporal fluctuations in FC, it is still unclear whether the fluctuations of FC measured in hemodynamics reflect the dynamics of underlying neural activity. We addressed this question using simultaneous imaging of neuronal calcium and hemodynamic signals in mice and found coordinated temporal dynamics of calcium FC and hemodynamic FC measured in the same short time windows. Moreover, we found that variation in transient neuronal coactivation patterns was significantly related to temporal fluctuations of sliding window FC in hemodynamics. Finally, we show that the observed dynamics of FC cannot be fully accounted for by simulated data assuming stationary FC. These results provide evidence for the neuronal origin of dynamic FC and further suggest that information relevant to FC is condensed in temporally sparse events that can be extracted using a small number of time points.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Neural Cell Adhesion Molecule 2 (NCAM2)-Induced c-Src-Dependent Propagation of Submembrane Ca2+ Spikes Along Dendrites Inhibits Synapse Maturation</title>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy041/4924352?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;The neural cell adhesion molecule 2 (NCAM2) is encoded by a gene on chromosome 21 in humans. NCAM2 accumulates in synapses, but its role in regulation of synapse formation remains poorly understood. We demonstrate that an increase in NCAM2 levels results in increased instability of dendritic protrusions and reduced conversion of protrusions to dendritic spines in mouse cortical neurons. NCAM2 overexpression induces an increase in the frequency of submembrane Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; spikes localized in individual dendritic protrusions and promotes propagation of submembrane Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; spikes over segments of dendrites or the whole dendritic tree. NCAM2-dependent submembrane Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; spikes are L-type voltage-gated Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; channel-dependent, and their propagation but not initiation depends on the c-Src protein tyrosine kinase. Inhibition of initiation or propagation of NCAM2-dependent submembrane Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; spikes reduces the NCAM2-dependent instability of dendritic protrusions. Synaptic boutons formed on dendrites of neurons with elevated NCAM2 expression are enriched in the protein marker of immature synapses GAP43, and the number of boutons with mature activity-dependent synaptic vesicle recycling is reduced. Our results indicate that synapse maturation is inhibited in NCAM2-overexpressing neurons and suggest that changes in NCAM2 levels and altered submembrane Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; dynamics can cause defects in synapse maturation in Down syndrome and other brain disorders associated with abnormal NCAM2 expression.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Non-perceptual Regions in the Left Inferior Parietal Lobe Support Phonological Short-term Memory: Evidence for a Buffer Account?</title>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy037/4924349?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Buffer versus embedded processes accounts of short-term memory (STM) for phonological information were addressed by testing subjects’ perception and memory for speech and non-speech auditory stimuli. Univariate and multivariate (MVPA) approaches were used to assess whether brain regions recruited in recognizing speech were involved in maintaining speech representations over a delay. As expected, a left superior temporal region was found to support speech perception. However, contrary to the embedded processes approach, this region failed to show a load effect, or any sustained activation, during a maintenance delay. Moreover, MVPA decoding during the maintenance stage was unsuccessful in this region by a perception classifier or an encoding classifier. In contrast, the left supramarginal gyrus showed both sustained activation and a load effect. Using MVPA, stimulus decoding was successful during the delay period. In addition, a functional connectivity analysis showed that, as memory load increased, the left temporal lobe involved in perception became more strongly connected with the parietal region involved in maintenance. Taken together, the findings provide greater support for a buffer than embedded processes account of phonological STM.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Toward Leveraging Human Connectomic Data in Large Consortia: Generalizability of fMRI-Based Brain Graphs Across Sites, Sessions, and Paradigms</title>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy032/4924348?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;While graph theoretical modeling has dramatically advanced our understanding of complex brain systems, the feasibility of aggregating connectomic data in large imaging consortia remains unclear. Here, using a battery of cognitive, emotional and resting fMRI paradigms, we investigated the generalizability of functional connectomic measures across sites and sessions. Our results revealed overall fair to excellent reliability for a majority of measures during both rest and tasks, in particular for those quantifying connectivity strength, network segregation and network integration. Processing schemes such as node definition and global signal regression (GSR) significantly affected resulting reliability, with higher reliability detected for the Power atlas (vs. AAL atlas) and data without GSR. While network diagnostics for default-mode and sensori-motor systems were consistently reliable independently of paradigm, those for higher-order cognitive systems were reliable predominantly when challenged by task. In addition, based on our present sample and after accounting for observed reliability, satisfactory statistical power can be achieved in multisite research with sample size of approximately 250 when the effect size is moderate or larger. Our findings provide empirical evidence for the generalizability of brain functional graphs in large consortia, and encourage the aggregation of connectomic measures using multisite and multisession data.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1803.01325</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;This research addressed whether interactions with social robots could
facilitate joint attention of the autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Two
conditions of initiators, namely 'Human' vs. 'Robot' were measured with 15
children with ASD and 15 age-matched typically developing (TD) children. Apart
from fixation and gaze transition, a new longest common subsequence (LCS)
approach was proposed to analyze eye-movement traces. Results revealed that
children with ASD showed deficits of joint attention. Compared to the human
agent, robot facilitate less fixations towards the targets, but it attracted
more attention and allowed the children to show gaze transition and to follow
joint attention logic. This results highlight both potential application of LCS
analysis on eye-tracking studies and of social robot to intervention.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1803.01236</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Speech requires programming the sequence of vocal gestures that produce the
sounds of words. Here we explored the timing of this program by asking our
participants to pronounce, as quickly as possible, a sequence of
consonant-consonant-vowel (CCV) structures appearing on screen. We measured the
delay between visual presentation and voice onset. In the case of plosive
consonants, produced by sharp and well defined movements of the vocal tract, we
found that delays are positively correlated with the duration of the transition
between consonants. We then used a battery of statistical tests and
mathematical vocal models to show that delays reflect the motor planning of
CCVs and transitions are proxy indicators of the vocal effort needed to produce
them. These results support that the effort required to produce the sequence of
movements of a vocal gesture modulates the onset of the motor plan.

Cell division, endocytosis, and viral budding would not function without the localization and assembly of protein complexes on membranes. What is poorly appreciated, however, is that by localizing to membranes, proteins search in a reduced space that effectively drives up concentration. Here we derive an accurate and practical analytical theory to quantify the significance of this dimensionality reduction in regulating protein assembly on membranes. We define a simple metric, an effective equilibrium constant, that allows for quantitative comparison of protein-protein interactions with and without membrane present. To test the importance of membrane localization for driving protein assembly, we collected the protein-protein and protein-lipid affinities, protein and lipid concentrations, and volume-to-surface-area ratios for 46 interactions between 37 membrane-targeting proteins in human and yeast cells. We find that many of the protein-protein interactions between pairs of proteins involved in clathrin-mediated endocytosis in human and yeast cells can experience enormous increases in effective protein-protein affinity (10–1000 fold) due to membrane localization. Localization of binding partners thus triggers robust protein complexation, suggesting that it can play an important role in controlling the timing of endocytic protein coat formation. Our analysis shows that several other proteins involved in membrane remodeling at various organelles have similar potential to exploit localization. The theory highlights the master role of phosphoinositide lipid concentration, the volume-to-surface-area ratio, and the ratio of 3D to 2D equilibrium constants in triggering (or preventing) constitutive assembly on membranes. Our simple model provides a novel quantitative framework for interpreting or designing &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; experiments of protein complexation influenced by membrane binding.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/yfpDHZa0FNA&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Free energy profiles for unwrapping the outer superhelical turn of nucleosomal DNA</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/mW0whYOVxOU/article</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Hidetoshi Kono, Shun Sakuraba, Hisashi Ishida&lt;/p&gt;

The eukaryotic genome is packaged into a nucleus in the form of chromatin. The fundamental structural unit of chromatin is a protein-DNA complex, the nucleosome, where 146 or 147 base pairs of DNA wrap 1.75 times around a histone core. To function in cellular processes, however, nucleosomal DNA must be unwrapped. Although this unwrapping has been experimentally investigated, details of the process at an atomic level are not yet well understood. Here, we used molecular dynamics simulation with an enhanced sampling method to calculate the free energy profiles for unwrapping the outer superhelical turn of nucleosomal DNA. A free energy change of about 11.5 kcal/mol for the unwrapping agrees well with values obtained in single molecule experiments. This simulation revealed a variety of conformational states, indicating there are many potential paths to outer superhelicdal turn unwrapping, but the dominant path is likely asymmetric. At one end of the DNA, the first five bps unwrap, after which a second five bps unwrap at the same end with no increase in free energy. The unwrapping then starts at the other end of the DNA, where 10 bps are unwrapped. During further unwrapping of 15 bps, the unwrapping advances at one of the ends, after which the other end of the DNA unwraps to complete the unwrapping of the outer superhelical turn. These results provide insight into the construction, disruption, and repositioning of nucleosomes, which are continuously ongoing during cellular processes.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/mW0whYOVxOU&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>RSS PAP: Metabotropic Glutamate Receptor 2/3 (mGluR2/3) Activation Suppresses TRPV1 Sensitization in Mouse, but Not Human Sensory Neurons</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0412-17.2018v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;The use of human tissue to validate putative analgesic targets identified in rodents is a promising strategy for improving the historically poor translational record of preclinical pain research. We recently demonstrated that in mouse and human sensory neurons, agonists for metabotropic glutamate receptors 2 and 3 (mGluR2/3) reduce membrane hyperexcitability produced by the inflammatory mediator prostaglandin E&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (PGE&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). Previous rodent studies indicate that mGluR2/3 can also reduce peripheral sensitization by suppressing inflammation-induced sensitization of TRPV1. Whether this observation similarly translates to human sensory neurons has not yet been tested. We found that activation of mGluR2/3 with the agonist APDC suppressed PGE&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-induced sensitization of TRPV1 in mouse, but not human sensory neurons. We also evaluated sensory neuron expression of the gene transcripts for mGluR2 (&lt;i&gt;Grm2&lt;/i&gt;), mGluR3 (&lt;i&gt;Grm3&lt;/i&gt;), and TRPV1 (&lt;i&gt;Trpv1&lt;/i&gt;). The majority of &lt;i&gt;Trpv1&lt;/i&gt;+ mouse and human sensory neurons expressed &lt;i&gt;Grm2&lt;/i&gt; and/or &lt;i&gt;Grm3&lt;/i&gt;, and in both mouse and human, &lt;i&gt;Grm2&lt;/i&gt; was expressed in a greater percentage of sensory neurons than &lt;i&gt;Grm3&lt;/i&gt;. Although we demonstrated a functional difference in the modulation of TRPV1 sensitization by mGluR2/3 activation between mouse and human, there were no species differences in the gene transcript colocalization of mGluR2 or mGluR3 with TRPV1 that might explain this functional difference. Taken together with our previous work, these results suggest that mGluR2/3 activation suppresses only some aspects of human sensory neuron sensitization caused by PGE&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. These differences have implications for potential healthy human voluntary studies or clinical trials evaluating the analgesic efficacy of mGluR2/3 agonists or positive allosteric modulators.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Amygdala Adaptation and Temporal Dynamics of the Salience Network in Conditioned Fear: A Single-Trial fMRI Study</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/5/1/ENEURO.0445-17.2018?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Research in rodents has established the role of the amygdaloid complex in defensive responses to conditioned threat. In human imaging studies, however, activation of the amygdala by conditioned threat cues is often not observed. One hypothesis states that this finding reflects adaptation of amygdaloid responses over time. We tested this hypothesis by estimating single-trial neural responses over a large number of conditioning trials. Functional MRI (fMRI) was recorded from 18 participants during classical differential fear conditioning: Participants viewed oriented grayscale grating stimuli (45° or 135°) presented centrally in random order. In the acquisition block, one grating (the CS+) was paired with a noxious noise, the unconditioned stimulus (US), on 25% of trials. The other grating, denoted CS–, was never paired with the US. Consistent with previous reports, BOLD in dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) and insula, but not the amygdala, was heightened when viewing CS+ stimuli that were not paired with US compared to CS– stimuli. Trial-by-trial analysis showed that over the course of acquisition, activity in the amygdala attenuated. Interestingly, activity in the dACC and insula also declined. Representational similarity analysis (RSA) corroborated these results, indicating that the voxel patterns evoked by CS+ and CS– in these brain regions became less distinguishable over time. Together, the present findings support the hypothesis that the lack of BOLD differences in the amygdaloid complex in many studies of classical conditioning is due to adaptation, and the adaptation effects may reflect changes in large-scale networks mediating aversive conditioning, particularly the salience network.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Implementing Goal-Directed Foraging Decisions of a Simpler Nervous System in Simulation</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/5/1/ENEURO.0400-17.2018?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Economic decisions arise from evaluation of alternative actions in contexts of motivation and memory. In the predatory sea-slug &lt;i&gt;Pleurobranchaea&lt;/i&gt; the economic decisions of foraging are found to occur by the workings of a simple, affectively controlled homeostat with learning abilities. Here, the neuronal circuit relations for approach-avoidance choice of &lt;i&gt;Pleurobranchaea&lt;/i&gt; are expressed and tested in the foraging simulation Cyberslug. Choice is organized around appetitive state as a moment-to-moment integration of sensation, motivation (satiation/hunger), and memory. Appetitive state controls a switch for approach vs. avoidance turn responses to sensation. Sensory stimuli are separately integrated for incentive value into appetitive state, and for prey location (stimulus place) into mapping motor response. Learning interacts with satiation to regulate prey choice affectively. The virtual predator realistically reproduces the decisions of the real one in varying circumstances and satisfies optimal foraging criteria. The basic relations are open to experimental embellishment toward enhanced neural and behavioral complexity in simulation, as was the ancestral bilaterian nervous system in evolution.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Atypical Localization and Dissociation between Glucose Uptake and Amyloid Deposition in Cognitively Normal APOE*E4 Homozygotic Elders Compared with Patients with Late-Onset Alzheimers Disease</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/5/1/ENEURO.0396-17.2018?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s disease (AD) progresses insidiously over decades. Therefore, study of preclinical AD is critical to identify early pathophysiological changes as potential targets for prevention or treatment. The brain processes at the preclinical stage remain minimally understood. Aside from age, the E4 allele of APOE flags a group at particularly high risk of late-onset AD (LOAD). Studies of these individuals could provide insights about the ontogenesis of AD offering clues for novel treatment strategies. To this end, cognitively normal, &lt;i&gt;APOE*E4&lt;/i&gt; homozygotes from the Alzheimer’s Diseases Neuroimaging Research Initiative database (ADNI-LONI) provided fluorodeoxyglucose and amyloid (florbetapir) PET scans (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 8 and 7, respectively; mean age 76 years). Their scans were compared to those of matched cognitively normal elders who were not E4 carriers. There was dissociation in the distribution between glucose uptake and amyloid deposition in the homozygotes. Peak hypometabolism localized bilaterally along the medial temporal cortex. In contrast, peak amyloid deposition localized principally to the putamen, a finding also seen in preclinical carriers of autosomal dominant AD mutations and preclinical AD associated with Down syndrome. Additional regions of amyloid deposition in homozygotes were medial prefrontal cortices including the anterior cingulate, middle and inferior frontal cortices, and middle and inferior occipital cortices. These findings contrast with those reported for LOAD. These data begin to characterize elders with normal cognition despite high AD risk in comparison to the known phenotypes of patients with LOAD.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Neural Determinants of Task Performance during Feature-Based Attention in Human Cortex</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/5/1/ENEURO.0375-17.2018?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Studies of feature-based attention have associated activity in a dorsal frontoparietal network with putative attentional priority signals. Yet, how this neural activity mediates attentional selection and whether it guides behavior are fundamental questions that require investigation. We reasoned that endogenous fluctuations in the quality of attentional priority should influence task performance. Human subjects detected a speed increment while viewing clockwise (CW) or counterclockwise (CCW) motion (baseline task) or while attending to either direction amid distracters (attention task). In an fMRI experiment, direction-specific neural pattern similarity between the baseline task and the attention task revealed a higher level of similarity for correct than incorrect trials in frontoparietal regions. Using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), we disrupted posterior parietal cortex (PPC) and found a selective deficit in the attention task, but not in the baseline task, demonstrating the necessity of this cortical area during feature-based attention. These results reveal that frontoparietal areas maintain attentional priority that facilitates successful behavioral selection.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: {alpha}-Tubulin Acetyltransferase Is a Novel Target Mediating Neurite Growth Inhibitory Effects of Chondroitin Sulfate Proteoglycans and Myelin-Associated Glycoprotein</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/5/1/ENEURO.0240-17.2018?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Damage to the CNS results in neuronal and axonal degeneration, and subsequent neurological dysfunction. Endogenous repair in the CNS is impeded by inhibitory chemical and physical barriers, such as chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs) and myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG), which prevent axon regeneration. Previously, it has been demonstrated that the inhibition of axonal histone deacetylase-6 (HDAC6) can promote microtubule α-tubulin acetylation and restore the growth of CSPGs- and MAG-inhibited axons. Since the acetylation of α-tubulin is regulated by two opposing enzymes, HDAC6 (deacetylation) and α-tubulin acetyltransferase-1 (αTAT1; acetylation), we have investigated the regulation of these enzymes downstream of a growth inhibitory signal. Our findings show that exposure of primary mouse cortical neurons to soluble CSPGs and MAG substrates cause an acute and RhoA-kinase-dependent reduction in α-tubulin acetylation and αTAT1 protein levels, without changes to either HDAC6 levels or HDAC6 activity. The CSPGs- and MAG-induced reduction in αTAT1 occurs primarily in the distal and middle regions of neurites and reconstitution of αTAT1, either by Rho-associated kinase (ROCK) inhibition or lentiviral-mediated αTAT1 overexpression, can restore neurite growth. Lastly, we demonstrate that CSPGs and MAG signaling decreases αTAT1 levels posttranscriptionally via a ROCK-dependent increase in αTAT1 protein turnover. Together, these findings define αTAT1 as a novel potential therapeutic target for ameliorating CNS injury characterized by growth inhibitory substrates that are prohibitive to axonal regeneration.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>RSS PAP: Theta Oscillations Organize Spiking Activity in Higher-Order Visual Thalamus during Sustained Attention</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0384-17.2018v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Higher-order visual thalamus plays a fundamental but poorly understood role in attention-demanding tasks. To investigate how neuronal dynamics in higher-order visual thalamus are modulated by sustained attention, we performed multichannel electrophysiological recordings in the lateral posterior-pulvinar complex (LP/pulvinar) in the ferret (&lt;i&gt;Mustela putorius furo&lt;/i&gt;). We recorded single unit activity and local field potential during the performance of the 5-choice serial reaction time task (5-CSRTT) that is used in both humans and animals as an assay of sustained attention. We found that half of the units exhibited an increasing firing rate during the delay period before stimulus onset (attention-modulated units). In contrast, the non-attention-modulated units responded to the stimulus, but not during the delay period. Spike-field coherence of only the attention-modulated neurons significantly increased from the start of the delay period until screen touch, predominantly in the theta frequency band. In addition, theta power and theta-gamma phase-amplitude coupling were elevated throughout the delay period. Our findings suggest that the theta oscillation plays a role in orchestrating thalamic signaling during sustained attention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Impaired sustained attention can be deadly, as illustrated by the number of motor vehicle accidents that are caused by drivers not reacting quickly enough to unexpected events on the road. Understanding how electrical signaling in higher-order visual nuclei, such as the LP/pulvinar, is modulated during tasks that require sustained attention is an important step in achieving a mechanistic understanding of sustained attention, which will eventually lead to new strategies to prevent and treat impairment in sustained attention.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>RSS PAP: Dopamine D2 Receptors in Dopaminergic Neurons Modulate Performance in a Reversal Learning Task in Mice</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0229-17.2018v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Neuroimaging studies in animal models and human subjects have each revealed that relatively low striatal dopamine D2-like receptor binding potential is associated with poor impulse control and with vulnerability for addiction-related behaviors. These studies cannot, however, disambiguate the roles for various pools of D2 receptors found in the striatum (e.g., those expressed on medium spiny striato-pallidal neurons vs. on dopamine-releasing nerve terminals) in these behavioral outcomes. To clarify the role of the latter pool – namely, D2 autoreceptors – we studied mice carrying a conditional DRD2 gene, with or without Cre-recombinase expressed under the transcriptional control of the dopamine transporter gene locus (autoDrd2-KO, n = 19 and controls, n = 21). These mice were tested for locomotor response to cocaine, and spatial reversal learning was assessed in operant conditioning chambers. As predicted, compared to control mice, autoDrd2-KO animals demonstrated heightened sensitivity to the locomotor stimulating effect of cocaine (10 mg/kg, i.p.), confirming previous research using a similar genetic model. In the spatial reversal learning task, autoDrd2-KO mice were slower to reach a learning criterion and had difficulty sustaining a prolonged nose poke response, measurements conceptually related to impaired response inhibition. Rate of learning of the initial discrimination and latencies to collect rewards, to initiate trials and to produce a response were unaffected by genetic deletion of D2 autoreceptors, discarding possible motor and motivational factors. Together, these findings confirm the role of D2 autoreceptors in reversal learning and suggest a broader involvement in behavioral inhibition mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Because impulsivity and substance use disorder often co-occur, they may share common molecular and cellular determinants. Studies in humans and animal models alike have helped identify the bioavailability dopamine receptor D2 as a correlate of both impulsivity and predisposition for addictive behaviors. Nevertheless, these studies were not able to differentiate between the respective roles of D2 auto- and heteroreceptors. The present work provides evidence that D2 autoreceptors alone influence the performance in a task measuring impulsivity in mice, suggesting that impulsivity is not only resulting from dysfunctional striato-pallidal neurons, but also might also be modulated by upstream, pre-synaptic events.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>cAMP and cGMP are well established second messengers required for long-term potentiation (LTP) and memory formation/consolidation. By contrast, amyloid β (Aβ), mostly known as one of the main culprits for Alzheimer’s disease (AD), has received relatively little attention in the context of plasticity and memory. Of note, however, low physiological concentrations of Aβ seem necessary for LTP induction and for memory formation. This should come as no surprise, since hormesis emerged as a central dogma in biology.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Parvalbumin (PV)-positive interneurons form dendritic gap junctions with one another, but the connectivity among gap junction-coupled dendrites remains uninvestigated in most neocortical areas. We visualized gap junctions in layer 4 of the mouse barrel cortex and examined their structural details. PV neurons were divided into 4 types based on the location of soma and dendrites within or outside barrels. Type 1 neurons that had soma and all dendrites inside a barrel, considered most specific to single vibrissa-derived signals, unexpectedly formed gap junctions only with other types but never with each other. Type 2 neurons inside a barrel elongated dendrites outward, forming gap junctions within a column that contained the home barrel. Type 3 neurons located outside barrels established connections with all types including Type 4 neurons that were confined inside the inter-barrel septa. The majority (33/38, 86.8%) of dendritic gap junctions were within 75 μm from at least 1 of 2 paired somata. All types received vesicular glutamate transporter 2-positive axon terminals preferentially on somata and proximal dendrites, indicating the involvement of all types in thalamocortical feedforward regulation in which proximal gap junctions may also participate. These structural organizations provide a new morphological basis for regulatory mechanisms in barrel cortex.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;The mammalian dorsal telencephalic neuroepithelium develops—from medial to lateral—into the choroid plaque, cortical hem, hippocampal primordium and isocortex under the influence of Bmp, Wnt and Notch signaling. Correct telencephalic development requires a tight coordination of the extent/duration of these signals, but the identification of possible molecular coordinators is still limited. Here, we postulated that Secreted Frizzled Related Protein 1 (Sfrp1), a multifunctional regulator of Bmp, Wnt and Notch signaling strongly expressed during early telencephalic development, may represent 1 of such molecules. We report that in E10.5–E12.5 &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Sfrp1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; embryos, the hem and hippocampal domains are reduced in size whereas the prospective neocortex is medially extended. These changes are associated with a significant reduction of the medio-lateral telencephalic expression of &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Axin2&lt;/span&gt;, a read-out of Wnt/βcatenin signaling activation. Furthermore, in the absence of &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Sfrp1&lt;/span&gt;, Notch signaling is increased, cortical progenitor cell cycle is shorter, with expanded progenitor pools and enhanced generation of early-born neurons. Hence, in postnatal &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Sfrp1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; animals the anterior hippocampus is reduced and the neocortex is shorter in the antero-posterior and medio-lateral axis but is thicker. We propose that, by controlling Wnt and Notch signaling in opposite directions, Sfrp1 promotes hippocampal patterning and balances medio-lateral and antero-posterior cortex expansion.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Cognitive training has been suggested as a possible remediation of decline in brain structure with older age. However, it is unknown whether training effects are transient or enduring, as no studies have examined training-induced plasticity relative to decline in older adults across extended periods with multiple intervention phases. We investigated the temporal dynamics of brain plasticity across periods on and off memory training, hypothesizing that (1) a decline in white matter (WM) microstructure would be observed across the duration of the study and (2) that periods of memory training would moderate the WM microstructural decline. In total, 107 older adults followed a 40-week program, including 2 training periods separated by periods with no intervention. The general decline in WM microstructure observed across the duration of the study was moderated following the training periods, demonstrating that cognitive training may mitigate age-related brain deterioration. The training-related improvements were estimated to subside over time, indicating that continuous training may be a premise for the enduring attenuation of neural decline. Memory improvements were largely maintained after the initial training period, and may thus not rely on continuous training to the same degree as WM microstructure.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

These 3 approaches provided complementary information. Histology provided accurate assessment of axonal diameters and size of synaptic boutons. dMRI revealed the topography of the projections (tractography), notably in the internal capsule. From measurements of axon diameters axonal conduction velocities were computed. Each area communicates with different diameter axons and this generates a hierarchy of conduction delays in this order: a4 (the shortest), SMA, premotor (F7), parietal, somatosensory, premotor F4 (the longest). We provide new interpretations for i) the well-known different anatomical and electrophysiological estimates of conduction velocity; ii) why conduction delays are probably an essential component of the cortical motor command; and iii) how histological and dMRI tractography can be integrated.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: MeCP2 Deficiency Leads to Loss of Glial Kir4.1</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/5/1/ENEURO.0194-17.2018?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Rett syndrome (RTT) is an X-linked neurodevelopmental disorder usually caused by mutations in methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MeCP2). RTT is typified by apparently normal development until 6–18 mo of age, when motor and communicative skills regress and hand stereotypies, autonomic symptoms, and seizures present. Restoration of MeCP2 function selectively to astrocytes reversed several deficits in a murine model of RTT, but the mechanism of this rescue is unknown. Astrocytes carry out many essential functions required for normal brain functioning, including extracellular K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; buffering. Kir4.1, an inwardly rectifying K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; channel, is largely responsible for the channel-mediated K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; regulation by astrocytes. Loss-of-function mutations in Kir4.1 in human patients result in a severe neurodevelopmental disorder termed EAST or SESAME syndrome. Here, we evaluated astrocytic Kir4.1 expression in a murine model of Rett syndrome. We demonstrate by chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis that Kir4.1 is a direct molecular target of MeCP2. Astrocytes from &lt;i&gt;Mecp2&lt;/i&gt;-deficient mice express significantly less Kir4.1 mRNA and protein, which translates into a &amp;gt;50% deficiency in Ba&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-sensitive Kir4.1-mediated currents, and impaired extracellular potassium dynamics. By examining astrocytes in isolation, we demonstrate that loss of Kir4.1 is cell autonomous. Assessment through postnatal development revealed that Kir4.1 expression in &lt;i&gt;Mecp2&lt;/i&gt;-deficient animals never reaches adult, wild-type levels, consistent with a neurodevelopmental disorder. These are the first data implicating a direct MeCP2 molecular target in astrocytes and provide novel mechanistic insight explaining a potential mechanism by which astrocytic dysfunction may contribute to RTT.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: The Neural Dynamics of Facial Identity Processing: Insights from EEG-Based Pattern Analysis and Image Reconstruction</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/5/1/ENEURO.0358-17.2018?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Uncovering the neural dynamics of facial identity processing along with its representational basis outlines a major endeavor in the study of visual processing. To this end, here, we record human electroencephalography (EEG) data associated with viewing face stimuli; then, we exploit spatiotemporal EEG information to determine the neural correlates of facial identity representations and to reconstruct the appearance of the corresponding stimuli. Our findings indicate that multiple temporal intervals support: facial identity classification, face space estimation, visual feature extraction and image reconstruction. In particular, we note that both classification and reconstruction accuracy peak in the proximity of the N170 component. Further, aggregate data from a larger interval (50–650 ms after stimulus onset) support robust reconstruction results, consistent with the availability of distinct visual information over time. Thus, theoretically, our findings shed light on the time course of face processing while, methodologically, they demonstrate the feasibility of EEG-based image reconstruction.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Sensory information is processed in specific brain regions, and shared between the cerebral hemispheres by axons that cross the midline through the corpus callosum. However, sensory deprivation usually causes sensory losses and/or functional changes. This is the case of people who suffered limb amputation and show changes of body map organization within the somatosensory cortex (S1) of the deafferented cerebral hemisphere (contralateral to the amputated limb), as well as in the afferented hemisphere (ipsilateral to the amputated limb). Although several studies have approached these functional changes, the possible finer morphological alterations, such as those occurring in callosal axons, still remain unknown. The present work combined histochemistry, single-axon tracing and 3D microscopy to analyze the fine morphological changes that occur in callosal axons of the forepaw representation in early amputated rats. We showed that the forepaw representation in S1 was reduced in the deafferented hemisphere and expanded in the afferented side. Accordingly, after amputation, callosal axons originating from the deafferented cortex undergo an expansion of their terminal arbors with increased number of terminal boutons within the homotopic representation at the afferented cerebral hemisphere. Similar microscale structural changes may underpin the macroscale morphological and functional phenomena that characterize limb amputation in humans.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: GSK3β Modulates Timing-Dependent Long-Term Depression Through Direct Phosphorylation of Kv4.2 Channels</title>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy042/4904064?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Spike timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) is a form of activity-dependent remodeling of synaptic strength that underlies memory formation. Despite its key role in dictating learning rules in the brain circuits, the molecular mechanisms mediating STDP are still poorly understood. Here, we show that spike timing-dependent long-term depression (tLTD) and A-type K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; currents are modulated by pharmacological agents affecting the levels of active glycogen-synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) and by GSK3β knockdown in layer 2/3 of the mouse somatosensory cortex. Moreover, the blockade of A-type K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; currents mimics the effects of GSK3 up-regulation on tLTD and occludes further changes in synaptic strength. Pharmacological, immunohistochemical and biochemical experiments revealed that GSK3β influence over tLTD induction is mediated by direct phosphorylation at Ser-616 of the Kv4.2 subunit, a molecular determinant of A-type K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; currents. Collectively, these results identify the functional interaction between GSK3β and Kv4.2 channel as a novel mechanism for tLTD modulation providing exciting insight into the understanding of GSK3β role in synaptic plasticity.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Low-Intensity Pulsed Ultrasound Attenuates LPS-Induced Neuroinflammation and Memory Impairment by Modulation of TLR4/NF-κB Signaling and CREB/BDNF Expression</title>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy039/4904063?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;The purpose of this study was to investigate the restorative role of low-intensity pulsed ultrasound (LIPUS) against lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced neuroinflammation and memory impairments in a simulation of Alzheimer’s disease. Mice subjected to LPS administration (250 μg/kg, i.p.) were treated with LIPUS daily for 7 days. The levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and inflammatory markers were estimated in brain tissue using western blot. After LIPUS treatment, the neuroprotective effects of LIPUS in mice were assessed by behavioral tests. LPS plus LIPUS-treated mice exhibited a significant increase in the average time spent in the target quadrant compared to the LPS-treated group. Compared with the LPS-treated group, LPS plus LIPUS-treated mice revealed a preference for the novel object. LIPUS treatment significantly attenuated LPS-induced increases in the expression of amyloid-beta (Aβ) and amyloid precursor protein (APP) in the hippocampus region of LPS-treated mice. Furthermore, LIPUS significantly reduced the protein levels of TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 in the mice brain induced by LPS. LIPUS treatment induces neuroprotection by inhibiting the LPS-induced activation of TLR4/NF-κB inflammatory signaling and by enhancing the associated CREB/BDNF expression in LPS-treated mice. Our data showed that LIPUS attenuated LPS-induced memory impairment as well as amyloidogenesis via the suppression of neuroinflammatory activity and BDNF decline.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Preterm Birth Changes Networks of Newborn Cortical Activity</title>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhy012/4904062?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Preterm birth is the greatest risk factor for lifelong neurocognitive deficits, globally. The effect of prematurity on early cortical network function has, however, remained poorly understood. Here, we developed a novel methodology that allows reliable assessment of functional connectivity in neonatal brain activity at millisecond and multisecond scales in terms of cortical phase and amplitude correlations, respectively. We measured scalp electroencephalography at term-equivalent age in infants exposed to very early prematurity as well as in healthy controls. We found that newborn cortical activity organizes into multiplex networks that differ significantly between vigilance states. As compared with healthy control infants, prematurity was found to cause frequency-specific patterns of dysconnectivity in cortical network, changes that were distinct for networks of phase and amplitude correlations. Neuroanatomically, the most prominent markers of prematurity were found in connections involving the frontal regions. Phase synchrony in frontally connected networks was correlated with newborn neurological performance, suggesting the first measure of cortical functional coupling that correlates with neurological performance in human infant.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>
