	<title>Experimental Brain Research: Effects of estrogen and progesterone on the neurogenic inflammatory neuropeptides: implications for gender differences in migraine</title>
	<link>http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s00221-020-05923-7</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Neurogenic inflammation including calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) and substance-P (SP) release plays a pivotal role in migraine pathogenesis. Prevalence of migraine is ~ 3 folds higher in women than in men, but its underlying mechanisms remained unclear. We investigated the effects of female sex hormones estrogen and progesterone on CGRP and SP in in-vivo and ex-vivo in rats of both sexes. For in-vivo experiments, male, female and ovariectomized rats were separated into four groups (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 7) as control, estrogen, progesterone and estrogen + progesterone, respectively. Groups received daily intraperitoneal vehicle, 17β-estradiol, progesterone and 17β-estradiol + progesterone for 5 days, respectively. For ex-vivo experiments in both sexes, isolated trigeminal ganglia and hemiskull preparations were divided into four groups (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 6 or 8), respectively, as in-vivo groups, and administered the same test substances. CGRP and SP contents in plasma and superfusates were determined using ELISA. In in-vivo experiments, 17β-estradiol decreased CGRP levels in males and SP levels in ovariectomized rats. Progesterone increased both CGRP and SP levels in females. Their combination decreased both CGRP and SP levels in males, and only SP levels in ovariectomized rats. In ex-vivo experiments, 17β-estradiol reduced CGRP release in males and SP release in females in trigeminal ganglia. While progesterone increased CGRP release in trigeminal ganglia, it reduced SP release from hemiskulls in both sexes. Their combination restored progesterone-mediated changes in neuropeptides releases in both trigeminal ganglia and hemiskulls in both sexes. Estrogen alleviates neurogenic inflammation through modulation of CGRP and SP release. Progesterone has dual effects on these neuropeptides in different sites associated with migraine pain.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Experimental Brain Research: Local syntactic violations evoke fast mismatch-related neural activity detected by optical neuroimaging</title>
	<link>http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s00221-020-05922-8</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;It remains to be investigated whether syntax-related mismatch activity would be evoked in event-related optical signals by syntactic violations that deviate from our language knowledge and expectations. In the current study, we have employed fast optical neuroimaging with a frequency-domain oximeter to examine whether syntactic violations of English bare infinitives in the non-finite complement clause would trigger syntax-related mismatch effects. Recorded sentences of bare or full infinitive structures (without or with the ‘&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;to&lt;/em&gt;’ infinitival marker) with syntactically correct or incorrect versions and non-syntactic lexical items (verbs) were presented to native speakers of English (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;n&lt;/em&gt; = 8) during silent movie viewing as a passive oddball task. The analysis of source strength (i.e., minimum norm current amplitudes) revealed that the syntactic category violations of bare object infinitives led to significantly more robust optical mismatch effects than the other syntactic violation and non-structural, lexical elements. This mismatch response had a peak latency of 186 ms in the left anterior superior temporal gyrus. In combination with our prior MEG report (Kubota et al. in Neurosci Lett 662:195–204, 2018), the present optical neuroimaging findings show that syntactic marking (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;unmarked&lt;/em&gt;-to-&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;marked&lt;/em&gt;) violations of the bare object infinitive against the rule of the mental grammar enhance the signal strength exactly in the same manner seen with MEG scanning, including the peak latency of mismatch activity and the activated area of the brain.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Experimental Brain Research: Functional brain asymmetry for emotions: psychological stress-induced reversed hemispheric asymmetry in emotional face perception</title>
	<link>http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s00221-020-05920-w</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Empirical evidence has demonstrated functional (mostly right-biased) brain asymmetry for emotion perception, whereas recent studies indicate that acute stress may modulate left and/or right hemisphere activation. However, it is still unknown whether emotion perception can be influenced by stress-induced hemispheric activation since behavioral studies report inconsistent or even contradictory results. We sought to reevaluate this gap. Eighty-eight healthy Caucasian university students participated in the study. In half of the randomly selected participants, acute psychological stress was induced by displaying a brief stressful movie clip (the stress condition), whereas the other half were shown a neutral movie clip (the non-stress condition). Prior to (the baseline) and following the movie clip display an emotion perception task was applied by presenting an emotional (happy, surprised, fearful, sad, angry, or disgusted) or neutral face to the left or right visual field. We found a more accurate perception of emotional and neutral faces presented to the LVF (the right hemisphere) in the baseline. However, we revealed that after watching a neutral movie clip, behavioral performance in emotional and neutral face perception accuracy became relatively equalized for both visual fields, whereas after watching a stressful movie clip, the RVF (the left hemisphere) even became dominant in emotional face perception. We propose a novel hemispheric functional-equivalence model: the brain is initially right-biased in emotional and neutral face perception by default; however, psychophysiological activation of a distributed brain-network due to watching neutral movie clips redistributes hemispheric performance toward relative equivalence. Moreover, even reversed hemispheric asymmetry may occur.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Experimental Brain Research: Functional specialization in human dorsal pathway for stereoscopic depth processing</title>
	<link>http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s00221-020-05918-4</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Binocular disparity, a primary cue for stereoscopic depth perception, is widely represented in visual cortex. However, the functional specialization in the disparity processing network remains unclear. Using magnetic resonance imaging-guided transcranial magnetic stimulation, we studied the causal contributions of V3A and MT+ to stereoscopic depth perception. Subjects viewed random-dot stereograms forming transparent planes with various interplane disparities. Their smallest detectable disparity and largest detectable disparity were measured in two experiments. We found that the smallest detectable disparity was affected by V3A, but not MT+ , stimulation. On the other hand, the largest detectable disparity was affected by both V3A and MT+ stimulation. Our results suggest different roles of V3A and MT+ in stereoscopic depth processing.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Experimental Brain Research: Protection of MCC950 against Alzheimer's disease via inhibiting neuronal pyroptosis in SAMP8 mice</title>

	<content:encoded>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Neuronal dysfunction and loss are thought to be one of the causes of cognitive impairment in Alzheimer's disease (AD), but the specific mechanism of neuronal loss in the pathogenesis of AD remains controversial. This study explored the role of NLRP3 inflammasome-induced neuronal pyroptosis in neuronal loss of AD, and pioneered the use of NLRP3 inhibitor MCC950 to intervene in the treatment of senescence-accelerated mouse prone 8 (SAMP8) mice. In vitro, human primary neurons (HPNs) pretreated with MCC950 were stimulated with amyloid-β&lt;sub class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;1–42&lt;/sub&gt; (Aβ&lt;sub class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;1–42&lt;/sub&gt;), and it was found that MCC950 significantly reduced the neurotoxicity of Aβ&lt;sub class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;1–42&lt;/sub&gt; by inhibiting neuronal pyroptosis. In vivo, SAMP8 mice were randomly divided into vehicle-treated group and MCC950-treated group, and it was found that MCC950 also played a positive role in treatment. The intervention of MCC950 improved the spatial memory ability and brain histological morphology of SAMP8 mice, and reduced the deposition of amyloid-β in the brain. Furthermore, MCC950 was found to inhibit the overexpressions of NLRP3, caspase-1, and GSDMD, which were the response factors of pyroptosis in SAMP8 mouse neurons, by immunofluorescence staining. In this study, we found that neuronal pyroptosis induced by the NLRP3/caspase-1/GSDMD axis was an important factor in neuronal loss of AD, and revealed that MCC950 might be a potential AD therapeutic agent.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Subjects’ eye movement behavior related to cognitive effort during gait was measured as subjects walked to perform low and high cognitive load tasks. We found that all pupil diameter measures, fixation durations, and the proportion of blink duration changed significantly during gait as a function of task load. In contrast, the number of fixations, saccade durations and travel time did not change significantly as a function of task load. Findings showed that pupil diameter was the best predictor of task load during one’s gait preceding the performance of the task. While other studies have demonstrated the importance of eye fixation characteristics during gait, our findings showed that eye measures related to pupil diameter were better at detecting cognitive load while walking to perform a task compared to eye fixation data. We also found that cognitive effort was not limited to just the performance of the task, but that it was also exerted during one’s gait preceding the performance of the task. Therefore, the additional attention demand caused by an increase in task complexity may result in less attentional resources being available to adequately handle distractions (such as obstacle avoidance) while walking to perform the task. Consequently, this may increase the likelihood of falls in those individuals with lower attentional capacity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Obesity is known to have a detrimental effect on balance and motor performance during daily motor tasks. However, it remains unclear whether these obesity-related impairments are due to deficient anticipatory postural adjustments (APA) that precede voluntary movement. The objective of this study was to examine the effects of obesity on APA and the impacts related on motor performance and mediolateral postural stability during gait initiation. Fifteen obese and ten normal-weight young participants performed a series of gait initiation at their preferred speed. Our results showed that the durations and amplitudes of APA along both anteroposterior and mediolateral directions did not differ between the two groups (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; &amp;gt; 0.05). In contrast, compared to normal-weight participants, mechanical effectiveness of APA was reduced in obese participants (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05). As a result, we observed a decreased motor performance (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05), in terms of peak anteroposterior center-of-mass velocity at the end of the first step, and a reduced mediolateral stability at swing foot contact in obese participants compared to normal-weight participants (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05). These findings suggest that APA effectiveness during gait initiation is reduced in obese adults, resulting in a decrease of both mediolateral stability and motor performance compared to their lean counterparts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Systemic treatments for ischemic stroke as a disease with high disability and death have been yet unsuccessful. Combined treatments can potentially cause better results in treatment of patients with Stroke. In this study we assessed the neuroprotective effect of modafinil-coated gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) and mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) in ischemic stroke rats. Stem cells and AuNPs offer great promise for new medical treatments. 60 male Wistar rats were randomly divided into five groups (12 in each group): (1) the group that developed middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO or ischemia), (2) the normal group (control), (3) the MCAO group that received MSC (C + MCAO), (4) the MCAO group that received MSC and modafinil (CM + MCAO), and (5) the MCAO group that received MSC and modafinil-coated AuNPs (CMN + MCAO). Middle Cerebral Artery Occlusion (MCAO) was performed by inserting a silicone coat filament in the right internal carotid artery via the external carotid artery until it reached the anterior cerebral artery. The filament was located in the internal carotid artery for 60 min and then removed. Modafinil-coated AuNPs (100 mg/kg) or Modafinil (100 mg/kg) were given to the rats as an oral gavage, once a day in the morning time. Finally, infarct volume, BDNF (Brain-derived neurotrophic factor), GDNF (Glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor), NeuN (neuronal nuclear protein) expression, and cell apoptosis in brain were analyzed. The brain infarct volume and apoptosis significantly decreased and &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;BDNF, NeuN,&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;GDNF&lt;/em&gt; increased in C + MCAO, CM + MCAO, and CMN + MCAO groups compared to ischemia. CMN + MCAO groups did not show significant difference in these factors compared to control group. These results demonstrated that the administration of stem cells and Modafinil-coated AuNPs at the same time had a good effect on ischemic brain injuries. It happened through increasing neurotrophic factors and decreasing brain cell apoptosis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Emerging evidence indicates that NLRP3 inflammasome-induced inflammation plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of depression. Thus, inhibition of NLRP3 inflammasome activation may offer a therapeutic benefit in the treatment of depression. Metformin has been shown to have potential anti-inflammatory activity, but the underlying mechanisms remain obscure. We used a chronic mild stress model of depression and cultured primary macrophage to investigate the effects of metformin on depression and its underlying mechanisms. We demonstrated that metformin alleviated depressive-like behaviors in the chronic mild stress-induced anhedonia model of depression. We further found that metformin significantly suppressed NLRP3 inflammasome activation, subsequent caspase-1 cleavage, and interleukin-1β secretion in both peripheral macrophages and central hippocampus. Our findings reveal that metformin confers an antidepressant effect partly through inhibition of peripheral and central NLRP3 inflammasome activation. In light of metformin favorable properties, it should be evaluated in the treatment of depression and related neurologic disorders characterized by NLRP3 inflammasome activation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;A goal of rehabilitation after stroke is to promote pre-stroke levels of arm use for every day, frequently bimanual, functional activities. We reasoned that, after a stroke, the choice to use one or both hands for bimanual tasks might depend not only on residual motor capacity, but also the specialized demands imposed by the task on the paretic hand. To capture spontaneous, task-specific choices, we covertly observed 50 pre-stroke right-handed chronic stroke survivors (25 each of left, LHD, and right-hemisphere damage, RHD) and 11 age-similar control adults and recorded their hand use strategies for two pairs of bimanual tasks with distinct demands: one with greater precision requirements (photo-album tasks), and another with greater stabilization requirements (letter-envelope tasks). The primary outcome was the choice to use one or both hands. Logistic regression was used to test the two hypotheses that the probability of choosing a bimanual strategy would be greater in those with less severe motor impairment and also in those with LHD. When collapsed across the four tasks, we found support for these hypotheses. Notably, however, the influence of these factors on bimanual choice varied based on task demands. For the photo–album pair, the probability of a bimanual strategy was greater for those with LHD compared to RHD, regardless of the degree of motor impairment. For the letter–envelope pair, we found a significant interaction between impairment and side of lesion in determining the likelihood of choosing both hands. Therefore, the manner in which side of lesion moderates the effect of impairment on hand use depends on the task.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Vessel damage is a general pathological process in many neurodegenerative disorders, as well as spinal cord injury, stroke, or trauma. Biomaterials can present novel tools to repair and regenerate damaged vessels. The aim of the present study is to test collagen hydrogels loaded with different angiogenic factors to study vessel repair in organotypic brain slice cultures. In the experimental set up I, we made a cut on the organotypic brain slice and tested re-growth of laminin + vessels. In the experimental set up II, we cultured two half brain slices with a gap with a collagen hydrogel placed in between to study endothelial cell migration. In the experimental set up I, we showed that the number of vessels crossing the cut was tendencially increased with the addition of fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2), vascular endothelial growth factor, or platelet-derived growth factor-BB compared to the control group. In the experimental set up II, we demonstrated that a collagen hydrogel loaded with FGF-2 resulted in a significantly increased number of migrated laminin + cells in the gap between the slices compared to the control hydrogel. Co-administration of several growth factors did not further potentiate the effects. Taken together, we show that organotypic brain slices are good models to study brain vessels and FGF-2 is a potent angiogenic factor for endothelial cell proliferation and migration. Our results provide evidence that the collagen hydrogels can be used as an extracellular matrix for the vascular endothelial cells.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;The purpose of this study was to determine if the implementation of a strict validation procedure, designed to limit the inclusion of inaccuracies from the decomposition of surface electromyographic (sEMG) signals, affects population-based motor unit (MU) analyses. Four sEMG signals were obtained from the vastus lateralis of 59 participants during isometric contractions at different relative intensities [30%, 70%, and 100% of maximal voluntary contraction (MVC)], and its individual motor unit potential trains (MUPTs) were extracted. The MUPTs were then excluded (ISIval) based on the coefficient of variation and histogram of the interspike intervals (ISI), the absence of additional clusters that reveals missed or additional firings, and more. MU population-based regression models (i.e., modeling the entire motor unit pool) were performed between motor unit potential size (MUP&lt;sub class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;SIZE&lt;/sub&gt;), mean firing rate (MFR), and recruitment threshold (RT%) separately for DSDC&lt;sub class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Only&lt;/sub&gt; (includes all MUPTs without the additional validation performed) and ISIval data at each contraction intensity. The only significant difference in regression coefficients between DSDC&lt;sub class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Only&lt;/sub&gt; and ISIval was for the intercepts of the MUP&lt;sub class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;SIZE&lt;/sub&gt;/MFR at 100% MVC. The validation had no other significant effect on any of the other regression coefficients for each of the contraction intensities. Our findings suggest that even though the decomposition of surface signals leads to some inaccuracies, these errors have limited effects on the regression models used to estimate the behavior of the whole pool. Therefore, we propose that motor unit population-based regression models may be robust enough to overcome decomposition-induced errors at the individual MU level.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Mental imagery can induce audiovisual integration, but whether it can induce interactions in other modalities remains uncertain. It has been demonstrated that audiomotor interaction can be generated following training, but whether such audiomotor interaction can be induced by auditory imagery training remains unknown. The present study aims at determining whether auditory mental imagery could induce a multimodal association with postural control. We examined static postural control in the presence of a frequency-modulated sound in three groups of participants, prior to and following a short period of training designed to create an association between auditory mental imagery of sounds and postural swaying. Results suggest that mental imagery impacted performance, as a significant decrease in postural control was observed in the experimental group following mental imagery training. Results of the control groups confirmed that the effect of mental imagery was not due to response bias, but to a significant multimodal interaction following training. These findings are in accordance with previous studies suggesting that mental imagery stimuli can interact with perceptual stimuli of a different sensory modality and lead to multisensory integration. The results also confirm that audiomotor interaction can be generated a mental imagery training. However, the full extent of mental imagery influence on multimodal interaction remains to be determined.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Between these administrations of the mANTI-Vea our participants spent ~ 6 h performing an intervening task. Our intent in this project was two-fold: first, to replicate the pattern of effects reported in Luna et al.’s original presentation of the ANTI-Vea; second, to assay the impact of fatigue on vigilance and attention by observing shifts in mANTI-Vea performance as a function of time on task and before versus after the intervening task. With time-on-task (the mANTI-Vea is divided into six sub-blocks) we observed that participants became increasingly conservative in their biases to respond towards infrequent targets, showed a decline in sensitivity, and lapsed in responding in the psychomotor vigilance task with greater frequency. In the pre/post comparison, we observed an increase in the proportion of lapses, but not in participants’ response biases. Attentional network scores were found to be somewhat insensitive to our fatigue manipulations; the effect of time-on-task was only significant for orienting scores on RT, and our pre/post comparison was only significant for RT derived executive functioning scores.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Subjects performed different goal-directed tasks representing three hierarchical levels of planning. The first level of planning consisted of having the subject walk to a bookcase on which an object (a cup) was located in the middle of a shelf. The second level of planning consisted of walking to the bookcase and picking up the cup which was in the middle, on the right side, or on the left side of the bookcase shelf. The third level of planning consisted of walking to the bookcase, picking up the cup which was located in the middle of the bookcase shelf, and moving it to a higher shelf. Findings showed that hierarchal goals do affect center of mass velocity and eye fixation behavior. Center of mass velocity to the bookcase increased with an increase in the number of goals. Subjects decreased gait velocity as they approached the bookcase and adjusted their last steps to accommodate picking up the cup. The findings also demonstrated the important role of vision in controlling gait velocity in goal-directed tasks. Eye fixation duration was more important than the number of eye fixations in controlling gait velocity. Thus, the amount of information gained through object fixation duration is of greater importance than the number of fixations on the object for effective goal achievement.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;The Human Connectome Project (HCP) provides a rich dataset of quantitative and domain-specific behavioral measures from twins and extensive family structures. This makes the dataset a unique and a valuable resource to investigate heritability and determine individual differences. Using a set of measures of behavioral domains (motor, emotion, personality, sensory, and cognition), we estimated the intraclass correlations (ICCs) and heritability of 56 behavioral measures for 4 genetically identified groups of participants: monozygotic (MZ) twins, dizygotic (DZ) twins, non-twin siblings (SB), and unrelated individuals (NR). The ICCs range varied among behavioral domains but systematically so among the four genetic groups. We found the same rank order of ICCs, from the highest values for MZ twins, statistically significantly smaller for the DZ twins and sibling group (compared to MZ), and close to zero for NR. The mean heritability values of the five behavioral domains were: cognition &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;h&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.405, emotion &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;h&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.316, motor &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;h&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.138, personality &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;h&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.444, and sensory &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;h&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.193. These domains share overlapping brain networks. The heritability of motor domain was significantly smaller than cognitive, personality, and emotion domains. These findings provide new insight into the effect of genetics on the various diverse behavioral measures.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) produces motor-evoked potentials (MEP) used to infer changes in corticomotor excitability. In humans, neck rotation can probe reticulospinal input on corticomotor output. This study investigated the effect of neck rotation on MEP duration in a proximal and distal upper limb muscle and compared responses between rest and preactivation. Single-pulse TMS to motor cortex was used to evoke MEPs at two stimulus intensities in 18 healthy adults (20–40 years). Surface electromyography recorded MEPs from the non-dominant biceps brachii (BB) and first dorsal interosseous (FDI). Participants were seated with the target muscle at rest or 10% preactivated, and head rotated ipsilateral, contralateral, or in neutral position. The primary outcome was MEP tail, defined as the mean difference in MEP duration between active and rest trials. Secondary outcomes were MEP duration and amplitude. MEP tail was modulated by neck rotation in the proximal BB (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; = 0.03) but not distal FDI (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; &amp;gt; 0.19), with shorter duration during ipsilateral or contralateral rotation relative to neutral. In a neutral neck position, MEP duration was prolonged by muscle preactivation and higher TMS intensities in the FDI and BB (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lt; 0.03). Neck rotation attenuated the prolongation of MEP duration during preactivation in the BB, but not the FDI. Neck rotation had no effect on MEP amplitude for either muscle (&lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;P&lt;/em&gt; &amp;gt; 0.05). Modulation of the late portion of the MEP by rotation of the neck could indicate subcortical projections to alpha-motoneuron pools are stronger in proximal than distal upper limb muscles. These findings may have relevance for using MEP duration as a neural biomarker in neurological diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Paired associative stimulation (PAS) can induce plasticity in the motor cortex, as measured by changes in corticospinal excitability (CSE). This effect is attenuated in older and less active individuals. Although a single bout of exercise enhances PAS-induced plasticity in young, physically inactive adults, it is not yet known if physical activity interventions affect PAS-induced neuroplasticity in middle-aged inactive individuals. Sixteen inactive middle-aged office workers participated in a randomized cross-over design investigating how CSE and short-interval intracortical inhibition (SICI) were affected by PAS preceded by 3 h of sitting (SIT), 3 h of sitting interrupted every 30 min by 3 min of frequent short bouts of physical activity (FPA) and 2.5 h of sitting followed by 25 min of moderate-intensity exercise (EXE). Transcranial magnetic stimulation was applied over the primary motor cortex (M1) of the dominant abductor pollicis brevis to induce recruitment curves before and 5 min and 30 min post-PAS. Linear mixed models were used to compare changes in CSE using time and condition as fixed effects and subjects as random effects. There was a main effect of time on CSE and planned within-condition comparisons showed that CSE was significantly increased from baseline to 5 min and 30 min post-PAS, in the FPA condition, with no significant changes in the SIT or EXE conditions. SICI decreased from baseline to 5 min post-PAS, but this was not related to changes in CSE. Our findings suggest that in middle-aged inactive adults, FPAs may promote corticospinal neuroplasticity. Possible mechanisms are discussed.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;It is now accepted that performing a cognitive task impacts postural control (Polskaia and Lajoie 2016; Vuillerme et al. Neurosci Lett 291: 77–80, 2000). However, the reverse impact of posture on cognitive performance is less documented. The present study investigated performance in two cognitive activities (memory and arithmetic) performed in three different postural conditions (sitting, standing, and walking). Overall, our data suggest that the posture adopted during a task can improve cognitive performance with a better answer for arithmetic in the sitting position than during walking but more correctly recalled words while walking. This study, thus, suggests that there could be preferential association between cognition and posture, i.e., memory cognitive performance can be improved when walking and mental arithmetic while sitting.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.07208</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Infant vocal babbling strongly relies on jaw oscillations, especially at the
stage of canonical babbling, which underlies the syllabic structure of world
languages. In this paper, we propose, model and analyze an hypothesis to
explain this predominance of the jaw in early babbling. This hypothesis states
that general stochastic optimization principles, when applied to learning
sensorimotor control, automatically generate ordered babbling stages with a
predominant exploration of jaw movements in early stages. The reason is that
those movements impact the auditory effects more than other articulators. In
previous computational models, such general principles were shown to
selectively freeze and free degrees of freedom in a model reproducing the
proximo-distal development observed in infant arm reaching. The contribution of
this paper is to show how, using the same methods, we are able to explain such
patterns in vocal development. We present three experiments. The two first ones
show that the recruitment order of articulators emerging from stochastic
optimization depends on the target sound to be achieved but that on average the
jaw is largely chosen as the first recruited articulator. The third experiment
analyses in more detail how the emerging recruitment order is shaped by the
dynamics of the optimization process.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A large scale computational model of the basal ganglia (BG) network is
proposed to describes movement disorder including deep brain stimulation (DBS).
The model of this complex network considers four areas of the basal ganglia
network: the subthalamic nucleus (STN) as target area of DBS, globus pallidus,
both pars externa and pars interna (GPe-GPi), and the thalamus (THA).
Parkinsonian conditions are simulated by assuming reduced dopaminergic input
and corresponding pronounced inhibitory or disinhibited projections to GPe and
GPi. Macroscopic quantities can be derived which correlate closely to thalamic
responses and hence motor programme fidelity. It can be demonstrated that
depending on different levels of striatal projections to the GPe and GPi, the
dynamics of these macroscopic quantities switch from normal conditions to
parkinsonian. Simulating DBS on the STN affects the dynamics of the entire
network, increasing the thalamic activity to levels close to normal, while
differing from both normal and parkinsonian dynamics. Using the mentioned
macroscopic quantities, the model proposes optimal DBS frequency ranges above
130 Hz.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.07143</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A central question in neuroscience is how self-organizing dynamic
interactions in the brain emerge on their relatively static structural
backbone. Due to the complexity of spatial and temporal dependencies between
different brain areas, fully comprehending the interplay between structure and
function is still challenging and an area of intense research. In this paper we
present a graph neural network (GNN) framework, to describe functional
interactions based on the structural anatomical layout. A GNN allows us to
process graph-structured spatio-temporal signals, providing a possibility to
combine structural information derived from diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) with
temporal neural activity profiles, like observed in functional magnetic
resonance imaging (fMRI). Moreover, dynamic interactions between different
brain regions learned by this data-driven approach can provide a multi-modal
measure of causal connectivity strength. We assess the proposed model's
accuracy by evaluating its capabilities to replicate empirically observed
neural activation profiles, and compare the performance to those of a vector
auto regression (VAR), like typically used in Granger causality. We show that
GNNs are able to capture long-term dependencies in data and also
computationally scale up to the analysis of large-scale networks. Finally we
confirm that features learned by a GNN can generalize across MRI scanner types
and acquisition protocols, by demonstrating that the performance on small
datasets can be improved by pre-training the GNN on data from an earlier and
different study. We conclude that the proposed multi-modal GNN framework can
provide a novel perspective on the structure-function relationship in the
brain. Therewith this approach can be promising for the characterization of the
information flow in brain networks.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Reservoir computing has repeatedly been shown to be extremely successful in
the prediction of nonlinear time-series. However, there is no complete
understanding of the proper design of a reservoir yet. We find that the
simplest popular setup has a harmful symmetry, which leads to the prediction of
what we call mirror-attractor. We prove this analytically. Similar problems can
arise in a general context, and we use them to explain the success or failure
of some designs. The symmetry is a direct consequence of the hyperbolic tangent
activation function. Further, four ways to break the symmetry are compared
numerically: A bias in the output, a shift in the input, a quadratic term in
the readout, and a mixture of even and odd activation functions. Firstly, we
test their susceptibility to the mirror-attractor. Secondly, we evaluate their
performance on the task of predicting Lorenz data with the mean shifted to
zero. The short-time prediction is measured with the forecast horizon while the
largest Lyapunov exponent and the correlation dimension are used to represent
the climate. Finally, the same analysis is repeated on a combined dataset of
the Lorenz attractor and the Halvorsen attractor, which we designed to reveal
potential problems with symmetry. We find that all methods except the output
bias are able to fully break the symmetry with input shift and quadratic
readout performing the best overall.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.07071</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A synaptic theory of Working Memory (WM) has been developed in the last
decade as a possible alternative to the persistent spiking paradigm. In this
context, we have developed a neural mass model able to reproduce exactly the
dynamics of heterogeneous spiking neural networks encompassing realistic
cellular mechanisms for short-term synaptic plasticity. This population model
reproduces the macroscopic dynamics of the network in terms of the firing rate
and the mean membrane potential. The latter quantity allows us to get insight
on Local Field Potential and electroencephalographic signals measured during WM
tasks to characterize the brain activity. More specifically synaptic
facilitation and depression integrate each other to efficiently mimic WM
operations via either synaptic reactivation or persistent activity. Memory
access and loading are associated to stimulus-locked transient oscillations
followed by a steady-state activity in the $\beta-\gamma$ band, thus resembling
what observed in the cortex during vibrotactile stimuli in humans and object
recognition in monkeys. Memory juggling and competition emerge already by
loading only two items. However more items can be stored in WM by considering
neural architectures composed of multiple excitatory populations and a common
inhibitory pool. Memory capacity depends strongly on the presentation rate of
the items and it maximizes for an optimal frequency range. In particular we
provide an analytic expression for the maximal memory capacity. Furthermore,
the mean membrane potential turns out to be a suitable proxy to measure the
memory load, analogously to event driven potentials in experiments on humans.
Finally we show that the $\gamma$ power increases with the number of loaded
items, as reported in many experiments, while $\theta$ and $\beta$ power reveal
non monotonic behaviours.

nonlinear dynamic modeling. Each of these generalizations leads to greatly
improved predictive performance without sacrificing a unique trait of Koopman
methods: the potential for fast, globally optimal control of nonlinear,

rather than linear dynamics in the lifted space. The second, Extended Koopman
Models, additionally introduces an invertible transformation of the control
signal which contributes to the lifted convex dynamics. We describe a deep
learning architecture for parameterizing these classes of models, and show
experimentally that each significantly outperforms traditional Koopman models
in trajectory prediction for two nonlinear, nonconvex dynamic systems.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Raven's Progressive Matrices have been widely used for measuring abstract
reasoning and intelligence in humans. However for artificial learning systems,
abstract reasoning remains a challenging problem. In this paper we investigate
how neural networks augmented with biologically inspired spiking modules gain a
significant advantage in solving this problem. To illustrate this, we first
investigate the performance of our networks with supervised learning, then with
unsupervised learning. Experiments on the RAVEN dataset show that the overall
accuracy of our supervised networks surpass human-level performance, while our
unsupervised networks significantly outperform existing unsupervised methods.
Finally, our results from both supervised and unsupervised learning illustrate
that, unlike their non-augmented counterparts, networks with spiking modules
are able to extract and encode temporal features without any explicit
instruction, do not heavily rely on training data, and generalise more readily
to new problems. In summary, the results reported here indicate that artificial

the inherent speed, and spatial, temporal and wavelength-based processing
diversity of signals in the optical domain. DLR delivers reductions in form
factor, hardware complexity, power consumption and latency, compared to
State-of-the-Art . DLR can be implemented with a single photonic DL and a few

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) is a stochastic neural network capable
of solving a variety of difficult tasks such as NP-Hard combinatorial
optimization problems and integer factorization. The RBM architecture is also
very compact; requiring very few weights and biases. This, along with its
simple, parallelizable sampling algorithm for finding the ground state of such
problems, makes the RBM amenable to hardware acceleration. However, training of
the RBM on these problems can pose a significant challenge, as the training
algorithm tends to fail for large problem sizes and efficient mappings can be
hard to find. Here, we propose a method of combining RBMs together that avoids
the need to train large problems in their full form. We also propose methods
for making the RBM more hardware amenable, allowing the algorithm to be
efficiently mapped to an FPGA-based accelerator. Using this accelerator, we are
able to show hardware accelerated factorization of 16 bit numbers with high
accuracy with a speed improvement of 10000x and a power improvement of 32x.

life: living organisms can be seen as systems that extract and process
information from their surroundings in order to reduce uncertainty. Here we
take this computational approach using a simple bit string model of coevolving
agents and their parasites. While agents try to predict their worlds, parasites
do the same with their hosts. The result of this process is that, in order to
escape their parasites, the host agents expand their computational complexity
despite the cost of maintaining it. This, in turn, is followed by increasingly
complex parasitic counterparts. Such arms races display several qualitative
phases, from monotonous to punctuated evolution or even ecological collapse.
Our minimal model illustrates the relevance of parasites in providing an active
mechanism for expanding living complexity beyond simple replicators, suggesting
that parasitic agents are likely to be a major evolutionary driver for
biological complexity.

	<title>Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience: Prolonged Targeted Cardiovascular Epidural Stimulation Improves Immunological Molecular Profile: A Case Report in Chronic Severe Spinal Cord Injury</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2020.571011</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In individuals with severe spinal cord injury (SCI), the autonomic nervous system (ANS) is affected leading to cardiovascular deficits, which include significant blood pressure instability, with the prevalence of systemic hypotension and orthostatic intolerance resulting in an increased risk of stroke. Additionally, persons with SCI rostral to thoracic vertebral level 5 (T5), where sympathetic nervous system fibers exit the spinal cord and innervate the immune system, have clinically significant systemic inflammation and increased infection risk. Our recent studies show that lumbosacral spinal cord epidural stimulation (scES), applied at the lumbosacral level using targeted configurations that promote cardiovascular stability (CV-scES), can safely and effectively normalize blood pressure in persons with chronic SCI. Herein we present a case report in a female (age 27 years) with chronic clinically motor complete cervical SCI demonstrating that 97-sessions of CV-scES, which increased systemic blood pressure, improved orthostatic tolerance in association with increased cerebral blood flow velocity in the middle cerebral artery, also promoted positive immunological changes in whole-blood gene expression. Specifically, there was evidence of the down-regulation of inflammatory pathways and the up-regulation of adaptative immune pathways. The findings of this case report suggest that the autonomic effects of epidural stimulation, targeted to promote cardiovascular homeostasis, also improves immune system function, which has a significant benefit to long-term cardiovascular and immunologic health in individuals with long-standing SCI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clinical Trial Registration:www.ClinicalTrials.gov, identifier NCT02307565.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Brain White-Matter Degeneration Due to Aging and Parkinson Disease as Revealed by Double Diffusion Encoding</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.584510</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Microstructure imaging by means of multidimensional diffusion encoding is increasingly applied in clinical research, with expectations that it yields a parameter that better correlates with clinical disability than current methods based on single diffusion encoding. Under the assumption that diffusion within a voxel can be well described by a collection of diffusion tensors, several parameters of this diffusion tensor distribution can be derived, including mean size, variance of sizes, orientational dispersion, and microscopic anisotropy. The information provided by multidimensional diffusion encoding also enables us to decompose the sources of the conventional fractional anisotropy and mean kurtosis. In this study, we explored the utility of the diffusion tensor distribution approach for characterizing white-matter degeneration in aging and in Parkinson disease by using double diffusion encoding. Data from 23 healthy older subjects and 27 patients with Parkinson disease were analyzed. Advanced age was associated with greater mean size and size variances, as well as smaller microscopic anisotropy. By analyzing the parameters underlying diffusion kurtosis, we found that the reductions of kurtosis in aging and Parkinson disease reported in the literature are likely driven by the reduction in microscopic anisotropy. Furthermore, microscopic anisotropy correlated with the severity of motor impairment in the patients with Parkinson disease. The present results support the use of multidimensional diffusion encoding in clinical studies and are encouraging for its future clinical implementation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Disrupted Patterns of Rich-Club and Diverse-Club Organizations in Subjective Cognitive Decline and Amnestic Mild Cognitive Impairment</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.575652</link>
	<content:encoded>Background&lt;p&gt;Subjective cognitive decline (SCD) and amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) were considered to be a continuum of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) spectrum. The abnormal topological architecture and rich-club organization in the brain functional network can reveal the pathology of the AD spectrum. However, few studies have explored the disrupted patterns of diverse club organizations and the combination of rich- and diverse-club organizations in SCD and aMCI.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;We collected resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data of 19 SCDs, 29 aMCIs, and 28 healthy controls (HCs) from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. Graph theory analysis was used to analyze the network metrics and rich- and diverse-club organizations simultaneously.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Compared with HC, the aMCI group showed altered small-world and network efficiency, whereas the SCD group remained relatively stable. The aMCI group showed reduced rich-club connectivity compared with the HC. In addition, the aMCI group showed significantly increased feeder connectivity and decreased local connectivity of the diverse club compared with the SCD group. The overlapping nodes of the rich club and diverse club showed a significant difference in nodal efficiency and shortest path length (L&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;) between groups. Notably, the L&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; values of overlapping nodes in the SCD and aMCI groups were significantly associated with episodic memory.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;The present study demonstrates that the network properties of SCD and aMCI have varying degrees of damage. The combination of the rich club and the diverse club can provide a novel insight into the pathological mechanism of the AD spectrum. The altered patterns in overlapping nodes might be potential biomarkers in the diagnosis of the AD spectrum.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: In vivo Analysis of CRISPR/Cas9 Induced Atlastin Pathological Mutations in Drosophila</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.547746</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is a highly dynamic network whose shape is thought to be actively regulated by membrane resident proteins. Mutation of several such morphology regulators cause the neurological disorder Hereditary Sp astic Paraplegia (HSP), suggesting a critical role of ER shape maintenance in neuronal activity and function. Human Atlastin-1 mutations are responsible for SPG3A, the earliest onset and one of the more severe forms of dominant HSP. Atlastin has been initially identified in Drosophila as the GTPase responsible for the homotypic fusion of ER membrane. The majority of SPG3A-linked Atlastin-1 mutations map to the GTPase domain, potentially interfering with atlastin GTPase activity, and to the three-helix-bundle (3HB) domain, a region critical for homo-oligomerization. Here we have examined the in vivo effects of four pathogenetic missense mutations (two mapping to the GTPase domain and two to the 3HB domain) using two complementary approaches: CRISPR/Cas9 editing to introduce such variants in the endogenous atlastin gene and transgenesis to generate lines overexpressing atlastin carrying the same pathogenic variants. We found that all pathological mutations examined reduce atlastin activity in vivo although to different degrees of severity. Moreover, overexpression of the pathogenic variants in a wild type atlastin background does not give rise to the loss of function phenotypes expected for dominant negative mutations. These results indicate that the four pathological mutations investigated act through a loss of function mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroinformatics: A Systemic Review of Available Low-Cost EEG Headsets Used for Drowsiness Detection</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fninf.2020.553352</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Drowsiness is a leading cause of traffic and industrial accidents, costing lives and productivity. Electroencephalography (EEG) signals can reflect awareness and attentiveness, and low-cost consumer EEG headsets are available on the market. The use of these devices as drowsiness detectors could increase the accessibility of safety and productivity-enhancing devices for small businesses and developing countries. We conducted a systemic review of currently available, low-cost, consumer EEG-based drowsiness detection systems. We sought to determine whether consumer EEG headsets could be reliably utilized as rudimentary drowsiness detection systems. We included documented cases describing successful drowsiness detection using consumer EEG-based devices, including the Neurosky MindWave, InteraXon Muse, Emotiv Epoc, Emotiv Insight, and OpenBCI. Of 46 relevant studies, ~27 reported an accuracy score. The lowest of these was the Neurosky Mindwave, with a minimum of 31%. The second lowest accuracy reported was 79.4% with an OpenBCI study. In many cases, algorithmic optimization remains necessary. Different methods for accuracy calculation, system calibration, and different definitions of drowsiness made direct comparisons problematic. However, even basic features, such as the power spectra of EEG bands, were able to consistently detect drowsiness. Each specific device has its own capabilities, tradeoffs, and limitations. Widely used spectral features can achieve successful drowsiness detection, even with low-cost consumer devices; however, reliability issues must still be addressed in an occupational context.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Mental Effort When Playing, Listening, and Imagining Music in One Pianist’s Eyes and Brain</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.576888</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;We investigated “musical effort” with an internationally renowned, classical, pianist while playing, listening, and imagining music. We used pupillometry as an objective measure of mental effort and fMRI as an exploratory method of effort with the same musical pieces. We also compared a group of non-professional pianists and non-musicians by the use of pupillometry and a small group of non-musicians with fMRI. This combined approach of psychophysiology and neuroimaging revealed the cognitive work during different musical activities. We found that pupil diameters were largest when “playing” (regardless of whether there was sound produced or not) compared to conditions with no movement (i.e., “listening” and “imagery”). We found positive correlations between pupil diameters of the professional pianist during different conditions with the same piano piece (i.e., normal playing, silenced playing, listen, imagining), which might indicate similar degrees of load on cognitive resources as well as an intimate link between the motor imagery of sound-producing body motions and gestures. We also confirmed that musical imagery had a strong commonality with music listening in both pianists and musically naïve individuals. Neuroimaging provided evidence for a relationship between noradrenergic (NE) activity and mental workload or attentional intensity within the domain of music cognition. We found effort related activity in the superior part of the locus coeruleus (LC) and, similarly to the pupil, the listening and imagery engaged less the LC–NE network than the motor condition. The pianists attended more intensively to the most difficult piece than the non-musicians since they showed larger pupils for the most difficult piece. Non-musicians were the most engaged by the music listening task, suggesting that the amount of attention allocated for the same task may follow a hierarchy of expertise demanding less attentional effort in expert or performers than in novices. In the professional pianist, we found only weak evidence for a commonality between subjective effort (as rated measure-by-measure) and the objective effort gauged with pupil diameter during listening. We suggest that psychophysiological methods like pupillometry can index mental effort in a manner that is not available to subjective awareness or introspection.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience: Examining Sodium and Potassium Channel Conductances Involved in Hyperexcitability of Chemotherapy-Induced Peripheral Neuropathy: A Mathematical and Cell Culture-Based Study</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2020.564980</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) is a prevalent, painful side effect which arises due to a number of chemotherapy agents. CIPN can have a prolonged effect on quality of life. Chemotherapy treatment is often reduced or stopped altogether because of the severe pain. Currently, there are no FDA-approved treatments for CIPN partially due to its complex pathogenesis in multiple pathways involving a variety of channels, specifically, voltage-gated ion channels. One aspect of neuropathic pain in vitro is hyperexcitability in dorsal root ganglia (DRG) peripheral sensory neurons. Our study employs bifurcation theory to investigate the role of voltage-gated ion channels in inducing hyperexcitability as a consequence of spontaneous firing due to the common chemotherapy agent paclitaxel. Our mathematical investigation of a reductionist DRG neuron model comprised of sodium channel Na&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;1.7, sodium channel Na&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;1.8, delayed rectifier potassium channel, A-type transient potassium channel, and a leak channel suggests that Na&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;1.8 and delayed rectifier potassium channel conductances are critical for hyperexcitability of small DRG neurons. Introducing paclitaxel into the model, our bifurcation analysis predicts that hyperexcitability is highest for a medium dose of paclitaxel, which is supported by multi-electrode array (MEA) recordings. Furthermore, our findings using MEA reveal that Na&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;1.8 blocker A-803467 and delayed rectifier potassium enhancer L-alpha-phosphatidyl-D-myo-inositol 4,5-diphosphate, dioctanoyl (PIP&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) can reduce paclitaxel-induced hyperexcitability of DRG neurons. Our approach can be readily extended and used to investigate various other contributors of hyperexcitability in CIPN.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2020.556628</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;High-frequency firing activity can be induced either naturally in a healthy brain as a result of the processing of sensory stimuli or as an uncontrolled synchronous activity characterizing epileptic seizures. As part of this work, we investigate how logic circuits that are engineered in neurons can be used to design spike filters, attenuating high-frequency activity in a neuronal network that can be used to minimize the effects of neurodegenerative disorders such as epilepsy. We propose a reconfigurable filter design built from small neuronal networks that behave as digital logic circuits. We developed a mathematical framework to obtain a transfer function derived from a linearization process of the Hodgkin-Huxley model. Our results suggest that individual gates working as the output of the logic circuits can be used as a reconfigurable filtering technique. Also, as part of the analysis, the analytical model showed similar levels of attenuation in the frequency domain when compared to computational simulations by fine-tuning the synaptic weight. The proposed approach can potentially lead to precise and tunable treatments for neurological conditions that are inspired by communication theory.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neural Circuits: Activity-Dependent Remodeling of Synaptic Protein Organization Revealed by High Throughput Analysis of STED Nanoscopy Images</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncir.2020.00057</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The organization of proteins in the apposed nanodomains of pre- and postsynaptic compartments is thought to play a pivotal role in synaptic strength and plasticity. As such, the alignment between pre- and postsynaptic proteins may regulate, for example, the rate of presynaptic release or the strength of postsynaptic signaling. However, the analysis of these structures has mainly been restricted to subsets of synapses, providing a limited view of the diversity of synaptic protein cluster remodeling during synaptic plasticity. To characterize changes in the organization of synaptic nanodomains during synaptic plasticity over a large population of synapses, we combined STimulated Emission Depletion (STED) nanoscopy with a Python-based statistical object distance analysis (pySODA), in dissociated cultured hippocampal circuits exposed to treatments driving different forms of synaptic plasticity. The nanoscale organization, characterized in terms of coupling properties, of presynaptic (Bassoon, RIM1/2) and postsynaptic (PSD95, Homer1c) scaffold proteins was differently altered in response to plasticity-inducing stimuli. For the Bassoon - PSD95 pair, treatments driving synaptic potentiation caused an increase in their coupling probability, whereas a stimulus driving synaptic depression had an opposite effect. To enrich the characterization of the synaptic cluster remodeling at the population level, we applied unsupervised machine learning approaches to include selected morphological features into a multidimensional analysis. This combined analysis revealed a large diversity of synaptic protein cluster subtypes exhibiting differential activity-dependent remodeling, yet with common features depending on the expected direction of plasticity. The expanded palette of synaptic features revealed by our unbiased approach should provide a basis to further explore the widely diverse molecular mechanisms of synaptic plasticity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Cholinergic Modulation of Glial Function During Aging and Chronic Neuroinflammation</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.577912</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Aging is a complex biological process that increases the risk of age-related cognitive degenerative diseases such as dementia, including Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Lewy Body Dementia (LBD), and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Even non-pathological aging of the brain can involve chronic oxidative and inflammatory stress, which disrupts the communication and balance between the brain and the immune system. There has been an increasingly strong connection found between chronic neuroinflammation and impaired memory, especially in AD. While microglia and astrocytes, the resident immune cells of the central nervous system (CNS), exerting beneficial effects during the acute inflammatory phase, during chronic neuroinflammation they can become more detrimental. Central cholinergic circuits are involved in maintaining normal cognitive function and regulating signaling within the entire cerebral cortex. While neuronal-glial cholinergic signaling is anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative, central cholinergic neuronal degeneration is implicated in impaired learning, memory sleep regulation, and attention. Although there is evidence of cholinergic involvement in memory, fewer studies have linked the cholinergic anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant pathways to memory processes during development, normal aging, and disease states. This review will summarize the current knowledge of cholinergic effects on microglia and astroglia, and their role in both anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant mechanisms, concerning normal aging and chronic neuroinflammation. We provided details on how stimulation of α7 nicotinic acetylcholine (α7nACh) receptors can be neuroprotective by increasing amyloid-β phagocytosis, decreasing inflammation and reducing oxidative stress by promoting the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) pathways and decreasing the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines. There is also evidence for astroglial α7nACh receptor stimulation mediating anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects by inhibiting the nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) pathway and activating the Nrf2 pathway respectively. We conclude that targeting cholinergic glial interactions between neurons and glial cells via α7nACh receptors could regulate neuroinflammation and oxidative stress, relevant to the treatment of several neurodegenerative diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Sex Differences of Microglia and Synapses in the Hippocampal Dentate Gyrus of Adult Mouse Offspring Exposed to Maternal Immune Activation</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.558181</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Schizophrenia is a psychiatric disorder affecting ∼1% of humans worldwide. It is earlier and more frequently diagnosed in men than woman, and men display more pronounced negative symptoms together with greater gray matter reductions. Our previous findings utilizing a maternal immune activation (mIA) mouse model of schizophrenia revealed exacerbated anxiety-like behavior and sensorimotor gating deficits in adult male offspring that were associated with increased microglial reactivity and inflammation in the hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG). However, both male and female adult offspring displayed stereotypy and impairment of sociability. We hypothesized that mIA may lead to sex-specific alterations in microglial pruning activity, resulting in abnormal synaptic connectivity in the DG. Using the same mIA model, we show in the current study sex-specific differences in microglia and synapses within the DG of adult offspring. Specifically, microglial levels of cluster of differentiation (CD)68 and CD11b were increased in mIA-exposed females. Sex-specific differences in excitatory and inhibitory synapse densities were also observed following mIA. Additionally, inhibitory synaptic tone was increased in DG granule cells of both males and females, while changes in excitatory synaptic transmission occurred only in females with mIA. These findings suggest that phagocytic and complement pathways may together contribute to a sexual dimorphism in synaptic pruning and neuronal dysfunction in mIA, and may propose sex-specific therapeutic targets to prevent schizophrenia-like behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Axonal Degeneration in AD: The Contribution of Aβ and Tau</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.581767</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s disease (AD) represents the most common age-related neurodegenerative disorder, affecting around 35 million people worldwide. Despite enormous efforts dedicated to AD research over decades, there is still no cure for the disease. Misfolding and accumulation of Aβ and tau proteins in the brain constitute a defining signature of AD neuropathology, and mounting evidence has documented a link between aggregation of these proteins and neuronal dysfunction. In this context, progressive axonal degeneration has been associated with early stages of AD and linked to Aβ and tau accumulation. As the axonal degeneration mechanism has been starting to be unveiled, it constitutes a promising target for neuroprotection in AD. A comprehensive understanding of the mechanism of axonal destruction in neurodegenerative conditions is therefore critical for the development of new therapies aimed to prevent axonal loss before irreversible neuronal death occurs in AD. Here, we review current evidence of the involvement of Aβ and tau pathologies in the activation of signaling cascades that can promote axonal demise.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Gait Progression Over 6 Years in Parkinson’s Disease: Effects of Age, Medication, and Pathology</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.577435</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Background: Gait disturbance is an early, cardinal feature of Parkinson’s disease (PD) associated with falls and reduced physical activity. Progression of gait impairment in Parkinson’s disease is not well characterized and a better understanding is imperative to mitigate impairment. Subtle gait impairments progress in early disease despite optimal dopaminergic medication. Evaluating gait disturbances over longer periods, accounting for typical aging and dopaminergic medication changes, will enable a better understanding of gait changes and inform targeted therapies for early disease. This study aimed to describe gait progression over the first 6 years of PD by delineating changes associated with aging, medication, and pathology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: One-hundred and nine newly diagnosed PD participants and 130 controls completed at least two gait assessments. Gait was assessed at 18-month intervals for up to 6 years using an instrumented walkway to measure sixteen spatiotemporal gait characteristics. Linear mixed-effects models assessed progression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Ten gait characteristics significantly progressed in PD, with changes in four of these characteristics attributable to disease progression. Age-related changes also contributed to gait progression; changes in another two characteristics reflected both aging and disease progression. Gait impairment progressed irrespective of dopaminergic medication change for all characteristics except step width variability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: Discrete gait impairments continue to progress in PD over 6 years, reflecting a combination of, and potential interaction between, disease-specific progression and age-related change. Gait changes were mostly unrelated to dopaminergic medication adjustments, highlighting limitations of current dopaminergic therapy and the need to improve interventions targeting gait decline.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: Divergent projections of the prelimbic cortex bidirectionally regulate active avoidance</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/59281</link>
	<content:encoded>The prefrontal cortex (PFC) integrates incoming information to guide our actions. When motivation for food-seeking competes with avoidance, the PFC likely plays a role in selecting the optimal choice. In platform-mediated active avoidance, rats avoid a tone-signaled footshock by stepping onto a nearby platform, delaying access to sucrose pellets. This avoidance requires prelimbic (PL) prefrontal cortex, basolateral amygdala (BLA), and ventral striatum (VS). We previously showed that inhibitory tone responses of PL neurons correlate with avoidability of shock (Diehl&lt;i&gt; et al.&lt;/i&gt;, 2018). Here, we optogenetically modulated PL terminals in VS and BLA to identify PL outputs regulating avoidance. Photoactivating PL-VS projections reduced avoidance, whereas photoactivating PL-BLA projections increased avoidance. Moreover, photosilencing PL-BLA or BLA-VS projections reduced avoidance, suggesting that VS receives opposing inputs from PL and BLA. Bidirectional modulation of avoidance by PL projections to VS and BLA enables the animal to make appropriate decisions when faced with competing drives.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: Parallel global profiling of plant TOR dynamics reveals a conserved role for LARP1 in translation</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/58795</link>
	<content:encoded>TARGET OF RAPAMYCIN (TOR) is a protein kinase that coordinates eukaryotic metabolism. In mammals, TOR specifically promotes translation of ribosomal protein mRNAs when amino acids are available to support protein synthesis. The mechanisms controlling translation downstream from TOR remain contested, however, and are largely unexplored in plants. To define these mechanisms in plants, we globally profiled the plant TOR-regulated transcriptome, translatome, proteome, and phosphoproteome. We found that TOR regulates ribosome biogenesis in plants at multiple levels, but through mechanisms that do not directly depend on 5′ oligopyrimidine tract motifs (5′TOPs) found in mammalian ribosomal protein mRNAs. We then show that the TOR-LARP1-5′TOP signaling axis is conserved in plants and regulates expression of a core set of eukaryotic 5′TOP mRNAs, as well as new, plant-specific 5′TOP mRNAs. Our study illuminates ancestral roles of the TOR-LARP1-5′TOP metabolic regulatory network and provides evolutionary context for ongoing debates about the molecular function of LARP1.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Damaging&lt;i&gt; GATA6&lt;/i&gt; variants cause cardiac outflow tract defects, sometimes with pancreatic and diaphragmic malformations. To define molecular mechanisms for these diverse developmental defects, we studied transcriptional and epigenetic responses to &lt;i&gt;GATA6&lt;/i&gt; loss of function and missense variants during cardiomyocyte differentiation of isogenic human induced pluripotent stem cells. We show that GATA6 is a pioneer factor in cardiac development, regulating &lt;i&gt;SMYD1 &lt;/i&gt;that activates &lt;i&gt;HAND2, &lt;/i&gt;and&lt;i&gt; KDR&lt;/i&gt; that with &lt;i&gt;HAND2 &lt;/i&gt;orchestrates outflow tract formation. Loss of function variants perturbed cardiac genes and also endoderm lineage genes that direct&lt;i&gt; PDX1&lt;/i&gt; expression and pancreatic development&lt;i&gt;. &lt;/i&gt;Remarkably, an exon 4 &lt;i&gt;GATA6&lt;/i&gt; missense variant, highly associated with extra-cardiac malformations, caused ectopic pioneer activities, profoundly diminishing &lt;i&gt;GATA4&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;FOXA1/2&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;PDX1 &lt;/i&gt;expression and increasing normal retinoic acid signaling that promotes diaphragm development.

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/51796</link>
	<content:encoded>Microglia are the resident myeloid cells in the central nervous system (CNS). The majority of microglia rely on CSF1R signaling for survival. However, a small subset of microglia in mouse brains can survive without CSF1R signaling and reestablish the microglial homeostatic population after CSF1R signaling returns. Using single-cell transcriptomic analysis, we characterized the heterogeneous microglial populations under CSF1R inhibition, including microglia with reduced homeostatic markers and elevated markers of inflammatory chemokines and proliferation. Importantly, MAC2/&lt;i&gt;Lgals3&lt;/i&gt; was upregulated under CSF1R inhibition, and shared striking similarities with microglial progenitors in the yolk sac and immature microglia in early embryos. Lineage-tracing studies revealed that these MAC2+ cells were of microglial origin. MAC2+ microglia were also present in non-treated adult mouse brains and exhibited immature transcriptomic signatures indistinguishable from those that survived CSF1R inhibition, supporting the notion that MAC2+ progenitor-like cells are present among adult microglia.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Anton Chizhov, Natalia Merkulyeva&lt;/p&gt;

A biophysically detailed description of the mechanisms of the primary vision is still being developed. We have incorporated a simplified, filter-based description of retino-thalamic visual signal processing into the detailed, conductance-based refractory density description of the neuronal population activity of the primary visual cortex. We compared four mechanisms of the direction selectivity (DS), three of them being based on asymmetrical projections of different types of thalamic neurons to the cortex, distinguishing between (i) lagged and nonlagged, (ii) transient and sustained, and (iii) On and Off neurons. The fourth mechanism implies a lack of subcortical bias and is an epiphenomenon of intracortical interactions between orientation columns. The simulations of the cortical response to moving gratings have verified that first three mechanisms provide DS to an extent compared with experimental data and that the biophysical model realistically reproduces characteristics of the visual cortex activity, such as membrane potential, firing rate, and synaptic conductances. The proposed model reveals the difference between the mechanisms of both the intact and the silenced cortex, favoring the second mechanism. In the fourth case, DS is weaker but significant; it completely vanishes in the silenced cortex.DS in the On-Off mechanism derives from the nonlinear interactions within the orientation map. Results of simulations can help to identify a prevailing mechanism of DS in V1. This is a step towards a comprehensive biophysical modeling of the primary visual system in the frameworks of the population rate coding concept.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/xBo45prYMsk&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Past work has shown that models incorporating human travel can improve the quality of influenza forecasts. Here, we develop and validate a metapopulation model of twelve European countries, in which international translocation of virus is driven by observed commuting and air travel flows, and use this model to generate influenza forecasts in conjunction with incidence data from the World Health Organization. We find that, although the metapopulation model fits the data well, it offers no improvement over isolated models in forecast quality. We discuss several potential reasons for these results. In particular, we note the need for data that are more comparable from country to country, and offer suggestions as to how surveillance systems might be improved to achieve this goal.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/ALqFUQMwvak&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

These regions include the dentate gyrus (DG), cornu Ammonis regions 3 (CA3) and 1 (CA1), the ventral subiculum (VS), presubiculum (PrS), and parasubiculum (PaS). Scale bar = 1 mm.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Employing cyto‐, myelo‐, and chemoarchitectural staining techniques, we analyzed the structure of the hippocampal formation in the banded mongoose and domestic ferret, species belonging to the two carnivoran superfamilies, which have had independent evolutionary trajectories for the past 55 million years. Our observations indicate that, despite the time since sharing a last common ancestor, these species show extensive similarities. The four major portions of the hippocampal formation (cornu Ammonis, dentate gyrus, subicular complex, and entorhinal cortex) were readily observed, contained the same internal subdivisions, and maintained the topological relationships of these subdivisions that could be considered typically mammalian. In addition, adult hippocampal neurogenesis was observed in both species, occurring at a rate similar to that observed in other mammals. Despite the overall similarities, several differences to each other, and to other mammalian species, were observed. We could not find evidence for the presence of the CA2 and CA4 fields of the cornu Ammonis region. In the banded mongoose the dentate gyrus appears to be comprised of up to seven lamina, through the sublamination of the molecular and granule cell layers, which is not observed in the domestic ferret. In addition, numerous subtle variations in chemoarchitecture between the two species were observed. These differences may contribute to an overall variation in the functionality of the hippocampal formation between the species, and in comparison to other mammalian species. These similarities and variations are important to understanding to what extent phylogenetic affinities and constraints affect potential adaptive evolutionary plasticity of the hippocampal formation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Deep-learning vision models have shown intriguing similarities and
differences with respect to human vision. We investigate how to bring machine
visual representations into better alignment with human representations. Human
representations are often inferred from behavioral evidence such as the
selection of an image most similar to a query image. We find that with
appropriate linear transformations of deep embeddings, we can improve
prediction of human binary choice on a data set of bird images from 72% at
baseline to 89%. We hypothesized that deep embeddings have redundant, high
(4096) dimensional representations; however, reducing the rank of these
representations results in a loss of explanatory power. We hypothesized that
the dilation transformation of representations explored in past research is too
restrictive, and indeed we found that model explanatory power can be
significantly improved with a more expressive linear transform. Most surprising
and exciting, we found that, consistent with classic psychological literature,
human similarity judgments are asymmetric: the similarity of X to Y is not
necessarily equal to the similarity of Y to X, and allowing models to express
this asymmetry improves explanatory power.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Models in systems biology are mathematical descriptions of biological
processes that are used to answer questions and gain a better understanding of
biological phenomena. Dynamic models represent the network through rates of the
production and consumption for the individual species. The ordinary
differential equations that describe rates of the reactions in the model
include a set of parameters. The parameters are important quantities to
understand and analyze biological systems. Moreover, the perturbation of the
kinetic parameters are correlated with upregulation of the system by
cell-intrinsic and cell-extrinsic factors, including mutations and the
environment changes. Here, we aim at using well-established models of
biological pathways to identify parameter values and point their potential
perturbation/deviation. We present our population-based optimization framework
that is able to identify kinetic parameters in the dynamic model based on only
input and output data (i.e., timecourses of selected metabolites). Our approach
can deal with the identification of the non-measurable parameters as well as
with discovering deviation of the parameters. We present our proposed
optimization framework on the example of the well-studied glycolytic pathway in
Saccharomyces cerevisiae.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.06406</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Genetic algorithms have been developed for decades by researchers in academia
and perform well in engineering applications, yet their uptake in industry
remains limited. In order to understand why this is the case, the opinions of
users of engineering design tools were gathered. The results from a survey
showing the attitudes of engineers and students with design experience with
respect to optimisation algorithms are presented. A survey was designed to
answer two research questions: To what extent is there a pre-existing sentiment
(negative or positive) among students, engineers, and managers towards genetic
algorithm-based design? and What are the requirements of practitioners with
regards to design optimisation and the design optimisation process? A total of
23 participants (N = 23) took part in the 3-part mixed methods survey. Thematic
analysis was conducted on the open-ended questions. A common thread throughout
participants responses is that there is a question of trust towards genetic
algorithms within industry. Perhaps surprising is that the key to gaining this
trust is not producing good results, but creating algorithms which explain the
process they take in reaching a result. Participants have expressed a desire to
continue to remain in the design loop. This is at odds with the motivation of a
portion of the genetic algorithms community of removing humans from the loop.
It is clear we need to take a different approach to increase industrial uptake.
Based on this, the following recommendations have been made to increase their
use in industry: an increase of transparency and explainability of genetic
algorithms, an increased focus on user experience, better communication between
developers and engineers, and visualising algorithm behaviour.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The existing convolutional neural network pruning algorithms can be divided
into two categories: coarse-grained clipping and fine-grained clipping. This
paper proposes a coarse and fine-grained automatic pruning algorithm, which can
achieve more efficient and accurate compression acceleration for convolutional
neural networks. First, cluster the intermediate feature maps of the
convolutional neural network to obtain the network structure after
coarse-grained clipping, and then use the particle swarm optimization algorithm
to iteratively search and optimize the structure. Finally, the optimal network
tailoring substructure is obtained.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.06225</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Running title: Frontoparietal anodal tDCS reduces ketamine-induced
oscillopathies.Abstract: During the prodromal phase of schizophrenia with its
complex and insidious clinical picture, electroencephalographic recordings
detect widespread oscillation disturbances (or oscillopathies). Neural
oscillations are electro-biomarkers of the connectivity state within systems. A
single systemic administration of ketamine, a non-competitive NMDA glutamate
receptor antagonist, transiently reproduces the oscillopathies with a clinical
picture reminiscent of the psychosis prodrome. This acute pharmacological model
may help the research and development of innovative treatments against the
psychotic transition. Transcranial electrical stimulation is recognized as an
appropriate non-invasive therapeutic modality since it can increase cognitive
performance and modulate neural oscillations with little or no side effects.
Therefore, our objective was to set up, in the sedated adult rat, a stimulation
method able to normalize the ketamine-induced oscillopathies. Unilateral
transcranial frontoparietal anodal stimulation by direct current (&amp;lt;+1 mA) was
applied in ketamine-treated rats. A concomitant electroencephalographic
recording of the parietal cortex measured the stimulation effects on its
spontaneously-occurring oscillations. A 5-min bipolar anodal tDCS immediately
and quickly reduced, significantly with an intensity-effect relationship, the
ketamine-induced oscillopathies at least in the bilateral parietal cortex. A
duration effect was also recorded. These preliminary neurophysiological
findings are promising for developing a therapeutic proof-of-concept against
neuropsychiatric disorders.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.06223</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Neural Architecture Search (NAS) is a collection of methods to craft the way
neural networks are built. We apply this idea to Federated Learning (FL),
wherein predefined neural network models with known hyperparameter values are
trained on the client/device data. This approach is not optimal as the model
developers can't observe the local data, and hence, are unable to build highly
accurate and efficient models. NAS is promising for FL which can search for
global and personalized models automatically for the non-IID data. Most NAS
methods are computationally expensive and require fine-tuning after the search,
making it a two-stage complex process with possible human intervention. Thus
there is a need for end-to-end NAS which can run on the heterogeneous data and
resource distribution typically seen in the FL scenario. In this paper, we
present an effective approach for direct federated NAS which is hardware
agnostic, computationally lightweight, and a one-stage method to search for
ready-to-deploy neural network models. Our results show an order of magnitude
reduction in resource consumption while edging out prior art in accuracy. This
opens up a window of opportunity to create optimized and computationally
efficient federated learning systems.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.06219</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The recently proposed Activation Relaxation (AR) algorithm provides a simple
and robust approach for approximating the backpropagation of error algorithm
using only local learning rules. Unlike competing schemes, it converges to the
exact backpropagation gradients, and utilises only a single type of
computational unit and a single backwards relaxation phase. We have previously
shown that the algorithm can be further simplified and made more biologically
plausible by (i) introducing a learnable set of backwards weights, which
overcomes the weight-transport problem, and (ii) avoiding the computation of
nonlinear derivatives at each neuron. However, tthe efficacy of these
simplifications has, so far, only been tested on simple multi-layer-perceptron
(MLP) networks. Here, we show that these simplifications still maintain
performance using more complex CNN architectures and challenging datasets,
which have proven difficult for other biologically-plausible schemes to scale
to. We also investigate whether another biologically implausible assumption of
the original AR algorithm -- the frozen feedforward pass -- can be relaxed
without damaging performance.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.06209</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Deep Reservoir Computing has emerged as a new paradigm for deep learning,
which is based around the reservoir computing principle of maintaining random
pools of neurons. The reservoir paradigm reflects and respects the high degree
of recurrence in biological brains, and the role that neuronal dynamics play in
learning. However, one issue hampering deep reservoir development is that one
cannot backpropagate through the reservoir layers. Recent deep reservoir
architectures do not learn hidden or hierarchical representations in the same
manner as deep artifical neural neteworks (ANNs), but rather concatenate all
hidden reservoirs together to perform traditional regression. Here we present a
novel Deep Reservoir Computer for time series prediction and classification
that learns through the non-differentiable hidden reservoir layers using a
biologically-inspired backpropagation alternative called Direct Feedback
Alignment, which resembles global dopamine signal broadcasting in the brain.
The hope is that this will enable future deep reservoir architectures to learn
hidden temporal representations.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;We propose a Similarity-Based Stratified Splitting (SBSS) technique, which
uses both the output and input space information to split the data. The splits
are generated using similarity functions among samples to place similar samples

data in the training phase. This strategy leads to a more realistic performance
estimation when used in real-world applications. We evaluate our proposal in
twenty-two benchmark datasets with classifiers such as Multi-Layer Perceptron,
Support Vector Machine, Random Forest and K-Nearest Neighbors, and five
similarity functions Cityblock, Chebyshev, Cosine, Correlation, and Euclidean.
According to the Wilcoxon Sign-Rank test, our approach consistently
outperformed ordinary stratified 10-fold cross-validation in 75\% of the

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.06078</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Mindfulness-based interventions have proven its efficacy in treating
post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), but the underlying neurobiological
mechanism is unknown. To determine the neurobiological mechanism of action of
mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) treating PTSD, we conducted a
randomized clinical trial (RCT) in which 98 veterans with PTSD were randomly
assigned to receive MBSR therapy (n = 47) or present-centered group therapy
(PCGT; n = 51; an active-control condition). Pre- and post-intervention
measures of PTSD symptom severity (PTSD Checklist) and brain activity measures
of electroencephalography (EEG) were assessed, including spectral power of
spontaneous neural oscillatory activities during resting and meditation
periods, time-frequency (TF) power of cognitive task-related brain responses,
and TF power of heartbeat-evoked brain responses (HEBR) that reflect cardiac
interoceptive brain responses during resting and meditation. Compared to
controls, the MBSR group had greater improvements in PTSD symptoms, spontaneous
EEG alpha (8-13 Hz) power in posterior sites, task-related frontal theta power
(4-7 Hz in 140-220 ms post-stimulus), and frontal theta HEBR (3-5 Hz and
265-328 ms post-R-peak). Latent difference score modeling found that only the
changes in the frontal theta HEBR mediated the MBSR treatment effect. Brain
source-level analysis found that the theta HEBR changes in the anterior
cingulate cortex, anterior insular cortex, and the lateral prefrontal cortex
predicted PTSD symptom improvements. These results indicated that mindfulness
meditation improves spontaneous brain activities reflecting internally oriented
relaxation and brain functions of attentional control. However, interoceptive
brain capacity enhanced by MBSR appears to be the primary cerebral mechanism
that regulates emotional disturbances and improves anxiety symptoms of PTSD.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;While the concept of a Sparse Neural Network has been researched for some
time, researchers have only recently made notable progress in the matter.
Techniques like Sparse Evolutionary Training allow for significantly lower
computational complexity when compared to fully connected models by reducing
redundant connections. That typically takes place in an iterative process of
weight creation and removal during network training. Although there have been
numerous approaches to optimize the redistribution of the removed weights,
there seems to be little or no study on the effect of activation functions on
the performance of the Sparse Networks. This research provides insights into
the relationship between the activation function used and the network
performance at various sparsity levels.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.05429</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The human brain has the ability to carry out new tasks with limited
experience. It utilizes prior learning experiences to adapt the solution
strategy to new domains. On the other hand, deep neural networks (DNNs)
generally need large amounts of data and computational resources for training.
However, this requirement is not met in many settings. To address these
challenges, we propose the TUTOR DNN synthesis framework. TUTOR targets
non-image datasets. It synthesizes accurate DNN models with limited available
data, and reduced memory and computational requirements. It consists of three
sequential steps: (1) drawing synthetic data from the same probability
distribution as the training data and labeling the synthetic data based on a
set of rules extracted from the real dataset, (2) use of two training schemes
that combine synthetic data and training data to learn DNN weights, and (3)
employing a grow-and-prune synthesis paradigm to learn both the weights and the
architecture of the DNN to reduce model size while ensuring its accuracy. We
show that in comparison with fully-connected DNNs, on an average TUTOR reduces
the need for data by 6.0x (geometric mean), improves accuracy by 3.6%, and
reduces the number of parameters (floating-point operations) by 4.7x (4.3x)
(geometric mean). Thus, TUTOR is a less data-hungry, accurate, and efficient
DNN synthesis framework.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2001.03614</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Experiments have shown that the same stimulation pattern that causes
Long-Term Potentiation in proximal synapses, will induce Long-Term Depression
in distal ones. In order to understand these, and other, surprising
observations we use a phenomenological model of Hebbian plasticity at the
location of the synapse. Our computational model describes the Hebbian
condition of joint activity of pre- and post-synaptic neuron in a compact form
as the interaction of the glutamate trace left by a presynaptic spike with the
time course of the postsynaptic voltage. We test the model using experimentally
recorded dendritic voltage traces in hippocampus and neocortex. We find that
the time course of the voltage in the neighborhood of a stimulated synapse is a
reliable predictor of whether a stimulated synapse undergoes potentiation,
depression, or no change. Our model can explain the existence of different --
at first glance seemingly paradoxical -- outcomes of synaptic potentiation and
depression experiments depending on the dendritic location of the synapse and
the frequency or timing of the stimulation.

                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Anti-myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein antibodies (anti-MOG), directed against a component of the myelin sheath, are sometimes detected in the blood or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients with acute demyelinating conditions. Cortical encephalitic presentations in anti-MOG-antibody-positive patients are recognized but rare, and few pediatric cases have been described.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec2&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Methods&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;We describe clinical, biochemical, and MRI findings in two children presenting with generalized seizures due to cortical encephalitis, and review potential underlying immunological processes.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec3&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;In both patients, anti-MOG antibodies were detected. Both underwent MRI scans which demonstrated bilateral cortical swelling and T2/fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) hyperintensity with corresponding regions of reduced diffusion.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec4&quot;&gt;

                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Early detection of anti-MOG antibodies in patients with a similar presentation and imaging features would enable rapid institution of appropriate treatment, and potentially reduce the need for invasive diagnostic procedures such as brain biopsy.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Changes in Day/Night Activity in the 6-OHDA-Induced Experimental Model of Parkinson’s Disease: Exploring Prodromal Biomarkers</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.590029</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The search for experimental models mimicking an early stage of Parkinson’s disease (PD) before motor manifestations is fundamental in order to explore early signs and get a better prognosis. Interestingly, our previous studies have indicated that 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) is a suitable model to induce an early degeneration of the nigrostriatal system without any gross motor impairment. Considering our previous findings, we aim to implement a novel system to monitor rats after intrastriatal injection of 6-OHDA to detect and analyze physiological changes underlying prodromal PD. Twenty male Sprague-Dawley rats were unilaterally injected with 6-OHDA (n = 10) or saline solution (n = 10) into the right striatum and placed in enriched environment cages where the activity was monitored. After 2 weeks, the amphetamine test was performed before the sacrifice. Immunohistochemistry was developed for the morphological evaluation and western blot analysis to assess molecular changes. Home-cage monitoring revealed behavioral changes in response to 6-OHDA administration including significant hyperactivity and hypoactivity during the light and dark phase, respectively, turning out in a change of the circadian timing. A preclinical stage of PD was functionally confirmed with the amphetamine test. Moreover, the loss of tyrosine hydroxylase expression was significantly correlated with the motor results, and 6-OHDA induced early proapoptotic events. Our findings provide evidence for a novel prodromal 6-OHDA model following a customized monitoring system that could give insights to detect non-motor deficits and molecular targets to test neuroprotective/neurorestorative agents.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Investigating the Relationship Between Neuronal Cell Death and Early DNA Methylation After Ischemic Injury</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.581915</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Cerebral ischemia induces neuronal cell death and causes various kinds of brain dysfunction. Therefore, prevention of neuronal cell death is most essential for protection of the brain. On the other hand, it has been reported that epigenetics including DNA methylation plays a pivotal role in pathogenesis of some diseases such as cancer. Accumulating evidences indicate that aberrant DNA methylation is related to cell death. However, DNA methylation after cerebral ischemia has not been fully understood yet. The aim of this present study was to investigate the relationships between DNA methylation and neuronal cell death after cerebral ischemia. We examined DNA methylation under the ischemic condition by using transient middle cerebral artery occlusion and reperfusion (MCAO/R) model rats and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)–treated cortical neurons in primary culture. In this study, we demonstrated that DNA methylation increased in these neurons 24 h after MCAO/R and that DNA methylation, possibly through activation of DNA methyltransferases (DNMT) 3a, increased in such neurons immediately after NMDA treatment. Furthermore, NMDA-treated neurons were protected by treatment with a DNMT inhibitor that were accompanied by inhibition of DNA methylation. Our results showed that DNA methylation would be an initiation factor of neuronal cell death and that inhibition of such methylation could become an effective therapeutic strategy for stroke.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Current Techniques for Investigating the Brain Extracellular Space</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.570750</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The brain extracellular space (ECS) is a continuous reticular compartment that lies between the cells of the brain. It is vast in extent relative to its resident cells, yet, at the same time the nano- to micrometer dimensions of its channels and reservoirs are commonly finer than the smallest cellular structures. Our conventional view of this compartment as largely static and of secondary importance for brain function is rapidly changing, and its active dynamic roles in signaling and metabolite clearance have come to the fore. It is further emerging that ECS microarchitecture is highly heterogeneous and dynamic and that ECS geometry and diffusional properties directly modulate local diffusional transport, down to the nanoscale around individual synapses. The ECS can therefore be considered an extremely complex and diverse compartment, where numerous physiological events are unfolding in parallel on spatial and temporal scales that span orders of magnitude, from milliseconds to hours, and from nanometers to centimeters. To further understand the physiological roles of the ECS and identify new ones, researchers can choose from a wide array of experimental techniques, which differ greatly in their applicability to a given sample and the type of data they produce. Here, we aim to provide a basic introduction to the available experimental techniques that have been applied to address the brain ECS, highlighting their main characteristics. We include current gold-standard techniques, as well as emerging cutting-edge modalities based on recent super-resolution microscopy. It is clear that each technique comes with unique strengths and limitations and that no single experimental method can unravel the unknown physiological roles of the brain ECS on its own.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Cross-Subject Commonality of Emotion Representations in Dorsal Motion-Sensitive Areas</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.567797</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Emotion perception is a crucial question in cognitive neuroscience and the underlying neural substrates have been the subject of intense study. One of our previous studies demonstrated that motion-sensitive areas are involved in the perception of facial expressions. However, it remains unclear whether emotions perceived from whole-person stimuli can be decoded from the motion-sensitive areas. In addition, if emotions are represented in the motion-sensitive areas, we may further ask whether the representations of emotions in the motion-sensitive areas can be shared across individual subjects. To address these questions, this study collected neural images while participants viewed emotions (joy, anger, and fear) from videos of whole-person expressions (contained both face and body parts) in a block-design functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiment. Multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) was conducted to explore the emotion decoding performance in individual-defined dorsal motion-sensitive regions of interest (ROIs). Results revealed that emotions could be successfully decoded from motion-sensitive ROIs with statistically significant classification accuracies for three emotions as well as positive versus negative emotions. Moreover, results from the cross-subject classification analysis showed that a person’s emotion representation could be robustly predicted by others’ emotion representations in motion-sensitive areas. Together, these results reveal that emotions are represented in dorsal motion-sensitive areas and that the representation of emotions is consistent across subjects. Our findings provide new evidence of the involvement of motion-sensitive areas in the emotion decoding, and further suggest that there exists a common emotion code in the motion-sensitive areas across individual subjects.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroinformatics: Simulation of Large Scale Neural Models With Event-Driven Connectivity Generation</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fninf.2020.522000</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Accurate simulations of brain structures is a major problem in neuroscience. Many works are dedicated to design better models or to develop more efficient simulation schemes. In this paper, we propose a hybrid simulation scheme that combines time-stepping second-order integration of Hodgkin-Huxley (HH) type neurons with event-driven updating of the synaptic currents. As the HH model is a continuous model, there is no explicit spike events. Thus, in order to preserve the accuracy of the integration method, a spike detection algorithm is developed that accurately determines spike times. This approach allows us to regenerate the outgoing connections at each event, thereby avoiding the storage of the connectivity. Consequently, memory consumption is significantly reduced while preserving execution time and accuracy of the simulations, especially the spike times of detailed point neuron models. The efficiency of the method, implemented in the SiReNe software&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;, is demonstrated by the simulation of a striatum model which consists of more than 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; neurons and 10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; synapses (each neuron has a fan-out of 504 post-synaptic neurons), under normal and Parkinson's conditions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience: A Neural Network Model With Gap Junction for Topological Detection</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2020.571982</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Visual information processing in the brain goes from global to local. A large volume of experimental studies has suggested that among global features, the brain perceives the topological information of an image first. Here, we propose a neural network model to elucidate the underlying computational mechanism. The model consists of two parts. The first part is a neural network in which neurons are coupled through gap junctions, mimicking the neural circuit formed by alpha ganglion cells in the retina. Gap junction plays a key role in the model, which, on one hand, facilitates the synchronized firing of a neuron group covering a connected region of an image, and on the other hand, staggers the firing moments of different neuron groups covering disconnected regions of the image. These two properties endow the network with the capacity of detecting the connectivity and closure of images. The second part of the model is a read-out neuron, which reads out the topological information that has been converted into the number of synchronized firings in the retina network. Our model provides a simple yet effective mechanism for the neural system to detect the topological information of images in ultra-speed.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience: Unsupervised Few-Shot Feature Learning via Self-Supervised Training</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2020.00083</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Learning from limited exemplars (few-shot learning) is a fundamental, unsolved problem that has been laboriously explored in the machine learning community. However, current few-shot learners are mostly supervised and rely heavily on a large amount of labeled examples. Unsupervised learning is a more natural procedure for cognitive mammals and has produced promising results in many machine learning tasks. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised feature learning method for few-shot learning. The proposed model consists of two alternate processes, progressive clustering and episodic training. The former generates pseudo-labeled training examples for constructing episodic tasks; and the later trains the few-shot learner using the generated episodic tasks which further optimizes the feature representations of data. The two processes facilitate each other, and eventually produce a high quality few-shot learner. In our experiments, our model achieves good generalization performance in a variety of downstream few-shot learning tasks on Omniglot and MiniImageNet. We also construct a new few-shot person re-identification dataset FS-Market1501 to demonstrate the feasibility of our model to a real-world application.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2020.00071</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;New technologies for recording the activity of large neural populations during complex behavior provide exciting opportunities for investigating the neural computations that underlie perception, cognition, and decision-making. Non-linear state space models provide an interpretable signal processing framework by combining an intuitive dynamical system with a probabilistic observation model, which can provide insights into neural dynamics, neural computation, and development of neural prosthetics and treatment through feedback control. This brings with it the challenge of learning both latent neural state and the underlying dynamical system because neither are known for neural systems a priori. We developed a flexible online learning framework for latent non-linear state dynamics and filtered latent states. Using the stochastic gradient variational Bayes approach, our method jointly optimizes the parameters of the non-linear dynamical system, the observation model, and the black-box recognition model. Unlike previous approaches, our framework can incorporate non-trivial distributions of observation noise and has constant time and space complexity. These features make our approach amenable to real-time applications and the potential to automate analysis and experimental design in ways that testably track and modify behavior using stimuli designed to influence learning.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Transducin Partners Outside the Phototransduction Pathway</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.589494</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Transducin mediates signal transduction in a classical G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) phototransduction cascade. Interactions of transducin with the receptor and the effector molecules had been extensively investigated and are currently defined at the atomic level. However, partners and functions of rod transducin α (Gα&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) and βγ (Gβ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;γ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) outside the visual pathway are not well-understood. In particular, light-induced redistribution of rod transducin from the outer segment to the inner segment and synaptic terminal (IS/ST) allows Gα&lt;sub&gt;t1&lt;/sub&gt; and/or Gβ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;γ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; to modulate synaptic transmission from rods to rod bipolar cells (RBCs). Protein-protein interactions underlying this modulation are largely unknown. We discuss known interactors of transducin in the rod IS/ST compartment and potential pathways leading to the synaptic effects of light-dispersed Gα&lt;sub&gt;t1&lt;/sub&gt; and Gβ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;γ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;. Furthermore, we show that a prominent non-GPCR guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) and a chaperone of Gα subunits, resistance to inhibitors of cholinesterase 8A (Ric-8A) protein, is expressed throughout the retina including photoreceptor cells. Recent structures of Ric-8A alone and in complexes with Gα subunits have illuminated the structural underpinnings of the Ric-8A activities. We generated a mouse model with conditional knockout of Ric-8A in rods in order to begin defining the functional roles of the protein in rod photoreceptors and the retina. Our analysis suggests that Ric-8A is not an obligate chaperone of Gα&lt;sub&gt;t1&lt;/sub&gt;. Further research is needed to investigate probable roles of Ric-8A as a GEF, trafficking chaperone, or a mediator of the synaptic effects of Gα&lt;sub&gt;t1&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Alterations in Intrinsic and Synaptic Properties of Hippocampal CA1 VIP Interneurons During Aging</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.554405</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Learning and memory deficits are hallmarks of the aging brain, with cortical neuronal circuits representing the main target in cognitive deterioration. While GABAergic inhibitory and disinhibitory circuits are critical in supporting cognitive processes, their roles in age-related cognitive decline remain largely unknown. Here, we examined the morphological and physiological properties of the hippocampal CA1 vasoactive intestinal peptide/calretinin-expressing (VIP+/CR+) type 3 interneuron-specific (I-S3) cells across mouse lifespan. Our data showed that while the number and morphological features of I-S3 cells remained unchanged, their firing and synaptic properties were significantly altered in old animals. In particular, the action potential duration and the level of steady-state depolarization were significantly increased in old animals in parallel with a significant decrease in the maximal firing frequency. Reducing the fast-delayed rectifier potassium or transient sodium conductances in I-S3 cell computational models could reproduce the age-related changes in I-S3 cell firing properties. However, experimental data revealed no difference in the activation properties of the Kv3.1 and A-type potassium currents, indicating that transient sodium together with other ion conductances may be responsible for the observed phenomena. Furthermore, I-S3 cells in aged mice received a stronger inhibitory drive due to concomitant increase in the amplitude and frequency of spontaneous inhibitory currents. These age-associated changes in the I-S3 cell properties occurred in parallel with an increased inhibition of their target interneurons and were associated with spatial memory deficits and increased anxiety. Taken together, these data indicate that VIP+/CR+ interneurons responsible for local circuit disinhibition survive during aging but exhibit significantly altered physiological properties, which may result in the increased inhibition of hippocampal interneurons and distorted mnemonic functions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Neural Stimulation and Molecular Mechanisms of Plasticity and Regeneration: A Review</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.00271</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Neural stimulation modulates the depolarization of neurons, thereby triggering activity-associated mechanisms of neuronal plasticity. Activity-associated mechanisms in turn play a major role in post-mitotic structure and function of adult neurons. Our understanding of the interactions between neuronal behavior, patterns of neural activity, and the surrounding environment is evolving at a rapid pace. Brain derived neurotrophic factor is a critical mediator of activity-associated plasticity, while multiple immediate early genes mediate plasticity of neurons following bouts of neural activity. New research has uncovered genetic mechanisms that govern the expression of DNA following changes in neural activity patterns, including RNAPII pause-release and activity-associated double stranded breaks. Discovery of novel mechanisms governing activity-associated plasticity of neurons hints at a layered and complex molecular control of neuronal response to depolarization. Importantly, patterns of depolarization in neurons are shown to be important mediators of genetic expression patterns and molecular responses. More research is needed to fully uncover the molecular response of different types of neurons-to-activity patterns; however, known responses might be leveraged to facilitate recovery after neural damage. Physical rehabilitation through passive or active exercise modulates neurotrophic factor expression in the brain and spinal cord and can initiate cortical plasticity commensurate with functional recovery. Rehabilitation likely relies on activity-associated mechanisms; however, it may be limited in its application. Electrical and magnetic stimulation direct specific activity patterns not accessible through passive or active exercise and work synergistically to improve standing, walking, and forelimb use after injury. Here, we review emerging concepts in the molecular mechanisms of activity-derived plasticity in order to highlight opportunities that could add value to therapeutic protocols for promoting recovery of function after trauma, disease, or age-related functional decline.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: A Systematic Review on Predictors of Working Memory Training Responsiveness in Healthy Older Adults: Methodological Challenges and Future Directions</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.575804</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Background: Research on predictors of working memory training responsiveness, which could help tailor cognitive interventions individually, is a timely topic in healthy aging. However, the findings are highly heterogeneous, reporting partly conflicting results following a broad spectrum of methodological approaches to answer the question “who benefits most” from working memory training.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Objective: The present systematic review aimed to systematically investigate prognostic factors and models for working memory training responsiveness in healthy older adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Method: Four online databases were searched up to October 2019 (MEDLINE Ovid, Web of Science, CENTRAL, and PsycINFO). The inclusion criteria for full texts were publication in a peer-reviewed journal in English/German, inclusion of healthy older individuals aged ≥55 years without any neurological and/or psychiatric diseases including cognitive impairment, and the investigation of prognostic factors and/or models for training responsiveness after targeted working memory training in terms of direct training effects, near-transfer effects to verbal and visuospatial working memory as well as far-transfer effects to other cognitive domains and behavioral variables. The study design was not limited to randomized controlled trials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: A total of 16 studies including n = 675 healthy older individuals with a mean age of 63.0–86.8 years were included in this review. Within these studies, five prognostic model approaches and 18 factor finding approaches were reported. Risk of bias was assessed using the Quality in Prognosis Studies checklist, indicating that important information, especially regarding the domains study attrition, study confounding, and statistical analysis and reporting, was lacking throughout many of the investigated studies. Age, education, intelligence, and baseline performance in working memory or other cognitive domains were frequently investigated predictors across studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: Given the methodological shortcomings of the included studies, no clear conclusions can be drawn, and emerging patterns of prognostic effects will have to survive sound methodological replication in future attempts to promote precision medicine approaches in the context of working memory training. Methodological considerations are discussed, and our findings are embedded to the cognitive aging literature, considering, for example, the cognitive reserve framework and the compensation vs. magnification account. The need for personalized cognitive prevention and intervention methods to counteract cognitive decline in the aging population is high and the potential enormous.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Registration: PROSPERO, ID CRD42019142750.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Compromised Behavior and Gamma Power During Working Memory in Cognitively Healthy Individuals With Abnormal CSF Amyloid/Tau</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.574214</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Research shows that gamma activity changes in Alzheimer’s disease (AD), revealing synaptic pathology and potential therapeutic applications. We aim to explore whether cognitive challenge combined with quantitative EEG (qEEG) can unmask abnormal gamma frequency power in healthy individuals at high risk of developing AD. We analyzed low (30–50 Hz) and high gamma (50–80 Hz) power over six brain regions at EEG sensor level (frontal/central/parietal/left temporal/right temporal/occipital) in a dataset collected from an aging cohort during N-back working memory (WM) testing at two different load conditions (N = 0 or 2). Cognitively healthy (CH) study participants (≥60 years old) of both sexes were divided into two subgroups: normal amyloid/tau ratios (CH-NAT, n = 10) or pathological amyloid/tau (CH-PAT, n = 14) in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). During low load (0-back) challenge, low gamma is higher in CH-PATs than CH-NATs over frontal and central regions (p = 0.014∼0.032, effect size (Cohen’s d) = 0.95∼1.11). However, during high load (2-back) challenge, low gamma is lower in CH-PATs compared to CH-NATs over the left temporal region (p = 0.045, Cohen’s d = −0.96), and high gamma is lower over the parietal region (p = 0.035, Cohen’s d = −1.02). Overall, our studies show a medium to large negative effect size across the scalp (Cohen’s d = −0.51∼−1.02). In addition, low gamma during 2-back is positively correlated with 0-back accuracy over all regions except the occipital region only in CH-NATs (r = 0.69∼0.77, p = 0.0098∼0.027); high gamma during 2-back correlated positively with 0-back accuracy over all regions in CH-NATs (r = 0.68∼0.78, p = 0.007∼0.030); high gamma during 2-back negatively correlated with 0-back response time over parietal, right temporal, and occipital regions in CH-NATs (r = −0.70∼−0.66, p = 0.025∼0.037). We interpret these preliminary results to show: (1) gamma power is compromised in AD-biomarker positive individuals, who are otherwise cognitively healthy (CH-PATs); (2) gamma is associated with WM performance in normal aging (CH-NATs) (most significantly in the frontoparietal region). Our pilot findings encourage further investigations in combining cognitive challenges and qEEG in developing neurophysiology-based markers for identifying individuals in the prodromal stage, to help improving our understanding of AD pathophysiology and the contributions of low- and high-frequency gamma oscillations in cognitive functions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>ATP is essential for all living cells. However, how dead cells lose ATP has not been well investigated. In this study, we developed new FRET biosensors for dual imaging of intracellular ATP level and caspase-3 activity in single apoptotic cultured human cells. We show that the cytosolic ATP level starts to decrease immediately after the activation of caspase-3, and this process is completed typically within 2 hr. The ATP decrease was facilitated by caspase-dependent cleavage of the plasma membrane channel pannexin-1, indicating that the intracellular decrease of the apoptotic cell is a ‘programmed’ process. Apoptotic cells deficient of pannexin-1 sustained the ability to produce ATP through glycolysis and to consume ATP, and did not stop wasting glucose much longer period than normal apoptotic cells. Thus, the pannexin-1 plays a role in arresting the metabolic activity of dead apoptotic cells, most likely through facilitating the loss of intracellular ATP.</content:encoded>

Here, we apply this technique to the context of acute inflammation and discover both infiltrating and tissue-resident immune cells to be visible without any labeling in the living mouse retina using near-infrared light alone. Intravital imaging of immune cells can be negatively impacted by surgical manipulation, exogenous dyes, transgenic manipulation and phototoxicity. These confounds are now overcome, using phase contrast and time-lapse videography to reveal the dynamic behavior of myeloid cells as they interact, extravasate and survey the mouse retina. Cellular motility and differential vascular responses were measured noninvasively and in vivo across hours to months at the same retinal location, from initiation to the resolution of inflammation. As comparable systems are already available for clinical research, this approach could be readily translated to human application.</content:encoded>

We also developed an image processing pipeline for segmentation and classification of morphological regions of interest and individual cells, and we apply this pipeline to the regenerating humerus. We demonstrate our approach is sensitive to biological perturbations by measuring changes in DNA synthesis after limb denervation. This method provides a powerful means to quantitatively interrogate macromolecule synthesis in heterogenous tissues at the organ, cellular, and molecular levels of organization.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: Diffusion vs direct transport in the precision of morphogen readout</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/58981</link>
	<content:encoded>Morphogen profiles allow cells to determine their position within a developing organism, but not all morphogen profiles form by the same mechanism. Here we derive fundamental limits to the precision of morphogen concentration sensing for two canonical mechanisms: the diffusion of morphogen through extracellular space and the direct transport of morphogen from source cell to target cell, e.g., via cytonemes. We find that direct transport establishes a morphogen profile without adding noise in the process. Despite this advantage, we find that for sufficiently large values of profile length, the diffusion mechanism is many times more precise due to a higher refresh rate of morphogen molecules. We predict a profile lengthscale below which direct transport is more precise, and above which diffusion is more precise. This prediction is supported by data from a wide variety of morphogens in developing &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; and zebrafish.</content:encoded>

In contrast, we discovered cytoplasm sharing without membrane breaching in highly resorptive &lt;i&gt;Drosophila &lt;/i&gt;rectal papillae.

Papillar cytoplasm sharing does not employ canonical mechanisms such as incomplete cytokinesis or muscle fusion pore regulators. Instead, sharing requires gap junction proteins (normally associated with transport of molecules &amp;lt;1kDa), which are positioned by membrane remodeling GTPases. Our work reveals a new role for apical membrane remodeling in converting a multicellular epithelium into a giant multinucleate cytoplasm.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: Critical role of WNK1 in MYC-dependent early mouse thymocyte development</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/56934</link>
	<content:encoded>WNK1, a kinase that controls kidney salt homeostasis, also regulates adhesion and migration in CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cells. &lt;i&gt;Wnk1&lt;/i&gt; is highly expressed in thymocytes, and since migration is important for thymocyte maturation, we investigated a role for WNK1 in mouse thymocyte development. We find that WNK1 is required for the transition of double negative (DN) thymocytes through the b-selection checkpoint and subsequent proliferation and differentiation into double positive (DP) thymocytes. Furthermore, we show that WNK1 negatively regulates LFA1-mediated adhesion and positively regulates CXCL12-induced migration in DN thymocytes. Despite this, migration defects of WNK1-deficient thymocytes do not account for the developmental arrest. Instead, we show that in DN thymocytes WNK1 transduces pre-TCR signals via OXSR1 and STK39 kinases and the SLC12A2 ion co-transporter that are required for post-transcriptional upregulation of MYC and subsequent proliferation and differentiation into DP thymocytes. Thus, a pathway regulating ion homeostasis is a critical regulator of thymocyte development.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: Cytoprotection by a naturally occurring variant of ATP5G1 in Arctic ground squirrel neural progenitor cells</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/55578</link>
	<content:encoded>Many organisms in nature have evolved mechanisms to tolerate severe hypoxia or ischemia, including the hibernation-capable Arctic ground squirrel (AGS). Although hypoxic or ischemia tolerance in AGS involves physiological adaptations, little is known about the critical cellular mechanisms underlying intrinsic AGS cell resilience to metabolic stress. Through cell survival-based cDNA expression screens in neural progenitor cells, we identify a genetic variant of AGS &lt;i&gt;Atp5g1&lt;/i&gt; that confers cell resilience to metabolic stress. &lt;i&gt;Atp5g1&lt;/i&gt; encodes a subunit of the mitochondrial ATP synthase. Ectopic expression in mouse cells and CRISPR/Cas9 base editing of endogenous AGS loci revealed causal roles of one AGS-specific amino acid substitution in mediating cytoprotection by AGS ATP5G1. AGS ATP5G1 promotes metabolic stress resilience by modulating mitochondrial morphological change and metabolic functions. Our results identify a naturally occurring variant of ATP5G1 from a mammalian hibernator that critically contributes to intrinsic cytoprotection against metabolic stress.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Inhibition of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase-AKT-cyclic GMP-c-Jun N-terminal kinase signaling pathway attenuates the development of morphine tolerance in a mouse model of neuropathic pain</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.14.340067v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Background: Opioid management of chronic pain can cause opioid-induced analgesic tolerance and hyperalgesia, complicating clinical pain-management treatments. Research presented here sought to determine if opioid induced tolerance is linked to activity changes within the PI3K{gamma}-AKT-cGMP-JNK intracellular signaling pathway in spinal cord or peripheral nervous systems. Methods: Morphine or saline injections were given subcutaneously twice a day for five days (15 mg/kg) to male C57Bl6 mice. A separate cohort of mice received spinal nerve ligation (SNL) one week prior to the start of morphine tolerance. Afterwards, spinal cord, dorsal root ganglia, and sciatic nerves were isolated for quantifying total and phosphorylated- JNK levels, cGMP, and gene expression analysis. Results: Gene expression for the PI3K{gamma}-AKT-cGMP-JNK signaling pathway including, Akt1, Akt2, Akt3, Pik3cg, Pten, Jnk3, and nNos1 were decreased in the spinal cord with varied expression changes in the dorsal root ganglia and sciatic nerve of morphine tolerant and morphine tolerant mice after SNL. We observed significant increases in total and phosphorylated- JNK levels in the spinal cord, total JNK in dorsal root ganglia, and cGMP in the sciatic nerve of morphine tolerant mice with SNL. Pharmacological inhibition of PI3K, nNOS, or JNK, using thalidomide, quercetin, or SP600125, attenuated the development of morphine tolerance in mice with SNL as measured by thermal paw withdrawal. Conclusions: Overall, the PI3K/AKT intracellular signaling pathway is a potential target for reducing the development of morphine tolerance. Continued research into this pathway will contribute to the development of new analgesic drug therapies.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.14.339747v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Eye-specific segregation of retinal ganglion cell (RGC) axons in the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN) is considered a hallmark of visual system development. However, a recent anatomical study showed that nearly half of the neurons in dLGN of adult mice still receive input from both retinae, but functional data about binocularity in mature dLGN is conflicting. Here, we found that a variable but small fraction of thalamocortical neurons is binocular in vivo. Using dual-channel optogenetics in vitro we correspondingly found that dLGN neurons are dominated by retinogeniculate input from one eye only, although most neurons also received small but detectable input from the non-dominant eye. Anatomical overlap between RGC axons and dLGN neuron dendrites did not explain this strong bias towards monocularity. Our data rather suggest that functional input selection and refinement, leaving the remaining non-dominant eye inputs in a juvenile-like state, underlies the prevalent monocularity of neurons in dLGN.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.14.339697v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>The goal of this study was to investigate a relatively unstudied memory condition for paradoxical combinations of item + source memory confidence responses, which challenged the conventional views of the memory processes supporting item and source memory judgments. We studied instances in which people provided accurate source memory judgments (conventionally ascribed as representing recollection) after having first produced low-confidence item recognition hits for the same items (conventionally thought to reflect familiarity-based processing). This paradoxical combination does not fit traditional accounts of being recollection (because it had low-confidence recognition) nor accounts of familiarity (since it had accurate source memory), and event-related potentials (ERPs) were used to adjudicate which processes support these kinds of memories. ERP results were unlike the conventional ERP effects of memory, lacking both an FN400 and the parietal old-new effect (LPC), and instead exhibited a significant negative-going ERP effect occurring later in time (800-1200ms) in central-parietal sites. Behavioral measures of response times revealed a crossover interaction: low confident recognition hits were slower during recognition but faster during source memory when compared to the opposite pattern seen for instances of high confident hits. Results provide a comprehensive characterization of the individual variability of the FN400 and LPC effects of memory, while adding the behavioral and physiological characterization of a late negative-going ERP effect for accurate source memory without recollection. Conclusions indicated that episodic context could be retrieved independently from recollection, while suggesting a role for a process of context familiarity that is independent from item-familiarity.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.14.339507v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Brain markers of oxidative damage increase with advancing age. In response, brain antioxidant levels may also increase with age, although this has not been well investigated. Here we used edited magnetic resonance spectroscopy to quantify endogenous levels of glutathione (GSH, one of the most abundant brain antioxidants) in 37 young (mean: 21.8 (2.5) years; 19 F) and 23 older adults (mean: 72.8 (8.9) years; 19 F). Accounting for age-related atrophy, we identified higher frontal and sensorimotor GSH levels for the older compared to the younger adults. For the older adults only, higher sensorimotor (but not frontal) GSH was correlated with poorer balance, gait, and manual dexterity. This suggests a regionally-specific relationship between higher brain oxidative stress levels and motor performance declines with age. We suggest these findings reflect a compensatory upregulation of GSH in response to increasing brain oxidative stress with normal aging. Together, these results provide insight into age differences in brain antioxidant levels and implications for motor function.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.14.339291v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Interpersonal space can be defined as a safety zone immediately surrounding our body, which allows us to feel comfortable during social interactions. Previous studies indicate that the size of interpersonal space at which the other is perceived as intrusive (permeability) and the ability to adapt interpersonal distance based on contextual factors (flexibility) are altered in children and adults with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). The present fMRI study aimed at extending the previous findings by investigating the behavioral and neurophysiological underpinnings of interpersonal space permeability and flexibility in adults with ASD. Individuals with ASD and matched controls (CTR) performed a modified version of the stop-distance paradigm for measuring interpersonal space preferences. Participants observed prerecorded videos of two confederates moving towards them and rated their comfort to the observed distance. The assessment of interpersonal space preferences was performed before and after engaging in cooperative and non-cooperative social interactions with the confederates, experimentally induced by means of a repeated trust game. We observed general lower comfort in response to an approaching confederate in the ASD group compared to the CTR group, indicating preference for larger interpersonal space in autism (altered permeability). This preference was accompanied by reduced activity in bilateral dorsal intraparietal sulcus (dIPS) and left fusiform face area (FFA), regions previously shown to be involved in interpersonal space regulation. Furthermore, we observed differences in effective connectivity among dIPS, FFA, and amygdala in ASDs compared to CTRs, depending on the level of experienced comfort. No differences between ASDs and CTRs were observed in the adaptation of interpersonal space following a cooperative and non-cooperative social interaction, suggesting preserved interpersonal space flexibility in the ASD adult population. The present study provides evidence for impaired permeability of interpersonal space in adults with ASD. The findings suggest that a dysregulation of the activity and connectivity of brain areas involved in the processing of interpersonal space may contribute to preference for larger distance and avoidance of physical proximity in ASDs. Future research is needed to examine whether the observed alteration of interpersonal space processing is an effect of or a contributing factor to the social disabilities characterizing autism.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.14.339192v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Pathogenic variants in SYNGAP1 are one of the most common genetic causes of nonsyndromic intellectual disability (ID) and are considered a risk for autism spectrum disorder (ASD). SYNGAP1 encodes a synaptic GTPase activating protein that modulates the intrinsic GTPase activity of several small G-proteins and is implicated in regulating the composition of the postsynaptic density. By targeting the deletion of exons encoding the calcium/lipid binding (C2) and GTPase activating protein (GAP) domains, we generated a novel rat model to study SYNGAP related pathophysiology. We find that rats heterozygous for the C2/GAP domain deletion (Syngap+/{Delta}-GAP) exhibit reduced exploration and fear extinction, altered social behaviour, and spontaneous seizures, while homozygous mutants die within days after birth. This new rat model reveals that the enzymatic domains of SYNGAP are essential for normal brain function and provide an important new model system in the study of both ID/ASD and epilepsy.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Novel epigenetic clock for fetal brain development predicts fetal epigenetic age for iPSCs and iPSC-derived neurons.</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.14.339093v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and their differentiated neurons (iPSC-neurons) are a widely used cellular model in the research of the central nervous system. However, it is unknown how well they capture age-associated processes, particularly given that pluripotent cells are only present during the early stages of mammalian development. Epigenetic clocks utilize coordinated age-associated changes in DNA methylation to make predictions that correlate strongly with chronological age, and is has been shown that the induction of pluripotency rejuvenates predicted epigenetic age. As existing clocks are not optimized for the study of brain development, to investigate more precisely the epigenetic age of iPSCs and iPSC-neurons, here, we establish the fetal brain clock (FBC), a bespoke epigenetic clock trained in prenatal neurodevelopmental samples. Our data show that the FBC outperforms other established epigenetic clocks in predicting the age of fetal brain samples. We then applied the FBC to DNA methylation data of cellular datasets that have profiled iPSCs and iPSC-derived neuronal precursor cells and neurons and find that these cell types are characterized by a fetal epigenetic age. Furthermore, while differentiation from iPSCs to neurons significantly increases the epigenetic age, iPSC-neurons are still predicted as having fetal epigenetic age. Together our findings reiterate the need for better understanding of the limitations of existing epigenetic clocks for answering biological research questions and highlight a potential limitation of iPSC-neurons as a cellular model for the research of age-related diseases as they might not fully recapitulate an aged phenotype.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.14.338954v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Approximately 44 million people worldwide live with Alzheimer's disease (AD) or a related form of dementia. Aggregates of the microtubule-associated protein tau are a common marker of these neurodegenerative diseases collectively termed as tauopathies. However, all therapeutic attempts based on tau have failed, suggesting that tau may only indicate a higher-level causal mechanism. For example, increasing levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) may trigger protein aggregation or modulate protein degradation. Here we show that type 4 NADPH oxidase (NOX), the most abundant isoform of the only dedicated reactive oxygen producing enzyme family, is upregulated in dementia and AD patients and in a humanized mouse model of tauopathy. Both global knockout and neuronal knockdown of the Nox4 gene in mice, diminished the accumulation of pathological tau and positively modified established tauopathy by a mechanism that implicates modulation of the autophagy-lysosomal pathway (ALP). Moreover, neuronal-targeted NOX4 knockdown was sufficient to reduce neurotoxicity and prevented cognitive decline, suggesting a direct and causal role for neuronal NOX4. Thus, NOX4 is a previously unrecognized causal, mechanism-based target in tauopathies and blood-brain barrier permeable specific NOX4 inhibitors could have therapeutic potential even in established disease.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>We present a semi-automated reconstruction of L2/3 mouse primary visual cortex from 3 million cubic microns of electron microscopic images, including pyramidal and inhibitory neurons, astrocytes, microglia, oligodendrocytes and precursors, pericytes, vasculature, mitochondria, and synapses. Visual responses of a subset of pyramidal cells are included. The data are being made publicly available, along with tools for programmatic and 3D interactive access. The density of synaptic inputs onto inhibitory neurons varies across cell classes and compartments. We uncover a compartment-specific correlation between mitochondrial coverage and synapse density. Frequencies of connectivity motifs in the graph of pyramidal cells are predicted quite accurately from node degrees using the configuration model of random graphs. Cells receiving more connections from nearby cells exhibit stronger and more reliable visual responses. These example findings illustrate the resource's utility for relating structure and function of cortical circuits as well as for neuronal cell biology.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Anticipation of temporally structured events in the brain</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.14.338145v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Higher-order regions in the brain play a role in organizing perceptual input into semantically-meaningful schematic representations, and they do so at differing timescales up the cortical hierarchy. Such integration in higher-order regions critically depends on the availability of temporal structure over long timescales. The ability to extract temporal structure is particularly adaptive because it enables the generation of predictions about upcoming events. How does the brain use repeated experience in structured environments to anticipate what is likely to come next? Here, we examine how the brain can anticipate event boundaries in familiar sequences of actions. We used a naturalistic stimulus (a movie), in which regularities are present at multiple timescales, enabling us to identify multiple timescales of prediction in the brain. We hypothesized that the timescale of neural prediction would vary continuously, with progressively higher-order regions (e.g., prefrontal cortex) predicting further in the future than lower-order regions (e.g., visual cortex). To test this, we examined brain activity with fMRI while individuals watched a 90-second clip from the movie The Grand Budapest Hotel, six times. To uncover neural anticipation, we used a searchlight approach in which, for each region of interest, we fit a Hidden Markov Model to identify temporal shifts between multivariate activity patterns evoked by the first viewing of the movie clip compared to repeated viewings. We found temporal shifts in event patterns throughout the brain, such that neural activity patterns for repeated viewings shifted to preceded those of initial viewing. The scale of prediction varied hierarchically in a posterior (less prediction) to anterior (more prediction) fashion, with prediction reaching up to 12 seconds in the future. Furthermore, in a subset of regions exhibiting prediction, neural event boundaries shifted with repeated viewing to precede subjective event boundaries by 6-7 seconds. Together, these results demonstrate that prediction is ubiquitous in the brain, but the amount of prediction varies across the cortical hierarchy.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.13.338491v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Spatial processing by receptive fields is a core property of the visual system. However, it is unknown how spatial coding in high-level regions contributes to recognition behavior. As face inversion is thought to disrupt typical 'holistic' processing of information in faces, we mapped population receptive fields (pRFs) with upright and inverted faces in the human visual system. In face-selective regions, but not primary visual cortex, pRFs and overall visual field coverage were smaller and shifted downward in response to face inversion. From these measurements, we successfully predicted the relative behavioral detriment of face inversion at different positions in the visual field. This correspondence between neural measurements and behavior demonstrates how spatial integration in face-selective regions enables holistic processing. These results not only show that spatial processing in high-level visual regions is dynamically used towards recognition, but also suggest a powerful approach for bridging neural computations by receptive fields to behavior.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: The effect of functionally-guided-connectivity-based rTMS on amygdala activation.</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.13.338483v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) has fundamentally transformed how we treat psychiatric disorders, but is still in need of innovation to optimally correct dysregulation that occurs throughout the fronto-limbic network. rTMS is often applied over the prefrontal cortex, a central node in this network, but less attention is given to subcortical areas because they lie at depths beyond the electric field penetration of rTMS. Recent studies have demonstrated that the effectiveness of rTMS is dependent on the functional connectivity between deep subcortical areas and superficial targets, indicating that leveraging such connectivity may improve dosing approaches for rTMS interventions. The current preliminary study, therefore, sought to test whether task-related, fMRI-connectivity-based rTMS could be used to modulate amygdala activation through its connectivity with the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). For this purpose, fMRI was collected on participants to identify a node in the mPFC that showed the strongest negative connectivity with right amygdala, as defined by psychophysiological interaction analysis. To promote long-lasting Hebbian-like effects, and potentially stronger modulation, 5Hz rTMS was then applied to this target as participants viewed frightening video-clips that engaged the fronto-limbic network. Post-rTMS fMRI results revealed promising increases in both the left mPFC and right amygdala, for active rTMS compared to sham. While these modulatory findings are promising, they differ from the a priori expectation that excitatory 5Hz rTMS over a negatively connected node would reduce amygdala activity. As such, further research is needed to better understand how connectivity influences TMS effects on distal structures, and to leverage this information to improve therapeutic applications.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.13.338350v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Background: Combined single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and electroencephalography (EEG) has been used to probe the features of local networks in the cerebral cortex. Here we investigate whether we can use this approach to explore long-range connections between the cerebellum and cerebral cortex. Objective: To assess the feasibility of using cerebellar TMS-EEG for the exploration of cerebellar-cerebral network dynamics. Methods: Ten healthy adults received single-pulse suprathreshold TMS to the cerebellum and an occipital/parietal control site with double-cone and figure-of-eight coils while cerebral activity was recorded. A multisensory electrical control condition was used to simulate the sensation of the double-cone coil at the cerebellar site. Two cleaning pipelines were compared, and the spatiotemporal relationships of the EEG output between conditions were examined at sensor and source levels. Results: Cerebellar stimulation with the double-cone coil resulted in large artefacts in the EEG trace. The addition of SOUND filtering to the cleaning pipeline improved the signal such that further analyses could be undertaken. The cortical potentials evoked by the active TMS conditions showed strong relationships with the responses to the multisensory control condition after ~50 ms. A distinct parietal component at ~42 ms was found following cerebellar double-cone stimulation. Conclusions: Cerebellar double-cone stimulation produces large artefacts in the EEG. Cerebellar-specific responses could not be reliably differentiated from sensory evoked potentials after ~50 ms. While evoked potentials differed across conditions at early latencies, it is unclear as to whether these represented TMS-related network activation of the cerebellarthalamocortical tract, or whether components were dominated by sensory contamination and/or coil-driven artefacts. Further work will be required to clarify the specific contribution of cerebellar-cortical connectivity to the observed early latency signals.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Attention may be oriented exogenously (i.e., involuntarily) to the location of salient stimuli, resulting in improved perception. However, it is unknown whether exogenous attention improves perception by facilitating processing of attended information, suppressing processing of unattended information, or both. To test this question, we measured behavioral performance and cue-elicited neural changes in the electroencephalogram as participants (N = 19) performed a task in which a spatially non-predictive auditory cue preceded a visual target. Critically, this cue was either presented at a peripheral target location or from the center of the screen, allowing us to isolate spatially specific attentional activity. We found that both behavioral performance and visual-cortical processing were enhanced at the location of a peripheral cue, but that both measures were equivalent to baseline (i.e., following a central cue) at the unattended location. These results suggest that exogenous attention operates solely via facilitation of information at an attended location.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.13.337857v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Tau pathology is a diagnostic feature of Alzheimer's disease (AD) but is also a prominent feature of Parkinson's disease (PD), including genetic forms of PD with mutations in leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2). In both diseases, tau pathology is progressive and correlates with cognitive decline. Neuropathological staging studies in humans and mouse models have suggested that tau spreads through the brain, but it is unclear how neuroanatomical connections, spatial proximity, and regional vulnerability contribute to pathology spread. Further, it is unknown how mutations in the LRRK2 gene may modulate susceptibility to tau pathology's initiation or spread. In this study, we used seed-based models of tauopathy to capture spatiotemporal patterns of pathology in mice. Following the injection of AD brain-derived tau into the brains of non-transgenic mice, tau pathology spreads progressively through the brain in a spatiotemporal pattern that is well-explained by anatomical connectivity. We validated and compared network models based on diffusion along anatomical connections to predict tau spread, estimate regional vulnerability to tau pathology, and investigate gene expression patterns related to regional vulnerability. We further investigated tau pathology spread in mice harboring a mutation in LRRK2 and found that while tau pathology spread is still constrained by anatomical connectivity, it spreads preferentially in a retrograde direction to regions that are otherwise resilient in wildtype mice. This study provides a quantitative demonstration that tau pathology spreads along anatomical connections, explores the kinetics of this spread, and provides a platform for investigating the effect of genetic risk factors and treatments on the progression of tauopathies.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Reducing SAR in 7T brain fMRI by circumventing fat suppression while removing the lipid signal through a parallel acquisition approach</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.13.337691v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Ultra-high-field functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) offers the way to new insights while increasing the spatial and temporal resolution. However, a crucial concern in 7T human MRI is the increase in power deposition, supervised through the specific absorption rate (SAR). The SAR limitation can restrict the brain coverage or the minimal repetition time of fMRI experiments. fMRI is based on the well-known gradient-echo echo-planar imaging (GRE-EPI) sequence, which offers ultrafast acquisition. Commonly, the GRE-EPI sequence comprises two pulses: fat suppression and excitation. This work provides the means for a significant reduction in the SAR by circumventing the fat-suppression pulse. Without this fat-suppression, however, lipid signal can result in artifacts due to the chemical shift between the lipid and water signals. Our approach exploits a reconstruction similar to the simultaneous-multi-slice (SMS) method to separate the lipid and water images, thus avoiding undesired lipid artifacts in brain images. The lipid-water separation is based on the known spatial shift of the lipid signal, which can be detected by the multi-channel coils sensitivity profiles. Our study shows robust human imaging, offering greater flexibility to reduce the SAR, shorten the repetition time or increase the volume coverage with substantial benefit for brain functional studies.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Curiosity, which can be defined as intrinsically motivated information-seeking, is an important driving force in our everyday lives. Based on previous evidence demonstrating a link between information prediction errors and dopamine neuronal firing rates, we asked whether the drive to seek information varies with individual differences in dopamine synthesis capacity. In order to investigate this, we let participants perform a lottery task in which we independently manipulated outcome uncertainty, outcome valence (gains versus losses) and expected value, and asked participants to indicate their curiosity for each presented lottery. In a separate session, participants underwent an [18F]DOPA PET scan to quantify their dopamine synthesis capacity. We replicate previous behavioral results, showing that curiosity is a function of outcome uncertainty as well as outcome valence (gain versus loss). However, we found no evidence that curiosity or the sensitivity to outcome uncertainty, outcome valence and expected value was related to participants dopamine synthesis capacity in the ventral striatum, the caudate nucleus or the putamen. These findings stress the need for further studies into the role of dopamine in (different types of) curiosity.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>The pig is widely used as a translational model in biomedical research, but currently lacks the requisite cortical characterization of homology to be used as a translational model in neuroscience. To overcome this obstacle, we created a digital platform based on Magnetic Resonance Imaging and data-driven tractography to facilitate cross-species cortical alignment of the pig and human brain. The full platform of pig neuroimaging tools includes volumetric and surface templates, a structural white matter atlas, and the establishment of a common connectivity space to facilitate pig-human cortical alignment. To promote the further adoption of the pig in neuroimaging, other researchers can access the common connectivity space by registering their data into pig volumetric and surface template space. Doing so, we advance the pig's translational capacity, making it a model capable of asking clinically relevant questions in neurology and neuroscience.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.13.335356v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Recent neuroscience studies suggest that flexible changes in functional brain networks are associated with cognitive functions. Therefore, the technique that detects changes in dynamical brain structures, which is called &quot;dynamic functional connectivity (DFC) analysis&quot;, has become important for the clarification of the crucial roles of functional brain networks. Conventional methods analyze DFC applying static indices based on the correlation between each pair of time-series data in the different brain areas to estimate network couplings. However, correlation-based indices lead to incorrect conclusions contaminated by spurious correlations between time-series data. These spurious correlation issues of network analysis could be reduced by performing the analysis assuming data structures based on a relevant model. Therefore, we propose a novel approach that combines the following two methods: (1) model-based network estimation assuming a dynamical system for time evolution, and (2) sequential estimation of model parameters based on Bayesian inference. We, thus, assumed that the model parameters reflect dynamical structures of functional brain networks. Moreover, by introducing model parameter values prior to the Bayesian inference, the network changes can be quantified based on the comparison between prior and posterior distributions of model parameters. In this comparison, we used the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence as an index for such changes. To validate our method, we applied it to numerical data and electroencephalographic (EEG) data. As a result, we confirmed that the KL divergence increased only when changes in dynamical structures occurred. Our proposed method successfully estimated both network couplings and change points of dynamic structures in the numerical and EEG data. The results suggest that our proposed method is useful in revealing the neural basis of dynamic functional networks.</content:encoded>

Here we show that relationships between SES, brain volumes and general cognitive ability differ significantly across European and US cohorts (4-97 years, N {approx} 500,000; 54,000 with brain imaging). Education was positively related to intracranial (ICV) and total brain gray matter (GM) volume. Income was related to ICV, but not GM. Relationships varied significantly across samples, and SES was more strongly related to brain and cognition in US than European cohorts. Differences in neuroanatomical volumes explained part of the SES-cognition relationships. SES was more strongly related to ICV than to GM, implying that SES-cognition relations in adulthood are less likely grounded in neuroprotective effects on GM volume in aging. Rather, a relationship may be established early in life. The findings underscore that SES has no uniform association with, or impact on, brain and cognition.</content:encoded>

Most foldable protein sequences adopt only a single native fold. Recent protein design studies have, however, created protein sequences which fold into different structures apon changes of environment, or single point mutation, the best characterized example being the switch between the folds of the GA and GB binding domains of streptococcal protein G. To obtain further insight into the design of sequences which can switch folds, we have used a computational model for the fitness landscape of a single fold, built from the observed sequence variation of protein homologues. We have recently shown that such coevolutionary models can be used to design novel foldable sequences. By appropriately combining two of these models to describe the joint fitness landscape of GA and GB, we are able to describe the propensity of a given sequence for each of the two folds. We have successfully tested the combined model against the known series of designed GA/GB hybrids. Using Monte Carlo simulations on this landscape, we are able to identify pathways of mutations connecting the two folds. In the absence of a requirement for domain stability, the most frequent paths go via sequences in which neither domain is stably folded, reminiscent of the propensity for certain intrinsically disordered proteins to fold into different structures according to context. Even if the folded state is required to be stable, we find that there is nonetheless still a wide range of sequences which are close to the transition region and therefore likely fold switches, consistent with recent estimates that fold switching may be more widespread than had been thought.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/pwH3Evehv4k&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Returning home is a crucial task accomplished daily by many animals, including humans. Because of their tiny brains, insects, like bees or ants, are good study models for efficient navigation strategies. Bees and ants are known to rely mainly on learned visual information about the nest surroundings to pinpoint their barely visible nest-entrance. During the return, when the actual sight of the insect matches the learned information, the insect is easily guided home. Occasionally, modifications to the visual environment may take place while the insect is on a foraging trip. Here, we addressed the ecologically relevant question of how bumblebees’ homing is affected by such a situation. In an artificial setting, we habituated bees to be guided to their nest by two constellations of visual cues. After habituation, these cues were displaced during foraging trips into a conflict situation. We recorded bumblebees’ return flights in such circumstances and investigated where they search for their nest entrance following the degree of displacement between the two visually relevant cues. Bumblebees mostly searched at the fictive nest location as indicated by either cue constellation, but never at a compromise location between them. We compared these experimental results to the predictions of different types of homing models. We found that models guiding an agent by a single holistic view of the nest surroundings could not account for the bumblebees’ search behaviour in cue-conflict situations. Instead, homing models relying on multiple views were sufficient. We could further show that homing models required fewer views and got more robust to height changes if optic flow-based spatial information was encoded and learned, rather than just brightness information.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/t0GW-wD3XXc&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s or Parkinson’s are associated with the prion-like propagation and aggregation of toxic proteins. A long standing hypothesis that amyloid-beta drives Alzheimer’s disease has proven the subject of contemporary controversy; leading to new research in both the role of tau protein and its interaction with amyloid-beta. Conversely, recent work in mathematical modeling has demonstrated the relevance of nonlinear reaction-diffusion type equations to capture essential features of the disease. Such approaches have been further simplified, to network-based models, and offer researchers a powerful set of computationally tractable tools with which to investigate neurodegenerative disease dynamics. Here, we propose a novel, coupled network-based model for a two-protein system that includes an enzymatic interaction term alongside a simple model of aggregate transneuronal damage. We apply this theoretical model to test the possible interactions between tau proteins and amyloid-beta and study the resulting coupled behavior between toxic protein clearance and proteopathic phenomenology. Our analysis reveals ways in which amyloid-beta and tau proteins may conspire with each other to enhance the nucleation and propagation of different diseases, thus shedding new light on the importance of protein clearance and protein interaction mechanisms in prion-like models of neurodegenerative disease.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/KLXNjOQrBgw&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Systematic modelling of the development of laminar projection origins in the cerebral cortex: Interactions of spatio-temporal patterns of neurogenesis and cellular heterogeneity</title>

The architectonic type principle conceptualizes structural connections between brain areas in terms of the relative architectonic differentiation of connected areas. It has previously been shown that spatio-temporal interactions between the time and place of neurogenesis could underlie multiple features of empirical mammalian connectomes, such as projection existence and the distribution of projection strengths. However, so far no mechanistic explanation for the emergence of typically observed laminar patterns of projection origins and terminations has been tested. Here, we expand an &lt;i&gt;in silico&lt;/i&gt; model of the developing cortical sheet to explore which factors could potentially constrain the development of laminar projection patterns. We show that manipulations which rely solely on spatio-temporal interactions, namely the relative density of laminar compartments, a delay in the neurogenesis of infragranular layers relative to layer 1, and a delay in the neurogenesis of supragranular layers relative to infragranular layers, do not result in the striking correlation between supragranular contribution to projections and the relative differentiation of areas that is typically observed in the mammalian cortex. In contrast, we find that if we introduce systematic variation in cell-intrinsic properties, coupling them with architectonic differentiation, the resulting laminar projection patterns closely mirror the empirically observed patterns. We also find that the spatio-temporal interactions posited to occur during neurogenesis are necessary for the formation of the characteristic laminar patterns. Hence, our results indicate that the specification of the laminar patterns of projection origins may result from systematic variation in a number of cell-intrinsic properties, superimposed on the previously identified spatio-temporal interactions which are sufficient for the emergence of the architectonic type principle on the level of inter-areal connectivity &lt;i&gt;in silico&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/9VZgkBWsJfs&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Bacteriophages (phages) are critical players in the dynamics and function of microbial communities and drive processes as diverse as global biogeochemical cycles and human health. Phages tend to be predators finely tuned to attack specific hosts, even down to the strain level, which in turn defend themselves using an array of mechanisms. However, to date, efforts to rapidly and comprehensively identify bacterial host factors important in phage infection and resistance have yet to be fully realized. Here, we globally map the host genetic determinants involved in resistance to 14 phylogenetically diverse double-stranded DNA phages using two model &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; strains (K-12 and BL21) with known sequence divergence to demonstrate strain-specific differences. Using genome-wide loss-of-function and gain-of-function genetic technologies, we are able to confirm previously described phage receptors as well as uncover a number of previously unknown host factors that confer resistance to one or more of these phages. We uncover differences in resistance factors that strongly align with the susceptibility of K-12 and BL21 to specific phage. We also identify both phage-specific mechanisms, such as the unexpected role of cyclic-di-GMP in host sensitivity to phage N4, and more generic defenses, such as the overproduction of colanic acid capsular polysaccharide that defends against a wide array of phages. Our results indicate that host responses to phages can occur via diverse cellular mechanisms. Our systematic and high-throughput genetic workflow to characterize phage-host interaction determinants can be extended to diverse bacteria to generate datasets that allow predictive models of how phage-mediated selection will shape bacterial phenotype and evolution. The results of this study and future efforts to map the phage resistance landscape will lead to new insights into the coevolution of hosts and their phage, which can ultimately be used to design better phage therapeutic treatments and tools for precision microbiome engineering.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/iHWP51nHehA&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Biology: Neural activity during a simple reaching task in macaques is counter to gating and rebound in basal ganglia–thalamic communication</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~3/iBXCAHu-EVs/article</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Bettina C. Schwab, Daisuke Kase, Andrew Zimnik, Robert Rosenbaum, Marcello G. Codianni, Jonathan E. Rubin, Robert S. Turner&lt;/p&gt;

Task-related activity in the ventral thalamus, a major target of basal ganglia output, is often assumed to be permitted or triggered by changes in basal ganglia activity through gating- or rebound-like mechanisms. To test those hypotheses, we sampled single-unit activity from connected basal ganglia output and thalamic nuclei (globus pallidus-internus [GPi] and ventrolateral anterior nucleus [VLa]) in monkeys performing a reaching task. Rate increases were the most common peri-movement change in both nuclei. Moreover, peri-movement changes generally began earlier in VLa than in GPi. Simultaneously recorded GPi-VLa pairs rarely showed short-time-scale spike-to-spike correlations or slow across-trials covariations, and both were equally positive and negative. Finally, spontaneous GPi bursts and pauses were both followed by small, slow reductions in VLa rate. These results appear incompatible with standard gating and rebound models. Still, gating or rebound may be possible in other physiological situations: simulations show how GPi-VLa communication can scale with GPi synchrony and GPi-to-VLa convergence, illuminating how synchrony of basal ganglia output during motor learning or in pathological conditions may render this pathway effective. Thus, in the healthy state, basal ganglia-thalamic communication during learned movement is more subtle than expected, with changes in firing rates possibly being dominated by a common external source.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/iBXCAHu-EVs&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Subthalamic Nucleus Deep Brain Stimulation Modulates 2 Distinct Neurocircuits</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25906?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Current understanding of the neuromodulatory effects of deep brain stimulation (DBS) on large‐scale brain networks remains elusive, largely due to the lack of techniques that can reveal DBS‐induced activity at the whole‐brain level. Using a novel 3T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)‐compatible stimulator, we investigated whole‐brain effects of subthalamic nucleus (STN) stimulation in patients with Parkinson disease.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fourteen patients received STN‐DBS treatment and participated in a block‐design functional MRI (fMRI) experiment, wherein stimulations were delivered during “ON” blocks interleaved with “OFF” blocks. fMRI responses to low‐frequency (60Hz) and high‐frequency(130Hz) STN‐DBS were measured 1, 3, 6, and 12 months postsurgery. To ensure reliability, multiple runs (48 minutes) of fMRI data were acquired at each postsurgical visit. Presurgical resting‐state fMRI (30 minutes) data were also acquired.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two neurocircuits showed highly replicable, but distinct responses to STN‐DBS. A circuit involving the globus pallidus internus (GPi), thalamus, and deep cerebellar nuclei was significantly activated, whereas another circuit involving the primary motor cortex (M1), putamen, and cerebellum showed DBS‐induced deactivation. These 2 circuits were dissociable in terms of their DBS‐induced responses and resting‐state functional connectivity. The GPi circuit was frequency‐dependent, selectively responding to high‐frequency stimulation, whereas the M1 circuit was responsive in a time‐dependent manner, showing enhanced deactivation over time. Finally, activation of the GPi circuit was associated with overall motor improvement, whereas M1 circuit deactivation was related to reduced bradykinesia.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Concurrent DBS‐fMRI using 3T revealed 2 distinct circuits that responded differentially to STN‐DBS and were related to divergent symptoms, a finding that may provide novel insights into the neural mechanisms underlying DBS. ANN NEUROL 2020&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Speech cognition bears potential application as a brain computer interface
that can improve the quality of life for the otherwise communication impaired
people. While speech and resting state EEG are popularly studied, here we
attempt to explore a &quot;non-speech&quot;(NS) state of brain activity corresponding to
the silence regions of speech audio. Firstly, speech perception is studied to
inspect the existence of such a state, followed by its identification in speech
imagination. Analogous to how voice activity detection is employed to enhance
the performance of speech recognition, the EEG state activity detection
protocol implemented here is applied to boost the confidence of imagined speech
EEG decoding. Classification of speech and NS state is done using two datasets
collected from laboratory-based and commercial-based devices. The state
sequential information thus obtained is further utilized to reduce the search
space of imagined EEG unit recognition. Temporal signal structures and
topographic maps of NS states are visualized across subjects and sessions. The
recognition performance and the visual distinction observed demonstrates the
existence of silence signatures in EEG.

algorithm to train DNNs by optimizing the parameters over the training data
iteratively. In this work, first we present a novel approach to add the
training ability to a baseline DNN accelerator (inference only) by splitting
the SGD algorithm into simple computational elements. Then, based on this
heuristic approach we propose TaxoNN, a light-weight accelerator for DNN
training. TaxoNN can easily tune the DNN weights by reusing the hardware
resources used in the inference process using a time-multiplexing approach and
low-bitwidth units. Our experimental results show that TaxoNN delivers, on
average, 0.97% higher misclassification rate compared to a full-precision
implementation. Moreover, TaxoNN provides 2.1$\times$ power saving and
1.65$\times$ area reduction over the state-of-the-art DNN training accelerator.

	<title>arXiv: Computer Science: Neural and Evolutionary Computing: Complexity-based speciation and genotype representation for neuroevolution. (arXiv:2010.05176v1 [cs.NE])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.05176</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;This paper introduces a speciation principle for neuroevolution where
evolving networks are grouped into species based on the number of hidden
neurons, which is indicative of the complexity of the search space. This
speciation principle is indivisibly coupled with a novel genotype
representation which is characterised by zero genome redundancy, high
resilience to bloat, explicit marking of recurrent connections, as well as an
efficient and reproducible stack-based evaluation procedure for networks with
arbitrary topology. Furthermore, the proposed speciation principle is employed
in several techniques designed to promote and preserve diversity within species
and in the ecosystem as a whole. The competitive performance of the proposed
framework, named Cortex, is demonstrated through experiments. A highly
customisable software platform which implements the concepts proposed in this
study is also introduced in the hope that it will serve as a useful and
reliable tool for experimentation in the field of neuroevolution.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.04963</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Deep neural networks (DNNs) have achieved outstanding performance in a wide
range of applications, e.g., image classification, natural language processing,
etc. Despite the good performance, the huge number of parameters in DNNs brings
challenges to efficient training of DNNs and also their deployment in low-end
devices with limited computing resources. In this paper, we explore the
correlations in the weight matrices, and approximate the weight matrices with
the low-rank block-term tensors. We name the new corresponding structure as
block-term tensor layers (BT-layers), which can be easily adapted to neural
network models, such as CNNs and RNNs. In particular, the inputs and the
outputs in BT-layers are reshaped into low-dimensional high-order tensors with
a similar or improved representation power. Sufficient experiments have
demonstrated that BT-layers in CNNs and RNNs can achieve a very large
compression ratio on the number of parameters while preserving or improving the
representation power of the original DNNs.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.04875</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Sparse sequences of neural spikes are posited to underlie aspects of working
memory, motor production, and learning. Discovering these sequences in an
unsupervised manner is a longstanding problem in statistical neuroscience.
Promising recent work utilized a convolutive nonnegative matrix factorization
model to tackle this challenge. However, this model requires spike times to be
discretized, utilizes a sub-optimal least-squares criterion, and does not
provide uncertainty estimates for model predictions or estimated parameters. We
address each of these shortcomings by developing a point process model that
characterizes fine-scale sequences at the level of individual spikes and
represents sequence occurrences as a small number of marked events in
continuous time. This ultra-sparse representation of sequence events opens new
possibilities for spike train modeling. For example, we introduce learnable
time warping parameters to model sequences of varying duration, which have been
experimentally observed in neural circuits. We demonstrate these advantages on
experimental recordings from songbird higher vocal center and rodent
hippocampus.

	<title>The Cerebellum: Increased Purkinje Cell Complex Spike and Deep Cerebellar Nucleus Synchrony as a Potential Basis for Syndromic Essential Tremor. A Review and Synthesis of the Literature</title>
	<link>http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s12311-020-01197-5</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;We review advances in understanding Purkinje cell (PC) complex spike (CS) physiology that suggest increased CS synchrony underlies syndromic essential tremor (ET). We searched PubMed for papers describing factors that affect CS synchrony or cerebellar circuits potentially related to tremor. Inferior olivary (IO) neurons are electrically coupled, with the degree of coupling controlled by excitatory and GABAergic inputs. Clusters of coupled IO neurons synchronize CSs within parasagittal bands via climbing fibers (Cfs). When motor cortex is stimulated in rats at varying frequencies, whisker movement occurs at ~10 Hz, correlated with synchronous CSs, indicating that the IO/CS oscillatory rhythm gates movement frequency. Intra-IO injection of the GABA&lt;sub class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptor antagonist picrotoxin increases CS synchrony, increases whisker movement amplitude, and induces tremor. Harmaline and 5-HT&lt;sub class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;2a&lt;/sub&gt; receptor activation also increase IO coupling and CS synchrony and induce tremor. The &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;hotfoot17&lt;/em&gt; mouse displays features found in ET brains, including cerebellar GluRδ2 deficiency and abnormal PC Cf innervation, with IO- and PC-dependent cerebellar oscillations and tremor likely due to enhanced CS synchrony. Heightened coupling within the IO oscillator leads, through its dynamic control of CS synchrony, to increased movement amplitude and, when sufficiently intense, action tremor. Increased CS synchrony secondary to aberrant Cf innervation of multiple PCs likely also underlies &lt;em class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;hotfoot17&lt;/em&gt; tremor. Deep cerebellar nucleus (DCN) hypersynchrony may occur secondary to increased CS synchrony but might also occur from PC axonal terminal sprouting during partial PC loss. Through these combined mechanisms, increased CS/DCN synchrony may plausibly underlie syndromic ET.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Neurodegenerative disorders have become the leading cause of chronic pain and death. Treatments available are not sufficient to help the patients as they only alleviate the symptoms and not the cause. In this regard, stem cells therapy has emerged as an upcoming option for the replacement of dead and damaged neurons. Stem cells, in general, are characterized as cells exhibiting potency properties, i.e., on being subjected to specific conditions they transform into cells of another lineage. Of all the types, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are known for their pluripotent nature without the obstacle of ethical concern surrounding the procurement of other cell types. Although fibroblasts are quite similar to MSCs morphologically, certain markers like CD73, CD 90 are specific to MSCs, making both the cell types distinguishable from each other. This is implemented while procuring MSCs from a plethora of sources like umbilical cord blood, adipose tissue, bone marrow, etc. Among these, bone marrow MSCs are the most widely used type for neural regeneration. Neural regeneration is achieved via transdifferentiation. Several studies have either transplanted the stem cells into rodent models or have carried out transdifferentiation in vitro. The process involves a combination of growth factors, pre-treatment factors, and neuronal differentiation inducing mediums. The results obtained are characterized by neuron-like morphology, expression of markers, along with electrophysical activity in some. Recent attempts involve exploring biomaterials that may mimic the native ECM and therefore can be directly introduced at the site of interest. The review gives a brief description of MSCs, their sources and markers, and the different attempts that have been made towards achieving the goal of differentiating MSCs into neurons.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                  &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Several viruses have the capacity to cause serious infections of the nervous system in patients who are immunosuppressed. Individuals may be immunosuppressed because of primary inherited immunodeficiency, secondary immunodeficiency due to particular diseases such as malignancy, administration of immunosuppressant drugs or organ or bone marrow transplantation. The viruses capable of such opportunistic infection of the nervous system include herpes simplex virus (HSV), Varicella-Zoster virus (VZV), Cytomegalovirus (CMV), Epstein –Barr virus (EBV), Human Herpes virus type 6 (HHV-6), JC virus (JCV), enterovirus, measles virus and Covid-19. In most cases it seems likely that immunological defence mechanisms in the immunosuppressed are deficient which creates a suitable environment for certain viruses to become opportunistic in the nervous and other systems. Further research is required both to understand these opportunistic mechanisms in more detail and also to determine how many virus infections are modified by specific inborn errors of immunological responses.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Background&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Cerebral small vessel disease (cSVD) is a leading cause of cognitive impairment in the elderly. Despite cSVD cognitive profile is thought to be mainly characterized by attention and executive functions deficits, there is no definite agreement on the standards for its evaluation. This systematic review aims at identifying cognitive domains and neuropsychological tools specifically chosen in the assessment of cognitive impairment related to cSVD, and the temporal and geographic trends in their utilization.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec2&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Methods&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Following PRISMA guidelines, original articles focused on cSVD patient samples neuropsychologically evaluated were searched using PubMed, Scopus and PsycINFO databases without language or time restrictions (PROSPERO registration number CRD42018089882; date 27-02-2018).&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec3&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;We screened 13,688 studies and included 298 in the qualitative data synthesis. Global cognitive functioning and attention/executive functions were the most evaluated domains (87% and 69%, respectively). Mini Mental State Examination was the most used screening tool (73%), followed by MoCA (14%) whose utilization rapidly increased over the last years. The most frequently used second level tests were phonemic and semantic fluencies (39% and 30%, respectively), Trail Making Test (TMT) part A and B (31% and 32%, respectively), Stroop (31.5%), and Boston naming (30%). All tests resulted stably utilized over time, except for semantic fluency and Stroop whose use increased. Phonemic fluency and Boston naming were the most used in North America (51% and 45%, respectively), TMT in Europe (43%), and Stroop and semantic fluency in Asia (43% and 40%, respectively).&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec4&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;This systematic review confirms that attention/executive functions domain is the most commonly evaluated in cSVD together with lexical retrieval abilities based on executive control processes. Temporal and geographic variability emerged in the choice of tests.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;

	<title>Journal of Neurology: Vestibular disorders: clinician ENT perspective on the need for research and innovation</title>
	<link>http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s00415-020-10242-6</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec1&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Objective&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Vertigo and dizziness are a frequent reason for medical consultation. However, diagnostic and therapeutic management is sometimes limited, and clinicians are faced with many unmet needs. The purpose of this study was to identify and prioritize these needs.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec2&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Methods&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;A questionnaire methodology was used to determine the need for innovation in vestibular disorder management. The questionnaire was sent to 19 teams in French-speaking ENT centers. We measured the concordance of the panel of experts on 56 questions related to the different vestibular pathologies encountered and the desired modalities of innovations.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec3&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Results&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Thirteen questions were identified as priorities. The needs expressed by the experts had better knowledge of the pathophysiological mechanisms of the main diseases encountered and the development of new treatment modalities. Particular attention was paid to inner ear imaging techniques and the development of specific electrophysiology techniques.&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec4&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Discussion&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Some of the anticipated innovations are already under development, such as new inner ear fluid imaging techniques (hydrops visualization using MRI) or in situ treatments (transtympanic dexamethasone or gentamicin injections). Others, such as new electrophysiological techniques, are still not fully developed&lt;/p&gt;
                  &lt;/span&gt;
                  &lt;span class=&quot;a-plus-plus abstract-section id-a-sec5&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;h3 class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
                    &lt;p class=&quot;a-plus-plus&quot;&gt;This study provides a snapshot of the needs of the medical profession in vestibular disorder management. It highlights a real concern of the attending personnel, as well as a critical need to optimize the means of diagnosing and treating patients with vestibular disorders.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>eLife: Dynamics of nevus development implicate cell cooperation in the growth arrest of transformed melanocytes</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/61026</link>
	<content:encoded>Mutational activation of the &lt;i&gt;BRAF&lt;/i&gt; proto-oncogene in melanocytes reliably produces benign nevi (pigmented ‘moles’), yet the same change is the most common driver mutation in melanoma. The reason nevi stop growing, and do not progress to melanoma, is widely attributed to a cell-autonomous process of ‘oncogene-induced senescence’. Using a mouse model of Braf-driven nevus formation, analyzing both proliferative dynamics and single-cell gene expression, we found no evidence that nevus cells are senescent, either compared with other skin cells, or other melanocytes. We also found that nevus size distributions could not be fit by any simple cell-autonomous model of growth arrest, yet were easily fit by models based on collective cell behavior, for example in which arresting cells release an arrest-promoting factor. We suggest that nevus growth arrest is more likely related to the cell interactions that mediate size control in normal tissues, than to any cell-autonomous, ‘oncogene-induced’ program of senescence.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: Full-length Plasmodium falciparum myosin A and essential light chain PfELC structures provide new anti-malarial targets</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/60581</link>
	<content:encoded>Parasites from the genus Plasmodium are the causative agents of malaria. The mobility, infectivity, and ultimately pathogenesis of &lt;i&gt;Plasmodium falciparum&lt;/i&gt; rely on a macromolecular complex, called the glideosome. At the core of the glideosome is an essential and divergent Myosin A motor (PfMyoA), a first order drug target against malaria. Here, we present the full-length structure of PfMyoA in two states of its motor cycle. We report novel interactions that are essential for motor priming and the mode of recognition of its two light chains (PfELC and MTIP) by two degenerate IQ motifs. Kinetic and motility assays using PfMyoA variants, along with molecular dynamics, demonstrate how specific priming and atypical sequence adaptations tune the motor’s mechano-chemical properties. Supported by evidence for an essential role of the PfELC in malaria pathogenesis, these structures provide a blueprint for the design of future anti-malarials targeting both the glideosome motor and its regulatory elements.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: Exploring chromosomal structural heterogeneity across multiple cell lines</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/60312</link>
	<content:encoded>Using computer simulations, we generate cell-specific 3D chromosomal structures and compare them to recently published chromatin structures obtained through microscopy. We demonstrate using machine learning and polymer physics simulations that epigenetic information can be used to predict the structural ensembles of multiple human cell lines. Theory predicts that chromosome structures are fluid and can only be described by an ensemble, which is consistent with the observation that chromosomes exhibit no unique fold. Nevertheless, our analysis of both structures from simulation and microscopy reveals that short segments of chromatin make two-state transitions between closed conformations and open dumbbell conformations. Finally, we study the conformational changes associated with the switching of genomic compartments observed in human cell lines. The formation of genomic compartments resembles hydrophobic collapse in protein folding, with the aggregation of denser and predominantly inactive chromatin driving the positioning of active chromatin toward the surface of individual chromosomal territories.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: Adrenergic activation modulates the signal from the Reissner fiber to cerebrospinal fluid-contacting neurons during development</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/59469</link>
	<content:encoded>The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) contains an extracellular thread conserved in vertebrates, the Reissner fiber, which controls body axis morphogenesis in the zebrafish embryo. Yet, the signaling cascade originating from this fiber to ensure body axis straightening is not understood. Here, we explore the functional link between the Reissner fiber and undifferentiated spinal neurons contacting the CSF (CSF-cNs). First, we show that the Reissner fiber is required in vivo for the expression of urp2, a neuropeptide expressed in CSF-cNs. We show that the Reissner fiber is also required for embryonic calcium transients in these spinal neurons. Finally, we study how local adrenergic activation can substitute for the Reissner fiber-signaling pathway to CSF-cNs and rescue body axis morphogenesis. Our results show that the Reissner fiber acts on CSF-cNs and thereby contributes to establish body axis morphogenesis, and suggest it does so by controlling the availability of a chemical signal in the CSF.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: Extended field-of-view ultrathin microendoscopes for high-resolution two-photon imaging with minimal invasiveness</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/58882</link>
	<content:encoded>Imaging neuronal activity with high and homogeneous spatial resolution across the field-of-view (FOV) and limited invasiveness in deep brain regions is fundamental for the progress of neuroscience, yet is a major technical challenge. We achieved this goal by correcting optical aberrations in gradient index lens-based ultrathin (≤ 500 µm) microendoscopes using aspheric microlenses generated through 3D-microprinting. Corrected microendoscopes had extended FOV (&lt;i&gt;eFOV&lt;/i&gt;) with homogeneous spatial resolution for two-photon fluorescence imaging and required no modification of the optical set-up. Synthetic calcium imaging data showed that, compared to uncorrected endoscopes, &lt;i&gt;eFOV&lt;/i&gt;-microendoscopes led to improved signal-to-noise ratio and more precise evaluation of correlated neuronal activity. We experimentally validated these predictions in awake head-fixed mice. Moreover, using &lt;i&gt;eFOV-&lt;/i&gt;microendoscopes we demonstrated cell-specific encoding of behavioral state-dependent information in distributed functional subnetworks in a primary somatosensory thalamic nucleus. &lt;i&gt;eFOV-&lt;/i&gt;microendoscopes are, therefore, small-cross-section ready-to-use tools for deep two-photon functional imaging with unprecedentedly high and homogeneous spatial resolution.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: Predicting the effect of statins on cancer risk using genetic variants from a Mendelian randomization study in the UK Biobank</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/57191</link>
	<content:encoded>Laboratory studies have suggested oncogenic roles of lipids, as well as anticarcinogenic effects of statins. Here we assess the potential effect of statin therapy on cancer risk using evidence from human genetics. We obtained associations of lipid-related genetic variants with the risk of overall and 22 site-specific cancers for 367,703 individuals in the UK Biobank. In total, 75,037 individuals had a cancer event. Variants in the &lt;i&gt;HMGCR&lt;/i&gt; gene region, which represent proxies for statin treatment, were associated with overall cancer risk (odds ratio [OR] per one standard deviation decrease in low-density lipoprotein [LDL] cholesterol 0.76, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.65–0.88, p=0.0003) but variants in gene regions representing alternative lipid-lowering treatment targets (&lt;i&gt;PCSK9&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;LDLR&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;NPC1L1&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;APOC3&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;LPL&lt;/i&gt;) were not. Genetically predicted LDL-cholesterol was not associated with overall cancer risk (OR per standard deviation increase 1.01, 95% CI 0.98–1.05, p=0.50). Our results predict that statins reduce cancer risk but other lipid-lowering treatments do not. This suggests that statins reduce cancer risk through a cholesterol independent pathway.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: PRDM9 activity depends on HELLS and promotes local 5-hydroxymethylcytosine enrichment</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/57117</link>
	<content:encoded>Meiotic recombination starts with the formation of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) at specific genomic locations that correspond to PRDM9 binding sites. The molecular steps occurring from PRDM9 binding to DSB formation are unknown. Using proteomic approaches to find PRDM9 partners, we identified HELLS, a member of the SNF2-like family of chromatin remodelers. Upon functional analyses during mouse male meiosis, we demonstrated that HELLS is required for PRDM9 binding and DSB activity at PRDM9 sites. However, HELLS is not required for DSB activity at PRDM9-independent sites. HELLS is also essential for 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) enrichment at PRDM9 sites. Analyses of 5hmC in mice deficient for SPO11, which catalyzes DSB formation, and in PRDM9 methyltransferase deficient mice reveal that 5hmC is triggered at DSB-prone sites upon PRDM9 binding and histone modification, but independent of DSB activity. These findings highlight the complex regulation of the chromatin and epigenetic environments at PRDM9-specified hotspots.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: Cytotoxic T Cells swarm by homotypic chemokine signalling</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/56554</link>
	<content:encoded>Cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) are thought to arrive at target sites either via random search or following signals by other leukocytes. Here, we reveal independent emergent behaviour in CTL populations attacking tumour masses. Primary murine CTLs coordinate their migration in a process reminiscent of the swarming observed in neutrophils. CTLs engaging cognate targets accelerate the recruitment of distant T cells through long-range homotypic signalling, in part mediated via the diffusion of chemokines CCL3 and CCL4. Newly arriving CTLs augment the chemotactic signal, further accelerating mass recruitment in a positive feedback loop. Activated effector human T cells and chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells similarly employ intra-population signalling to drive rapid convergence. Thus, CTLs recognising a cognate target can induce a localised mass response by amplifying the direct recruitment of additional T cells independently of other leukocytes.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: Dopaminergic and opioidergic regulation during anticipation and consumption of social and nonsocial rewards</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/55797</link>
	<content:encoded>The observation of animal orofacial and behavioral reactions has played a fundamental role in research on reward but is seldom assessed in humans. Healthy volunteers (N = 131) received 400 mg of the dopaminergic antagonist amisulpride, 50 mg of the opioidergic antagonist naltrexone, or placebo. Subjective ratings, physical effort, and facial reactions to matched primary social (affective touch) and nonsocial (food) rewards were assessed. Both drugs resulted in lower physical effort and greater negative facial reactions during reward anticipation, especially of food rewards. Only opioidergic manipulation through naltrexone led to a reduction in positive facial reactions to liked rewards during reward consumption. Subjective ratings of wanting and liking were not modulated by either drug. Results suggest that facial reactions during anticipated and experienced pleasure rely on partly different neurochemical systems, and also that the neurochemical bases for food and touch rewards are not identical.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.13.337378v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Speech understanding in noisy situations is compromised in old age. This study investigated the energetic and informational masking components of multi-talker babble noise and their influence on neural tracking of the speech envelope in a sample of healthy older adults. Twenty-three older adults (age range 65 - 80 years) listened to an audiobook embedded in noise while their electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded. Energetic masking was manipulated by varying the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) between target speech and background talkers and informational masking was manipulated by varying the number of background talkers. Neural envelope tracking was measured by calculating temporal response functions (TRFs) between speech envelope and EEG. Number of background talkers, but not SNR modulated the amplitude of an earlier (around 50 ms time lag) and a later (around 300 ms time lag) peak in the TRFs. Selective attention, but not working memory or peripheral hearing additionally modulated the amplitude of the later TRF peak. Finally, amplitude of the later TRF peak was positively related to accuracy in the comprehension task. The results suggest that stronger envelope tracking is beneficial for speech-in-noise understanding and that selective attention is an important ability supporting speech-in-noise understanding in multi-talker scenes.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Disinhibitory and neuromodulatory regulation of hippocampal synaptic plasticity</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.13.337188v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Hippocampal synaptic plasticity, particularly in the Schaffer collateral (SC) to CA1 pyramidal excitatory transmission, is considered as the cellular mechanism underlying learning. The CA1 pyramidal neurons are embedded in an intricate local circuitry that contains a variety of interneurons. The roles these interneurons play in the regulation of the excitatory synaptic plasticity remains largely understudied. Our recent experiments showed that repeated cholinergic activation of 7 nACh receptors expressed in oriens-lacunosum-moleculare (OLM2) interneurons could induce LTP in SC-CA1 synapses, likely through disinhibition by inhibiting stratum radiatum (s.r.) interneurons that provide feedforward inhibition onto CA1 pyramidal neurons, revealing a potential mechanism for local interneurons to regulate SC-CA1 synaptic plasticity. Here, we pair in vitro studies with biophysically-based modeling to uncover the mechanisms through which cholinergic-activated GABAergic interneurons can disinhibit CA1 pyramidal cells, and how repeated disinhibition modulates hippocampal plasticity at the excitatory synapses. We found that 7 nAChR activation increases OLM activity. OLM neurons, in turn inhibit the fast-spiking interneurons that provide feedforward inhibition onto CA1 pyramidal neurons. This disinhibition, paired with tightly timed SC stimulation, can induce potentiation at the excitatory synapses of CA1 pyramidal neurons. Our work further describes the pairing of disinhibition with SC stimulation as a general mechanism for the induction of hippocampal synaptic plasticity. Disinhibition of the excitatory synapses, paired with SC stimulation, leads to increased NMDAR activation and intracellular calcium concentration sufficient to upregulate AMPAR permeability and potentiate the synapse. Repeated paired disinhibition of the excitatory synapse leads to larger and longer lasting increases of the AMPAR permeability. Our study thus provides a novel mechanism for inhibitory interneurons to directly modify glutamatergic synaptic plasticity. In particular, we show how cholinergic action on OLM interneurons can down-regulate the GABAergic signaling onto CA1 pyramidal cells, and how this shapes local plasticity rules. We identify paired disinhibition with SC stimulation as a general mechanism for the induction of hippocampal synaptic plasticity.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Huntington's disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disease characterized by a late clinical onset of psychiatric, cognitive, and motor symptoms. Transcriptional dysregulation is an early and central disease mechanism which is accompanied by epigenetic alterations in HD. Previous studies demonstrated that targeting transcriptional changes by inhibition of histone deacetylases (HDACs), especially the class I HDACs, provides therapeutic effects. Yet, their exact mechanisms of action and the features of HD pathology, on which these inhibitors act remain to be elucidated. Here, using transcriptional profiling, we found that selective inhibition of HDAC1 and HDAC3 by RGFP109 repaired the expression of a number of genes, including the transcription factor genes Neurod2 and Nr4a2, and 43% of the gene sets that were dysregulated by mutant Huntingtin expression in the striatum and improved motor skill learning deficit in the R6/1 mouse model of HD. RGFP109-treated R6/1 mice showed improved coordination on the RotaRod over four consecutive trials, while vehicle-treated R6/1 animals displayed no improvement in coordination skills and fell 50 seconds earlier off the rod in the fourth trial. We also found, by volumetric MRI, a widespread brain atrophy in the R6/1 mice at the symptomatic disease stage, on which RGFP109 showed a modest effect. Collectively, our combined work presents new evidence for specific HDAC1 and HDAC3 inhibition as a therapeutic strategy for alleviating the phenotypic and molecular features of HD.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Do auditory mismatch responses differ between acoustic features?</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.13.337006v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Mismatch negativity (MMN) is the electroencephalographic (EEG) waveform obtained by subtracting event-related potential (ERP) responses evoked by unexpected deviant stimuli from responses evoked by expected standard stimuli. While the MMN is thought to reflect an unexpected change in an ongoing, predictable stimulus, it is unknown whether MMN responses evoked by changes in different stimulus features have different magnitudes, latencies, and topographies. The present study aimed to investigate whether MMN responses differ depending on whether sudden stimulus change occur in pitch, duration, location or vowel identity respectively. To calculate ERPs to standard and deviant stimuli, EEG signals were recorded in normal-hearing participants (N=20; 13 males, 7 females) who listened to roving oddball sequences of artificial syllables. In the roving paradigm, any given stimulus is repeated several times to form a standard, and then suddenly replaced with a deviant stimulus which differs from the standard. Here, deviants differed from preceding standards along one of four features (pitch, duration, vowel or interaural level difference). The feature levels were individually chosen to match behavioral discrimination performance. We identified neural activity evoked by unexpected violations along all four acoustic dimensions. Evoked responses to deviant stimuli increased in amplitude relative to the responses to standard stimuli. A univariate (channel-by-channel) analysis yielded no significant differences between MMN responses following violations of different features. However, in a multivariate analysis (pooling information from multiple EEG channels), acoustic features could be decoded from the topography of mismatch responses, although at later latencies than those typical for MMN. These results support the notion that deviant feature detection may be subserved by a different process than general mismatch detection.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Generalized paradoxical effects in excitatory/inhibitory networks</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.13.336727v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>An inhibition-stabilized network (ISN) is a network of excitatory and inhibitory cells at a stable fixed point of firing rates for a given input, for which the excitatory subnetwork would be unstable if inhibitory rates were frozen at their fixed point values. It has been shown that in a low-dimensional model (one unit per neuronal subtype) of an ISN with a single excitatory and single inhibitory cell type, the inhibitory unit shows a &quot;paradoxical&quot; response, lowering (raising) its steady-state firing rate in response to addition to it of excitatory (inhibitory) input. This has been generalized to an ISN with multiple inhibitory cell types: if input is given only to inhibitory cells, the steady-state inhibition received by excitatory cells changes paradoxically, that is, it decreases (increases) if the steady-state excitatory firing rates decrease (increase). We generalize these analyses of paradoxical effects to low-dimensional networks with multiple cell types of both excitatory and inhibitory neurons. The analysis depends on the connectivity matrix of the network linearized about a given fixed point, and its eigenvectors or &quot;modes&quot;. We show the following: (1) A given cell type shows a paradoxical change in steady-state rate in response to input it receives, if and only if the network with that cell type omitted has an odd number of unstable modes. Excitatory neurons can show paradoxical responses when there are two or more inhibitory subtypes. (2) More generally, if the cell types are divided into two nonoverlapping subsets A and B, then subset B has an odd (even) number of modes that show paradoxical response if and only if subset A has an odd (even) number of unstable modes. (3) The net steady-state inhibition received by any unstable mode of the excitatory subnetwork will change paradoxically, i.e. in the same direction as the change in amplitude of that mode. In particular, this means that a sufficient condition to determine that a network is an ISN is if, in response to an input only to inhibitory cells, the firing rates of and inhibition received by all excitatory cell types all change in the same direction. This in turn will be true if all E cells and all inhibitory cell types that connect to E cells change their firing rates in the same direction.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Reliability and sensitivity of two whole-brain segmentation approaches included in FreeSurfer - ASEG and SAMSEG</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.13.335737v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>An accurate and reliable whole-brain segmentation is a key aspect of longitudinal neuroimaging studies. The ability to measure structural changes reliably is fundamental to detect confidently biological effects, especially when these affects are small. In this work, we undertake a thorough comparative analysis of reliability, bias, sensitivity to detect longitudinal change and diagnostic sensitivity to Alzheimer's disease of two subcortical segmentation methods, Automatic Segmentation (ASEG) and Sequence Adaptive Multimodal Segmentation (SAMSEG). These are provided by the recently released version 7.1 of the open-source neuroimaging package FreeSurfer, with ASEG being the default segmentation method. First, we use a large sample of participants (n = 1629) distributed across the lifespan (age range = 4-93 years) to assess the within-session test-retest reliability in eight bilateral subcortical structures: amygdala, caudate, hippocampus, lateral ventricles, nucleus accumbens, pallidum, putamen and thalamus. We performed the analyses separately for a sub-sample scanned on a 1.5T Siemens Avanto (n = 774) and a sub-sample scanned on a 3T Siemens Skyra (n = 855). The absolute symmetrized percent differences across the lifespan indicated relatively constant reliability trajectories across age except for the younger children in the Avanto dataset for ASEG. Although both methods showed high reliability (ICC &amp;gt; 0.95), SAMSEG yielded significantly lower volumetric differences between repeated measures for all subcortical segmentations (p &amp;lt; 0.05) and higher spatial overlap in all structures except putamen, which had significantly higher spatial overlap for ASEG. Second, we tested how well each method was able to detect neuroanatomic volumetric change using longitudinal follow up scans (n = 491 for Avanto and n = 245 for Skyra; interscan interval = 1-10 years). Both methods showed excellent ability to detect longitudinal change, but yielded age-trajectories with notable differences for most structures, including the hippocampus and the amygdala. For instance, ASEG hippocampal volumes showed a steady age-decline from subjects in their twenties, while SAMSEG hippocampal volumes were stable until their sixties. Finally, we tested sensitivity of each method to clinically relevant change. We compared annual rate of hippocampal atrophy in a group of cognitively normal older adults (n = 20), patients with mild cognitive impairment (n = 20) and patients with Alzheimer's disease (n = 20). SAMSEG was more sensitive to detect differences in atrophy between the groups, demonstrating ability to detect clinically relevant longitudinal changes. Both ASEG and SAMSEG were reliable and led to detection of within-person longitudinal change. However, SAMSEG yielded more consistent measurements between repeated scans without a lack of sensitivity to changes.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.12.336941v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Elevation of serotonin via postnatal fluoxetine (PNFlx) treatment during critical temporal windows is hypothesized to perturb the development of limbic circuits thus establishing a substratum for persistent disruption of mood-related behavior. We examined the impact of PNFlx treatment on the formation and maintenance of perineuronal nets (PNNs), extracellular matrix (ECM) structures that deposit primarily around inhibitory interneurons, and mark the closure of critical period plasticity. PNFlx treatment evoked a significant decline in PNN number, with a robust reduction in PNNs deposited around parvalbumin (PV) interneurons, within the CA1 and CA3 hippocampal subfields at postnatal day 21 in Sprague-Dawley rat pups. While the reduction in CA1 subfield PNN number was still observed in adulthood, we observed no change in colocalization of PV-positive interneurons with PNNs in the hippocampi of adult PNFlx animals. PNFlx treatment did not alter hippocampal parvalbumin, calretinin, or reelin-positive neuron numbers in PNFlx animals at P21 or in adulthood. We did observe a small, but significant increase in somatostatin (SST)-positive interneurons in the DG subfield of PNFlx-treated animals in adulthood. This was accompanied by altered GABA-A receptor subunit composition, increased dendritic complexity of apical dendrites of CA1 pyramidal neurons, and enhanced neuronal activation revealed by increased c-Fos-positive cell numbers within hippocampi of PNFlx-treated animals in adulthood. These results indicate that PNFlx treatment alters the developmental trajectory of PNNs within the hippocampus, raising the possibility of a disruption of critical period plasticity and the establishment of an altered excitation-inhibition balance within this key limbic brain region.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: A class of synaptic signaling molecules required for homeostatic potentiation also tunes homeostatic depression</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.12.336883v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Synapses and circuits rely on homeostatic forms of regulation in order to transmit meaningful information. The Drosophila melanogaster neuromuscular junction (NMJ) is a well-studied synapse that shows robust homeostatic control of function. Most prior studies of homeostatic plasticity at the NMJ have centered on presynaptic homeostatic potentiation (PHP). PHP happens when postsynaptic muscle neurotransmitter receptors are impaired, triggering retrograde signaling that causes an increase in presynaptic neurotransmitter release. As a result, normal levels of evoked excitation are maintained. The counterpart to PHP at the NMJ is presynaptic homeostatic depression (PHD). Overexpression of the Drosophila vesicular glutamate transporter (VGlut) causes an increase in the amplitude of spontaneous events. PHD happens when the synapse responds to the challenge by decreasing quantal content during evoked neurotransmission, again, resulting in normal levels of postsynaptic excitation. We hypothesized that there may exist a class of molecules that affects both PHP and PHD. Impairment of any such molecule could hurt the ability of a synapse to respond to any significant homeostatic challenge. We conducted an electrophysiology-based screen for blocks of PHD. While we did not observe a block of PHD in the genetic conditions screened, we instead found loss-of-function conditions that led to excess depression, i.e., a substantial deficit in evoked amplitude when combined with VGlut overexpression. The conditions causing this phenotype included a double heterozygous loss-of-function condition for genes encoding the inositol trisphosphate receptor (IP3R, itpr) and ryanodine receptor (RyR). IP3Rs and RyRs gate calcium release from intracellular stores. Pharmacological agents targeting IP3R and RyR recapitulated the genetic losses of these factors, as did lowering calcium levels from other sources. Our data are consistent with the idea that some factors required for homeostatic potentiation are also required for the synapse to achieve appropriate levels of homeostatic depression. Loss of such factors may disorient compensatory plasticity signals.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: SEX DIFFERENCES IN μ-OPIOID REGULATION OF COERULEAR-CORTICAL TRANSMISSION</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.12.336552v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Stress-induced activation of locus coeruleus (LC)-norepinephrine (NE) projections to the prefrontal cortex is thought to promote cognitive responses to stressors. LC activation by stressors is modulated by endogenous opioids that serve to restrain LC activation and to facilitate a return to baseline activity upon stress termination. Sex differences in this opioid influence could be a basis for sex differences in stress vulnerability. Consistent with this, we recently demonstrated that -opioid receptor (MOR) expression is decreased in the female rat LC compared to the male LC and this was associated with sexually distinct consequences of activating MOR in the LC on cognitive flexibility. Given that the LC-NE system affects cognitive flexibility through its projections to the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), the present study quantified and compared the effects of LC-MOR activation on mPFC neural activity in male and female rats. Local field potential (LFPs) were recorded from the mPFC of freely behaving male and female rats before and following local LC microinjection of the MOR agonist, DAMGO or vehicle. Intra-LC DAMGO altered the LFP power spectrum selectively in male, but not female rats, resulting in a time-dependent increase in the power in delta and alpha frequency bands. LC microinfusion of ACSF had no effect in either sex. Together, the results are consistent with previous evidence for decreased MOR function in the female rat LC and demonstrate that this translates to a diminished effect on cortical activity that can account for sex differences in cognitive consequences. Decreased LC-MOR function in females could contribute to greater stress-induced activation of the LC, and increased vulnerability of females to hyperarousal symptoms of stress-related neuropsychiatric pathologies.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv: Neuroscience: Validating Dynamicity in Resting State fMRI with Activation-Informed Temporal Segmentation</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.12.335976v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Confirming the presence (or absence) of dynamic functional connectivity (dFC) states during rest is an important open question in the field of cognitive neuroscience. Traditional dFC frameworks aim to identify dynamics directly from connectivity estimates with a sliding window approach, however this method suffers from several drawbacks including sensitivity to window size and poor test-retest reliability. We hypothesize that time-varying changes in functional connectivity are mirrored by significant temporal changes in functional activation, and that this coupling can be leveraged to study dFC without the need for a predefined sliding window. Here we introduce a novel data-driven dFC framework, which involves informed segmentation of fMRI time series at candidate FC state transition points estimated from changes in whole-brain functional activation, rather than a fixed-length sliding window. We show our approach reliably identifies true cognitive state change points when applied on block-design working memory task data and outperforms the standard sliding window approach in accurately separating connectivity matrices from task and rest blocks in this context. When applied to data from four resting state fMRI scanning sessions, our method consistently recovers five reliable FC states, and subject-specific features derived from these states show significant correlation with behavioral phenotypes of interest (cognitive ability, personality). Overall, these results suggest abrupt whole-brain changes in activation can be used as a marker for changes in connectivity states, and provides strong evidence for the existence of time-varying FC in rest.</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: The synergy of damage repair and retention promotes rejuvenation and prolongs healthy lifespans in cell lineages</title>

Damaged proteins are inherited asymmetrically during cell division in the yeast &lt;i&gt;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&lt;/i&gt;, such that most damage is retained within the mother cell. The consequence is an ageing mother and a rejuvenated daughter cell with full replicative potential. Daughters of old and damaged mothers are however born with increasing levels of damage resulting in lowered replicative lifespans. Remarkably, these prematurely old daughters can give rise to rejuvenated cells with low damage levels and recovered lifespans, called second-degree rejuvenation. We aimed to investigate how damage repair and retention together can promote rejuvenation and at the same time ensure low damage levels in mother cells, reflected in longer health spans. We developed a dynamic model for damage accumulation over successive divisions in individual cells as part of a dynamically growing cell lineage. With detailed knowledge about single-cell dynamics and relationships between all cells in the lineage, we can infer how individual damage repair and retention strategies affect the propagation of damage in the population. We show that damage retention lowers damage levels in the population by reducing the variability across the lineage, and results in larger population sizes. Repairing damage efficiently in early life, as opposed to investing in repair when damage has already accumulated, counteracts accelerated ageing caused by damage retention. It prolongs the health span of individual cells which are moreover less prone to stress. In combination, damage retention and early investment in repair are beneficial for healthy ageing in yeast cell populations.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/mXRoa-zjcos&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Time varying methods to infer extremes in dengue transmission dynamics</title>

Dengue is an arbovirus affecting global populations. Frequent outbreaks occur, especially in equatorial cities such as Singapore, where year-round tropical climate, large daily influx of travelers and population density provide the ideal conditions for dengue to transmit. Little work has, however, quantified the peaks of dengue outbreaks, when health systems are likely to be most stretched. Nor have methods been developed to infer differences in exogenous factors which lead to the rise and fall of dengue case counts across extreme and non-extreme periods. In this paper, we developed time varying extreme mixture (tvEM) methods to account for the temporal dependence of dengue case counts across extreme and non-extreme periods. This approach permits inference of differences in climatic forcing across non-extreme and extreme periods of dengue case counts, quantification of their temporal dependence as well as estimation of thresholds with associated uncertainties to determine dengue case count extremities. Using tvEM, we found no evidence that weather affects dengue case counts in the near term for non-extreme periods, but that it has non-linear and mixed signals in influencing dengue through tvEM parameters in the extreme periods. Using the most appropriate tvEM specification, we found that a threshold at the 70&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; (95% credible interval 41.1, 83.8) quantile is optimal, with extreme events of 526.6, 1052.2 and 1183.6 weekly case counts expected at return periods of 5, 50 and 75 years. Weather parameters at a 1% scaled increase was found to decrease the long-run expected case counts, but larger increases would lead to a drastic expected rise from the baseline correspondingly. The tvEM approach can provide valuable inference on the extremes of time series, which in the case of infectious disease notifications, allows public health officials to understand the likely scale of outbreaks in the long run.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/I3cXdvxQa64&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

We show how highly-diverse ecological communities may display persistent abundance fluctuations, when interacting through resource competition and subjected to migration from a species pool. These fluctuations appear, robustly and predictably, in certain regimes of parameter space. Their origin is closely tied to the ratio of realized species diversity to the number of resources. This ratio is set by competition, through the balance between species being pushed out and invading. When this ratio is smaller than one, dynamics will reach stable equilibria. When this ratio is larger than one, the competitive exclusion principle dictates that fixed-points are either unstable or marginally stable. If they are unstable, the system is repelled from fixed points, and abundances forever fluctuate. While marginally-stable fixed points are in principle allowed and predicted by some models, they become structurally unstable at high diversity. This means that even small changes to the model, such as non-linearities in how resources combine to generate species’ growth, will result in persistent abundance fluctuations.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/-YwQ_ZWKQz0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Learning in neuronal networks has developed in many directions, in particular to reproduce cognitive tasks like image recognition and speech processing. Implementations have been inspired by stereotypical neuronal responses like tuning curves in the visual system, where, for example, ON/OFF cells fire or not depending on the contrast in their receptive fields. Classical models of neuronal networks therefore map a set of input signals to a set of activity levels in the output of the network. Each category of inputs is thereby predominantly characterized by its mean. In the case of time series, fluctuations around this mean constitute noise in this view. For this paradigm, the high variability exhibited by the cortical activity may thus imply limitations or constraints, which have been discussed for many years. For example, the need for averaging neuronal activity over long periods or large groups of cells to assess a robust mean and to diminish the effect of noise correlations. To reconcile robust computations with variable neuronal activity, we here propose a conceptual change of perspective by employing variability of activity as the basis for stimulus-related information to be learned by neurons, rather than merely being the noise that corrupts the mean signal. In this new paradigm both afferent and recurrent weights in a network are tuned to shape the input-output mapping for covariances, the second-order statistics of the fluctuating activity. When including time lags, covariance patterns define a natural metric for time series that capture their propagating nature. We develop the theory for classification of time series based on their spatio-temporal covariances, which reflect dynamical properties. We demonstrate that recurrent connectivity is able to transform information contained in the temporal structure of the signal into spatial covariances. Finally, we use the MNIST database to show how the covariance perceptron can capture specific second-order statistical patterns generated by moving digits.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/S4krP42eumQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Coalescent theory combined with statistical modeling allows us to estimate effective population size fluctuations from molecular sequences of individuals sampled from a population of interest. When sequences are sampled serially through time and the distribution of the sampling times depends on the effective population size, explicit statistical modeling of sampling times improves population size estimation. Previous work assumed that the genealogy relating sampled sequences is known and modeled sampling times as an inhomogeneous Poisson process with log-intensity equal to a linear function of the log-transformed effective population size. We improve this approach in two ways. First, we extend the method to allow for joint Bayesian estimation of the genealogy, effective population size trajectory, and other model parameters. Next, we improve the sampling time model by incorporating additional sources of information in the form of time-varying covariates. We validate our new modeling framework using a simulation study and apply our new methodology to analyses of population dynamics of seasonal influenza and to the recent Ebola virus outbreak in West Africa.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/XIZaWF6dlYo&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Emerging infectious diseases (EIDs) of plants continue to devastate ecosystems and livelihoods worldwide. Effective management requires surveillance to detect epidemics at an early stage. However, despite the increasing use of risk-based surveillance programs in plant health, it remains unclear how best to target surveillance resources to achieve this. We combine a spatially explicit model of pathogen entry and spread with a statistical model of detection and use a stochastic optimisation routine to identify which arrangement of surveillance sites maximises the probability of detecting an invading epidemic. Our approach reveals that it is not always optimal to target the highest-risk sites and that the optimal strategy differs depending on not only patterns of pathogen entry and spread but also the choice of detection method. That is, we find that spatial correlation in risk can make it suboptimal to focus solely on the highest-risk sites, meaning that it is best to avoid ‘putting all your eggs in one basket’. However, this depends on an interplay with other factors, such as the sensitivity of available detection methods. Using the economically important arboreal disease huanglongbing (HLB), we demonstrate how our approach leads to a significant performance gain and cost saving in comparison with conventional methods to targeted surveillance.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/dZ_K3scbbW8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Biology: Pharmacological evidence for the implication of noradrenaline in effort</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~3/y7pI-Dljj44/article</link>

The trade-off between effort and reward is one of the main determinants of behavior, and its alteration is at the heart of major disorders such as depression or Parkinson’s disease. Monoaminergic neuromodulators are thought to play a key role in this trade-off, but their relative contribution remains unclear. Rhesus monkeys (&lt;i&gt;Macaca mulatta&lt;/i&gt;) performed a choice task requiring a trade-off between the volume of fluid reward and the amount of force to be exerted on a grip. In line with a causal role of noradrenaline in effort, decreasing noradrenaline levels with systemic clonidine injections (0.01 mg/kg) decreased exerted force and enhanced the weight of upcoming force on choices, without any effect on reward sensitivity. Using computational modeling, we showed that a single variable (“effort”) could capture the amount of resources necessary for action and control both choices (as a variable for decision) and force production (as a driving force). Critically, the multiple effects of noradrenaline manipulation on behavior could be captured by a specific modulation of this single variable. Thus, our data strongly support noradrenaline’s implication in effort processing.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/y7pI-Dljj44&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

&lt;p&gt;Sex‐specific role of dopamine D1 and D2 receptors in cocaine effects on adult neurogenesis has been studied. Results indicate that: 1) Cocaine hyperactivity decreases neurogenesis (males) or neuronal maturity (females), and correlates with BDNF. 2) Cocaine does not increase hyperactivity in D1ko females, but increases neuronal maturity and BDNF. 3) Cocaine increases hypoactivity in D2ko males, and increases neurogenesis and BDNF in D2ko females. 4) SCH23390 reduces cocaine hyperactivity, and correlates with BDNF. 5) Raclopride increases cocaine hyperactivity in females, and neurogenesis and BDNF in both sexes. Sex‐specific D1 and D2 signaling on proliferation and neuronal maturity is differentially perturbed by cocaine, and BDNF may contribute to D2 neuroplasticity in cocaine addiction.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adult neurogenesis in rodents is modulated by dopaminergic signaling and inhibited by cocaine. However, the sex‐specific role of dopamine D1 and D2 receptors (D1R, D2R) in the deleterious effect of cocaine on adult neurogenesis has not been described yet. Here, we explored sex differences in a) cell proliferation (BrdU), b) neural precursor (nestin), c) neuronal phenotype (BrdU/β3‐tubulin), and d) neuronal maturity (NeuN) in the subventricular zone (SVZ) of the lateral ventricles and striatum of mice with genetic deletion (D1&lt;sup&gt;‐/‐&lt;/sup&gt;, D2&lt;sup&gt;‐/‐&lt;/sup&gt;) or pharmacological blockage (SCH23390: 0.1 mg/kg/day/5 days; Raclopride: 0.3 mg/kg/day/5 days) of D1R and D2R, and treated (10 mg/kg/day/5 days) and then challenged (5 mg/kg, 48 h later) with cocaine. Results indicated that hyperactivity responses to cocaine were absent in D1&lt;sup&gt;‐/‐&lt;/sup&gt; mice and reduced in SCH23390‐treated mice. Activity responses to cocaine were reduced in D2&lt;sup&gt;‐/‐&lt;/sup&gt; males, but absent in D2&lt;sup&gt;‐/‐&lt;/sup&gt; females and increased in Raclopride‐treated females. D1R deletion blocked the deleterious effect of cocaine on SVZ cell proliferation in males. Cocaine‐exposed D1&lt;sup&gt;‐/‐&lt;/sup&gt; males also had reduced neuronal phenotype of SVZ newborn cells and increased striatal neuronal maturity. D2&lt;sup&gt;‐/‐&lt;/sup&gt; mice had lower proliferative and neural precursor responses. Cocaine in D2&lt;sup&gt;‐/‐&lt;/sup&gt; females or co‐administered with Raclopride in WT females improved SVZ cell proliferation, an effect that positively correlated with plasma brain‐derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) concentrations. In conclusion, the sex‐specific D1R and D2R signaling on SVZ cell proliferation, neural progenitor and neuronal maturity is differentially perturbed by cocaine, and BDNF may be required to link D2R to neuroplasticity in cocaine addiction in females.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Effects of Sleep Deprivation on Working Memory: Change in Functional Connectivity Between the Dorsal Attention, Default Mode, and Fronto-Parietal Networks</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00360</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Sleep deprivation (SD) is very common in modern society and has a profound effect on cognitive function, in particular on working memory (WM). This type of memory is required for completion of many tasks and is adversely affected by SD. However, the cognitive neural mechanism by which SD affects WM, remains unclear. In this study, we investigated the changes in the brain network involved in WM after SD. Twenty-two healthy subjects underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging scan while in a state of resting wakefulness and again after 36 h of total SD and performed a WM task before each scanning session. Nineteen main nodes of the default mode network (DMN), dorsal attention network (DAN), fronto-parietal network (FPN), salience network (SN), and other networks were selected for functional analysis of brain network connections. Functional connectivity measures were computed between seed areas for region of interest (ROI)-to-ROI analysis and to identify patterns of ROI-to-ROI connectivity. The relationship between the significant changes in functional connectivity in the brain network and WM performance were then examined by Pearson’s correlation analysis. WM performance declined significantly after SD. Compared with the awake state, the functional connectivity between DAN and DMN significantly increased after SD while that between FPN and DMN significantly decreased. Correlation analysis showed that the enhanced functional connectivity between DAN and DMN was negatively correlated with the decline in WM performance and that the decline in functional connectivity between FPN and DMN was positively correlated with decreased WM performance. These findings suggested that SD may affect WM by altering the functional connectivity among DMN, DAN, and FPN.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>This study examined records of 2,566 consecutive COVID-19 patients at five Massachusetts hospitals and sought to predict level-of-care requirements based on clinical and laboratory data. Several classification methods were applied and compared against standard pneumonia severity scores. The need for hospitalization, ICU care, and mechanical ventilation were predicted with a validation accuracy of 88%, 87%, and 86%, respectively.ICU care and ventilation. When predictions are limited to patients with more complex disease, the accuracy of the ICU and ventilation prediction models achieved accuracy of 83% and 82%, respectively. Vital signs, age, BMI, dyspnea, and comorbidities were the most important predictors of hospitalization. Opacities on chest imaging, age, admission vital signs and symptoms, male gender, admission laboratory results, and diabetes were the most important risk factors for ICU admission and mechanical ventilation. The factors identified collectively form a signature of the novel COVID-19 disease.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: DMT alters cortical travelling waves</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/59784</link>
	<content:encoded>Psychedelic drugs are potent modulators of conscious states and therefore powerful tools for investigating their neurobiology. N,N, Dimethyltryptamine (DMT) can rapidly induce an extremely immersive state of consciousness characterized by vivid and elaborate visual imagery. Here, we investigated the electrophysiological correlates of the DMT induced altered state from a pool of participants receiving DMT and (separately) placebo (saline) while instructed to keep their eyes closed. Consistent with our hypotheses, results revealed a spatio-temporal pattern of cortical activation (i.e., travelling waves) similar to that elicited by visual stimulation. Moreover, the typical top-down alpha-band rhythms of closed-eyes rest were significantly decreased, while the bottom-up forward wave was significantly increased. These results support a recent model proposing that psychedelics reduce the 'precision-weighting of priors', thus altering the balance of top-down versus bottom-up information passing. The robust hypothesis-confirming nature of these findings imply the discovery of an important mechanistic principle underpinning psychedelic-induced altered states.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: Rapid purification and metabolomic profiling of synaptic vesicles from mammalian brain</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/59699</link>
	<content:encoded>Neurons communicate by the activity-dependent release of small-molecule neurotransmitters packaged into synaptic vesicles (SVs). Although many molecules have been identified as neurotransmitters, technical limitations have precluded a full metabolomic analysis of synaptic vesicle content. Here, we present a workflow to rapidly isolate SVs and to interrogate their metabolic contents at high-resolution using mass spectrometry. We validated the enrichment of glutamate in SVs of primary cortical neurons using targeted polar metabolomics. Unbiased and extensive global profiling of SVs isolated from these neurons revealed that the only detectable polar metabolites they contain are the established neurotransmitters glutamate and GABA. In addition, we adapted the approach to enable quick capture of SVs directly from brain tissue and determined the neurotransmitter profiles of diverse brain regions in a cell-type specific manner. The speed, robustness, and precision of this method to interrogate SV contents will facilitate novel insights into the chemical basis of neurotransmission.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/58990</link>
	<content:encoded>Tissue resident mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSCs) occupy perivascular spaces. Profiling human adipose perivascular mesenchyme with antibody arrays identified 16 novel surface antigens, including endolysosomal protein CD107a. Surface CD107a expression segregates MSCs into functionally distinct subsets. In culture, CD107a&lt;sup&gt;low&lt;/sup&gt; cells demonstrate high colony formation, osteoprogenitor cell frequency, and osteogenic potential. Conversely, CD107a&lt;sup&gt;high&lt;/sup&gt; cells include almost exclusively adipocyte progenitor cells. Accordingly, human CD107a&lt;sup&gt;low&lt;/sup&gt; cells drove dramatic bone formation after intramuscular transplantation in mice, and induced spine fusion in rats, whereas CD107a&lt;sup&gt;high&lt;/sup&gt; cells did not. CD107a protein trafficking to the cell surface is associated with exocytosis during early adipogenic differentiation. RNA sequencing also suggested that CD107a&lt;sup&gt;low&lt;/sup&gt; cells are precursors of CD107a&lt;sup&gt;high&lt;/sup&gt; cells. These results document the molecular and functional diversity of perivascular regenerative cells, and show that relocation to cell surface of a lysosomal protein marks the transition from osteo- to adipogenic potential in native human MSCs, a population of substantial therapeutic interest.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: Retinotectal circuitry of larval zebrafish is adapted to detection and pursuit of prey</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/58596</link>
	<content:encoded>Retinal axon projections form a map of the visual environment in the tectum. A zebrafish larva typically detects a prey object in its peripheral visual field. As it turns and swims towards the prey, the stimulus enters the central, binocular area, and seemingly expands in size. By volumetric calcium imaging, we show that posterior tectal neurons, which serve to detect prey at a distance, tend to respond to small objects and intrinsically compute their direction of movement. Neurons in anterior tectum, where the prey image is represented shortly before the capture strike, are tuned to larger object sizes and are frequently not direction-selective, indicating that mainly interocular comparisons serve to compute an object’s movement at close range. The tectal feature map originates from a linear combination of diverse, functionally specialized, lamina-specific, and topographically ordered retinal ganglion cell synaptic inputs. We conclude that local cell-type composition and connectivity across the tectum are adapted to the processing of location-dependent, behaviorally relevant object features.</content:encoded>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Neuroinflammation and Tau Colocalize in vivo in Progressive Supranuclear Palsy</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25911?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We examined the relationship between tau pathology and neuroinflammation using [&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;C]PK11195 and [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]AV‐1451 PET in 17 patients with progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) Richardson's syndrome. We tested the hypothesis that neuroinflammation and tau protein aggregation colocalize macroscopically, and correlate with clinical severity.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nondisplaceable binding potential (BP&lt;sub&gt;ND&lt;/sub&gt;) for each ligand was quantified in 83 regions of interest (ROIs). The [&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;C]PK11195 and [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]AV‐1451 BP&lt;sub&gt;ND&lt;/sub&gt; values were correlated across all regions. The spatial distributions of [&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;C]PK11195 and [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]AV‐1451 binding were determined by principal component analyses (PCAs), and the loading of each spatial component compared against the patients’ clinical severity (using the PSP rating scale).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regional [&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;C]PK11195 and [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]AV‐1451 binding were positively correlated (R = 0.577, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.0001). The PCA identified 4 components for each ligand, reflecting the relative expression of tau pathology or neuroinflammation in distinct groups of brain regions. Positive associations between [&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;C]PK11195 and [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]AV‐1451 components’ loadings were found in both subcortical (R = 0.769, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.0001) and cortical regions (R = 0.836, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.0001). There were positive correlations between clinical severity and both subcortical tau pathology (R = 0.667, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.003) and neuroinflammation (R = 0.788, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We show that tau pathology and neuroinflammation colocalize in PSP, and that individual differences in subcortical tau pathology and neuroinflammation are linked to clinical severity. Although longitudinal studies are needed to determine causal associations between these molecular pathologies, we suggest that the combination of tau‐ and immune‐oriented strategies may be useful for effective disease‐modifying treatments in PSP.

	<title>Hippocampus: Adult neurogenesis alters response to an aversive distractor in a labyrinth maze without affecting spatial learning or memory</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/hipo.23267?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adult neurogenesis has been implicated in learning and memory of complex spatial environments. However, new neurons also play a role in nonmnemonic behavior, including the stress response and attention shifting. Many commonly used spatial tasks are very simple, and unsuitable for detecting neurogenesis effects, or are aversively motivated, making it difficult to dissociate effects on spatial learning and memory from effects on stress. We have therefore created a novel complex spatial environment, the flex maze, to enable reward‐mediated testing of spatial learning in a flexibly configurable labyrinth. Using a pharmacogenetic method to completely inhibit neurogenesis in adulthood, we found that rats lacking new neurons (TK rats) and wild type controls completed and remembered most mazes equally well. However, control rats were slower to complete peppermint‐scented mazes than other mazes, while neurogenesis‐deficient rats showed no effect of mint on maze behavior, completing these mazes significantly faster than control rats. Additional testing found that wild type and TK rats showed similar detection of, avoidance of, and glucocorticoid response to the mint odor. These results suggest that spatial learning and memory in a labyrinth task is unaffected by the loss of new neurons, but that these cells affect the ability of an aversive stimulus to distract rats from completing the maze.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Hippocampus: Multi‐omics analysis suggests enhanced epileptogenesis in the Cornu Ammonis 3 of the pilocarpine model of mesial temporal lobe epilepsy</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/hipo.23268?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE) is a chronic neurological disorder characterized by the occurrence of seizures, and histopathological abnormalities in the mesial temporal lobe structures, mainly hippocampal sclerosis (HS). We used a multi‐omics approach to determine the profile of transcript and protein expression in the dorsal and ventral hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG) and &lt;i&gt;Cornu Ammonis&lt;/i&gt; 3 (CA3) in an animal model of MTLE induced by pilocarpine. We performed label‐free proteomics and RNAseq from laser‐microdissected tissue isolated from pilocarpine‐induced Wistar rats. We divided the DG and CA3 into dorsal and ventral areas and analyzed them separately. We performed a data integration analysis and evaluated enriched signaling pathways, as well as the integrated networks generated based on the gene ontology processes. Our results indicate differences in the transcriptomic and proteomic profiles among the DG and the CA3 subfields of the hippocampus. Moreover, our data suggest that epileptogenesis is enhanced in the CA3 region when compared to the DG, with most abnormalities in transcript and protein levels occurring in the CA3. Furthermore, our results show that the epileptogenesis in the pilocarpine model involves predominantly abnormal regulation of excitatory neuronal mechanisms mediated by N‐methyl D‐aspartate (NMDA) receptors, changes in the serotonin signaling, and neuronal activity controlled by calcium/calmodulin‐dependent protein kinase (CaMK) regulation and leucine‐rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2)/WNT signaling pathways.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Keratinocytes Communicate with Sensory Neurons via Synaptic‐like Contacts</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25912?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pain, temperature, and itch are conventionally thought to be exclusively transduced by the intraepidermal nerve endings. Although recent studies have shown that epidermal keratinocytes also participate in sensory transduction, the mechanism underlying keratinocyte communication with intraepidermal nerve endings remains poorly understood. We sought to demonstrate the synaptic character of the contacts between keratinocytes and sensory neurons and their involvement in sensory communication between keratinocytes and sensory neurons.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contacts were explored by morphological, molecular, and functional approaches in cocultures of epidermal keratinocytes and sensory neurons. To interrogate whether structures observed &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; were also present in the human epidermis, &lt;i&gt;in situ&lt;/i&gt; correlative light electron microscopy was performed on human skin biopsies.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Epidermal keratinocytes dialogue with sensory neurons through en passant synaptic‐like contacts. These contacts have the ultrastructural features and molecular hallmarks of chemical synaptic‐like contacts: narrow intercellular cleft, keratinocyte synaptic vesicles expressing synaptophysin and synaptotagmin 1, and sensory information transmitted from keratinocytes to sensory neurons through SNARE‐mediated (syntaxin1) vesicle release.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By providing selective communication between keratinocytes and sensory neurons, synaptic‐like contacts are the hubs of a 2‐site receptor. The permanent epidermal turnover, implying a specific &lt;i&gt;en passant&lt;/i&gt; structure and high plasticity, may have delayed their identification, thereby contributing to the long‐held concept of nerve endings passing freely between keratinocytes. The discovery of keratinocyte–sensory neuron synaptic‐like contacts may call for a reassessment of basic assumptions in cutaneous sensory perception and sheds new light on the pathophysiology of pain and itch as well as the physiology of touch.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Circulating Lipoprotein Lipids, Apolipoproteins and Ischemic Stroke</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25916?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We conducted a Mendelian randomization (MR) study to disentangle the comparative effects of lipids and apolipoproteins on ischemic stroke.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Single‐nucleotide polymorphisms associated with low‐ and high‐density lipoprotein (LDL and HDL) cholesterol, triglycerides, and apolipoprotein A‐I and B (apoA‐I and apoB) at the level of genomewide significance (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 5 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−8&lt;/sup&gt;) in the UK Biobank were used as instrumental variables. Summary‐level data for ischemic stroke and its subtypes were obtained from the MEGASTROKE consortium with 514,791 individuals (60,341 ischemic stroke cases, and 454,450 non‐cases).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Increased levels of apoB, LDL cholesterol, and triglycerides were associated with higher risk of any ischemic stroke, large artery stroke, and small vessel stroke in the main and sensitivity univariable MR analyses. In multivariable MR analysis including apoB, LDL cholesterol, and triglycerides in the same model, apoB retained a robust effect (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05), whereas the estimate for LDL cholesterol was reversed, and that for triglycerides largely attenuated. Decreased levels of apoA‐I and HDL cholesterol were robustly associated with increased risk of any ischemic stroke, large artery stroke, and small vessel stroke in all univariable MR analyses, but the association for apoA‐I was attenuated to the null after mutual adjustment.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The present MR study reveals that apoB is the predominant trait that accounts for the etiological basis of apoB, LDL cholesterol, and triglycerides in relation to ischemic stroke, in particular large artery and small vessel stroke. Whether HDL cholesterol exerts a protective effect on ischemic stroke independent of apoA‐I needs further investigation. ANN NEUROL 2020&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Behavior is the neuronally controlled, voluntary or involuntary response of an organism to its environment. An increasing body of evidence indicates that microbes, which live closely associated with animals or in their immediate surroundings, significantly influence animals’ behavior. The extreme complexity of the nervous system of animals, combined with the extraordinary microbial diversity, are two major obstacles to understand, at the molecular level, how microbes modulate animal behavior. In this review, we discuss recent advances in dissecting the impact that bacteria have on the nervous system of two genetically tractable invertebrate models, Drosophila melanogaster and Caenorhabditis elegans.</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Nuclear plasticity increases susceptibility to damage during confined migration</title>

Large nuclear deformations during migration through confined spaces have been associated with nuclear membrane rupture and DNA damage. However, the stresses associated with nuclear damage remain unclear. Here, using a quasi-static plane strain finite element model, we map evolution of nuclear shape and stresses during confined migration of a cell through a deformable matrix. Plastic deformation of the nucleus observed for a cell with stiff nucleus transiting through a stiffer matrix lowered nuclear stresses, but also led to kinking of the nuclear membrane. In line with model predictions, transwell migration experiments with fibrosarcoma cells showed that while nuclear softening increased invasiveness, nuclear stiffening led to plastic deformation and higher levels of DNA damage. In addition to highlighting the advantage of nuclear softening during confined migration, our results suggest that plastic deformations of the nucleus during transit through stiff tissues may lead to bending-induced nuclear membrane disruption and subsequent DNA damage.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/KHpEjGEbJ5A&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Likelihood-free nested sampling for parameter inference of biochemical reaction networks</title>

The development of mechanistic models of biological systems is a central part of Systems Biology. One major challenge in developing these models is the accurate inference of model parameters. In recent years, nested sampling methods have gained increased attention in the Systems Biology community due to the fact that they are parallelizable and provide error estimates with no additional computations. One drawback that severely limits the usability of these methods, however, is that they require the likelihood function to be available, and thus cannot be applied to systems with intractable likelihoods, such as stochastic models. Here we present a likelihood-free nested sampling method for parameter inference which overcomes these drawbacks. This method gives an unbiased estimator of the Bayesian evidence as well as samples from the posterior. We derive a lower bound on the estimators variance which we use to formulate a novel termination criterion for nested sampling. The presented method enables not only the reliable inference of the posterior of parameters for stochastic systems of a size and complexity that is challenging for traditional methods, but it also provides an estimate of the obtained variance. We illustrate our approach by applying it to several realistically sized models with simulated data as well as recently published biological data. We also compare our developed method with the two most popular other likeliood-free approaches: pMCMC and ABC-SMC. The C++ code of the proposed methods, together with test data, is available at the github web page https://github.com/Mijan/LFNS_paper.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/8-zw79YnMRI&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Comparative genomics studies may be used to acquire new knowledge regarding genome architecture, which defines the rules for combining sets of genes in the genome of living organisms. Hundreds of thousands of prokaryotic genomes have been sequenced and assembled. However, computational tools capable of simultaneously comparing large numbers of genomes are lacking. We developed the Genome Complexity Browser, a tool that allows the visualization of gene contexts, in a graph-based format, and the quantification of variability for different segments of a genome. The graph-based visualization allows the inspection of changes in gene contents and neighborhoods across hundreds of genomes, simultaneously, which may facilitate the identification of conserved and variable segments of operons or the estimation of the overall variability associated with a particular genome locus. We introduced a measure called complexity, to quantify genome variability. Intraspecies and interspecies comparisons revealed that regions with high complexity values tended to be located in areas that are conserved across different strains and species.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/gJNe7HEdoqU&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Identification of mutations of the genes that give cancer a selective advantage is an important step towards research and clinical objectives. As such, there has been a growing interest in developing methods for identification of driver genes and their temporal order within a single patient (intra-tumor) as well as across a cohort of patients (inter-tumor). In this paper, we develop a probabilistic model for tumor progression, in which the driver genes are clustered into several ordered driver pathways. We develop an efficient inference algorithm that exhibits favorable scalability to the number of genes and samples compared to a previously introduced ILP-based method. Adopting a probabilistic approach also allows principled approaches to model selection and uncertainty quantification. Using a large set of experiments on synthetic datasets, we demonstrate our superior performance compared to the ILP-based method. We also analyze two biological datasets of colorectal and glioblastoma cancers. We emphasize that while the ILP-based method puts many seemingly passenger genes in the driver pathways, our algorithm keeps focused on truly driver genes and outputs more accurate models for cancer progression.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/YJD8RczkOVI&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Predicting three-dimensional protein structure and assembling protein complexes using sequence information belongs to the most prominent tasks in computational biology. Recently substantial progress has been obtained in the case of single proteins using a combination of unsupervised coevolutionary sequence analysis with structurally supervised deep learning. While reaching impressive accuracies in predicting residue-residue contacts, deep learning has a number of disadvantages. The need for large structural training sets limits the applicability to multi-protein complexes; and their deep architecture makes the interpretability of the convolutional neural networks intrinsically hard. Here we introduce FilterDCA, a simpler supervised predictor for inter-domain and inter-protein contacts. It is based on the fact that contact maps of proteins show typical contact patterns, which results from secondary structure and are reflected by patterns in coevolutionary analysis. We explicitly integrate averaged contacts patterns with coevolutionary scores derived by Direct Coupling Analysis, improving performance over standard coevolutionary analysis, while remaining fully transparent and interpretable. The FilterDCA code is available at http://gitlab.lcqb.upmc.fr/muscat/FilterDCA.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/8fIdWF2neq8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The success of clinical trials of selective B‐cell depletion in patients with relapsing multiple sclerosis (RMS) and primary progressive MS (PPMS) have led to a conceptual shift in the understanding of MS pathogenesis, away from the classical model in which T cells were the sole central actors, and towards a more complex paradigm with B cells having an essential role in both the inflammatory and neurodegenerative components of the disease process. The role of B cells in MS was selected as the topic of the 27&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; Annual meeting of the European Charcot Foundation. Results of the meeting are presented in this concise review which recaps current concepts underlying the biology and therapeutic rationale behind B‐cell directed therapeutics in MS, as well as proposes strategies to optimise the use of existing anti‐B‐cell treatments and provide future directions for research in this area.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Alzheimer‐Related Cerebrovascular Disease in Down Syndrome</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25905?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adults with Down syndrome (DS) develop Alzheimer disease (AD) pathology by their 5th decade. Compared with the general population, traditional vascular risks in adults with DS are rare, allowing examination of cerebrovascular disease in this population and insight into its role in AD without the confound of vascular risk factors. We examined in vivo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)‐based biomarkers of cerebrovascular pathology in adults with DS, and determined their cross‐sectional relationship with age, beta‐amyloid pathology, and mild cognitive impairment or clinical AD diagnostic status.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Participants from the Biomarkers of Alzheimer's Disease in Down Syndrome study (n = 138, 50 ± 7 years, 39% women) with MRI data and a subset (n = 90) with amyloid positron emission tomography (PET) were included. We derived MRI‐based biomarkers of cerebrovascular pathology, including white matter hyperintensities (WMH), infarcts, cerebral microbleeds, and enlarged perivascular spaces (PVS), as well as PET‐based biomarkers of amyloid burden. Participants were characterized as cognitively stable (CS), mild cognitive impairment–DS (MCI‐DS), possible AD dementia, or definite AD dementia based on in‐depth assessments of cognition, function, and health status.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were detectable WMH, enlarged PVS, infarcts, and microbleeds as early as the 5th decade of life. There was a monotonic increase in WMH volume, enlarged PVS, and presence of infarcts across diagnostic groups (CS &amp;lt; MCI‐DS &amp;lt; possible AD dementia &amp;lt; definite AD dementia). Higher amyloid burden was associated with a higher likelihood of an infarct.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings highlight the prevalence of cerebrovascular disease in adults with DS and add to a growing body of evidence that implicates cerebrovascular disease as a core feature of AD and not simply a comorbidity. ANN NEUROL 2020&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience: Mapping of the Spinal Sensorimotor Network by Transvertebral and Transcutaneous Spinal Cord Stimulation</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsys.2020.555593</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Transcutaneous stimulation is a neuromodulation method that is efficiently used for recovery after spinal cord injury and other disorders that are accompanied by motor and sensory deficits. Multiple aspects of transcutaneous stimulation optimization still require testing in animal experiments including the use of pharmacological agents, spinal lesions, cell recording, etc. This need initially motivated us to develop a new approach of transvertebral spinal cord stimulation (SCS) and to test its feasibility in acute and chronic experiments on rats. The aims of the current work were to study the selectivity of muscle activation over the lower thoracic and lumbosacral spinal cord when the stimulating electrode was located intravertebrally and to compare its effectiveness to that of the clinically used transcutaneous stimulation. In decerebrated rats, electromyographic activity was recorded in the muscles of the back (m. longissimus dorsi), tail (m. abductor caudae dorsalis), and hindlimb (mm. iliacus, adductor magnus, vastus lateralis, semitendinosus, tibialis anterior, gastrocnemius medialis, soleus, and flexor hallucis longus) during SCS with an electrode placed alternately in one of the spinous processes of the VT12–VS1 vertebrae. The recruitment curves for motor and sensory components of the evoked potentials (separated from each other by means of double-pulse stimulation) were plotted for each muscle; their slopes characterized the effectiveness of the muscle activation. The electrophysiological mapping demonstrated that transvertebral SCS has specific effects to the rostrocaudally distributed sensorimotor network of the lower thoracic and lumbosacral cord, mainly by stimulation of the roots that carry the sensory and motor spinal pathways. These effects were compared in the same animals when mapping was performed by transcutaneous stimulation, and similar distribution of muscle activity and underlying neuroanatomical mechanisms were found. The experiments on chronic rats validated the feasibility of the proposed stimulation approach of transvertebral SCS for further studies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Neuroprotective Effect of Optogenetics Varies With Distance From Channelrhodopsin-2 Expression in an Amyloid-β-Injected Mouse Model of Alzheimer’s Disease</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.583628</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Background: Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that is the most common cause of dementia. Optogenetics uses a combination of genetic engineering and light to activate or inhibit specific neurons in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Objective: The objective of the study was to examine the effect of activation of glutamatergic neurons in the hippocampus of mice injected with Aβ1-42 on memory function and biomarkers of neuroinflammation and neuroprotection in the brain to elucidate the clinical utility of optogenetic neuromodulation in AD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: AAV5–CaMKII–channelrhodopsin-2 (CHR2)–mCherry (Aβ-CHR2 mice) or AAV5—CaMKII–mCherry (Aβ-non-CHR2 mice) was injected into the dentate gyrus (DG) of the bilateral hippocampus of an Aβ1-42-injected mouse model of AD. The novel object recognition test was used to investigate working memory (M1), short-term memory (M2), and long-term memory (M3) after Aβ1-42 injection. Hippocampus tissues were collected for immunohistochemical analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Compared to controls, M1 and M2 were significantly higher in Aβ-CHR2 mice, but there was no significant difference in M3; NeuN and synapsin expression were significantly increased in the DG of Aβ-CHR2 mice, but not in CA1, CA3, the subventricular zone (SVZ), or the entorhinal cortex (ENT); GluR2 and IL-10 expressions were significantly increased, and GFAP expression was significantly decreased, in CA1, CA3, the DG, and the SVZ of Aβ-CHR2 mice, but not in the ENT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: Activation of glutamatergic neurons by optogenetics in the bilateral DG of an Aβ-injected mouse model of AD improved M1 and M2, but not M3. A single-target optogenetics strategy has spatial limitations; therefore, a multiple targeted optogenetics approach to AD therapy should be explored.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.577879</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Kolmer–Agduhr (KA) cells are a subgroup of interneurons positioned adjacent to the neurocoele with cilia on the apical surface protruding into the central canal of the spinal cord. Although KA cells were identified almost a century ago, their development and functions are only beginning to be unfolded. Recent studies have revealed the characteristics of KA cells in greater detail, including their spatial distribution, the timing of their differentiation, and their specification via extrinsic signaling and a unique combination of transcription factors in zebrafish and mouse. Cell lineage-tracing experiments have demonstrated that two subsets of KA cells, named KA’ and KA” cells, differentiate from motoneuronal progenitors and floor-plate precursors, respectively, in both zebrafish and mouse. Although KA’ and KA” cells originate from different progenitors/precursors, they each share a common set of transcription factors. Intriguingly, the combination of transcription factors that promote the acquisition of KA’ cell characteristics differs from those that promote a KA” cell identity. In addition, KA’ and KA” cells exhibit separable neuronal targets and differential responses to bending of the spinal cord. In this review, we summarize what is currently known about the genetic programs defining the identities of KA’ and KA” cell identities. We then discuss how these two subgroups of KA cells are genetically specified.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Retinal degeneration (rd) is one of the leading causes of blindness in the modern world today. Various strategies including electrical stimulation are being researched for the restoration of partial or complete vision. Previous studies have demonstrated that the effectiveness of electrical stimulation in somatosensory, frontal and visual cortices is dependent on stimulation parameters including stimulation frequency and brain states. The aim of the study is to investigate the effect of applying a prolonged electrical stimulation on the eye of rd mice with various stimulation frequencies, in awake and anesthetized brain states. We recorded spontaneous electrocorticogram (ECoG) neural activity in prefrontal cortex and primary visual cortex in a mouse model of retinitis pigmentosa (RP) after prolonged (5-day) transcorneal electrical stimulation (pTES) at various frequencies (2, 10, and 20 Hz). We evaluated the absolute power and coherence of spontaneous ECoG neural activities in contralateral primary visual cortex (contra Vcx) and contralateral pre-frontal cortex (contra PFx). Under the awake state, the absolute power of theta, alpha and beta oscillations in contra Vcx, at 10 Hz stimulation, was higher than in the sham group. Under the anesthetized state, the absolute power of medium-, high-, and ultra-high gamma oscillations in the contra PFx, at 2 Hz stimulation, was higher than in the sham group. We also observed that the ultra-high gamma band coherence in contra Vcx-contra PFx was higher than in the sham group, with both 10 and 20 Hz stimulation frequencies. Our results showed that pTES modulates rd brain oscillations in a frequency and brain state-dependent manner. These findings suggest that non-invasive electrical stimulation of retina changes patterns of neural oscillations in the brain circuitry. This also provides a starting point for investigating the sustained effect of electrical stimulation of the retina to brain activities.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neural Technology: Systematic Evaluation of DBS Parameters in the Hemi-Parkinsonian Rat Model</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.561008</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Electrical stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) is clinically employed to ameliorate several symptoms of manifest Parkinson’s Disease (PD). Stimulation parameters utilized by chronically implanted pulse generators comprise biphasic rectangular short (60–100 μs) pulses with a repetition frequency between 130 and 180 Hz. A better insight into the effect of electrical stimulation parameters could potentially reveal new possibilities for the improvement of deep brain stimulation (DBS) as a treatment. To this end, we employed single-sided 6-hydroxidopamine (6-OHDA) lesioning of the medial forebrain bundle (MFB) in rats to systematically investigate alternative stimulation parameters. These hemi-parkinsonian (hemi-PD) rats underwent individualized, ipsilateral electrical stimulation to the STN of the lesioned hemisphere, while the transiently induced contralateral rotational behavior was quantified to assess the effect of DBS parameter variations. The number of induced rotations during 30 s of stimulation was strongly correlated with the amplitude of the stimulation pulses. Despite a general linear relation between DBS frequency and rotational characteristics, a plateau effect was observed in the rotation count throughout the clinically used frequency range. Alternative waveforms to the conventional biphasic rectangular (Rect) pulse shapes [Triangular (Tri), Sinusoidal (Sine), and Sawtooth (Lin.Dec.)] required higher charges per phase to display similar behavior in rats as compared to the conventional pulse shape. The Euclidean Distance (ED) was used to quantify similarities between different angular trajectories. Overall, our study confirmed that the effect of different amplitude and frequency parameters of STN-DBS in the hemi-PD rat model was similar to those in human PD patients. This shows that induced contralateral rotation is a valuable readout in testing stimulation parameters. Our study supports the call for more pre-clinical studies using this measurement to assess the effect of other DBS parameters such as pulse-width and interphase intervals.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Sensitivity of Neuroimaging Indicators in Monitoring the Effects of Interferon Gamma Treatment in Friedreich’s Ataxia</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00872</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The identification of efficient markers of disease progression and response to possibly effective treatments is a key priority for slowly progressive, rare and neurodegenerative diseases, such as Friedreich’s ataxia. Various imaging modalities have documented specific abnormalities in Friedreich’s ataxia that could be tracked to provide useful indicators of efficacy in clinical trials. Advanced MRI imaging (diffusion tensor imaging, DTI; functional MRI, fMRI; and resting-state fMRI, rs-fMRI) and retinal imaging (optical coherence tomography, OCT) were tested longitudinally in a small group of Friedreich’s ataxia patients participating in an open-label clinical trial testing the safety and the efficacy of 6-month treatment with interferon gamma. While the DTI indices documented the slow progression of fractional anisotropy loss, fMRI and rs-fMRI were significantly modified during and after treatment. The fMRI changes significantly correlated with the Scale for the Assessment and Rating of Ataxia, which is used to monitor clinical response. OCT documented the known thickness reduction of the retinal nerve fiber layer thickness, but there was no change over time. This pilot study provides indications for the potential utility of fMRI and rs-fMRI as ancillary measures in clinical trials for Friedreich’s ataxia.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Decoding the Temporal Dynamics of Covert Spatial Attention Using Multivariate EEG Analysis: Contributions of Raw Amplitude and Alpha Power</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.570419</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Attention can be oriented in space covertly without the need of eye movements. We used multivariate pattern classification analyses (MVPA) to investigate whether the time course of the deployment of covert spatial attention leading up to the observer’s perceptual decision can be decoded from both EEG alpha power and raw activity traces. Decoding attention from these signals can help determine whether raw EEG signals and alpha power reflect the same or distinct features of attentional selection. Using a classical cueing task, we showed that the orientation of covert spatial attention can be decoded by both signals. However, raw activity and alpha power may reflect different features of spatial attention, with alpha power more associated with the orientation of covert attention in space and raw activity with the influence of attention on perceptual processes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Mapping the Scene and Object Processing Networks by Intracranial EEG</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.561399</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Human perception and cognition are based predominantly on visual information processing. Much of the information regarding neuronal correlates of visual processing has been derived from functional imaging studies, which have identified a variety of brain areas contributing to visual analysis, recognition, and processing of objects and scenes. However, only two of these areas, namely the parahippocampal place area (PPA) and the lateral occipital complex (LOC), were verified and further characterized by intracranial electroencephalogram (iEEG). iEEG is a unique measurement technique that samples a local neuronal population with high temporal and anatomical resolution. In the present study, we aimed to expand on previous reports and examine brain activity for selectivity of scenes and objects in the broadband high-gamma frequency range (50–150 Hz). We collected iEEG data from 27 epileptic patients while they watched a series of images, containing objects and scenes, and we identified 375 bipolar channels responding to at least one of these two categories. Using K-means clustering, we delineated their brain localization. In addition to the two areas described previously, we detected significant responses in two other scene-selective areas, not yet reported by any electrophysiological studies; namely the occipital place area (OPA) and the retrosplenial complex. Moreover, using iEEG we revealed a much broader network underlying visual processing than that described to date, using specialized functional imaging experimental designs. Here, we report the selective brain areas for scene processing include the posterior collateral sulcus and the anterior temporal region, which were already shown to be related to scene novelty and landmark naming. The object-selective responses appeared in the parietal, frontal, and temporal regions connected with tool use and object recognition. The temporal analyses specified the time course of the category selectivity through the dorsal and ventral visual streams. The receiver operating characteristic analyses identified the PPA and the fusiform portion of the LOC as being the most selective for scenes and objects, respectively. Our findings represent a valuable overview of visual processing selectivity for scenes and objects based on iEEG analyses and thus, contribute to a better understanding of visual processing in the human brain.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Sensory-to-Motor Overflow: Cooling Foot Soles Impedes Squat Jump Performance</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.549880</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Evidence from recent studies on animals and humans suggest that neural overflow from the primary sensory cortex (S1) to the primary motor cortex (M1) may play a critical role in motor control. However, it is unclear if whole-body maximal motor tasks are also governed by this mechanism. Maximum vertical squat jumps were performed by 15 young adults before cooling, then immediately following a 15-min cooling period using an ice-water bath for the foot soles, and finally immediately following a 15-min period of natural recovery from cooling. Jump heights were, on average, 3.1 cm lower immediately following cooling compared to before cooling (p = 3.39 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−8&lt;/sup&gt;) and 1.9 cm lower following natural recovery from cooling (p = 0.00124). The average vertical ground reaction force (vGRF) was also lower by 78.2 N in the condition immediately following cooling compared to before cooling (p = 8.1 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−5&lt;/sup&gt;) and 56.7N lower following natural recovery from cooling (p = 0.0043). The current study supports the S1-to-M1 overflow mechanism in a whole-body dynamic jump.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Variance and Scale-Free Properties of Resting-State Blood Oxygenation Level-Dependent Signal After Fear Memory Acquisition and Extinction</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.509075</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Recently, the dynamic properties of brain activity rather than its stationary values have attracted more interest in clinical applications. It has been shown that brain signals exhibit scale-free dynamics or long-range temporal correlations (LRTC) that differ between rest and cognitive tasks in healthy controls and clinical groups. Little is known about how fear-inducing tasks may influence dispersion and the LRTC of subsequent resting-state brain activity. In this study, we aimed to explore the changes in the variance and scale-free properties of the brain’s blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signal during the resting-state sessions before and after fear learning and fear memory extinction. During a 1-h break between magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanning, 23 healthy, right-handed volunteers experienced a fear extinction procedure, followed by Pavlovian fear conditioning that included partial reinforcement using mild electrical stimulation. We extracted the average time course of the BOLD signal from 245 regions of interest (ROIs) taken from the resting-state functional atlas. The variance of the BOLD signal and the Hurst exponent (H), which reflects the scale-free dynamic, were compared in the resting states before and after fear learning and fear memory extinction. After fear extinction, six ROIs showed a difference in H at the uncorrected level of significance, including areas associated with fear processing. H decreased during fear extinction but then became higher than before fear learning, specifically in areas related to the fear extinction network (FEN). However, activity in the other ROIs restored the H to its initial level. The variance of the BOLD signal in six ROIs demonstrated a significant increase from initial rest to the post-task rest. A limited number of ROIs showed changes in both H and variance. Our results imply that the variability and scale-free properties of the BOLD signal might serve as additional indicators of changes in spontaneous brain activity related to recent experience.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Improved Separation of Odor Responses in Granule Cells of the Olfactory Bulb During Odor Discrimination Learning</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.579349</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In the olfactory bulb, olfactory information is translated into ensemble representations by mitral/tufted cells, and these representations change dynamically in a context-dependent manner. In particular, odor representations in mitral/tufted cells display pattern separation during odor discrimination learning. Although granule cells provide major inhibitory input to mitral/tufted cells and play an important role in pattern separation and olfactory learning, the dynamics of odor responses in granule cells during odor discrimination learning remain largely unknown. Here, we studied odor responses in granule cells of the olfactory bulb using fiber photometry recordings in awake behaving mice. We found that odors evoked reliable, excitatory responses in the granule cell population. Intriguingly, during odor discrimination learning, odor responses in granule cells exhibited improved separation and contained information about odor value. In conclusion, we show that granule cells in the olfactory bulb display learning-related plasticity, suggesting that they may mediate pattern separation in mitral/tufted cells.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Gas6 Inhibits Toll-Like Receptor-Mediated Inflammatory Pathways in Mouse Microglia via Axl and Mer</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.576650</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Background: Microglia are well known key regulators of neuroinflammation which feature in multiple neurodegenerative disorders. These cells survey the CNS and, under inflammatory conditions, become “activated” through stimulation of toll-like receptors (TLRs), resulting in changes in morphology and production and release of cytokines. In the present study, we examined the roles of the related TAM receptors, Mer and Axl, and of their ligand, Gas6, in the regulation of microglial pro-inflammatory TNF-α production and microglial morphology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Primary cultures of murine microglia of wild-type (WT), Mer&lt;sup&gt;−/−&lt;/sup&gt; and Axl&lt;sup&gt;−/−&lt;/sup&gt; backgrounds were stimulated by the TLR4 agonist, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) with or without pre-treatment with Gas6. Gene expression of TNF-α, Mer, and Axl was examined using reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR), and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to measure TNF-α release from microglia. Immunofluorescence staining of β-actin and the microglial marker Iba1 was performed to reveal microglial morphological changes, with cellular characteristics (area, perimeter, Feret’s diameter, minimum Feret, roundness, and aspect ratio) being quantified using ImageJ software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Under basal conditions, TNF-α gene expression was significantly lower in Axl&lt;sup&gt;−/−&lt;/sup&gt; microglia compared to WT cells. However, all microglial cultures robustly responded to LPS stimulation with the upregulation of TNF-α expression to similar degrees. Furthermore, Mer receptor expression was less responsive to LPS stimulation when in Axl knockout cells. The presence of Gas6 consistently inhibited the LPS-induced upregulation of TNF-α in WT, Mer&lt;sup&gt;−/−&lt;/sup&gt; and Axl&lt;sup&gt;−/−&lt;/sup&gt; microglia. Moreover, Gas6 also inhibited LPS-induced changes in the microglial area, perimeter length, and cell roundness in wild-type cells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: Gas6 can negatively regulate the microglial pro-inflammatory response to LPS as well as via stimulation of other TLRs, acting through either of the TAM receptors, Axl and Mer. This finding indicates an interaction between TLR and TAM receptor signaling pathways and reveals an anti-inflammatory role for the TAM ligand, Gas6, which could have therapeutic potential.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Functional MRI-Specific Alterations in Executive Control Network in Mild Cognitive Impairment: An ALE Meta-Analysis</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.578863</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Background: Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is regarded as a transitional stage between normal aging and Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia. MCI individuals with deficits in executive function are at higher risk for progressing to AD dementia. Currently, there is no consistent result for alterations in the executive control network (ECN) in MCI, which makes early prediction of AD conversion difficult. The aim of the study was to find functional MRI-specific alterations in ECN in MCI patients by expounding on the convergence of brain regions with functional abnormalities in ECN.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: We searched PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science to identify neuroimaging studies using methods including the amplitude of low frequency fluctuation/fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation, regional homogeneity, and functional connectivity in MCI patients. Based on the Activation Likelihood Estimation algorithm, the coordinate-based meta-analysis and functional meta-analytic connectivity modeling were conducted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: A total of 25 functional imaging studies with MCI patients were included in a quantitative meta-analysis. By summarizing the included articles, we obtained specific brain region changes, mainly including precuneus, cuneus, lingual gyrus, middle frontal gyrus, posterior cingulate cortex, and cerebellum posterior lobe, in the ECN based on these three methods. The specific abnormal brain regions indicated that there were interactions between the ECN and other networks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: This study confirms functional imaging specific abnormal markers in ECN and its interaction with other networks in MCI. It provides novel targets and pathways for individualized and precise interventions to delay the progression of MCI to AD.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB) are frequently prescribed for a range of diseases including hypertension, proteinuric chronic kidney disease, and heart failure. There is evidence indicating that these drugs upregulate ACE2, a key component of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) and is found on the cells of a number of tissues, including the epithelial cells in the lungs. While ACE2 has a beneficial role in many diseases such as hypertension, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease, it also serves as a receptor for both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 via binding with the spike protein of the virus, thereby allowing it entry into host cells. Thus, it has been suggested that these therapies can theoretically increase the risk of SARS- CoV-2 infection and cause more severe COVID-19. Given the success of ACEi and ARBs in cardiovascular diseases, we seek to gain insights into the implications of these medications in the pathogenesis of COVID-19. To that end, we have developed a mathematical model that represents the RAS, binding of ACE2 with SARS-CoV-2 and the subsequent cell entry, and the host’s acute inflammatory response. The model can simulate different levels of SARS-CoV-2 exposure, and represent the effect of commonly prescribed anti-hypertensive medications, ACEi and ARB, and predict tissue damage. Model simulations indicate that whether the extent of tissue damage may be exacerbated by ACEi or ARB treatment depends on a number of factors, including the level of existing inflammation, dosage, and the effect of the drugs on ACE2 protein abundance. The findings of this study can serve as the first step in the development of appropriate and more comprehensive guidelines for the prescription of ACEi and ARB in the current and future coronavirus pandemics.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/QDTmdHbBMK4&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

To understand why some hosts get sicker than others from the same type of infection, it is essential to explain how key processes, such as host responses to infection and parasite growth, are influenced by various biotic and abiotic factors. In many disease systems, the initial infection dose impacts host morbidity and mortality. To explore drivers of dose-dependence and individual variation in infection outcomes, we devised a mathematical model of malaria infection that allowed host and parasite traits to be linear functions (reaction norms) of the initial dose. We fitted the model, using a hierarchical Bayesian approach, to experimental time-series data of acute &lt;i&gt;Plasmodium chabaudi&lt;/i&gt; infection across doses spanning seven orders of magnitude. We found evidence for both dose-dependent facilitation and debilitation of host responses. Most importantly, increasing dose reduced the strength of activation of indiscriminate host clearance of red blood cells while increasing the half-life of that response, leading to the maximal response at an intermediate dose. We also explored the causes of diverse infection outcomes across replicate mice receiving the same dose. Besides random noise in the injected dose, we found variation in peak parasite load was due to unobserved individual variation in host responses to clear infected cells. Individual variation in anaemia was likely driven by random variation in parasite burst size, which is linked to the rate of host cells lost to malaria infection. General host vigour in the absence of infection was also correlated with host health during malaria infection. Our work demonstrates that the reaction norm approach provides a useful quantitative framework for examining the impact of a continuous external factor on within-host infection processes.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/B7KSyafyguM&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

The mutation responsible for Duffy negativity, which impedes &lt;i&gt;Plasmodium vivax&lt;/i&gt; infection, has reached high frequencies in certain human populations. Conversely, mutations capable of blocking the more lethal &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;falciparum&lt;/i&gt; have not succeeded in malarious zones. Here we present an evolutionary-epidemiological model of malaria which demonstrates that if adaptive immunity against the most virulent effects of malaria is gained rapidly by the host, mutations which prevent infection &lt;i&gt;per se&lt;/i&gt; are unlikely to succeed. Our results (i) explain the rarity of strain-transcending &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;falciparum&lt;/i&gt; infection blocking adaptations in humans; (ii) make the surprising prediction that mutations which block &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;falciparum&lt;/i&gt; infection are most likely to be found in populations experiencing low or infrequent malaria transmission, and (iii) predict that immunity against some of the virulent effects of &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;vivax&lt;/i&gt; malaria may be built up over the course of many infections.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/UL9ghmjx9V0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

The mononuclear phagocyte system (MPS) is a family of cells including progenitors, circulating blood monocytes, resident tissue macrophages, and dendritic cells (DCs) present in every tissue in the body. To test the relationships between markers and transcriptomic diversity in the MPS, we collected from National Center for Biotechnology Information Gene Expression Omnibus (NCBI-GEO) a total of 466 quality RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data sets generated from mouse MPS cells isolated from bone marrow, blood, and multiple tissues. The primary data were randomly downsized to a depth of 10 million reads and requantified. The resulting data set was clustered using the network analysis tool &lt;i&gt;BioLayout&lt;/i&gt;. A sample-to-sample matrix revealed that MPS populations could be separated based upon tissue of origin. Cells identified as classical DC subsets, cDC1s and cDC2s, and lacking &lt;i&gt;Fcgr1&lt;/i&gt; (encoding the protein CD64) were contained within the MPS cluster, no more distinct than other MPS cells. A gene-to-gene correlation matrix identified large generic coexpression clusters associated with MPS maturation and innate immune function. Smaller coexpression gene clusters, including the transcription factors that drive them, showed higher expression within defined isolated cells, including monocytes, macrophages, and DCs isolated from specific tissues. They include a cluster containing &lt;i&gt;Lyve1&lt;/i&gt; that implies a function in endothelial cell (EC) homeostasis, a cluster of transcripts enriched in intestinal macrophages, and a generic lymphoid tissue cDC cluster associated with &lt;i&gt;Ccr7&lt;/i&gt;. However, transcripts encoding &lt;i&gt;Adgre1&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Itgax&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Itgam&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Clec9a&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Cd163&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Mertk&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Mrc1&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Retnla&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;H2-a/e&lt;/i&gt; (encoding class II major histocompatibility complex [MHC] proteins) and many other proposed macrophage subset and DC lineage markers each had idiosyncratic expression profiles. Coexpression of immediate early genes (for example, &lt;i&gt;Egr1&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Fos&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Dusp1&lt;/i&gt;) and inflammatory cytokines and chemokines (tumour necrosis factor [&lt;i&gt;Tnf&lt;/i&gt;], &lt;i&gt;Il1b&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Ccl3/4&lt;/i&gt;) indicated that all tissue disaggregation and separation protocols activate MPS cells. Tissue-specific expression clusters indicated that all cell isolation procedures also co-purify other unrelated cell types that may interact with MPS cells in vivo. Comparative analysis of RNA-seq and single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) data from the same lung cell populations indicated that MPS heterogeneity implied by global cluster analysis may be even greater at a single-cell level. This analysis highlights the power of large data sets to identify the diversity of MPS cellular phenotypes and the limited predictive value of surface markers to define lineages, functions, or subpopulations.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/_zx7TnbaPY0&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: Corticocuneate projections are altered after spinal cord dorsal column lesions in New World monkeys</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/cne.25050?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;img alt=&quot;Corticocuneate projections are altered after spinal cord dorsal column lesions in New World monkeys&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/77ffbc5a-9a8e-4fb7-a9bd-1b8802fdd10a/cne25050-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cuneate nucleus normally receives cortical inputs from the hand regions of sensorimotor cortex in the contralateral and ipsilateral hemispheres. This cortical descending influence remains similar in New World monkeys with the short recoveries from the dorsal column lesion, but is greatly increased after the long recoveries.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recovery of responses to cutaneous stimuli in the area 3b hand cortex of monkeys after dorsal column lesions (DCLs) in the cervical spinal cord relies on neural rewiring in the cuneate nucleus (Cu) over time. To examine whether the corticocuneate projections are modified during recoveries after the DCL, we injected cholera toxin subunit B (CTB) into the hand representation in Cu to label the cortical neurons after various recovery times, and related results to the recovery of neural responses in the affected area 3b hand cortex. In normal New World monkeys, labeled neurons were predominately distributed in the hand regions of contralateral areas 3b, 3a, 1 and 2, parietal ventral (PV), secondary somatosensory cortex (S2), and primary motor cortex (M1), with similar distributions in the ipsilateral cortex in significantly smaller numbers. In monkeys with short‐term recoveries, the area 3b hand neurons were unresponsive or responded weakly to touch on the hand, while the cortical labeling pattern was largely unchanged. After longer recoveries, the area 3b hand neurons remained unresponsive, or responded to touch on the hand or somatotopically abnormal parts, depending on the lesion extent. The distributions of cortical labeled neurons were much more widespread than the normal pattern in both hemispheres, especially when lesions were incomplete. The proportion of labeled neurons in the contralateral area 3b hand cortex was not correlated with the functional reactivation in the area 3b hand cortex. Overall, our findings indicated that corticocuneate inputs increase during the functional recovery, but this functional role is uncertain.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

&lt;p&gt;GluD1 is more strongly expressed in the striosome than in the matrix compartment of the monkey caudate nucleus. At the subcellular level, GluD1 is found at asymmetric glutamatergic synapses on dendrites and spines. Double immunofluorescence data suggest an association between GluD1 profiles and vGluT2‐containing thalamic terminals in both striatal compartments.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The glutamate receptor Delta 1 (GluD1) is strongly expressed in the striatum. Knockout of GluD1 expression in striatal neurons elicits cognitive deficits and disrupts the thalamostriatal system in mice. To understand the potential role of GluD1 in the primate striatum, we compared the cellular and subcellular localization of striatal GluD1 immunoreactivity (GluD1‐IR) in mice and monkeys. In both species, striatal GluD1‐IR displayed a patchy pattern of distribution in register with the striosome/matrix compartmentation, but in an opposite fashion. While GluD1 was more heavily expressed in the striosomes than the matrix in the monkey caudate nucleus, the opposite was found in the mouse striatum. At the electron microscopic level, GluD1‐IR was preferentially expressed in dendritic shafts (47.9 ± 1.2%), followed by glia (37.7 ± 2.5%), and dendritic spines (14.3 ± 2.6%) in the matrix of the mouse striatum. This pattern was not statistically different from the labeling in the striosome and matrix compartments of the monkey caudate nucleus, with the exception of a small amount of GluD1‐positive unmyelinated axons and axon terminals in the primate striatum. Immunogold staining revealed synaptic and perisynaptic GluD1 labeling at putative axo‐dendritic and axo‐spinous glutamatergic synapses and intracellular labeling on the surface of mitochondria. Confocal microscopy showed that GluD1 is preferentially co‐localized with thalamic over cortical terminals in both the striosome and matrix compartments. These data provide the anatomical substrate for a deeper understanding of GluD1 regulation of striatal glutamatergic synapses, but also suggest possible extrasynaptic, glial and mitochondrial GluD1 functions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Polymicrogyria is Associated With Pathogenic Variants in PTEN</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25904?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Congenital structural brain malformations have been described in patients with pathogenic phosphatase and tensin homologue (&lt;i&gt;PTEN&lt;/i&gt;) variants, but the frequency of cortical malformations in patients with &lt;i&gt;PTEN&lt;/i&gt; variants and their impact on clinical phenotype are not well understood. Our goal was to systematically characterize brain malformations in patients with &lt;i&gt;PTEN&lt;/i&gt; variants and assess the relevance of their brain malformations to clinical presentation.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We systematically searched a local radiology database for patients with &lt;i&gt;PTEN&lt;/i&gt; variants who had available brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The MRI scans were reviewed systematically for cortical abnormalities. We reviewed electroencephalogram (EEG) data and evaluated the electronic medical record for evidence of epilepsy and developmental delay.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In total, we identified 22 patients with &lt;i&gt;PTEN&lt;/i&gt; pathogenic variants for which brain MRIs were available (age range 0.4–17 years). Twelve among these 22 patients (54%) had polymicrogyria (PMG). Variants associated with PMG or atypical gyration encoded regions of the phosphatase or C2 domains of PTEN. Interestingly, epilepsy was present in only 2 of the 12 patients with PMG. We found a trend toward higher rates of global developmental delay (GDD), intellectual disability (ID), and motor delay in individuals with cortical abnormalities, although cohort size limited statistical significance.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Malformations of cortical development, PMG in particular, represent an under‐recognized phenotype associated with &lt;i&gt;PTEN&lt;/i&gt; pathogenic variants and may have an association with cognitive and motor delays. Epilepsy was infrequent compared to the previously reported high risk of epilepsy in patients with PMG. ANN NEUROL 2020&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Noninvasive characterization of human glymphatics and meningeal lymphatics in an in vivo model of blood‐brain barrier leakage</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25928?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To evaluate human glymphatics and meningeal lymphatics noninvasively.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This prospective study implemented 3‐dimensional isotropic contrast‐enhanced T2 fluid‐attenuated inversion recovery (3D isotropic CE‐T2‐FLAIR) imaging with a 3‐tesla (T) magnetic resonance machine to study cerebral glymphatics and meningeal lymphatics in patients with reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome (RCVS) with (n=92) or without (n=90) blood‐brain barrier (BBB) disruption and a disease control group with cluster headache (n=35). The contrast agent gadobutrol (0.2 mmol/kg (0.2mL/kg)) was administered intravenously in all study subjects.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In total, 217 patients (182 RCVS, 35 cluster headache) were analyzed and separated into two groups based on the presence or absence of visible gadolinium (Gd) leakage. Paraarterial tracer enrichment was clearly depicted in those with overt BBB disruption, while paravenous and parasinus meningeal contrast enrichment was evident in both groups. Paravenous and parasinus contrast enrichment remained in RCVS patients in the remission stage and in cluster headache patients, suggesting that these meningeal lymphatic channels were universal anatomical structures rather than being phase‐ or condition‐specific. Additionally, we demonstrated nodular leptomeningeal enhancement in 32.3% of participants, which might represent potential lymphatic reservoirs. Four selected RCVS patients who received consecutive contrasted 3D isotropic FLAIR imaging after gadobutrol administration showed that the Gd persisted for at least 54 minutes and was completely cleared within 18 hours.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This large‐scale &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; study successfully demonstrated the putative human paraarterial glymphatic transports and meningeal lymphatics by clear depiction of paraarterial, parasinus and paravenous meningeal contrast enrichment using the high‐resolution 3D isotropic CE‐T2‐FLAIR imaging noninvasively; this technique may serve as a basis for further studies to delineate clinical relevance of glymphatic clearance.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Chronic Sodium Selenate Treatment Restores Deficits in Cognition and Synaptic Plasticity in a Murine Model of Tauopathy</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2020.570223</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A major goal in diseases is identifying a potential therapeutic agent that is cost-effective and can remedy some, if not all, disease symptoms. In Alzheimer’s disease (AD), aggregation of hyperphosphorylated tau protein is one of the neuropathological hallmarks, and Tau pathology correlates better with cognitive impairments in AD patients than amyloid-β load, supporting a key role of tau-related mechanisms. Selenium is a non-metallic trace element that is incorporated in the brain into selenoproteins. Chronic treatment with sodium selenate, a non-toxic selenium compound, was recently reported to rescue behavioral phenotypes in tau mouse models. Here, we focused on the effects of chronic selenate application on synaptic transmission and synaptic plasticity in THY-Tau22 mice, a transgenic animal model of tauopathies. Three months with a supplement of sodium selenate in the drinking water (12 μg/ml) restored not only impaired neurocognitive functions but also rescued long-term depression (LTD), a major form of synaptic plasticity. Furthermore, selenate reduced the inactive demethylated catalytic subunit of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) in THY-Tau22 without affecting total PP2A.Our study provides evidence that chronic dietary selenate rescues functional synaptic deficits of tauopathy and identifies activation of PP2A as the putative mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Altered EEG Signal Complexity Induced by Hand Proximity: A Multiscale Entropy Approach</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.562132</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Visual short-term memory (VSTM) is an important cognitive function that acts as a temporary storage for visual information. Previous studies have shown that VSTM capacity can be modulated by the location of one’s hands, where hand proximity enhances neural processing and memory of nearby visual stimuli. The present study used traditional event-related potentials (ERP) along with multiscale entropy (MSE) analysis to shed light on the neural mechanism(s) behind such near-hand effect. Participants’ electroencephalogram (EEG) data were recorded as they performed a VSTM task with their hands either proximal or distal to the display. ERP analysis showed altered memory processing in the 400–700 ms time window during memory retrieval period. Importantly, MSE analysis also showed significant EEG difference between hand proximal and distal conditions between scales 10 to 20, and such difference is clustered around the right parietal cortex – a region that is involved in VSTM processing and bimodal hand-eye integration. The implications of higher MSE time scale in the parietal cortex are discussed in the context of signal complexity and its possible relation to cognitive processing. To our knowledge, this study provides the first investigation using MSE to characterize the temporal characteristics and signal complexity behind the effect of hand proximity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Deep learning has recently been used for the analysis of neuroimages, such as structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), functional MRI, and positron emission tomography (PET), and it has achieved significant performance improvements over traditional machine learning in computer-aided diagnosis of brain disorders.

We first provide a comprehensive overview of deep learning techniques and popular network architectures by introducing various types of deep neural networks and recent developments. We then review deep learning methods for computer-aided analysis of four typical brain disorders, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Autism spectrum disorder, and Schizophrenia, where the first two diseases are neurodegenerative disorders and the last two are neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders, respectively. More importantly, we discuss the limitations of existing studies and present possible future directions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Brain Responses to Food Odors Associated With BMI Change at 2-Year Follow-Up</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.574148</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The understanding of food cue associated neural activations that predict future weight variability may guide the design of effective prevention programs and treatments for overeating and obesity. The current study investigated the association between brain response to different food odors with varied energy density and individual changes of body mass index (BMI) over 2 years. Twenty-five participants received high-fat (chocolate and peanut), low-fat (bread and peach) food odors, and a nonfood odor (rose) while the brain activation was measured using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). BMIs were calculated with participant’s self-reported body weight and height collected at the time of the fMRI scan and again at 2 years later. Regression analyses revealed significant negative correlations between BMI increase over 2 years and brain activation of the bilateral precuneus and the right posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) in response to high-fat vs. low-fat food odors. Also, brain activation of the right supplementary motor area (SMA) in response to food vs. non-food odor was negatively correlated to subsequent BMI increase over 2 years. Taken together, the current findings suggest that individual differences in neural responsivity to (high calorie) food odors in brain regions of the default mode and motor control network serve as a neural marker for future BMI change.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Predicting Stimulus Modality and Working Memory Load During Visual- and Audiovisual-Acquired Equivalence Learning</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.569142</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Scholars have extensively studied the electroencephalography (EEG) correlates of associative working memory (WM) load. However, the effect of stimulus modality on EEG patterns within this process is less understood. To fill this research gap, the present study re-analyzed EEG datasets recorded during visual and audiovisual equivalence learning tasks from earlier studies. The number of associations required to be maintained (WM load) in WM was increased using the staircase method during the acquisition phase of the tasks. The support vector machine algorithm was employed to predict WM load and stimulus modality using the power, phase connectivity, and cross-frequency coupling (CFC) values obtained during time segments with different WM loads in the visual and audiovisual tasks. A high accuracy (&amp;gt;90%) in predicting stimulus modality based on power spectral density and from the theta–beta CFC was observed. However, accuracy in predicting WM load was higher (≥75% accuracy) than that in predicting stimulus modality (which was at chance level) using theta and alpha phase connectivity. Under low WM load conditions, this connectivity was highest between the frontal and parieto-occipital channels. The results validated our findings from earlier studies that dissociated stimulus modality based on power-spectra and CFC during equivalence learning. Furthermore, the results emphasized the importance of alpha and theta frontoparietal connectivity in WM load.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Early detection and evaluation of cognitive alteration in chronic liver disease is important for predicting the subsequent development of hepatic encephalopathy. While visuomotor tasks have been rigorously employed for cognitive evaluation in chronic liver disease, there is a paucity of auditory processing task. Here we focused on auditory perception and examined behavioral and haemodynamic responses to a melodic contour identification task (CIT) to compare cognitive abilities in patients with chronic liver disease (CLD, N = 30) and healthy controls (N = 25). Further, we used support vector machines to examine the optimal combination of channels of functional near-infrared spectroscopy that can classify cognitive alterations in CLD. Behavioral findings showed that CIT performance was significantly worse in the patient group and CIT significantly correlated with neurocognitive evaluation (i.e., number connection test, digit span test). The findings indicated that CIT can measure auditory cognitive capacity and its difference existing between patient group and healthy controls. Additionally, optimal subsets classified the 16-dimensional haemodynamic data with 78.35% classification accuracy, yielding markers of cognitive alterations in the prefrontal regions (CH6, CH7, CH10, CH13, CH14, and CH16). The results confirmed the potential use of behavioral as well as haemodynamic responses to music perception as an alternative or supplementary method for evaluating cognitive alterations in chronic liver disease.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Prefrontal Responses to Odors in Individuals With Autism Spectrum Disorders: Functional NIRS Measurement Combined With a Fragrance Pulse Ejection System</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.523456</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are impaired not only in social competencies but also in sensory perception, particularly olfaction. The olfactory ability of individuals with ASD has been examined in several psychophysical studies, but the results have been highly variable, which might be primarily due to methodological difficulties in the control of odor stimuli (e.g., the problem of lingering scents). In addition, the neural correlates of olfactory specificities in individuals with ASD remain largely unknown. To date, only one study has investigated this issue using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). The present study utilized a sophisticated method−a pulse ejection system−to present well-controlled odor stimuli to participants with ASD using an ASD-friendly application. With this advantageous system, we examined their odor detection, identification, and evaluation abilities and measured their brain activity evoked by odors using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). As the odor detection threshold (DT) of participants with ASD was highly variable, these participants were divided into two groups according to their DT: an ASD-Low DT group and an ASD-High DT group. Behavioral results showed that the ASD-High DT group had a significantly higher DT than the typically developing (control) group and the ASD-Low DT group, indicating their insensitivity to the tested odors. In addition, while there was no significant difference in the odor identification ability between groups, there was some discrepancy between the groups’ evaluations of odor pleasantness. The brain data identified, for the first time, that neural activity in the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) was significantly weaker in the ASD-High DT group than in the control group. Moreover, the strength of activity in the right DLPFC was negatively correlated with the DT. These findings suggest that participants with ASD have impairments in the higher-order function of olfactory processing, such as olfactory working memory and/or attention.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Children With Autism Produce a Unique Pattern of EEG Microstates During an Eyes Closed Resting-State Condition</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.00288</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Although fMRI studies have produced considerable evidence for differences in the spatial connectivity of resting-state brain networks in persons with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) relative to typically developing (TD) peers, little is known about the temporal dynamics of these brain networks in ASD. The aim of this study was to examine the EEG microstate architecture in children with ASD as compared to TD at rest in two separate conditions – eyes-closed (EC) and eyes-open (EO). EEG microstate analysis was performed on resting-state data of 13 ASD and 13 TD children matched on age, gender, and IQ. We found that children with ASD and TD peers produced topographically similar canonical microstates at rest. Group differences in the duration and frequency of these microstates were found primarily in the EC resting-state condition. In line with previous fMRI findings that have reported differences in spatial connectivity within the salience network (previously correlated with the activity of microstate C) in ASD, we found that the duration of activation of microstate C was increased, and the frequency of microstate C was decreased in ASD as compared to TD in EC resting-state. Functionally, these results may be reflective of alterations in interoceptive processes in ASD. These results suggest a unique pattern of EEG microstate architecture in ASD relative to TD during resting-states and also that EEG microstate parameters in ASD are susceptible to differences in resting-state conditions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neural Circuits: Early Auditory Experience Modifies Neuronal Firing Properties in the Zebra Finch Auditory Cortex</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncir.2020.570174</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Songbirds learn to sing much as humans learn to speak. In zebra finches, one of the premier songbird models, males learn to sing for later courtship through a multistep learning process during the developmental period. They first listen to and memorize the song of a tutor (normally their father) during the sensory learning period. Then, in the subsequent sensory-motor learning phase (with large overlap), they match their vocalizations to the memorized tutor song via auditory feedback and develop their own unique songs, which they maintain throughout their lives. Previous studies have suggested that memories of tutor songs are shaped in the caudomedial nidopallium (NCM) of the brain, which is analogous to the mammalian higher auditory cortex. Isolation during development, which extends the sensory learning period in males, alters song preference in adult females, and NCM inactivation decreases song preference. However, the development of neurophysiological properties of neurons in this area and the effect of isolation on these neurons have not yet been explained. Here, we performed whole-cell patch-clamp recording on NCM neurons from juvenile zebra finches during the sensory learning period, 20, 40, or 60 days post-hatching (DPH) and examined their neurophysiological properties. In contrast to previous reports in adult NCM neurons, the majority of NCM neurons of juvenile zebra finches showed spontaneous firing with or without burst firing patterns, and the percentage of neurons that fired increased in the middle of the sensory learning period (40 DPH) and then decreased at the end (60 DPH) in both males and females. We further found that auditory isolation from tutor songs alters developmental changes in the proportions of firing neurons both in males and females, and also changes those of burst neurons differently between males that sing and females that do not. Taken together, these findings suggest that NCM neurons develop their neurophysiological properties depending on auditory experiences during the sensory song learning period, which underlies memory formation for song learning in males and song discrimination in females.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Insulin-Like Growth Factor 1 on the Maintenance of Ribbon Synapses in Mouse Cochlear Explant Cultures</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.571155</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Hearing loss has become one of the most common disabilities worldwide. The synaptic connections between inner hair cells (IHCs) and spiral ganglion neurons have specialized synaptic constructions, termed ribbon synapses, which are important for auditory function. The ribbon synapses in the cochlea are quite vulnerable to various insults. As such, the maintenance of ribbon synapses is important for ensuring hearing function. Insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) plays a critical role in the development and maintenance of the cochlea and has the potential to protect cochlear hair cells from various insults. In this study, we examined the role of IGF1 in the maintenance of ribbon synapses in cochlear explants of postnatal day four mice. We cultured cochlear explants with an IGF1 receptor antagonist, JB1, which is an IGF1 peptide analog. Results showed that exposure to JB1 for 24 h resulted in the loss of ribbon synapses. After an additional 24-h culture without JB1, the number of ribbon synapses spontaneously recovered. The application of exogenous IGF1 showed two different aspects of ribbon synapses. Low doses of exogenous IGF1 promoted the recovery of ribbon synapses, while it compromised the spontaneous recovery of ribbon synapses at high doses. Altogether, these results indicate that the paracrine or autocrine release of IGF1 in the cochlea plays a crucial role in the maintenance of cochlear ribbon synapses.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Phenotype-Agnostic Molecular Subtyping of Neurodegenerative Disorders: The Cincinnati Cohort Biomarker Program (CCBP)</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.553635</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Ongoing biomarker development programs have been designed to identify serologic or imaging signatures of clinico-pathologic entities, assuming distinct biological boundaries between them. Identified putative biomarkers have exhibited large variability and inconsistency between cohorts, and remain inadequate for selecting suitable recipients for potential disease-modifying interventions. We launched the Cincinnati Cohort Biomarker Program (CCBP) as a population-based, phenotype-agnostic longitudinal study. While patients affected by a wide range of neurodegenerative disorders will be deeply phenotyped using clinical, imaging, and mobile health technologies, analyses will not be anchored on phenotypic clusters but on bioassays of to-be-repurposed medications as well as on genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, epigenomics, microbiomics, and pharmacogenomics analyses blinded to phenotypic data. Unique features of this cohort study include (1) a reverse biology-to-phenotype direction of biomarker development in which clinical, imaging, and mobile health technologies are subordinate to biological signals of interest; (2) hypothesis free, causally- and data driven-based analyses; (3) inclusive recruitment of patients with neurodegenerative disorders beyond clinical criteria-meeting patients with Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s diseases, and (4) a large number of longitudinally followed participants. The parallel development of serum bioassays will be aimed at linking biologically suitable subjects to already available drugs with repurposing potential in future proof-of-concept adaptive clinical trials. Although many challenges are anticipated, including the unclear pathogenic relevance of identifiable biological signals and the possibility that some signals of importance may not yet be measurable with current technologies, this cohort study abandons the anchoring role of clinico-pathologic criteria in favor of biomarker-driven disease subtyping to facilitate future biosubtype-specific disease-modifying therapeutic efforts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>A major challenge in neurobiology in the 21st century is to understand how the brain adapts with experience. Activity-dependent gene expression is integral to the synaptic plasticity underlying learning and memory; however, this process cannot be explained by a simple linear trajectory of transcription to translation within a specific neuronal population. Many other regulatory mechanisms can influence RNA metabolism and the capacity of neurons to adapt. In particular, the RNA modification N6-methyladenosine (m6A) has recently been shown to regulate RNA processing through alternative splicing, RNA stability, and translation.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Francesco Regazzoni, Luca Dedè, Alfio Quarteroni&lt;/p&gt;

We propose four novel mathematical models, describing the microscopic mechanisms of force generation in the cardiac muscle tissue, which are suitable for multiscale numerical simulations of cardiac electromechanics. Such models are based on a biophysically accurate representation of the regulatory and contractile proteins in the sarcomeres. Our models, unlike most of the sarcomere dynamics models that are available in the literature and that feature a comparable richness of detail, do not require the time-consuming Monte Carlo method for their numerical approximation. Conversely, the models that we propose only require the solution of a system of PDEs and/or ODEs (the most reduced of the four only involving 20 ODEs), thus entailing a significant computational efficiency. By focusing on the two models that feature the best trade-off between detail of description and identifiability of parameters, we propose a pipeline to calibrate such parameters starting from experimental measurements available in literature. Thanks to this pipeline, we calibrate these models for room-temperature rat and for body-temperature human cells. We show, by means of numerical simulations, that the proposed models correctly predict the main features of force generation, including the steady-state force-calcium and force-length relationships, the length-dependent prolongation of twitches and increase of peak force, the force-velocity relationship. Moreover, they correctly reproduce the Frank-Starling effect, when employed in multiscale 3D numerical simulation of cardiac electromechanics.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/KRa2qWDDbfI&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Inconsistent therapeutic efficacy of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in regenerative medicine has been documented in many clinical trials. Precise prediction on the therapeutic outcome of a MSC therapy based on the patient’s conditions would provide valuable references for clinicians to decide the treatment strategies. In this article, we performed a meta-analysis on MSC therapies for cartilage repair using machine learning. A small database was generated from published &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; and clinical studies. The unique features of our neural network model in handling missing data and calculating prediction uncertainty enabled precise prediction of post-treatment cartilage repair scores with coefficient of determination of 0.637 ± 0.005. From this model, we identified defect area percentage, defect depth percentage, implantation cell number, body weight, tissue source, and the type of cartilage damage as critical properties that significant impact cartilage repair. A dosage of 17 − 25 million MSCs was found to achieve optimal cartilage repair. Further, critical thresholds at 6% and 64% of cartilage damage in area, and 22% and 56% in depth were predicted to significantly compromise on the efficacy of MSC therapy. This study, for the first time, demonstrated machine learning of patient-specific cartilage repair post MSC therapy. This approach can be applied to identify and investigate more critical properties involved in MSC-induced cartilage repair, and adapted for other clinical indications.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/3Y1ySVN8soQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

The current quantitative reverse transcription PCR (RT-qPCR) assay recommended for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) testing in the United States requires analysis of 3 genomic targets per sample: 2 viral and 1 host. To simplify testing and reduce the volume of required reagents, we devised a multiplex RT-qPCR assay to detect SARS-CoV-2 in a single reaction. We used existing N1, N2, and RP primer and probe sets by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, but substituted fluorophores to allow multiplexing of the assay. The cycle threshold (Ct) values of our multiplex RT-qPCR were comparable to those obtained by the single assay adapted for research purposes. Low copy numbers (≥500 copies/reaction) of SARS-CoV-2 RNA were consistently detected by the multiplex RT-qPCR. Our novel multiplex RT-qPCR improves upon current single diagnostics by saving reagents, costs, time, and labor.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/FyibY_G3i4g&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Annals of Neurology: CAG Repeat Size Influences the Progression Rate of Spinocerebellar Ataxia Type 3</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25919?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In spinocerebellar ataxia type 3/Machado‐Joseph disease (SCA3/MJD), the expanded cytosine adenine guanine (CAG) repeat in &lt;i&gt;ATXN3&lt;/i&gt; is the causal mutation, and its length is the main factor in determining the age at onset (AO) of clinical symptoms. However, the contribution of the expanded CAG repeat length to the rate of disease progression after onset has remained a matter of debate, even though an understanding of this factor is crucial for experimental data on disease modifiers and their translation to clinical trials and their design.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eighty‐two Dutch patients with SCA3/MJD were evaluated annually for 15 years using the International Cooperative Ataxia Rating Scale (ICARS). Using linear growth curve models, ICARS progression rates were calculated and tested for their relation to the length of the CAG repeat expansion and to the residual age at onset (RAO): The difference between the observed AO and the AO predicted on the basis of the CAG repeat length.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On average, ICARS scores increased 2.57 points/year of disease. The length of the CAG repeat was positively correlated with a more rapid ICARS progression, explaining 30% of the differences between patients. Combining both the length of the CAG repeat and RAO as comodifiers explained up to 47% of the interpatient variation in ICARS progression.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our data imply that the length of the expanded CAG repeat in &lt;i&gt;ATXN3&lt;/i&gt; is a major determinant of clinical decline, which suggests that CAG‐dependent molecular mechanisms similar to those responsible for disease onset also contribute to the rate of disease progression in SCA3/MJD.

&lt;p&gt;Rats and marmosets were injected with pentylenetetrazol and euthanized at different time points after stimulus. Immunohistochemical detection of c‐Fos was quantified using stereological cell counting in eight neocortical regions. Our results showed that the marmoset brain has a greater neuronal activation after intense stimulation by means of pentylenetetrazol and a more complex pattern of brain activation. We speculate that these functional differences may contribute for the understanding of the different neuronal processing capacities of the neocortex in these mammals' orders.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previous evidence indicated a potential mechanism that might support the fact that primates exhibit greater neural integration capacity as a result of the activation of different structures of the central nervous system, as compared to rodents. The current study aimed to provide further evidence to confirm previous findings by analyzing the patterns of c‐Fos expression in more neocortical structures of rats and marmosets using a more robust quantitative technique and evaluating a larger number of brain areas. Nineteen Wistar rats and 21 marmosets (&lt;i&gt;Callithrix jacchus&lt;/i&gt;) were distributed among control groups (animals without injections) and animals injected with pentylenetetrazol (PTZ) and euthanized at different time points after stimulus. Immunohistochemical detection of c‐Fos was quantified using unbiased and efficient stereological cell counting in eight neocortical regions. Marmosets had a c‐Fos expression that was notably more widely expressed (5× more cells) and longer lasting (up to 3 hr) than rats. c‐Fos expression in rats presented similar patterns of expression according to the function of the brain cortical structures (associative, sensorial, and motor functions), which was not observed for marmosets (in which no clear pattern could be drawn, and a more diverse profile emerged). Our results provide evidence that the marmoset brain has a greater neuronal activation after intense stimulation by means of PTZ and a more complex pattern of brain activation. We speculate that these functional differences may contribute for the understanding of the different neuronal processing capacities of the neocortex in these mammals' orders.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Altered Expression of Glial Gap Junction Proteins Cx43, Cx30, and Cx47 in the 5XFAD Model of Alzheimer’s Disease</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.582934</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Glial gap junction proteins, called connexins (Cxs), form gap junctions in the central nervous system (CNS) to allow the bidirectional cytosolic exchange of molecules between adjacent cells. Their involvement in inheritable diseases and the use of experimental animal models that closely mimic such diseases revealed the critical role of glial GJs in myelination and homeostasis. Cxs are also implicated in acquired demyelinating disorders, such as Multiple Sclerosis (MS) and Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Animal and human studies have revealed a role of the astrocytic Cx43 in the progression of AD but the role of Cx47, which is the main partner of Cx43 in the astrocyte-oligodendrocyte GJs is still unknown. The aim of this study was to investigate the astrocytic connexins, Cx43 and Cx30 in relation to oligodendrocytic Cx47 in the cortex and thalamus of the 5XFAD mouse model of AD. The model was characterized by increased Aβ deposition, gliosis, neuronal loss, and memory impairment. Compared to wild-type mice, Cx43 and Cx30 showed increased immunoreactivity in older 5XFAD mice, reflecting astrogliosis, while Cx47 immunoreactivity was reduced. Moreover, Cx47 GJ plaques showed reduced colocalization with Cx43 plaques. Oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) and mature oligodendrocyte populations were also depleted, and myelin deficits were observed. Our findings indicate reduced astrocyte-oligodendrocyte gap junction connectivity and possibly a shift in Cx43 expression toward astrocyte-astrocyte gap junctions and/or hemichannels, that could impair oligodendrocyte homeostasis and myelination. However, other factors, such as Aβ toxicity, could directly affect oligodendrocyte survival in AD. Our study provides evidence that Cxs might have implications in the progression of AD, although the role of oligodendrocyte Cxs in AD requires further investigation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.568614</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Accurate removal of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) signal outside the brain, a.k.a., skull stripping, is a key step in the brain image pre-processing pipelines. In rodents, this is mostly achieved by manually editing a brain mask, which is time-consuming and operator dependent. Automating this step is particularly challenging in rodents as compared to humans, because of differences in brain/scalp tissue geometry, image resolution with respect to brain-scalp distance, and tissue contrast around the skull. In this study, we proposed a deep-learning-based framework, U-Net, to automatically identify the rodent brain boundaries in MR images. The U-Net method is robust against inter-subject variability and eliminates operator dependence. To benchmark the efficiency of this method, we trained and validated our model using both in-house collected and publicly available datasets. In comparison to current state-of-the-art methods, our approach achieved superior averaged Dice similarity coefficient to ground truth T2-weighted rapid acquisition with relaxation enhancement and T2&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt;-weighted echo planar imaging data in both rats and mice (all p &amp;lt; 0.05), demonstrating robust performance of our approach across various MRI protocols.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroinformatics: Classification of Schizophrenia by Functional Connectivity Strength Using Functional Near Infrared Spectroscopy</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fninf.2020.00040</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) has been widely employed in the objective diagnosis of patients with schizophrenia during a verbal fluency task (VFT). Most of the available methods depended on the time-domain features extracted from the data of single or multiple channels. The present study proposed an alternative method based on the functional connectivity strength (FCS) derived from an individual channel. The data measured 100 patients with schizophrenia and 100 healthy controls, who were used to train the classifiers and to evaluate their performance. Different classifiers were evaluated, and support machine vector achieved the best performance. In order to reduce the dimensional complexity of the feature domain, principal component analysis (PCA) was applied. The classification results by using an individual channel, a combination of several channels, and 52 ensemble channels with and without the dimensional reduced technique were compared. It provided a new approach to identify schizophrenia, improving the objective diagnosis of this mental disorder. FCS from three channels on the medial prefrontal and left ventrolateral prefrontal cortices rendered accuracy as high as 84.67%, sensitivity at 92.00%, and specificity at 70%. The neurophysiological significance of the change at these regions was consistence with the major syndromes of schizophrenia.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: β-Amyloid Plaque Reduction in the Hippocampus After Focused Ultrasound-Induced Blood–Brain Barrier Opening in Alzheimer’s Disease</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.593672</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The blood–brain barrier (BBB) limits therapeutic delivery in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and other neurological disorders. Animal models have demonstrated safe BBB opening and reduction in β-amyloid plaque with focused ultrasound (FUS). We recently demonstrated the feasibility, safety, and reversibility of FUS-induced BBB opening in the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex in six participants with early AD. We now report the effect of BBB opening with FUS treatment on β-amyloid plaque. Six participants underwent &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F-Florbetaben PET scan at baseline and 1 week after the completion of the third FUS treatment (60 days interval). PET analysis comparing the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex in the treated and untreated hemispheres revealed a decrease in the ratio of &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F-Florbetaben ligand binding. The standard uptake value ratios (SUVr) reduction ranged from 2.7% to 10% with an average of 5.05% (±2.76) suggesting a decrease in β-amyloid plaque.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Auditory Processing Differences Correlate With Autistic Traits in Males</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.584704</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) has high prevalence among males compared to females but mechanisms underlying the differences between sexes are poorly investigated. Moreover, autistic symptoms show a continuity in the general population and are referred to as autistic traits in people without an ASD diagnosis. One of the symptoms of ASD is sensory processing differences both in sensitivity and perception. To investigate sensory processing differences in autistic traits, we examined auditory and visual processing in a healthy population. We recruited 75 individuals (39 females and 36 males, mean age = 23.01 years, SD = 3.23 years) and assessed autistic traits using the Autism Spectrum Quotient, and sensory sensitivity using the Sensory Sensitivity Scales. Sensory processing in the visual domain was examined with the radial motion stimulus and the auditory domain was assessed with the 1,000 Hz pure tone stimulus with electroencephalography-evoked potentials. The results showed that the auditory sensitivity scores of the males (r&lt;sub&gt;aud&lt;/sub&gt; (34) = 0.396, p&lt;sub&gt;aud&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.017) and the visual sensitivity scores of females were correlated with autistic traits (r&lt;sub&gt;vis&lt;/sub&gt; (37) = 0.420, p&lt;sub&gt;vis&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.008). Moreover, the P2 latency for the auditory stimulus was prolonged in the participants with a higher level of autistic traits (r&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; (61) = 0.411, p = 0.008), and this correlation was only observed in males (r&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; (31) = 0.542, p = 0.001). We propose that auditory processing differences are related to autistic traits in neurotypicals, particularly in males. Our findings emphasize the importance of considering sex differences in autistic traits and ASD.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Electrophysiological and Behavioral Correlates of Valence, Arousal and Subjective Significance in the Lexical Decision Task</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.567220</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The emotional properties of words, such as valence and arousal, influence the way we perceive and process verbal stimuli. Recently, subjective significance was found to be an additional factor describing the activational aspect of emotional reactions, which is vital for the cognitive consequences of emotional stimuli processing. Subjective significance represents the form of mental activation specific to reflective mind processing. The Lexical Decision Task (LDT) is a paradigm allowing the investigation of the involuntary processing of meaning and differentiating this processing from the formal processing of the perceptual features of words. In this study, we wanted to search for the consequences of valence, arousal, and subjective significance for the involuntary processing of verbal stimuli meaning indexed by both behavioral measures (reaction latencies) and electrophysiological measures (Event-Related Potentials: ERPs). We expected subjective significance, as the reflective form of activation, to shorten response latencies in LDT. We also expected subjective significance to modulate the amplitude of the ERP FN400 component, reducing the negative-going deflection of the potential. We expected valence to shape the LPC component amplitude, differentiating between negative and positive valences, since the LPC indexes the meaning processing. Indeed, the results confirmed our expectations and showed that subjective significance is a factor independent from the arousal and valence that shapes the involuntary processing of verbal stimuli, especially the detection of a link between stimulus and meaning indexed by the FN400. Moreover, we found that the LPC amplitude was differentiated by valence level.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Neural Correlates of Smartphone Dependence in Adolescents</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.564629</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Increases in depressive and suicide-related symptoms among United States adolescents have been recently linked to increased use of smartphones. Understanding of the brain mechanisms that underlie the potential smartphone dependence may help develop interventions to address this important problem. In this exploratory study, we investigated the neural mechanisms underlying potential smartphone dependence in a sample of 19 adolescent volunteers who completed self-assessments of their smartphone dependence, depressive symptoms, and sleep problems. All 19 adolescents underwent diffusion MRI that allowed for assessment of white matter structural connectivity within the framework of connectomics. Based on previous literature on the neurobiology of addiction, we hypothesized a disruption of network centrality of three nodes in the mesolimbic network: Nucleus Accumbens, anterior cingulate cortex, and amygdala. Our results showed positive correlations between the node centrality of the right amygdala and self-reported smartphone dependence, between smartphone dependence and sleep problems, and between sleep problems and depressive symptoms. A higher phone dependence was observed in females compared to males. Supported by these results, we propose a model of how smartphone dependence can be linked to aberrations in brain networks, sex, sleep disturbances, and depression in adolescents.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Robust EEG-Based Decoding of Auditory Attention With High-RMS-Level Speech Segments in Noisy Conditions</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.557534</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The attended speech stream can be detected robustly, even in adverse auditory scenarios with auditory attentional modulation, and can be decoded using electroencephalographic (EEG) data. Speech segmentation based on the relative root-mean-square (RMS) intensity can be used to estimate segmental contributions to perception in noisy conditions. High-RMS-level segments contain crucial information for speech perception. Hence, this study aimed to investigate the effect of high-RMS-level speech segments on auditory attention decoding performance under various signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions. Scalp EEG signals were recorded when subjects listened to the attended speech stream in the mixed speech narrated concurrently by two Mandarin speakers. The temporal response function was used to identify the attended speech from EEG responses of tracking to the temporal envelopes of intact speech and high-RMS-level speech segments alone, respectively. Auditory decoding performance was then analyzed under various SNR conditions by comparing EEG correlations to the attended and ignored speech streams. The accuracy of auditory attention decoding based on the temporal envelope with high-RMS-level speech segments was not inferior to that based on the temporal envelope of intact speech. Cortical activity correlated more strongly with attended than with ignored speech under different SNR conditions. These results suggest that EEG recordings corresponding to high-RMS-level speech segments carry crucial information for the identification and tracking of attended speech in the presence of background noise. This study also showed that with the modulation of auditory attention, attended speech can be decoded more robustly from neural activity than from behavioral measures under a wide range of SNR.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Sensory Prediction of Limb Movement Is Critical for Automatic Online Control</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.549537</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Fast, online control of movement is an essential component of human motor skills, as it allows automatic correction of inaccurate planning. The present study explores the role of two types of concurrent signals in error correction: predicted visual reafferences coming from an internal representation of the hand, and actual visual feedback from the hand. While the role of sensory feedback in these corrections is well-established, much less is known about sensory prediction. The relative contributions of these two types of signals remain a subject of debate, as they are naturally interconnected. We address the issue in a study that compares online correction of an artificially induced, undetected planning error. Two conditions are tested, which only differ with respect to the accuracy of predicted visual reafferences. In the first, “Prism” experiment, a planning error is introduced by prisms that laterally displace the seen hand prior to hand movement onset. The prism-induced conflict between visual and proprioceptive inputs of the hand also generates an erroneous prediction of visual reafferences of the moving hand. In the second, “Jump” experiment, a planning error is introduced by a jump in the target position, during the orienting saccade, prior to hand movement onset. In the latter condition, predicted reafferences of the hand remained intact. In both experiments, after hand movement onset, the hand was either visible or hidden, which enabled us to manipulate the presence (or absence) of visual feedback during movement execution. The Prism experiment highlighted late and reduced correction of the planning error, even when natural visual feedback of the moving hand was available. In the Jump experiment, early and automatic corrections of the planning error were observed, even in the absence of visual feedback from the moving hand. Therefore, when predicted reafferences were accurate (the Jump experiment), visual feedback was processed rapidly and automatically. When they were erroneous (the Prism experiment), the same visual feedback was less efficient, and required voluntary, and late, control. Our study clearly demonstrates that in natural environments, reliable prediction is critical in the preprocessing of visual feedback, for fast and accurate movement.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neural Circuits: The Interplay of Synaptic Plasticity and Scaling Enables Self-Organized Formation and Allocation of Multiple Memory Representations</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncir.2020.541728</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;It is commonly assumed that memories about experienced stimuli are represented by groups of highly interconnected neurons called cell assemblies. This requires allocating and storing information in the neural circuitry, which happens through synaptic weight adaptations at different types of synapses. In general, memory allocation is associated with synaptic changes at feed-forward synapses while memory storage is linked with adaptation of recurrent connections. It remains, however, largely unknown how memory allocation and storage can be achieved and the adaption of the different synapses involved be coordinated to allow for a faithful representation of multiple memories without disruptive interference between them. In this theoretical study, by using network simulations and phase space analyses, we show that the interplay between long-term synaptic plasticity and homeostatic synaptic scaling organizes simultaneously the adaptations of feed-forward and recurrent synapses such that a new stimulus forms a new memory and where different stimuli are assigned to distinct cell assemblies. The resulting dynamics can reproduce experimental in-vivo data, focusing on how diverse factors, such as neuronal excitability and network connectivity, influence memory formation. Thus, the here presented model suggests that a few fundamental synaptic mechanisms may suffice to implement memory allocation and storage in neural circuitry.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Prior Hypoxia Exposure Enhances Murine Microglial Inflammatory Gene Expression in vitro Without Concomitant H3K4me3 Enrichment</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.535549</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Hypoxia (Hx) is a component of multiple disorders, including stroke and sleep-disordered breathing, which often precede or are comorbid with neurodegenerative diseases. However, little is known about how hypoxia affects the ability of microglia, resident CNS macrophages, to respond to subsequent inflammatory challenges that are often present during neurodegenerative processes. We, therefore, tested the hypothesis that hypoxia would enhance or “prime” microglial pro-inflammatory gene expression in response to a later inflammatory challenge without programmatically increasing basal levels of pro-inflammatory cytokine expression. To test this, we pre-exposed immortalized N9 and primary microglia to hypoxia (1% O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) for 16 h and then challenged them with pro-inflammatory lipopolysaccharide (LPS) either immediately or 3–6 days following hypoxic exposure. We used RNA sequencing coupled with chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing to analyze primed microglial inflammatory gene expression and modifications to histone H3 lysine 4 trimethylation (H3K4me3) at the promoters of primed genes. We found that microglia exhibited enhanced responses to LPS 3 days and 6 days post-hypoxia. Surprisingly, however, the majority of primed genes were not enriched for H3K4me3 acutely following hypoxia exposure. Using the bioinformatics tool MAGICTRICKS and reversible pharmacological inhibition, we found that primed genes required the transcriptional activities of NF-κB. These findings provide evidence that hypoxia pre-exposure could lead to persistent and aberrant inflammatory responses in the context of CNS disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Glycyrrhizic acid (GA) is the substance with the highest content of triterpenoid saponins that can be extracted from licorice, and has anti-inflammatory, neuroprotective, and anticancer functions, among others. The aim of this study was to investigate the protective effect of GA on cognitive decline in middle-aged mice and explore its mechanisms. We injected GA by the tail vein of C57BL/6 mice and measured their cognitive levels using the Morris water maze. The Morris water maze results demonstrated that GA improved learning and memory abilities in middle-aged mice. Furthermore, the RNA-sequencing and flow cytometric analyses revealed that GA could increase T and B cells. We then confirmed the relationship between cognition and the immune system in the immune-deficient B-NDG mouse model. Our results suggest that GA improves cognition in aging mice by regulating T/B cell proliferation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Quantitative Digitography Measures Fine Motor Disturbances in Chronically Treated HIV Similar to Parkinson’s Disease</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.539598</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Introduction: Motor and cognitive deficits were compared in aging, chronically treated human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) people, people with mild-to-moderate stage Parkinson’s disease (PD), and healthy controls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Groups consisted of 36 people with PD, 28 with HIV infection, and 28 healthy controls. Motor function was assessed with the Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS-III) and a rapid alternating finger tapping (RAFT) task on an engineered keyboard known as Quantitative Digitography (QDG). Executive function, verbal memory, and visuospatial processing were assessed using standard neuropsychological tests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: HIV demonstrated RAFT deficits similar to PD such as reduced amplitude (P = 0.023) and greater amplitude variability (P = 0.019) in the index finger when compared to controls. This fine motor disturbance correlated with HIV’s immune health, measured by their CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cell count (P &amp;lt; 0.01). The UPDRS did not yield motor differences between HIV and controls. Executive function and verbal memory were impaired in HIV (P = 0.006, P = 0.016, respectively), but not in PD; visuospatial processing was similarly impaired in HIV and PD (P &amp;lt; 0.05) although motor deficits predominated in PD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusions: Fine motor bradykinesia measured quantitatively by QDG RAFT holds promise as a marker of motor decline related to current immune health in aging HIV patients and may be useful in longitudinal studies regarding mechanisms of immunosenescence vs. potential toxicity of combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) in this population. Additionally, motor and cognitive networks in HIV may be affected differently as the disease progresses as observed in the differential patterns of impairment between HIV and PD, providing insight into the mechanisms of brain deterioration in HIV.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

For infectious disease prevention, policy-makers are typically required to base policy decisions in light of operational and monetary restrictions, prohibiting implementation of all candidate interventions. To inform the evidence-base underpinning policy decision making, mathematical and health economic modelling can be a valuable constituent.
Applied to England, this study aims to identify the optimal target age groups when extending a seasonal influenza vaccination programme of at-risk individuals to those individuals at low risk of developing complications following infection. To perform this analysis, we utilise an age- and strain-structured transmission model that includes immunity propagation mechanisms which link prior season epidemiological outcomes to immunity at the beginning of the following season. Making use of surveillance data from the past decade in conjunction with our dynamic model, we simulate transmission dynamics of seasonal influenza in England from 2012 to 2018. We infer that modified susceptibility due to natural infection in the previous influenza season is the only immunity propagation mechanism to deliver a non-negligible impact on the transmission dynamics. Further, we discerned case ascertainment to be higher for young infants compared to adults under 65 years old, and uncovered a decrease in case ascertainment as age increased from 65 to 85 years of age.
Our health economic appraisal sweeps vaccination age space to determine threshold vaccine dose prices achieving cost-effectiveness under differing paired strategies. In particular, we model offering vaccination to all those low-risk individuals younger than a given age (but no younger than two years old) and all low-risk individuals older than a given age, while maintaining vaccination of at-risk individuals of any age. All posited strategies were deemed cost-effective. In general, the addition of low-risk vaccination programmes whose coverage encompassed children and young adults (aged 20 and below) were highly cost-effective. The inclusion of elder age-groups to the low-risk programme typically lessened the cost-effectiveness. Notably, elderly-centric programmes vaccinating from 65-75 years and above had the least permitted expense per vaccine.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/YXYrHOVQBO8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Social behaviors are ubiquitous and crucial to an animal’s survival and success. The behaviors an animal performs in a social setting are affected by internal factors, inputs from the environment, and interactions with others. To quantify social behaviors, we need to measure both the stochastic nature of the behavior of isolated individuals and how this behavioral repertoire changes as a function of the environment and interactions between individuals. We probed the behavior of male and female fruit flies in a circular arena as individuals and within all possible pairings. By combining measurements of the animals’ position in the arena with an unsupervised analysis of their behaviors, we define the effects of position in the environment and the presence of a partner on locomotion, grooming, singing, and other behaviors that make up an animal’s repertoire. We find that geometric context tunes behavioral preference, pairs of animals synchronize their behavioral preferences across shared trials, and paired individuals display signatures of behavioral mimicry.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/J7-bscTtJHs&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Cholesterol binding to the sterol-sensing region of Niemann Pick C1 protein confines dynamics of its N-terminal domain</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/FqaJ-_IesIk/article</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Vikas Dubey, Behruz Bozorg, Daniel Wüstner, Himanshu Khandelia&lt;/p&gt;

Lysosomal accumulation of cholesterol is a hallmark of Niemann Pick type C (NPC) disease caused by mutations primarily in the lysosomal membrane protein NPC1. NPC1 contains a transmembrane sterol-sensing domain (SSD), which is supposed to regulate protein activity upon cholesterol binding, but the mechanisms underlying this process are poorly understood. Using atomistic simulations, we show that in the absence of cholesterol in the SSD, the luminal domains of NPC1 are highly dynamic, resulting in the disengagement of the NTD from the rest of the protein. The disengaged NPC1 adopts a flexed conformation that approaches the lipid bilayer, and could represent a conformational state primed to receive a sterol molecule from the soluble lysosomal cholesterol carrier NPC2. The binding of cholesterol to the SSD of NPC1 allosterically suppresses the conformational dynamics of the luminal domains resulting in an upright NTD conformation. The presence of an additional 20% cholesterol in the membrane has negligible impact on this process. The additional presence of an NTD-bound cholesterol suppresses the flexing of the NTD. We propose that cholesterol acts as an allosteric effector, and the modulation of NTD dynamics by the SSD-bound cholesterol constitutes an allosteric feedback mechanism in NPC1 that controls cholesterol abundance in the lysosomal membrane.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/FqaJ-_IesIk&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Comparative Neurology: Ocular dominance plasticity: Molecular mechanisms revisited</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/cne.25001?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ocular dominance plasticity (ODP) is a type of cortical plasticity operating in visual cortex of mammals that are endowed with binocular vision based on the competition‐driven disparity. Earlier, a molecular mechanism was proposed that catecholamines play an important role in the maintenance of ODP in kittens. Having survived the initial test, the hypothesis was further advanced to identify noradrenaline (NA) as a key factor that regulates ODP in the immature cortex. Later, the ODP‐promoting effect of NA is extended to the adult with age‐related limitations. Following the enhanced NA availability, the chain events downstream lead to the β‐adrenoreceptor‐induced cAMP accumulation, which in turn activates the protein kinase A. Eventually, the protein kinase translocates to the cell nucleus to activate cAMP responsive element binding protein (CREB). CREB is a cellular transcription factor that controls the transcription of various genes, underpinning neuronal plasticity and long‐term memory. In the advent of molecular genetics in that various types of new tools have become available with relative ease, ODP research has lightly adopted in the rodent model the original concepts and methodologies. Here, after briefly tracing the strategic maturation of our quest, the review moves to the later development of the field, with the emphasis placed around the following issues: (a) Are we testing ODP per se? (b) What does monocular deprivation deprive of the immature cortex? (c) The critical importance of binocular competition, (d) What is the adult plasticity? (e) Excitation–Inhibition balance in local circuits, and (f) Species differences in the animal models.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

&lt;p&gt;Herculano‐Houzel et al. examine numbers of neurons in the brain of 13 bat species and find that the apparently “enlarged” cerebellum of small echolocating bats has the same proportion of brain neurons as other mammals, and is more likely simply the result of a diminutive cerebral cortex.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Small echolocating bats are set apart from most other mammals by their relatively large cerebellum, a feature that has been associated to echolocation, as it is presumed to indicate a relatively enlarged number of neurons in the cerebellum in comparison to other brain structures. Here we quantify the neuronal composition of the cerebral cortex, cerebellum and remaining brain structures of seven species of large Pteropodid bats (formerly classified as megachiropterans), one of which echolocates, and six species of small bats (formerly classified as microchiropterans), all of which echolocate. This chiropteran data is compared to 60 mammalian species in our dataset to determine whether the relatively large cerebellum of the small echolocating bats, and possibly that of the echolocating Pteropodid, contains a relatively enlarged number of neurons. We find no evidence that the distribution of neurons differs between microchiropterans and megachiropterans, but our data indicate that microchiropterans, like the smallest shrew in our dataset, have diminutive cerebral cortices, which makes the cerebellum appear relatively large. We propose that, in agreement with the diminutive brain size of the earliest fossil mammals, this is a plesiomorphic, not a derived, feature of microchiropteran brains. The results of this study also reveal important neural characteristics related to the phylogenetic affinities and relationships of the chiropterans.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;img alt=&quot;The effect of optic nerve section on form deprivation myopia in the guinea pig&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/2a0b0582-4e0b-412c-abf4-3b37e72c7705/cne24961-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Myopic eyes grow too long so images are focused short of the retina. What controls this excessive growth? We know that across species, deprivation of detailed vision (form deprivation, FD) increases the rate of eye elongation and induces myopia. When the FD ceases, these myopic eyes then slow their growth and recover from their myopia. We show here that in young mammalian eyes, this bidirectional response still occurs after the optic nerve is cut, implicating local retinal control of eye growth. However, the FD eye grows excessively after optic nerve section showing that the fine‐tuning of eye growth requires an intact optic nerve.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Myopia is induced when a growing eye wears a diffuser that deprives it of detailed spatial vision (form deprivation, FD). In chickens with optic nerve section (ONS), FD myopia still occurs, suggesting that the signals underlying myopia reside within the eye. As avian eyes differ from mammals, we asked whether local mechanisms also underlie FD myopia in a mammalian model. Young guinea pigs underwent either sham surgery followed by FD (SHAM + FD, &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 7); or ONS followed by FD (ONS + FD, &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 7); or ONS without FD (ONS, &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 9). FD was initiated 3 days after surgery with a diffuser that was worn on the surgically treated eye for 14 days. Animals with ONS + FD developed −8.9 D of relative myopia and elongated by 135 μm more than in their untreated eyes after 2 weeks of FD. These changes were significantly greater than those in SHAM + FD animals (−5.5 D and 40 μm of elongation after 14 days of FD), and reflected exaggerated elongation of the posterior vitreous chamber. The myopia reversed when FD was discontinued, despite ONS, but eyes did not recover back to normal (30 days after surgery, ONS + FD eyes still retained −3 D of relative myopia when SHAM+FD animals had returned to normal). No long‐term residual myopia was present after ONS alone, ruling out a surgical artifact. Although the gross mechanism signaling myopic ocular growth and its recovery in the young mammalian eye does not require an intact optic nerve, its fine‐tuning is disrupted by ONS.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

&lt;p&gt;

We previously reported in young chicks bidirectional gene expression regulation of the &lt;i&gt;BMP2&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;4&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;7&lt;/i&gt; in retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) after visual manipulation, tied to the direction of induced eye growth changes. Here we report local (regional) differences in expression patterns that were also treatment specific. Both &lt;i&gt;BMP2&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;BMP4&lt;/i&gt; genes showed the expected increased expression with imposed myopic defocus (+10 D lens) after 2 and 48 hr, albeit limited to central and mid‐peripheral RPE zones. In contrast, the expected decrease in &lt;i&gt;BMP2&lt;/i&gt; gene expression with imposed hyperopic defocus (−10 D lens) was evident across all three zones after both 2 and 48 hr, with similar patterns observed after 48 hr with FD. Similar but smaller changes were recorded for &lt;i&gt;BMP4&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;BMP7&lt;/i&gt; gene expression with the latter myopia‐inducing treatments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We previously reported bidirectional gene expression regulation of the Bone Morphogenetic Proteins (&lt;i&gt;BMP2&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;4&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;7&lt;/i&gt;) in chick retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) in response to imposed optical defocus and form‐deprivation (FD). This study investigated whether there are local (regional) differences in these effects. 19‐day old White‐Leghorn chicks wore monocular +10 or − 10 D lenses, or diffusers (FD) for 2 or 48 hr, after which RPE samples were collected from both eyes, from a central circular zone (3 mm radius), and 3 mm wide annular mid‐peripheral and peripheral zones in all cases. &lt;i&gt;BMP2&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;4&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;7&lt;/i&gt; gene expression levels in RPE from treated and fellow control eyes were compared as well as differences across zones. With the +10 D lens, increased expression of both &lt;i&gt;BMP2&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;BMP4&lt;/i&gt; genes was observed in central and mid‐peripheral zones but not the peripheral zone after 2 and 48 hr. In contrast, with the −10 D lens &lt;i&gt;BMP2&lt;/i&gt; gene expression was significantly decreased in all three zones after 2 and 48 hr. Similar patterns of &lt;i&gt;BMP2&lt;/i&gt; gene expression were observed in all three zones after 48 hr of FD. Smaller changes were recorded for &lt;i&gt;BMP4&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;BMP7&lt;/i&gt; gene expression for both myopia‐inducing treatments. That optical defocus‐ and FD‐induced changes in &lt;i&gt;BMP&lt;/i&gt; gene expression in chick RPE show treatment‐dependent local (regional) differences suggest important differences in the nature and contributions of local retinal and underlying RPE regions to eye growth regulation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

&lt;p&gt;Many animals, just like humans, are able to categorize objects based on physical appearance. In humans, training improves performance in such tasks by distorting perceived similarity at the category boundary, a nonlinear effect termed categorical perception (CP). Here we sought evidence for a comparable effect in a lower vertebrate. Based on stimuli generated using a novel image morphing technique, we describe a series of visual discrimination experiments demonstrating CP of facial patterns in a reef fish, providing insight into the evolutionary origins and neural bases of this ability.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Categorical perception (CP) is the phenomenon by which a smoothly varying stimulus property undergoes a nonlinear transformation during processing in the brain. Consequently, the stimuli are perceived as belonging to distinct categories separated by a sharp boundary. Originally thought to be largely innate, the discovery of CP in tasks such as novel image discrimination has piqued the interest of cognitive scientists because it provides compelling evidence that learning can shape a category's perceptual boundaries. CP has been particularly closely studied in human face perception. In nonprimates, there is evidence for CP for sound and color discrimination, but not for image or face discrimination. Here, we investigate the potential for learned CP in a lower vertebrate, the damselfish &lt;i&gt;Pomacentrus amboinensis.&lt;/i&gt; Specifically, we tested whether the ability of these fish to discriminate complex facial patterns tracked categorical rather than metric differences in the stimuli. We first trained the fish to discriminate sets of two facial patterns. Next, we morphed between these patterns and determined the just noticeable difference (JND) between a morph and original image. Finally, we tested for CP by analyzing the discrimination ability of the fish for pairs of JND stimuli along the spectrum of morphs between two original images. Discrimination performance was significant for the image pair straddling the boundary between categories, and chance for equivalent stimulus pairs on either side, thus producing the classic “category boundary” effect. Our results reveal how perception can be influenced in a top‐down manner even in the absence of a visual cortex.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

&lt;p&gt;Two decades ago Jack Pettigrew and I proposed the interhemispheric switch model of binocular rivalry and the sticky switch model of bipolar disorder. Here I describe the genesis, development, supporting data, and current status of these models. I also reflect on doing science with Pettigrew, his remarkable life in science, and how perspectives in science and medicine can fluctuate like the very phenomena on which we worked.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Science and medicine aim to identify verifiable and replicable truths. However, the paths to such truths are frequently characterized by swinging pendulums of opposing perspectives. This is especially so in human neuroscience and the brain‐based clinical sciences, where the target of investigation is the most complex of all biological systems. This article overviews a set of interrelated neuroscientific and clinical hypotheses, models, experiments, and predictions with which I have been involved for the last two decades. Traversing visual neuroscience, consciousness science, genetics, chronobiology, and biological and clinical psychiatry, the work illustrates how developments in science and medicine can occur through a combination of synthesis, serendipity, and experimentation. The article also reflects on doing science with the inimitable John “Jack” Pettigrew, and outlines how Pettigrew and I conceived, proposed, tested, and developed two new scientific models—one on neural mechanisms of binocular rivalry, the other on the pathophysiology of bipolar disorder. I also provide an update on various aspects of our models and data, and describe lessons learned from Pettigrew on how perspectives in science exhibit their own fluctuations, ironically like the very phenomena on which we worked.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

&lt;p&gt;This review in memoriam of Jack Pettigrew provides an overview of research into the phenomenon of perceptual rivalry, across a wide variety of species including insects, fish, reptiles, and primates. Perceptual rivalry is characterized by spontaneous alternations in perceptual state in response to ambiguous or conflicting sensory input. We highlight several interesting commonalities across species and use a comparative approach to better understand how the brain suppresses opposing sensory signals and generates alternations in perceptual dominance.

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This review in memoriam of Jack Pettigrew provides an overview of past and current research into the phenomenon of multistable perception across multiple animal species. Multistable perception is characterized by two or more perceptual interpretations spontaneously alternating, or rivaling, when animals are exposed to stimuli with inherent sensory ambiguity. There is a wide array of ambiguous stimuli across sensory modalities, ranging from the configural changes observed in simple line drawings, such as the famous Necker cube, to the alternating perception of entire visual scenes that can be instigated by interocular conflict. The latter phenomenon, called binocular rivalry, in particular caught the attention of the late Jack Pettigrew, who combined his interest in the neuronal basis of perception with a unique comparative biological approach that considered ambiguous sensation as a fundamental problem of sensory systems that has shaped the brain throughout evolution. Here, we examine the research findings on visual perceptual alternation and suppression in a wide variety of species including insects, fish, reptiles, and primates. We highlight several interesting commonalities across species and behavioral indicators of perceptual alternation. In addition, we show how the comparative approach provides new avenues for understanding how the brain suppresses opposing sensory signals and generates alternations in perceptual dominance.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

&lt;p&gt;The regenerative capacity of the zebrafish, and the stereotypic organization of its retinal cell populations, enable examination of the specificity by which retinal Müller glial cells replace neurons that are lost. Zebrafish have four cone types, with peak sensitivities to red, green, blue, and ultraviolet wavelengths. Using a targeted cell ablation approach, we found that Müller glia produced cones of all types when all cones, red cones and UV cones were ablated. In contrast, blue cone ablation largely failed to generate cones. The relative proportions of regenerated cells of each type depended on the cone types that were ablated, and was biased toward the major cone type that was lost.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A major challenge in regenerative medicine is replacing cells lost through injury or disease. While significant progress has been made, much remains unknown about the accuracy of native regenerative programs in cell replacement. Here, we capitalized on the regenerative capacity and stereotypic retinal organization of zebrafish to determine the specificity with which retinal Müller glial cells replace lost neuronal cell types. By utilizing a targeted genetic ablation technique, we restricted death to all or to distinct cone photoreceptor types (red, blue, or UV‐sensitive cones), enabling us to compare the composition of cones that are regenerated. We found that Müller glia produce cones of all types upon nondiscriminate ablation of these photoreceptors, or upon selective ablation of red or UV cones. Pan‐ablation of cones led to regeneration of the various cone types in relative abundances that resembled those of nonablated controls, that is, red &amp;gt; green &amp;gt; UV ~ blue cones. Moreover, selective loss of red or UV cones biased production toward the cone type that was ablated. In contrast, ablation of blue cones alone largely failed to induce cone production at all, although it did induce cell division in Müller glia. The failure to produce cones upon selective elimination of blue cones may be due to their low abundance compared to other cone types. Alternatively, it may be that blue cone death alone does not trigger a change in progenitor competency to support cone genesis. Our findings add to the growing notion that cell replacement during regeneration does not perfectly mimic programs of cell generation during development.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

&lt;p&gt;Similarities in gene expression patterns prompted our speculations on the common developmental and evolutionary origin of the claustrum and the subplate. Here we systematically compare the currently available data on cytoarchitecture, evolutionary origin, gene expression, cell types, birthdates, neurogenesis, lineage and migration, circuit connectivity, and cell death of the neurons that contribute to the claustrum and subplate. Almost all of the markers we examined that were expressed in the subplate/Layer 6b were also expressed in the claustral complex, but not all claustrum specific or enriched genes were expressed in subplate/Layer 6b, suggesting overall similarities, but also some differences. There are numerous similarities between the adult connectivity patters of Layer 6b and claustrum. In particular, both have extensive cortical connections. However, there are differences in the relative strength of their reciprocal connectivity with various other structures in the adult. Based on their similarities and differences we propose a partially common early evolutionary origin of the cells that become claustrum and subplate, a likely scenario that is shared in these cell populations across all amniotes.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The human claustrum, a major hub of widespread neocortical connections, is a thin, bilateral sheet of gray matter located between the insular cortex and the striatum. The subplate is a largely transient cortical structure that contains some of the earliest generated neurons of the cerebral cortex and has important developmental functions to establish intra‐ and extracortical connections. In human and macaque some subplate cells undergo regulated cell death, but some remain as interstitial white matter cells. In mouse and rat brains a compact layer is formed, Layer 6b, and it remains underneath the cortex, adjacent to the white matter. Whether Layer 6b in rodents is homologous to primate subplate or interstitial white matter cells is still debated. Gene expression patterns, such as those of &lt;i&gt;Nurr1/Nr4a2&lt;/i&gt;, have suggested that the rodent subplate and the persistent subplate cells in Layer 6b and the claustrum might have similar origins. Moreover, the birthdates of the claustrum and Layer 6b are similarly precocious in mice. These observations prompted our speculations on the common developmental and evolutionary origin of the claustrum and the subplate. Here we systematically compare the currently available data on cytoarchitecture, evolutionary origin, gene expression, cell types, birthdates, neurogenesis, lineage and migration, circuit connectivity, and cell death of the neurons that contribute to the claustrum and subplate. Based on their similarities and differences we propose a partially common early evolutionary origin of the cells that become claustrum and subplate, a likely scenario that is shared in these cell populations across all amniotes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

&lt;p&gt;By combining intracortical electrical microstimulation (ICMS) with intrinsic optical imaging, we find that focal ICMS at single digit locations in monkey cortex (Areas 3a, 3b, 1, 2, and M1) reveals known anatomical connections. This novel method of studying cortical connections is in vivo, rapid, targeted, and mesoscale.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To map in vivo cortical circuitry at the mesoscale, we applied a novel approach to map interareal functional connectivity. Electrical intracortical microstimulation (ICMS) in conjunction with optical imaging of intrinsic signals (OIS) was used map functional connections in somatosensory cortical areas in anesthetized squirrel monkeys. ICMS produced activations that were focal and that displayed responses which were stimulation intensity dependent. ICMS in supragranular layers of Brodmann Areas 3b, 1, 2, 3a, and M1 evoked interareal activation patterns that were topographically appropriate and appeared consistent with known anatomical connectivity. Specifically, ICMS revealed Area 3b connections with Area 1; Area 1 connections with Areas 2 and 3a; Area 2 connections with Areas 1, 3a, and M1; Area 3a connections with Areas M1, 1, and 2; and M1 connections with Areas 3a, 1, and 2. These somatosensory connectivity patterns were reminiscent of feedforward patterns observed anatomically, although feedback contributions are also likely present. Further consistent with anatomical connectivity, intra‐areal and intra‐areal patterns of activation were patchy with patch sizes of 200–300 μm. In summary, ICMS with OIS is a novel approach for mapping interareal and intra‐areal connections in vivo. Comparisons with feedforward and feedback anatomical connectivity are discussed.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

&lt;p&gt;Histological sections and electroretinography suggest the presence of a heavily rod dominated (and possibly rod‐only) retina in Port Jackson sharks. Mapping of the distribution of retinal neurons reveals a specialisation for higher visual acuity in a narrow horizontal band that corresponds to the part of the visual field covering the water‐substrate interface. Such a specialized retina would be well‐adapted to low‐light (scotopic) vision and a benthic lifestyle, and may assist the shark in finding food and avoiding predators.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this study, we investigated the visual system of the Port Jackson shark &lt;i&gt;Heterodontus portusjacksoni&lt;/i&gt;, a shallow‐dwelling benthic species and generalist predator endemic to the temperate coastal waters around southern Australia. Measurements of retinal spectral sensitivity in juvenile sharks, made using single flash and heterochromatic flicker photometry under conditions of dark‐ or light‐adaptation, indicated a peak sensitivity at around 500 nm, with no evidence of a spectral shift with increasing levels of light adaptation. Histological sections of the retina revealed a heavily rod dominated retina containing only a few small cell profiles in the photoreceptor layer that might represent a sparse cone population or may be immature rods. Assessment of retinal topography in juvenile sharks indicated the presence of a distinct specialisation for increased visual spatial acuity in the form of a horizontal streak of higher rod photoreceptor (~80,000 rods mm&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;) and ganglion cell (~1,800 cells mm&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;) densities across the horizontal meridian of the eye. This specialization would be adaptive for panoramic sampling of the part of the visual field corresponding to the substrate‐water interface and remove the need for &lt;i&gt;H. portusjacksoni&lt;/i&gt; to move its eyes extensively when resting on the sea floor. The estimated upper limit of spatial resolving power in juvenile &lt;i&gt;H. portusjacksoni&lt;/i&gt; was 3.14 cycles deg&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;, which is at the lower end of values measured in elasmobranchs. Taken together, these results suggest that the retina of &lt;i&gt;H. portusjacksoni&lt;/i&gt; is well adapted for nocturnal vision.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

&lt;p&gt;Alternately spliced human EAAT5 (hEAAT5v) which contains an additional intron after exon 7 of normally spliced human EAAT5 (7‐int) was cloned from human brain. Immunocytochemistry reveals expression of this protein in apical (A) and basal (B) dendrites and axons (Ax) of human cortical pyramidal neurons. The protein is also expressed by GABAergic neurons including Purkinje cells. It plausibly functions as a glutamate‐gated chloride conductance rather than as a glutamate transporter.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Excitatory amino acid transporter 5 (EAAT5) is a protein that is known to be alternately spliced and to be abundantly expressed in the retina by populations of neurons including photoreceptors and bipolar cells. EAAT5 acts as a slow glutamate transporter and also as glutamate‐gated chloride channel, the chloride conductance being large enough for EAAT5 to serve functionally as an “inhibitory” glutamate receptor. However, there has been a long‐standing view that the classically spliced form of EAAT5 is not abundant or widespread in the brain and so it has not been extensively investigated in the literature. We recently identified a human‐specific splicing form of EAAT5 that was not expressed by rodents but was shown to be a functional glutamate transporter. We have examined the expression of this form of EAAT5, hEAAT5v at the mRNA, and protein level in human brain, and show that populations of human cortical pyramidal neurons and cerebellar Purkinje cells show significant expression of hEAAT5v. Accordingly, we infer that EAAT5 may well be a player in modulating neuronal function in the human brain and propose that its localization in both glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons could be compatible with a role in influencing intracellular chloride and thereby neuronal parameters such as membrane potential rather than acting as a presynaptic glutamate transporter.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

&lt;p&gt;We investigated eye morphology and retinal topography in Caribbean and Chilean flamingos. Both species have a well‐defined visual streak, with the peak retinal ganglion cell densities located in a small central area. The organization of the visual system in these birds reflects their cathemeral activity pattern and the physical nature of the habitats in which they live.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this study, we assessed eye morphology and retinal topography in two flamingo species, the Caribbean flamingo (&lt;i&gt;Phoenicopterus ruber&lt;/i&gt;) and the Chilean flamingo (&lt;i&gt;P. chilensis&lt;/i&gt;). Eye morphology is similar in both species and cornea size relative to eye size (C:A ratio) is intermediate between those previously reported for diurnal and nocturnal birds. Using stereology and retinal whole mounts, we estimate that the total number of Nissl‐stained neurons in the retinal ganglion cell (RGC) layer in the Caribbean and Chilean flamingo is ~1.70 and 1.38 million, respectively. Both species have a well‐defined visual streak with a peak neuron density of between 13,000 and 16,000 cells mm&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt; located in a small central &lt;i&gt;area&lt;/i&gt;. Neurons in the high‐density regions are smaller and more homogeneous compared to those in medium‐ and low‐density regions. Peak anatomical spatial resolving power in both species is approximately 10–11 cycles/deg. &lt;i&gt;En‐face&lt;/i&gt; images of the fundus in live Caribbean flamingos acquired using spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD‐OCT) revealed a thin, dark band running nasotemporally just dorsal to the pecten, which aligned with the visual streak in the retinal topography maps. Cross‐sectional images (B‐scans) obtained with SD‐OCT showed that this dark band corresponds with an area of retinal thickening compared to adjacent areas. Neither the retinal whole mounts, nor the SD‐OCT imaging revealed any evidence of a central fovea in either species. Overall, we suggest that eye morphology and retinal topography in flamingos reflects their cathemeral activity pattern and the physical nature of the habitats in which they live.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

&lt;p&gt;Jack Pettigrew was a pioneer in his approach to understanding sensory systems in birds. Here, we review his seminal research on owls as well as more recent studies aimed at understanding the evolution of sensory specializations in hummingbirds and tactile‐feeding species. We also review Pettigrew's work on two unusual, and rarely studied, Australian bird species that exhibit unique auditory and visual specializations in order to occupy their unique niches. Overall, we conclude that a comparative approach can yield unique insights into sensory system function in birds, as well as other vertebrates.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Diversity” is an apt descriptor of the research career of Jack Pettigrew as it ranged from the study of trees, to clinical conditions, to sensory neuroscience. Within sensory neuroscience, he was fascinated by the evolution of sensory systems across species. Here, we review some of his work on avian sensory specialists and research that he inspired in others. We begin with an overview of the importance of the Wulst in stereopsis and the need for further study of the Wulst in relation to binocularity across avian species. Next, we summarize recent anatomical, behavioral, and physiological studies on optic flow specializations in hummingbirds. Beyond vision, we discuss the first evidence of a tactile “fovea” in birds and how this led to detailed studies of tactile specializations in waterfowl and sensorimotor systems in parrots. We then describe preliminary studies by Pettigrew of two endemic Australian species, the plains‐wanderer (&lt;i&gt;Pedionomus torquatus&lt;/i&gt;) and letter‐winged kite (&lt;i&gt;Elanus scriptus&lt;/i&gt;), that suggest the evolution of some unique auditory and visual specializations in relation to their unique behavior and ecology. Finally, we conclude by emphasizing the importance of a comparative and integrative approach to understanding avian sensory systems and provide an example of one system that has yet to be properly examined: tactile facial bristles in birds. Through reviewing this research and offering future avenues for discovery, we hope that others also embrace the comparative approach to understanding sensory system evolution in birds and other vertebrates.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

&lt;p&gt;Using immunohistochemical and quantitative methods, we examined adult hippocampal neurogenesis in wild‐caught and captive‐bred Egyptian fruit bats. We find that the effect of the environment on this process is more method dependent than environment dependent, requiring a reassessment of how we interpret differences in the process of adult hippocampal neurogenesis between environments and species. This image shows doublecortin immunostained immature neurons in the dentate gyrus of an Egyptian fruit bat captured in the subtropical woodlands of South Africa.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We quantified both proliferative (Ki‐67 immunohistochemistry) and immature (doublecortin immunohistochemistry) cells within the dentate gyrus of adult Egyptian fruit bats from three distinct environments: (a) primary rainforest, (b) subtropical woodland, and (c) fifth‐generation captive‐bred. We used four different previously reported methods to assess the effect of the environment on proliferative and immature cells: (a) the comparison of raw totals of proliferative and immature cells; (b) these totals standardized to brain mass; (c) these totals expressed as a density using the volume of the granular cell layer (GCLv) for standardization; and (d) these totals expressed as a percentage of the total number of granule cells. For all methods, the numbers of proliferative cells did not differ statistically among the three groups, indicating that the rate of proliferation, while malleable to experimental manipulation or transiently in response to events of importance in the natural habitat, appears to occur, for the most part, at a predetermined rate within a species. For the immature cells, raw numbers and standardizations to brain mass and GCLv revealed no difference between the three groups studied; however, standardization to total granule cell numbers indicated that the two groups of wild‐caught bats had significantly higher numbers of immature neurons than the captive‐bred bats. These contrasting results indicate that the interpretation of the effect of the environment on the numbers of immature neurons appears method dependent. It is possible that current methods are not sensitive enough to reveal the effect of different environments on proliferative and immature cells.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

&lt;p&gt;Immunohistochemical staining for parvalbumin reveals the presence of large, multipolar, white matter interstitial cells (white matter neurons) in the subcortical white matter of the telencephalon of the Egyptian fruit bat.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A large population of infracortical white matter neurons, or white matter interstitial cells (WMICs), are found within the subcortical white matter of the mammalian telencephalon. We examined WMICs in three species of megachiropterans, &lt;i&gt;Megaloglossus woermanni&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Casinycteris argynnis&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;Rousettus aegyptiacus&lt;/i&gt;, using immunohistochemical and stereological techniques. Immunostaining for neuronal nuclear marker (NeuN) revealed substantial numbers of WMICs in each species—&lt;i&gt;M. woermanni&lt;/i&gt; 124,496 WMICs, &lt;i&gt;C. argynnis&lt;/i&gt; 138,458 WMICs, and the larger brained &lt;i&gt;R. aegyptiacus&lt;/i&gt; having an estimated WMIC population of 360,503. To examine the range of inhibitory neurochemical types we used antibodies against parvalbumin, calbindin, calretinin, and neural nitric oxide synthase (nNOS). The calbindin and nNOS immunostained neurons were the most commonly observed, while those immunoreactive for calretinin and parvalbumin were sparse. The proportion of WMICs exhibiting inhibitory neurochemical profiles was ~26%, similar to that observed in previously studied primates. While for the most part the WMIC population in the megachiropterans studied was similar to that observed in other mammals, the one feature that differed was the high proportion of WMICs immunoreactive to calbindin, whereas in primates (macaque monkey, lar gibbon and human) the highest proportion of inhibitory WMICs contain calretinin. Interestingly, there appears to be an allometric scaling of WMIC numbers with brain mass. Further quantitative comparative work across more mammalian species will reveal the developmental and evolutionary trends associated with this infrequently studied neuronal population.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

&lt;p&gt;Visually guided action requires integrating information from multiple sources and encoding flexible action representations. We look at objects that we might reach, but also use them as a cue to act in another spatial location. This research article examines the sensorimotor transformations in parietal cortex occurring when we perform various actions in three‐dimensional space.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goal‐directed movements involve a series of neural computations that compare the sensory representations of goal location and effector position, and transform these into motor commands. Neurons in posterior parietal cortex (PPC) control several effectors (e.g., eye, hand, foot) and encode goal location in a variety of spatial coordinate systems, including those anchored to gaze direction, and to the positions of the head, shoulder, or hand. However, there is little evidence on whether reference frames depend also on the effector and/or type of motor response. We addressed this issue in macaque PPC area V6A, where previous reports using a fixate‐to‐reach in depth task, from different starting arm positions, indicated that most units use mixed body/hand‐centered coordinates. Here, we applied singular value decomposition and gradient analyses to characterize the reference frames in V6A while the animals, instead of arm reaching, performed a nonspatial motor response (hand lift). We found that most neurons used mixed body/hand coordinates, instead of “pure” body‐, or hand‐centered coordinates. During the task progress the effect of hand position on activity became stronger compared to target location. Activity consistent with body‐centered coding was present only in a subset of neurons active early in the task. Applying the same analyses to a population of V6A neurons recorded during the fixate‐to‐reach task yielded similar results. These findings suggest that V6A neurons use consistent reference frames between spatial and nonspatial motor responses, a functional property that may allow the integration of spatial awareness and movement control.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

&lt;p&gt;The middle temporal visual area (MT) is revealed by parvalbumin immunoreactivity in early development (P3) of galagos, suggesting that MT resembles the primary sensory areas by developing early, and the early development of MT may influence the subsequent development of dorsal stream visual areas.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Considerable evidence supports the premise that the visual system of primates develops hierarchically, with primary visual cortex developing structurally and functionally first, thereby influencing the subsequent development of higher cortical areas. An apparent exception is the higher order middle temporal visual area (MT), which appears to be histologically distinct near the time of birth in marmosets. Here we used a number of histological and immunohistological markers to evaluate the maturation of cortical and subcortical components of the visual system in galagos ranging from newborns to adults. Galagos are representative of the large strepsirrhine branch of primate evolution, and studies of these primates help identify brain features that are broadly similar across primate taxa. The histological results support the view that MT is functional at or near the time of birth, as is primary visual cortex. Likewise, the superior colliculus, dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus, and the posterior nucleus of the pulvinar are well‐developed by birth. Thus, these subcortical structures likely provide visual information directly or indirectly to cortex in newborn galagos. We conclude that MT resembles a primary sensory area by developing early, and that the early development of MT may influence the subsequent development of dorsal stream visual areas.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

&lt;p&gt;The passing of Jack Pettigrew (University of Queensland) and Bogdan Dreher (University of Sydney) within 2 weeks of each other in May 2019 provided the catalyst for documenting the roles that they and their colleagues from the Peter Bishop School played in establishing vision research as a major strength in Australian neuroscience in the second half of the 20th century.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;img alt=&quot;A comparative analysis of the dopaminergic innervation of the executive caudal nidopallium in pigeon, chicken, zebra finch, and carrion crow&quot; src=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/cms/asset/5b73d015-09fd-4fba-bb55-bd92c6db5136/cne24878-toc-0001-m.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visualizing the dopaminergic innervation and myelinated dorsal arcopallium tract, we showed that the avian analogue to the prefrontal cortex (PFC), known as the nidopallium caudolaterale (NCL), adheres to a species‐specific variation. The NCL in pigeon and chicken is best described as a semilunar structure in the dorsolateral part of the caudal nidopallium. The NCL in carrion crow and zebra finch consists of at least three subareas (NCM, NCLd, and NCLv) that span across the entire back of the caudal forebrain.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the long, separate evolutionary history of birds and mammals, both lineages developed a rich behavioral repertoire of remarkably similar executive control generated by distinctly different brains. The seat for executive functioning in birds is the nidopallium caudolaterale (NCL) and the mammalian equivalent is known as the prefrontal cortex (PFC). Both are densely innervated by dopaminergic fibers, and are an integration center of sensory input and motor output. Whereas the variation of the PFC has been well documented in different mammalian orders, we know very little about the NCL across the avian clade. In order to investigate whether this structure adheres to species‐specific variations, this study aimed to describe the trajectory of the NCL in pigeon, chicken, carrion crow and zebra finch. We employed immunohistochemistry to map dopaminergic innervation, and executed a Gallyas stain to visualize the dorsal arcopallial tract that runs between the NCL and the arcopallium. Our analysis showed that whereas the trajectory of the NCL in the chicken is highly comparable to the pigeon, the two Passeriformes show a strikingly different pattern. In both carrion crow and zebra finch, we identified four different subareas of high dopaminergic innervation that span the entire caudal forebrain. Based on their sensory input, motor output, and involvement in dopamine‐related cognitive control of the delineated areas here, we propose that at least three morphologically different subareas constitute the NCL in these songbirds. Thus, our study shows that comparable to the PFC in mammals, the NCL in birds varies considerably across species.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Hippocampus: Recurrent amplification of grid‐cell activity</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/hipo.23254?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;High‐level cognitive abilities such as navigation and spatial memory are thought to rely on the activity of grid cells in the medial entorhinal cortex (MEC), which encode the animal's position in space with periodic triangular patterns. Yet the neural mechanisms that underlie grid‐cell activity are still unknown. Recent in vitro and in vivo experiments indicate that grid cells are embedded in highly structured recurrent networks. But how could recurrent connectivity become structured during development? And what is the functional role of these connections? With mathematical modeling and simulations, we show that recurrent circuits in the MEC could emerge under the supervision of weakly grid‐tuned feedforward inputs. We demonstrate that a learned excitatory connectivity could amplify grid patterns when the feedforward sensory inputs are available and sustain attractor states when the sensory cues are lost. Finally, we propose a Fourier‐based measure to quantify the spatial periodicity of grid patterns: the grid‐tuning index.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25908?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;This study aimed to characterise both neuronal autoantibodies and levels of interferon α, two proposed causative agents in neuropsychiatric systemic lupus erythematosus (NPSLE). Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma from 35 patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE; 15 with NPSLE) showed no antibodies against natively expressed N‐methyl‐D‐aspartate receptors (NMDARs), or the surface of live hippocampal neurons. By comparison to controls (n = 104), patients with SLE had antibodies that bound to a peptide representing the extracellular domain of NMDARs (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.0001), however, binding was retained against both rearranged peptides and no peptide (r = 0.85 and r = 0.79, respectively, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.0001). In summary, neuronal‐surface reactive antibodies were not detected in NPSLE. Further, while interferon α levels were higher in SLE (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.0001), they lacked specificity for NPSLE. Our findings mandate a search for novel biomarkers in this condition.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Hypersensitivity to Calcitonin Gene–Related Peptide in Post‐Traumatic Headache</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25915?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To demonstrate that calcitonin gene–related peptide (CGRP) induces headache exacerbation with migraine‐like features in patients with persistent post‐traumatic headache (PTH) attributed to mild traumatic brain injury (TBI).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled, two‐way crossover study was conducted. Analyses were intention‐to‐treat. Eligible patients were aged 18 to 65 years and had a history of persistent PTH after mild TBI for at least 12 months. Patients were randomized to receive an intravenous infusion of 1.5μg/min of CGRP or placebo (isotonic saline) over 20 minutes on two separate experimental days. A 12‐hour observational period was used to evaluate the following outcomes: (1) difference in incidence of headache exacerbation with migraine‐like features and (2) difference in area under the curve for headache intensity scores.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thirty patients (mean age = 37 years, 25 women [83%]) were randomized and completed the study. During the 12‐hour observational period, 21 of 30 patients (70%) developed headache exacerbation with migraine‐like features after CGRP, compared with 6 patients (20%) after placebo (&lt;i&gt;p &amp;lt;&lt;/i&gt; 0.001). The baseline‐corrected area under the curve for headache intensity scores was significantly larger after CGRP, compared with placebo (&lt;i&gt;p &amp;lt;&lt;/i&gt; 0.001).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patients with persistent PTH are hypersensitive to CGRP, which underscores its pathophysiological importance. Furthermore, CGRP‐targeted therapies might provide a novel mechanism‐based treatment option for patients with persistent PTH. ANN NEUROL 2020&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Synaptic Neuroscience: Two Distinct Populations of α1α6-Containing GABAA-Receptors in Rat Cerebellum</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnsyn.2020.591129</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;GABAA receptors are pentameric GABA-gated chloride channels. The existence of 19 different subunits (six α, three β, three γ, δ, ε, θ, π, and three ρ) in mammalian systems gives rise to an enormous theoretical diversity of GABAA receptor subtypes with distinct subunit composition and unique pharmacological properties. These receptors are already now the drug targets of several clinically used compounds, such as benzodiazepines, anesthetics, and many more. There is a constant quest to identify novel molecules and possible future drug targets: Currently, α6-containing GABAA receptors are being discussed in the context of treating sensorimotor gating deficits in neuropsychiatric disorders, such as tic disorders and schizophrenia. Therefore, we aim to learn more about α6-containing GABAA receptors. They are mostly expressed in the cerebellar granule cell layer, where they form the following subtypes: α6βxγ2, α1α6βxγ2, α6βxδ, and α1α6βxδ. In former studies, α1α6βxγ2-containing GABAA receptors were considered a single receptor population. In the current study, we investigate the possibility, that this population can consist of two subgroups with alternative arrangements depending if α1 neighbors γ2 (forming a “diazepam-sensitive” receptor), or if α6 neighbors γ2 (forming a “diazepam-insensitive” receptor) and aimed to prove the existence of both subtypes in native tissue. We performed immunoprecipitation experiments on rat cerebellar lysates using α1- or α6 subunit-specific antibodies followed by radioligand binding assays with either &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;H-flunitrazepam or &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;H-Ro 15-4513. Indeed, we were able to prove the existence of two distinct populations of α1α6-containing GABAA-receptors and could quantify the different receptor populations: α1βxγ2 receptors constitute approximately 60% of all γ2-containing receptors in the rat cerebellum, α6βxγ2 about 20%, and both isoforms of α1α6βxγ2 9–15% each. The simple classification of GABAA-receptors into αx-containing subtypes seems not to reflect the complexity of nature; those receptors are more diverse than previously thought.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: P2X7 Receptor Upregulation in Huntington’s Disease Brains</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2020.567430</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Huntington’s disease (HD) is a fatal degenerative disorder affecting the nervous system. It is characterized by motor, cognitive, and psychiatric dysfunctions, with a late onset and an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance. HD-causing mutation consists in an expansion of repeated CAG triplets in the huntingtin gene (HTT), encoding for an expanded polyglutamine (polyQ) stretch in the huntingtin protein (htt). The mutation causes neuronal dysfunction and loss through multiple mechanisms, affecting both the nucleus and cytoplasm. P2X7 receptor (P2X7R) emerged as a major player in neuroinflammation, since ATP – its endogenous ligand – is massively released under this condition. Indeed, P2X7R stimulation in the central nervous system (CNS) is known to enhance the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines from microglia and of neurotransmitters from neuronal presynaptic terminals, as well as to promote apoptosis. Previous experiments performed with neurons expressing the mutant huntingtin and exploiting HD mouse models demonstrated a role of P2X7R in HD. On the basis of those results, here, we explore for the first time the status of P2X7R in HD patients’ brain. We report that in HD postmortem striatum, as earlier observed in HD mice, the protein levels of the full-length form of P2X7R, also named P2X7R-A, are upregulated. In addition, the exclusively human naturally occurring variant lacking the C-terminus region, P2X7R-B, is upregulated as well. As we show here, this augmented protein levels can be explained by elevated mRNA levels. Furthermore, in HD patients’ striatum, P2X7R shows not only an augmented total transcript level but also an alteration of its splicing. Remarkably, P2X7R introns 10 and 11 are more retained in HD patients when compared with controls. Taken together, our data confirm that P2X7R is altered in brains of HD subjects and strengthen the notion that P2X7R may represent a potential therapeutic target for HD.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience: Kinase Domain Is a Dynamic Hub for Driving LRRK2 Allostery</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnmol.2020.538219</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Protein kinases and GTPases are the two major molecular switches that regulate much of biology, and both of these domains are embedded within the large multi-domain Leucine-Rich Repeat Kinase 2 (LRRK2). Mutations in LRRK2 are the most common cause of familial Parkinson’s disease (PD) and are also implicated in Crohn’s disease. The recent Cryo-Electron Microscopy (Cryo-EM) structure of the four C-terminal domains [ROC COR KIN WD40 (RCKW)] of LRRK2 includes both of the catalytic domains. Although the important allosteric N-terminal domains are missing in the Cryo-EM structure this structure allows us to not only explore the conserved features of the kinase domain, which is trapped in an inactive and open conformation but also to observe the direct allosteric cross-talk between the two domains. To define the unique features of the kinase domain and to better understand the dynamic switch mechanism that allows LRRK2 to toggle between its inactive and active conformations, we have compared the LRRK2 kinase domain to Src, BRaf, and PKA. We also compare and contrast the two canonical glycine-rich loop motifs in LRRK2 that anchor the nucleotide: the G-Loop in protein kinases that anchors ATP and the P-Loop in GTPases that anchors GTP. The RCKW structure also provides a template for the cross-talk between the kinase and GTPase domains and brings new mechanistic insights into the physiological function of LRRK2 and how the kinase domain, along with key phosphorylation sites, can serve as an allosteric hub for mediating conformational changes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: What’s That (Blue) Spot on my MRI? Multimodal Neuroimaging of the Locus Coeruleus in Neurodegenerative Disease</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.583421</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The locus coeruleus (LC) has long been underappreciated for its role in the pathophysiology of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Parkinson’s disease (PD), and other neurodegenerative disorders. While AD and PD are distinct in clinical presentation, both are characterized by prodromal protein aggregation in the LC, late-stage degeneration of the LC, and comorbid conditions indicative of LC dysfunction. Many of these early studies were limited to post-mortem histological techniques due to the LC’s small size and location deep in the brainstem. Thus, there is a growing interest in utilizing in vivo imaging of the LC as a predictor of preclinical neurodegenerative processes and biomarker of disease progression. Simultaneously, neuroimaging in animal models of neurodegenerative disease holds promise for identifying early alterations to LC circuits, but has thus far been underutilized. While still in its infancy, a handful of studies have reported effects of single gene mutations and pathology on LC function in disease using various neuroimaging techniques. Furthermore, combining imaging and optogenetics or chemogenetics allows for interrogation of network connectivity in response to changes in LC activity. The purpose of this article is twofold: (1) to review what magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography (PET) have revealed about LC dysfunction in neurodegenerative disease and its potential as a biomarker in humans, and (2) to explore how animal models can be used to test hypotheses derived from clinical data and establish a mechanistic framework to inform LC-focused therapeutic interventions to alleviate symptoms and impede disease progression.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.582324</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The blood-brain barrier (BBB) plays an important role in both the physiological state and pharmacological state of the brain. Transiently enhancing the permeability of the BBB may allow the use of more types of medications for neuropsychiatric diseases. Our previous research revealed that electroacupuncture (EA) stimulation at certain parameters can enhance the permeability of the BBB in Sprague-Dawley rats, but this phenomenon is not well characterized. We propose that specific frequency EA can transiently open the BBB and may be related to the change of tight junctions (TJ). To find the best EA frequency among commonly used frequencies, preliminarily explore the mechanism, we detected BBB permeability by measuring the intensity of Evans Blue and 20 kDa FITC-dextran fluorescence in the cerebral cortex. Then, we used a laser spectrometer, immunofluorescence, western blotting, and transmission electron microscopy to detect the mechanism of BBB opening. Finally, measured brain water content, AQP4, GFAP, Iba1, and used the DeadEnd&lt;sup&gt;TM&lt;/sup&gt; Fluorometric TUNEL System to clear whether the stimulation caused obvious negative effects. The results show that EA stimulation at 2/100 Hz maximally increased BBB permeability, and the BBB closed within 12 h after EA stimulation was removed. EA stimulation increased blood perfusion, c-fos levels, and Substance P expression in the cerebral cortex, decreased ZO-1 and occludin levels and induced ultrastructural changes in TJ morphology. EA stimulation at specific parameters did not cause brain edema, activation of glial cells, or cell apoptosis. This study shows that EA stimulation induces a reversible, frequency-dependent alteration of BBB permeability and proposes a hypothetical mechanism of BBB opening related to vasodilation and TJ disruption. Transiently enhancing the permeability of the BBB with EA at specific parameters may be a new strategies for delivering therapeutics to the central nervous system. Further study of this technology is needed.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Interaction of Alpha-Synuclein With Lipids: Mitochondrial Cardiolipin as a Critical Player in the Pathogenesis of Parkinson’s Disease</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.578993</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Alpha-Synuclein (α-Syn) is a central protein in the pathogenesis of synucleinopathies, a group of neurodegenerative disorders including Parkinson’s disease (PD). Although its role in neurotransmission is well established, the precise role of this protein in disease pathogenesis is still not fully understood. It is, however, widely regarded to be associated with the misfolding and accumulation of toxic intracellular aggregates. In fact, α-Syn is the most abundant protein component of Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites, which are also characterized by a high lipid content. Lipids, the main constituents of cellular membranes, have been implicated in many aspects of PD-related processes. α-Syn interacts with membrane phospholipids and free fatty acids via its N-terminal domain, and altered lipid-protein complexes might enhance both its binding to synaptic and mitochondrial membranes and its oligomerization. Several studies have highlighted a specific interaction of α-Syn with the phospholipid cardiolipin (CL), a major constituent of mitochondrial membranes. By interacting with CL, α-Syn is able to disrupt mitochondrial membrane integrity, leading to mitochondrial dysfunction. Additionally, externalized CL is able to facilitate the refolding of toxic α-Syn species at the outer mitochondrial membrane. In this review, we discuss how α-Syn/lipid interactions, in particular the α-Syn/CL interaction at the mitochondrial membrane, may affect α-Syn aggregation and mitochondrial dysfunction and may thus represent an important mechanism in the pathogenesis of PD.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurogenesis: Effects of Dopamine on the Immature Neurons of the Adult Rat Piriform Cortex</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.574234</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The layer II of the adult piriform cortex (PCX) contains a numerous population of immature neurons. Interestingly, in both mice and rats, most, if not all, these cells have an embryonic origin. Moreover, recent studies from our laboratory have shown that they progressively mature into typical excitatory neurons of the PCX layer II. Therefore, the adult PCX is considered a “non-canonical” neurogenic niche. These immature neurons express the polysialylated form of the neural cell adhesion molecule (PSA-NCAM), a molecule critical for different neurodevelopmental processes. Dopamine (DA) is a relevant neurotransmitter in the adult CNS, which also plays important roles in neural development and adult plasticity, including the regulation of PSA-NCAM expression. In order to evaluate the hypothetical effects of pharmacological modulation of dopaminergic neurotransmission on the differentiation of immature neurons of the adult PCX, we studied dopamine D2 receptor (D2r) expression in this region and the relationship between dopaminergic fibers and immature neurons (defined by PSA-NCAM expression). In addition, we analyzed the density of immature neurons after chronic treatments with an antagonist and an agonist of D2r: haloperidol and PPHT, respectively. Many dopaminergic fibers were observed in close apposition to PSA-NCAM-expressing neurons, which also coexpressed D2r. Chronic treatment with haloperidol significantly increased the number of PSA-NCAM immunoreactive cells, while PPHT treatment decreased it. These results indicate a prominent role of dopamine, through D2r and PSA-NCAM, on the regulation of the final steps of development of immature neurons in the adult PCX.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.572965</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Gangliosides are glycosphingolipids highly abundant in the nervous system, and carry most of the sialic acid residues in the brain. Gangliosides are enriched in cell membrane microdomains (“lipid rafts”) and play important roles in the modulation of membrane proteins and ion channels, in cell signaling and in the communication among cells. The importance of gangliosides in the brain is highlighted by the fact that loss of function mutations in ganglioside biosynthetic enzymes result in severe neurodegenerative disorders, often characterized by very early or childhood onset. In addition, changes in the ganglioside profile (i.e., in the relative abundance of specific gangliosides) were reported in healthy aging and in common neurological conditions, including Huntington’s disease (HD), Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Parkinson’s disease (PD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), stroke, multiple sclerosis and epilepsy. At least in HD, PD and in some forms of epilepsy, experimental evidence strongly suggests a potential role of gangliosides in disease pathogenesis and potential treatment. In this review, we will summarize ganglioside functions that are crucial to maintain brain health, we will review changes in ganglioside levels that occur in major neurological conditions and we will discuss their contribution to cellular dysfunctions and disease pathogenesis. Finally, we will review evidence of the beneficial roles exerted by gangliosides, GM1 in particular, in disease models and in clinical trials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: The Function of the NMDA Receptor in Hypoxic-Ischemic Encephalopathy</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.567665</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) is one of the main forms of neonatal brain injury which could lead to neonatal disability or even cause neonatal death. Therefore, HIE strongly affects the health of newborns and brings heavy burden to the family and society. It has been well studied that N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors are involved in the excitotoxicity induced by hypoxia ischemia in adult brain. Recently, it has been shown that the NMDA receptor also plays important roles in HIE. In the present review, we made a summary of the molecular mechanism of NMDA receptor in the pathological process of HIE, focusing on the distinct role of GluN2A- and GluN2B-containing NMDA receptor subtypes and aiming to provide some insights into the clinical treatment and drug development of HIE.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Neurodegeneration: Novel Porcine Retina Cultivation Techniques Provide Improved Photoreceptor Preservation</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.556700</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the leading cause of blindness in industrialized countries among people over 60 years. It has multiple triggers and risk factors, but despite intense research efforts, its pathomechanisms are currently not completely understood. AMD pathogenesis is characterized by soft drusen in Bruch’s membrane and involves the retinal pigment epithelium–Bruch’s membrane-choroid complex and adjacent structures, like photoreceptors. This study explores the potential of novel cultivation techniques to preserve photoreceptors in retinal explants to gain better insights in AMD pathology. The porcine retina explants were cultured for 4 and 8 days using three different explantation techniques, namely, control (photoreceptors facing down, touching the filter), filter (photoreceptors facing up, turned sample using a filter), and tweezers (photoreceptors facing up, turned sample using tweezers). Optical coherence tomography revealed that the tweezers method had the best capacity to limit thinning of the retinal explants. Both novel methods displayed advantages in maintaining outer segment thickness. Additionally, immunofluorescence evaluation revealed a better preservation of opsin&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cells and rhodopsin signal intensity in both novel methods, especially the tweezers method. Furthermore, RT-qPCR analysis demonstrated an upregulation of OPSIN and RHODOPSIN mRNA expression in tweezers samples at 8 days. Amacrine and bipolar cell numbers were not altered at day 4 of cultivation, while cultivation until 8 days led to reduced bipolar cell numbers. At 4 days, CALRETININ mRNA was upregulated in filter samples, but protein kinase C alpha expression was downregulated. Retinal ganglion cells were diminished in both novel techniques due to a direct physical contact with the insert. Remarkably, no difference in TUBB3 mRNA expression was detected among the techniques. Nevertheless, both novel methods exhibited an improved retention of photoreceptor cells. In conclusion, the tweezers technique was the most promising one. Due to the high homology of the porcine to the human retina, it provides a reasonable alternative to in vivo rodent models. Consequently, an adapted coculture system based on the current findings may serve as an ex vivo model suitable to analyze AMD pathomechanisms and novel therapeutic approaches.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Dynamic Alterations of Amplitude of Low-Frequency Fluctuations in Patients With Drug-Naïve First-Episode Early Onset Schizophrenia</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00901</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Abnormalities in static neural activity have been widely reported in early onset schizophrenia (EOS). However, dynamic brain activity alterations over time in EOS are unclear. Here, we investigated whether temporal dynamic changes in spontaneous neural activity are influenced by EOS. A total of 78 drug-naïve first-episode patients with EOS and 90 healthy controls (HCs) were enrolled in this study. Dynamic amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (dALFF) was performed to examine the abnormal time-varying local neural activity in EOS. Furthermore, we investigated the relationships between abnormalities in dALFF variability and clinical characteristics in EOS patients. Compared to HCs, EOS patients showed significantly decreased dALFF variability in the bilateral precuneus, right superior marginal gyrus, right post-central gyrus and increased dALFF in the right middle temporal gyrus (MTG). Moreover, increased dALFF variability in MTG was negatively associated with negative symptoms in EOS. Our findings reveal increased dynamic local neural activity in higher order networks of the cortex, suggesting that enhanced spontaneous brain activity may be a predominant neural marker for brain maturation. In addition, decreased dALFF variability in the default mode network (DMN) and limbic system may reflect unusually dynamic neural activity. This dysfunctional brain activity could distinguish between patients and HCs and deepen our understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms of EOS.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Contraction Phase and Force Differentially Change Motor Evoked Potential Recruitment Slope and Interhemispheric Inhibition in Young Versus Old</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.581008</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Interhemispheric interactions are important for arm coordination and hemispheric specialization. Unilateral voluntary static contraction is known to increase bilateral corticospinal motor evoked potential (MEP) amplitude. It is unknown how increasing and decreasing contraction affect the opposite limb. Since dynamic muscle contraction is more ecologically relevant to daily activities, we studied MEP recruitment using a novel method and short interval interhemispheric inhibition (IHI) from active to resting hemisphere at 4 phases of contralateral ECR contraction: Rest, Ramp Up [increasing at 25% of maximum voluntary contraction (MVC)], Execution (tonic at 50% MVC), and Ramp Down (relaxation at 25% MVC) in 42 healthy adults. We analyzed the linear portion of resting extensor carpi radialis (ECR) MEP recruitment by stimulating at multiple intensities and comparing slopes, expressed as mV per TMS stimulation level, via linear mixed modeling. In younger participants (age ≤ 30), resting ECR MEP recruitment slopes were significantly and equally larger both at Ramp Up (slope increase = 0.047, p &amp;lt; 0.001) and Ramp Down (slope increase = 0.031, p &amp;lt; 0.001) compared to rest, despite opposite directions of force change. In contrast, Active ECR MEP recruitment slopes were larger in Ramp Down than all other phases (Rest:0.184, p &amp;lt; 0.001; Ramp Up:0.128, p = 0.001; Execution: p = 0.003). Older (age ≥ 60) participants’ resting MEP recruitment slope was higher than younger participants across all phases. IHI did not reduce MEP recruitment slope equally in old compared to young. In conclusion, our data indicate that MEP recruitment slope in the resting limb is affected by the homologous active limb contraction force, irrespective of the direction of force change. The active arm MEP recruitment slope, in contrast, remains relatively unaffected. Older participants had steeper MEP recruitment slopes and less interhemispheric inhibition compared to younger participants.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Background&lt;p&gt;The beneficial effects of acute exercise on executive function have been well-documented, but the influence of cardiorespiratory fitness on this effect requires further investigations, especially using imaging technique. This study aimed to examine the effects of cardiorespiratory fitness on acute exercise-induced changes on behavioral performance and on functional brain activation.&lt;/p&gt;Method&lt;p&gt;Based on their cardiorespiratory fitness level, 62 participants ranked in the top and bottom of the maximum oxygen consumption (VO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; max) were finally selected and allocated to high-fit group or low-fit group. Both groups were asked to complete the Stroop task after 30 min of aerobic exercise and chair-seated rest (control session). Among them, 26 participants were randomly selected and asked to undergo the Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI).&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;Behavioral results showed that individuals responded significantly faster after exercise than those in the control session. The fMRI results revealed a significant interaction effects of Group by Session in brain regions including anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and bilateral dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). For the ACC, activation in the high-fit group was significantly decreased after aerobic exercise compared to those in the control session; whereas an increased activation was noticed in the low-fit group. Regarding to the bilateral DLPFC, activation in high-fit group was significantly decreased after exercise compared to those in the control session, while no significant differences were found in the low-fit group. In addition, for the post-exercise session, a significant positive correlations between activation of the ACC and left DLPFC in the high-fit group was observed. There was a significant negative correlation between activation of the ACC and reaction time in the congruent condition after exercise in the low-fit group.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;Findings further clarify the neurophysiological processes of acute exercise-induced changes in cognitive performance as they suggest that cardiorespiratory fitness is an important factor which influences changes in brain activation patterns in response to acute aerobic exercises.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Effects of Diazepam on Reaction Times to Stop and Go</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.567177</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Introduction: The ability to stop the execution of a movement in response to an external cue requires intact executive function. The effect of psychotropic drugs on movement inhibition is largely unknown. Movement stopping can be estimated by the Stop Signal Reaction Time (SSRT). In a recent publication, we validated an improved measure of SSRT (optimum combination SSRT, ocSSRT). Here we explored how diazepam, which enhances transmission at GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptors, affects ocSSRT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Nine healthy individuals were randomized to receive placebo, 5 mg or 10 mg doses of diazepam. Each participant received both the dosage of drug and placebo orally on separate days with adequate washout. The ocSSRT and simple reaction time (RT) were estimated through a stop-signal task delivered via a battery-operated box incorporating green (Go) and red (Stop) light-emitting diodes. The task was performed just before and 1 h after dosing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Result: The mean change in ocSSRT after 10 mg diazepam was significantly higher (+27 ms) than for placebo (−1 ms; p = 0.012). By contrast, the mean change in simple response time remained comparable in all three dosing groups (p = 0.419).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: Our results confirm that a single therapeutic adult dose of diazepam can alter motor inhibition in drug naïve healthy individuals. The selective effect of diazepam on ocSSRT but not simple RT suggests that GABAergic neurons may play a critical role in movement-stopping.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Human Neuroscience: Reduced Frontal Nogo-N2 With Uncompromised Response Inhibition During Transcutaneous Vagus Nerve Stimulation—More Efficient Cognitive Control?</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2020.561780</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;We have previously shown invasive vagus nerve stimulation to improve attention and working memory and alter emotion-attention interaction in patients with refractory epilepsy, suggesting that VNS might be useful in the treatment of cognitive impairment. The current research focuses on whether non-invasive, transcutaneous vagus nerve stimulation (tVNS) has similar effects to VNS. Furthermore, we aimed to assess whether tVNS has an impact on cognitive control in general or on underlying brain physiology in a task that mimics everyday life demands where multiple executive functions are engaged while encountering intervening emotional stimuli. Event-related potentials (ERP) evoked in such a task, specifically centro-parietal P3 and frontal N2 were used as biomarkers for attention allocation and cognitive control required to carry out the task. A single-blinded, sham-controlled, within-subject study on healthy subjects (n = 25) was conducted using Executive Reaction Time Test (RT-test), a Go/NoGo task engaging multiple executive functions along with intervening threat-related distractors while EEG was recorded. tVNS at the left tragus and sham stimulation at the left ear lobe was alternately delivered throughout the task. To assess the impact of tVNS on neural activity underlying attention and cognitive control, centro-parietal P3 and frontal N2 peak amplitudes were measured in Go and NoGo conditions. Task performance was assessed with RTs and different error types reflecting cognitive control in general and distinct executive functions, such as working memory and response inhibition.No significant effects due to tVNS on performance in the Executive RT-test were observed. For N2 there was a main effect of stimulator status and a significant interaction of trial type (Go, NoGo) and stimulator status. Post hoc analysis revealed that tVNS resulted in a significant reduction of frontal N2 only in the NoGo condition. No significant effects were observed for P3 nor were there any effects of emotion. Diminished NoGo-N2 potential along with unaltered task performance during tVNS suggests fewer cognitive control resources were required to successfully withhold a prepotent response. Though caution is warranted, we suggest that tVNS may lead to more efficient neural processing with fewer resources needed for successful cognitive control, providing promise for its potential use in cognitive enhancement.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience: Predicting Antidepressant Citalopram Treatment Response via Changes in Brain Functional Connectivity After Acute Intravenous Challenge</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2020.554186</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Introduction: The early and therapy-specific prediction of treatment success in major depressive disorder is of paramount importance due to high lifetime prevalence, and heterogeneity of response to standard medication and symptom expression. Hence, this study assessed the predictability of long-term antidepressant effects of escitalopram based on the short-term influence of citalopram on functional connectivity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods: Twenty nine subjects suffering from major depression were scanned twice with resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging under the influence of intravenous citalopram and placebo in a randomized, double-blinded cross-over fashion. Symptom factors were identified for the Hamilton depression rating scale (HAM-D) and Beck's depression inventory (BDI) taken before and after a median of seven weeks of escitalopram therapy. Predictors were calculated from whole-brain functional connectivity, fed into robust regression models, and cross-validated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results: Significant predictive power could be demonstrated for one HAM-D factor describing insomnia and the total score (r = 0.45–0.55). Remission and response could furthermore be predicted with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.73 and 0.68, respectively. Functional regions with high influence on the predictor were located especially in the ventral attention, fronto-parietal, and default mode networks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: It was shown that medication-specific antidepressant symptom improvements can be predicted using functional connectivity measured during acute pharmacological challenge as an easily assessable imaging marker. The regions with high influence have previously been related to major depression as well as the response to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, corroborating the advantages of the current approach of focusing on treatment-specific symptom improvements.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.590823</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Endometriosis is a chronic and debilitating condition affecting ∼10% of women. Endometriosis is characterized by infertility and chronic pelvic pain, yet treatment options remain limited. In many respects this is related to an underlying lack of knowledge of the etiology and mechanisms contributing to endometriosis-induced pain. Whilst many studies focus on retrograde menstruation, and the formation and development of lesions in the pathogenesis of endometriosis, the mechanisms underlying the associated pain remain poorly described. Here we review the recent clinical and experimental evidence of the mechanisms contributing to chronic pain in endometriosis. This includes the roles of inflammation, neurogenic inflammation, neuroangiogenesis, peripheral sensitization and central sensitization. As endometriosis patients are also known to have co-morbidities such as irritable bowel syndrome and overactive bladder syndrome, we highlight how common nerve pathways innervating the colon, bladder and female reproductive tract can contribute to co-morbidity via cross-organ sensitization.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Mesenchymal Stromal Cells’ Therapy for Polyglutamine Disorders: Where Do We Stand and Where Should We Go?</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.584277</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Polyglutamine (polyQ) diseases are a group of inherited neurodegenerative disorders caused by the expansion of the cytosine-adenine-guanine (CAG) repeat. This mutation encodes extended glutamine (Q) tract in the disease protein, resulting in the alteration of its conformation/physiological role and in the formation of toxic fragments/aggregates of the protein. This group of heterogeneous disorders shares common molecular mechanisms, which opens the possibility to develop a pan therapeutic approach. Vast efforts have been made to develop strategies to alleviate disease symptoms. Nonetheless, there is still no therapy that can cure or effectively delay disease progression of any of these disorders. Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) are promising tools for the treatment of polyQ disorders, promoting protection, tissue regeneration, and/or modulation of the immune system in animal models. Accordingly, data collected from clinical trials have so far demonstrated that transplantation of MSC is safe and delays the progression of some polyQ disorders for some time. However, to achieve sustained phenotypic amelioration in clinics, several treatments may be necessary. Therefore, efforts to develop new strategies to improve MSC’s therapeutic outcomes have been emerging. In this review article, we discuss the current treatments and strategies used to reduce polyQ symptoms and major pre-clinical and clinical achievements obtained with MSC transplantation as well as remaining flaws that need to be overcome. The requirement to cross the blood-brain-barrier (BBB), together with a short rate of cell engraftment in the lesioned area and low survival of MSC in a pathophysiological context upon transplantation may contribute to the transient therapeutic effects. We also review methods like pre-conditioning or genetic engineering of MSC that can be used to increase MSC survival in vivo, cellular-free approaches—i.e., MSC-conditioned medium (CM) or MSC-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) as a way of possibly replacing the use of MSC and methods required to standardize the potential of MSC/MSC-derived products. These are fundamental questions that need to be addressed to obtain maximum MSC performance in polyQ diseases and therefore increase clinical benefits.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Xenon Exerts Neuroprotective Effects on Kainic Acid-Induced Acute Generalized Seizures in Rats via Increased Autophagy</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.582872</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Xenon has been shown to have neuroprotective effects and is clinically used as a favorable safe inhalation anesthetic. We previously confirmed the neuroprotective effects of xenon treatment in epileptic animals. However, the mechanism underlying these protective effects remains unclear. We aimed to assess the effects of xenon inhalation on autophagy in neuronal injury induced by acute generalized seizures. Kainic acid (KA) was injected into the lateral ventricle of male Sprague–Dawley rats to induce acute generalized seizures. Next, the rats were treated via inhalation of a 70% xenon/21% oxygen/9% nitrogen mixture for 60 min immediately after KA administration. The control group was treated via inhalation of a 79% nitrogen/21% oxygen mixture. Subsequently, two inhibitors (3-methyladenine or bafilomycin A&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) or an autophagy inducer (rapamycin) were administered, respectively, before KA and xenon administration to determine the role of autophagy in the protective effects of xenon. The levels of apoptosis, neuronal injury, and autophagy were determined in all the rats. Xenon inhalation significantly attenuated the severity of the seizure-induced neuronal injury. Increased autophagy accompanied this inhibitive effect. Autophagy inhibition eliminated these xenon neuroprotective effects. A simulation of autophagy using rapamycin recapitulated xenon’s protective effects on KA-induced acute generalized seizures in the rats. These findings confirmed that xenon exerts strong neuroprotective effects in KA-induced acute generalized seizures. Further, they indicate that increased autophagy may underlie the protective effects of xenon. Therefore, xenon and autophagy inducers may be useful clinical options for their neuroprotective effects in epileptic seizures.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience: Dysregulated Plasma Membrane Turnover Underlying Dendritic Pathology in Neurodegenerative Diseases</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2020.556461</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Due to their enormous surface area compared to other cell types, neurons face unique challenges in properly handling supply and retrieval of the plasma membrane (PM)—a process termed PM turnover—in their distal areas. Because of the length and extensiveness of dendritic branches in neurons, the transport of materials needed for PM turnover from soma to distal dendrites will be inefficient and quite burdensome for somatic organelles. To meet local demands, PM turnover in dendrites most likely requires local cellular machinery, such as dendritic endocytic and secretory systems, dysregulation of which may result in dendritic pathology observed in various neurodegenerative diseases (NDs). Supporting this notion, a growing body of literature provides evidence to suggest the pathogenic contribution of dysregulated PM turnover to dendritic pathology in certain NDs. In this article, we present our perspective view that impaired dendritic endocytic and secretory systems may contribute to dendritic pathology by encumbering PM turnover in NDs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroanatomy: Histological Evidence for the Enteric Nervous System and the Choroid Plexus as Alternative Routes of Neuroinvasion by SARS-CoV2</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnana.2020.596439</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Evidence is mounting that the novel corona virus SARS-CoV2 inflicts neurological symptoms in a subgroup of COVID-19 patients. While plenty of theories on the route of neuroinvasion have been proposed, little histological evidence has been presented supporting any of these hypotheses. Therefore, we carried out immunostainings for ACE2 and TMPRSS2, two proteinases crucial for the entry of SARS-CoV2 into host cells, in the human enteric nervous system (ENS), as well as in the choroid plexus of the lateral ventricles. Both of these sites are important, yet often neglected entry gates to the nervous system. We found that ACE2 and TMPRSS2 are expressed by enteric neurons and glial cells of the small and large intestine, as well as choroid plexus epithelial cells, indicating that these cells meet the molecular requirements for viral entry. Together, our results are fundamental histological evidence substantiating current theories of neuroinvasion by SARS-CoV2.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroanatomy: Neuronize v2: Bridging the Gap Between Existing Proprietary Tools to Optimize Neuroscientific Workflows</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnana.2020.585793</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Knowledge about neuron morphology is key to understanding brain structure and function. There are a variety of software tools that are used to segment and trace the neuron morphology. However, these tools usually utilize proprietary formats. This causes interoperability problems since the information extracted with one tool cannot be used in other tools. This article aims to improve neuronal reconstruction workflows by facilitating the interoperability between two of the most commonly used software tools—Neurolucida (NL) and Imaris (Filament Tracer). The new functionality has been included in an existing tool—Neuronize—giving rise to its second version. Neuronize v2 makes it possible to automatically use the data extracted with Imaris Filament Tracer to generate a tracing with dendritic spine information that can be read directly by NL. It also includes some other new features, such as the ability to unify and/or correct inaccurately-formed meshes (i.e., dendritic spines) and to calculate new metrics. This tool greatly facilitates the process of neuronal reconstruction, bridging the gap between existing proprietary tools to optimize neuroscientific workflows.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroanatomy: Visual Corticocortical Inputs to Ferret Area 18</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnana.2020.581478</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Visual cortical areas in the adult mammalian brain are linked by a network of interareal feedforward and feedback circuits. We investigated the topography of feedback projections to ferret (Mustela putorius furo) area 18 from extrastriate areas 19, 21, and Ssy. Our objective was to characterize the anatomical organization of the extrastriate feedback pool to area 18. We also wished to determine if feedback projections to area 18 share similar features as feedback projections to area 17. We injected the tracer cholera toxin B subunit (CTb) into area 18 of adult ferrets to visualize the distribution and pattern of retrogradely labeled cells in extrastriate cortex. We find several similarities to the feedback projection to area 17: (i) Multiple visual cortical areas provide feedback to area 18: areas 19, 21, Ssy, and weaker inputs from posterior parietal and lateral temporal visual areas. Within each area a greater proportion of feedback projections arises from the infragranular than from the supragranular layers. (ii) The cortical area immediately rostral to area 18 provides the greatest proportion of total cortical feedback, and has the greatest peak density of cells providing feedback to area 18. (iii) The spacing (peak cell density and nearest neighbor distances) of cells in extrastriate cortex providing feedback to areas 17 and 18 are similar. However, peak density of feedback cells to area 18 is comparable in the supra- and infragranular layers, whereas peak density of feedback cells to area 17 is higher in the infragranular layers. Another prominent difference is that dorsal area 18 receives a cortical input that area 17 does not: from ventral cortex representing the upper visual field; this appears to be roughly 25% of the feedback input to area 18. Lastly, area 17 receives a greater proportion of cortical feedback from area 21 than from Ssy, whereas area 18 receives more feedback from Ssy than from area 21. While the organization of feedback projections from extrastriate cortex to areas 17 and 18 is broadly similar, the main difference in input topography might arise due to differences in visual field representations of the two areas.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnana.2020.536838</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Post mortem magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies on the human brain are of great interest for the validation of in vivo MRI. It facilitates a link between functional and anatomical information available from MRI in vivo and neuroanatomical knowledge available from histology/immunocytochemistry. However, linking in vivo and post mortem MRI to microscopy techniques poses substantial challenges. Fixation artifacts and tissue deformation of extracted brains, as well as co registration of 2D histology to 3D MRI volumes complicate direct comparison between modalities. Moreover, post mortem brain tissue does not have the same physical properties as in vivo tissue, and therefore MRI approaches need to be adjusted accordingly. Here, we present a pipeline in which whole-brain human post mortem in situ MRI is combined with subsequent tissue processing of the whole human brain, providing a 3-dimensional reconstruction via blockface imaging. To this end, we adapted tissue processing procedures to allow both post mortem MRI and subsequent histological and immunocytochemical processing. For MRI, tissue was packed in a susceptibility matched solution, tailored to fit the dimensions of the MRI coil. Additionally, MRI sequence parameters were adjusted to accommodate T1 and T2&lt;sup&gt;∗&lt;/sup&gt; shortening, and scan time was extended, thereby benefiting the signal-to-noise-ratio that can be achieved using extensive averaging without motion artifacts. After MRI, the brain was extracted from the skull and subsequently cut while performing optimized blockface imaging, thereby allowing three-dimensional reconstructions. Tissues were processed for Nissl and silver staining, and co-registered with the blockface images. The combination of these techniques allows direct comparisons across modalities.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Ofloxacin as a Disruptor of Actin Aggresome “Hirano Bodies”: A Potential Repurposed Drug for the Treatment of Neurodegenerative Diseases</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.591579</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;There is a growing number of aging populations that are more prone to the prevalence of neuropathological disorders. Two major diseases that show a late onset of the symptoms include Alzheimer’s disorder (AD) and Parkinson’s disorder (PD), which are causing an unexpected social and economic impact on the families. A large number of researches in the last decade have focused upon the role of amyloid precursor protein, Aβ-plaque, and intraneuronal neurofibrillary tangles (tau-proteins). However, there is very few understanding of actin-associated paracrystalline structures formed in the hippocampus region of the brain and are called Hirano bodies. These actin-rich inclusion bodies are known to modulate the synaptic plasticity and employ conspicuous effects on long-term potentiation and paired-pulse paradigms. Since the currently known drugs have very little effect in controlling the progression of these diseases, there is a need to develop therapeutic agents, which can have improved efficacy and bioavailability, and can transport across the blood–brain barrier. Moreover, finding novel targets involving compound screening is both laborious and is an expensive process in itself followed by equally tedious Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval exercise. Finding alternative functions to the already existing FDA-approved molecules for reversing the progression of age-related proteinopathies is of utmost importance. In the current study, we decipher the role of a broad-spectrum general antibiotic (Ofloxacin) on actin polymerization dynamics using various biophysical techniques like right-angle light scattering, dynamic light scattering, circular dichroism spectrometry, isothermal titration calorimetry, scanning electron microscopy, etc. We have also performed in silico docking studies to deduce a plausible mechanism of the drug binding to the actin. We report that actin gets disrupted upon binding to Ofloxacin in a concentration-dependent manner. We have inferred that Ofloxacin, when attached to a drug delivery system, can act as a good candidate for the treatment of neuropathological diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.584743</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Neurogranin (Ng) is a small protein usually expressed in granule-like structures in pyramidal cells of the hippocampus and cortex. However, its clinical value is not fully clear so far. Currently, Ng is proved to be involved in synaptic plasticity, synaptic regeneration, and long-term potentiation mediated by the calcium- and calmodulin-signaling pathways. Due to both the synaptic integrity and function as the growing concerns in the pathogenesis of a wide variety of neurological and mental diseases, a series of researches published focused on the associations between Ng and these kinds of diseases in the past decade. Therefore, in this review, we highlight several diseases, which include, but are not limited to, Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson disease, Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease, neuro-HIV, neurosyphilis, schizophrenia, depression, traumatic brain injury, and acute ischemic stroke, and summarize the associations between cerebrospinal fluid or blood-derived Ng with these diseases. We propose that Ng is a potential and promising biomarker to improve the diagnosis, prognosis, and severity evaluation of these diseases in the future.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.581374</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Aberrant accumulation of misfolded proteins into amyloid deposits is a hallmark in many age-related neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Parkinson’s disease (PD), Huntington’s disease (HD), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Pathological inclusions and the associated toxicity appear to spread through the nervous system in a characteristic pattern during the disease. This has been attributed to a prion-like behavior of amyloid-type aggregates, which involves self-replication of the pathological conformation, intercellular transfer, and the subsequent seeding of native forms of the same protein in the neighboring cell. Molecular chaperones play a major role in maintaining cellular proteostasis by assisting the (re)-folding of cellular proteins to ensure their function or by promoting the degradation of terminally misfolded proteins to prevent damage. With increasing age, however, the capacity of this proteostasis network tends to decrease, which enables the manifestation of neurodegenerative diseases. Recently, there has been a plethora of studies investigating how and when chaperones interact with disease-related proteins, which have advanced our understanding of the role of chaperones in protein misfolding diseases. This review article focuses on the steps of prion-like propagation from initial misfolding and self-templated replication to intercellular spreading and discusses the influence that chaperones have on these various steps, highlighting both the positive and adverse consequences chaperone action can have. Understanding how chaperones alleviate and aggravate disease progression is vital for the development of therapeutic strategies to combat these debilitating diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Ceftriaxone has been reported to upregulate GLT-1 expression and improve cognitive decline in APP/PS1 mice. The aim of the present study was to elucidate the role of GLT-1 in ceftriaxone-mediated improvement on cognitive deficits and associated changes in xCT (catalytic subunit of system x&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt;) expression and activity using GLT-1 knockdown APP/PS1 mice.&lt;/p&gt;Methods&lt;p&gt;GLT-1 knockdown (GLT-1&lt;sup&gt;±&lt;/sup&gt;) mice were generated in C57BL/6J mice using the CRISPR/Cas9 technique and crossed to APP/PS1 mice to generate GLT-1&lt;sup&gt;±&lt;/sup&gt;APP/PS1 mice. The cognition was evaluated by novel object recognition and Morris water maze tests. GLT-1 and xCT expression, GLT-1 uptake for glutamate, and glutathione levels of hippocampus were assayed using Western blot and immunohistochemistry, &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;H-glutamate, and glutathione assay kit, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;Results&lt;p&gt;In comparison with wild-type mice, APP/PS1 mice exhibited significant cognitive deficits, represented with poor performance in novel object recognition and Morris water maze tests, downregulated GLT-1 expression and glutamate uptake. Ceftriaxone treatment significantly improved the above impairments in APP/PS1 mice, but had negligible impact in GLT-1&lt;sup&gt;±&lt;/sup&gt;APP/PS1 mice. The xCT expression increased in APP/PS1 and GLT-1&lt;sup&gt;±&lt;/sup&gt;APP/PS1 mice. This upregulation might be a compensatory change against the accumulated glutamate resulting from GLT-1 impairment. Ceftriaxone treatment restored xCT expression in APP/PS1 mice, but not in GLT-1&lt;sup&gt;±&lt;/sup&gt;APP/PS1 mice. Glutathione levels decreased in APP/PS1 mice in comparison to the wild-type group. After ceftriaxone administration, the decline in glutathione level was restored in APP/PS1 mice, but not in GLT-1&lt;sup&gt;±&lt;/sup&gt;APP/PS1 mice.&lt;/p&gt;Conclusion&lt;p&gt;Ceftriaxone improves cognitive impairment of APP/PS1 mice by upregulating GLT-1-mediated uptake of glutamate and co-regulation of GLT-1 and xCT in APP/PS1 mice.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Frontiers in Ageing Neuroscience: Age-Dependent Shift of AMPA Receptors From Synapses to Intracellular Compartments in Alzheimer’s Disease: Immunocytochemical Analysis of the CA1 Hippocampal Region in APP/PS1 Transgenic Mouse Model</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2020.577996</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Synapse loss occurs early in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) patients and animal models. Alterations at synaptic level are a major morphological correlate of the memory deficits and related symptoms of AD. Given the predominant roles of synaptic AMPA receptors (AMPARs) in excitatory synaptic transmission in the brain, changes in their dynamic regulation are also implicated in the pathophysiology of AD. Here, we used immunolocalization techniques to analyze the expression and subcellular distribution of AMPARs in the hippocampal region of APP/PS1 mouse model of AD. Immunoblots and histoblots revealed that the total amount of AMPARs and their regional expression pattern in the hippocampus was similar in APP/PS1 mice and in age-matched wild type mice. At the ultrastructural level, two synapse populations were examined using SDS-digested freeze-fracture replica labeling in the stratum radiatum in mice: (i) on spines of CA1 pyramidal cells; and (ii) on randomly found dendritic shafts of CA1 interneurons. While 1- and 6-months-old APP/PS1 mice exhibited no change, we observed a significant reduction at 12 months in AMPAR density at synapses in both pyramidal cells and interneurons, compared to wild-type. This reduction of AMPARs in dendritic spines was accompanied by a significant increase in AMPAR subunit proteins identified in intracellular compartments. Our data demonstrate an age-dependent reduction of synaptic AMPARs in APP/PS1 mice, which may contribute to impaired learning and memory at later stages of AD.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is commonly an age-associated dementia with neurodegeneration. The pathogenesis of AD is complex and still remains unclear. The inflammation, amyloid β (Aβ), and neurofibrillary tangles as well misfolded tau protein in the brain may contribute to the occurrence and development of AD. Compared with tau protein, Aβ is less toxic. So far, all efforts made in the treatments of AD with targeting these pathogenic factors were unsuccessful over the past decades. Recently, many studies demonstrated that changes of the intestinal environment and gut microbiota via gut–brain axis pathway can cause neurological disorders, such as AD, which may be involved in the pathogenesis of AD. Thus, remodeling the gut microbiota by various ways to maintain their balance might be a novel therapeutic strategy for AD. In the review article, we analyzed the characteristics of gut microbiota and its dysbiosis in AD and its animal models and investigated the possibility of targeting the gut microbiota in the treatment of the patients with AD in the future.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: An analysis of tissue-specific alternative splicing at the protein level</title>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Jose Manuel Rodriguez, Fernando Pozo, Tomas di Domenico, Jesus Vazquez, Michael L. Tress&lt;/p&gt;

The role of alternative splicing is one of the great unanswered questions in cellular biology. There is strong evidence for alternative splicing at the transcript level, and transcriptomics experiments show that many splice events are tissue specific. It has been suggested that alternative splicing evolved in order to remodel tissue-specific protein-protein networks. Here we investigated the evidence for tissue-specific splicing among splice isoforms detected in a large-scale proteomics analysis. Although the data supporting alternative splicing is limited at the protein level, clear patterns emerged among the small numbers of alternative splice events that we could detect in the proteomics data. More than a third of these splice events were tissue-specific and most were ancient: over 95% of splice events that were tissue-specific in both proteomics and RNAseq analyses evolved prior to the ancestors of lobe-finned fish, at least 400 million years ago. By way of contrast, three in four alternative exons in the human gene set arose in the primate lineage, so our results cannot be extrapolated to the whole genome. Tissue-specific alternative protein forms in the proteomics analysis were particularly abundant in nervous and muscle tissues and their genes had roles related to the cytoskeleton and either the structure of muscle fibres or cell-cell connections. Our results suggest that this conserved tissue-specific alternative splicing may have played a role in the development of the vertebrate brain and heart.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/RaxpIoGOwSw&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Mathematical model predicts response to chemotherapy in advanced non-resectable non-small cell lung cancer patients treated with platinum-based doublet</title>

We developed a computational platform including machine learning and a mechanistic mathematical model to find the optimal protocol for administration of platinum-doublet chemotherapy in a palliative setting. The platform has been applied to advanced metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The 42 NSCLC patients treated with palliative intent at Maria Sklodowska-Curie National Research Institute of Oncology, Gliwice Branch, were collected from a retrospective cohort of patients diagnosed in 2004–2014. Patients were followed-up, for three years. Clinical data collected include complete information about the clinical course of the patients including treatment schedule, response according to RECIST classification, and survival. The core of the platform is the mathematical model, in the form of a system of ordinary differential equations, describing dynamics of platinum-sensitive and platinum-resistant cancer cells and interactions reflecting competition for space and resources. The model is simulated stochastically by sampling the parameter values from a joint probability distribution function. The machine learning model is applied to calibrate the mathematical model and to fit it to the overall survival curve. The model simulations faithfully reproduce the clinical cohort at three levels long-term response (OS), the initial response (according to RECIST criteria), and the relationship between the number of chemotherapy cycles and time between two consecutive chemotherapy cycles. In addition, we investigated the relationship between initial and long-term response. We showed that those two variables do not correlate which means that we cannot predict patient survival solely based on the initial response. We also tested several chemotherapy schedules to find the best one for patients treated with palliative intent. We found that the optimal treatment schedule depends, among others, on the strength of competition among various subclones in a tumor. The computational platform developed allows optimizing chemotherapy protocols, within admissible limits of toxicity, for palliative treatment of metastatic NSCLC. The simplicity of the method allows its application to chemotherapy optimization in different cancers.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/cJ577BZUvzM&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Protein binding to small molecules is fundamental to many biological processes, yet it remains challenging to predictively design this functionality &lt;i&gt;de novo&lt;/i&gt;. Current state-of-the-art computational design methods typically rely on existing small molecule binding sites or protein scaffolds with existing shape complementarity for a target ligand. Here we introduce new methods that utilize pools of discrete contacts between protein side chains and defined small molecule ligand substructures (ligand fragments) observed in the Protein Data Bank. We use the Rosetta Molecular Modeling Suite to recombine protein side chains in these contact pools to generate hundreds of thousands of energetically favorable binding sites for a target ligand. These composite binding sites are built into existing scaffold proteins matching the intended binding site geometry with high accuracy. In addition, we apply pools of side chain rotamers interacting with the target ligand to augment Rosetta’s conventional design machinery and improve key metrics known to be predictive of design success. We demonstrate that our method reliably builds diverse binding sites into different scaffold proteins for a variety of target molecules. Our generalizable &lt;i&gt;de novo&lt;/i&gt; ligand binding site design method provides a foundation for versatile design of protein to interface previously unattainable molecules for applications in medical diagnostics and synthetic biology.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/tLCJEdsBOQ8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLoS Computational Biology: Delayed global feedback in the genesis and stability of spatiotemporal excitation patterns in paced biological excitable media</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/cM8FtjAYdZk/article</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Zhen Song, Zhilin Qu&lt;/p&gt;

Biological excitable media, such as cardiac or neural cells and tissue, exhibit memory in which a change in the present excitation may affect the behaviors in the next excitation. For example, a change in calcium (Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;) concentration in a cell in the present excitation may affect the Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; dynamics in the next excitation via bi-directional coupling between voltage and Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, forming a delayed feedback loop. Since the Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; dynamics inside the excitable cells are spatiotemporal while the membrane voltage is a global signal, the feedback loop is then a delayed global feedback (DGF) loop. In this study, we investigate the roles of DGF in the genesis and stability of spatiotemporal excitation patterns in periodically-paced excitable media using mathematical models with different levels of complexity: a model composed of coupled FitzHugh-Nagumo units, a 3-dimensional physiologically-detailed ventricular myocyte model, and a coupled map lattice model. We investigate the dynamics of excitation patterns that are temporal period-2 (P2) and spatially concordant or discordant, such as subcellular concordant or discordant Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;alternans in cardiac myocytes or spatially concordant or discordant Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and repolarization alternans in cardiac tissue. Our modeling approach allows both computer simulations and rigorous analytical treatments, which lead to the following results and conclusions. When DGF is absent, concordant and discordant P2 patterns occur depending on initial conditions with the discordant P2 patterns being spatially random. When the DGF is negative, only concordant P2 patterns exist. When the DGF is positive, both concordant and discordant P2 patterns can occur. The discordant P2 patterns are still spatially random, but they satisfy that the global signal exhibits a temporal period-1 behavior. The theoretical analyses of the coupled map lattice model reveal the underlying instabilities and bifurcations caused by the DGF for the genesis, selection, and stability of spatiotemporal excitation patterns.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/cM8FtjAYdZk&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Prevalence of impetigo (skin sores) remains high in remote Australian Aboriginal communities, Fiji, and other areas of socio-economic disadvantage. Skin sore infections, driven primarily in these settings by Group A &lt;i&gt;Streptococcus&lt;/i&gt; (GAS) contribute substantially to the disease burden in these areas. Despite this, estimates for the force of infection, infectious period and basic reproductive ratio—all necessary for the construction of dynamic transmission models—have not been obtained. By utilising three datasets each containing longitudinal infection information on individuals, we estimate each of these epidemiologically important parameters. With an eye to future study design, we also quantify the optimal sampling intervals for obtaining information about these parameters. We verify the estimation method through a simulation estimation study, and test each dataset to ensure suitability to the estimation method. We find that the force of infection differs by population prevalence, and the infectious period is estimated to be between 12 and 20 days. We also find that optimal sampling interval depends on setting, with an optimal sampling interval between 9 and 11 days in a high prevalence setting, and 21 and 27 days for a lower prevalence setting. These estimates unlock future model-based investigations on the transmission dynamics of skin sores.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/TWADoKP271A&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Cooperative DNA binding is a key feature of transcriptional regulation. Here we examined the role of cooperativity in Notch signaling by CRISPR-mediated engineering of mice in which neither Notch1 nor Notch2 can homo- or heterodimerize, essential for cooperative binding to sequence-paired sites (SPS) located near many Notch-regulated genes. Although most known Notch-dependent phenotypes were unaffected in Notch1/2 dimer–deficient mice, a subset of tissues proved highly sensitive to loss of cooperativity. These phenotypes include heart development, compromised viability in combination with low gene dose, and the gut, developing ulcerative colitis in response to 1% dextran sulfate sodium (DSS). The most striking phenotypes—gender imbalance and splenic marginal zone B-cell lymphoma—emerged in combination with gene dose reduction or when challenged by chronic fur mite infestation. This study highlights the role of the environment in malignancy and colitis and is consistent with Notch-dependent anti-parasite immune responses being compromised in Notch dimer–deficient animals.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/OhWkoT8JGR4&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Amyloid-β (Aβ) accumulation in the brain is a hallmark of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) pathology. However, the molecular mechanism controlling microglial Aβ phagocytosis is poorly understood. Here we found that the E3 ubiquitin ligase Pellino 1 (Peli1) is induced in the microglia of AD-like five familial AD (5×FAD) mice, whose phagocytic efficiency for Aβ was then impaired, and therefore &lt;i&gt;Peli1&lt;/i&gt; depletion suppressed the Aβ deposition in the brains of 5×FAD mice. Mechanistic characterizations indicated that Peli1 directly targeted CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP)β, a major transcription factor responsible for the transcription of scavenger receptor CD36. Peli1 functioned as a direct E3 ubiquitin ligase of C/EBPβ and mediated its ubiquitination-induced degradation. Consequently, loss of Peli1 increased the protein levels of C/EBPβ and the expression of CD36 and thus, promoted the phagocytic ability in microglial cells. Together, our findings established Peli1 as a critical regulator of microglial phagocytosis and highlighted the therapeutic potential by targeting Peli1 for the treatment of microglia-mediated neurological diseases.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/FApN5VBcNuo&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Antibiotics that inhibit multiple bacterial targets offer a promising therapeutic strategy against resistance evolution, but developing such antibiotics is challenging. Here we demonstrate that a rational design of balanced multitargeting antibiotics is feasible by using a medicinal chemistry workflow. The resultant lead compounds, ULD1 and ULD2, belonging to a novel chemical class, almost equipotently inhibit bacterial DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV complexes and interact with multiple evolutionary conserved amino acids in the ATP-binding pockets of their target proteins. ULD1 and ULD2 are excellently potent against a broad range of gram-positive bacteria. Notably, the efficacy of these compounds was tested against a broad panel of multidrug-resistant &lt;i&gt;Staphylococcus aureus&lt;/i&gt; clinical strains. Antibiotics with clinical relevance against staphylococcal infections fail to inhibit a significant fraction of these isolates, whereas both ULD1 and ULD2 inhibit all of them (minimum inhibitory concentration [MIC] ≤1 μg/mL). Resistance mutations against these compounds are rare, have limited impact on compound susceptibility, and substantially reduce bacterial growth. Based on their efficacy and lack of toxicity demonstrated in murine infection models, these compounds could translate into new therapies against multidrug-resistant bacterial infections.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/SHPpibAf0pQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

What enables the mental activities of thinking verbally or humming in our mind? We hypothesized that the interaction between motor and sensory systems induces speech and melodic mental representations, and this motor-to-sensory transformation forms the neural basis that enables our verbal thinking and covert singing. Analogous with the neural entrainment to auditory stimuli, participants imagined singing lyrics of well-known songs rhythmically while their neural electromagnetic signals were recorded using magnetoencephalography (MEG). We found that when participants imagined singing the same song in similar durations across trials, the delta frequency band (1–3 Hz, similar to the rhythm of the songs) showed more consistent phase coherence across trials. This neural phase tracking of imagined singing was observed in a frontal-parietal-temporal network: the proposed motor-to-sensory transformation pathway, including the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), insula (INS), premotor area, intra-parietal sulcus (IPS), temporal-parietal junction (TPJ), primary auditory cortex (Heschl’s gyrus [HG]), and superior temporal gyrus (STG) and sulcus (STS). These results suggest that neural responses can entrain the rhythm of mental activity. Moreover, the theta-band (4–8 Hz) phase coherence was localized in the auditory cortices. The mu (9–12 Hz) and beta (17–20 Hz) bands were observed in the right-lateralized sensorimotor systems that were consistent with the singing context. The gamma band was broadly manifested in the observed network. The coherent and frequency-specific activations in the motor-to-sensory transformation network mediate the internal construction of perceptual representations and form the foundation of neural computations for mental operations.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/plosbiology/NewArticles/~4/r81mYLnIko4&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

We studied whether genetic liability for AD predicts sleep duration using a genetic risk score (GRS) for AD (AD‐GRS), in 406,536 UK Biobank participants with European ancestry and without dementia at enrollment. Higher AD‐GRS score was associated with shorter sleep (b = −0.014, 95% confidence interval [CI] = −0.022 to −0.006), especially in those aged 55+. Using AD‐GRS as an instrumental variable for AD diagnosis, incipient AD reduced sleep duration by 1.87 hours (95% CI = 0.96, 2.78). Short sleep duration might be an early marker of AD.

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Rivastigmine in Parkinson's Disease Dementia with Orthostatic Hypotension</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25923?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To evaluate if the cognitive benefit of rivastigmine is affected by the presence of orthostatic hypotension (OH) in patients with Parkinson's disease dementia (PDD).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We conducted a post‐hoc analysis on 1,047 PDD patients from two randomized controlled trials comparing rivastigmine vs. placebo at week 24 (n = 501) and rivastigmine patch vs. capsule at week 76 (n = 546). A drop ≥20 mm Hg in systolic or ≥ 10 in diastolic blood pressure upon standing classified subjects as OH+; otherwise, OH‐. The primary endpoint was the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale‐Cognitive subscale (ADAS‐Cog) at week 24 and the Mattis Dementia Rating Scale (MDRS) at week 76, using intention‐to‐treat with retrieved dropout at week 24 and observed cases, at week 76, consistent with the original analyses.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall safety was comparable between OH+ (n = 288, 27.5%) and OH‐ (n = 730, 69.7%), except for higher frequency of syncope (9.2%) in the OH+ placebo arm. The placebo‐adjusted effect of rivastigmine on ADAS‐Cog at week 24 was 5.6 ± 1.2 for OH+ and 1.9 ± 0.9 in OH‐ (p = 0.0165). Among OH+ subjects, the MDRS change from baseline at week 76 was higher for rivastigmine capsules vs. patch (10.6 ± 2.9 vs. ‐1.5 ± 3.0) (p = 0.031). The overall prevalence of OH+ was lower for rivastigmine than placebo at week 24 (28.3% vs 44.6%) (p = 0.0476).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cognitive benefit from rivastigmine is larger in PDD patients with OH, possibly mediated by a direct antihypotensive effect.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Annals of Neurology: Optogenetic spreading depression elicits trigeminal pain and anxiety behavior</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25926?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cortical spreading depression (SD) is an intense depolarization underlying migraine aura. Despite the weight of evidence linking SD to the pain phase of migraine, controversy remains over a causal role of SD in cephalgia because of the invasive nature of previous SD induction methods. To overcome this problem, we employed a novel minimally invasive optogenetic SD induction method and examined the effect SD on behavior.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Optogenetic SD was induced as a single event or repeatedly every other day for 2 weeks. Endpoints including periorbital and hindpaw mechanical allodynia, mouse grimace, anxiety, and working memory were examined in male and female mice.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A single SD produced bilateral periorbital mechanical allodynia that developed within 1 hour and resolved within 2 days. Sumatriptan prevented periorbital allodynia when administered immediately after SD. Repeated SDs also produced bilateral periorbital allodynia that lasted 4 days and resolved within 2 weeks after the last SD. In contrast, the hindpaw withdrawal thresholds did not change after repeated SDs suggesting that SD‐induced allodynia was limited to the trigeminal region. Moreover, repeated SDs increased mouse grimace scores 2 days after the last SD, while single SD did not. Repeated SD also increased thigmotaxis scores as a measure of anxiety. In contrast, neither single nor repeated SDs affected visuospatial working memory. We did not detect sexual dimorphism in any endpoint.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Altogether, these data show a clinically congruent causal relationship between SD, trigeminal pain and anxiety behavior possibly reflecting SD modulation of hypothalamic, thalamic and limbic mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Annals of Neurology: NOTCH2NLC Intermediate‐length Repeat Expansions are Associated with Parkinson's Disease</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25925?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;NOTCH2NLC&lt;/i&gt; GGC repeat expansions were recently identified in neuronal intranuclear inclusion disease (NIID); however, it remains unclear whether they occur in other neurodegenerative disorders. This study aimed to investigate the role of intermediate‐length &lt;i&gt;NOTCH2NLC&lt;/i&gt; GGC repeat expansions in Parkinson's disease (PD). We screened for GGC repeat expansions in a cohort of 1011 PD patients and identified 11 patients with intermediate‐length repeat expansions ranging 41–52 repeats, with no repeat expansions in 1134 controls. Skin biopsy revealed phospho‐alpha synuclein deposition, confirming the PD diagnosis in two patients harboring intermediate‐length repeat expansions, who had previously been diagnosed with NIID or essential tremors. Fibroblasts from PD patients harboring intermediate‐length repeat expansions revealed &lt;i&gt;NOTCH2NLC&lt;/i&gt; upregulation and autophagic dysfunction. Our results suggest that intermediate‐length repeat expansions in &lt;i&gt;NOTCH2NLC&lt;/i&gt; are potentially associated with PD.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Frontiers in Neuroscience: Brain Imaging Methods: Tissue Clearing and Expansion Methods for Imaging Brain Pathology in Neurodegeneration: From Circuits to Synapses and Beyond</title>
	<link>https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.00914</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Studying the structural alterations occurring during diseases of the nervous system requires imaging heterogeneous cell populations at the circuit, cellular and subcellular levels. Recent advancements in brain tissue clearing and expansion methods allow unprecedented detailed imaging of the nervous system through its entire scale, from circuits to synapses, including neurovascular and brain lymphatics elements. Here, we review the state-of-the-art of brain tissue clearing and expansion methods, mentioning their main advantages and limitations, and suggest their parallel implementation for circuits-to-synapses brain imaging using conventional (diffraction-limited) light microscopy -such as confocal, two-photon and light-sheet microscopy- to interrogate the cellular and molecular basis of neurodegenerative diseases. We discuss recent studies in which clearing and expansion methods have been successfully applied to study neuropathological processes in mouse models and postmortem human brain tissue. Volumetric imaging of cleared intact mouse brains and large human brain samples has allowed unbiased assessment of neuropathological hallmarks. In contrast, nanoscale imaging of expanded cells and brain tissue has been used to study the effect of protein aggregates on specific subcellular structures. Therefore, these approaches can be readily applied to study a wide range of brain processes and pathological mechanisms with cellular and subcellular resolution in a time- and cost-efficient manner. We consider that a broader implementation of these technologies is necessary to reveal the full landscape of cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying neurodegenerative diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.cell.com/neuron/fulltext/S0896-6273(20)30709-1?rss=yes</link>
	<content:encoded>Liu et al. (2016) previously described a BAC transgenic model of C9orf72 ALS/FTD. The molecular and pathological features in this model are now detected by multiple independent groups. Methodological factors can affect detection of ALS/FTD phenotypes. Additionally, environment and FVB strain background are important phenotypic modifiers in this model.</content:encoded>
