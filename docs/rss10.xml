	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: Longitudinal Course of Vasomotor Symptoms in Perimenopausal Migraineurs</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25476?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To examine the longitudinal course of vasomotor symptoms (VMS) in women with a history of migraine, in comparison to women without a history of migraine disease.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study sample consisted of 467 women with a self‐reported prior migraine diagnosis and 2,466 women without prior migraine diagnosis who were assessed longitudinally during menopausal transition as part of the Study of Women's Health Across the Nation. Linear mixed regression models with backward elimination were used to evaluate longitudinal associations between VMS and migraine while adjusting for baseline and time‐varying demographic, socioeconomic, psychological, and reproductive factors. Additional analyses were performed to further assess the specificity of the association between migraine with VMS that included evaluating the association between migraine and vaginal dryness, and between back pain and VMS.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A history of migraine predicted an increased frequency of VMS but not vaginal dryness during menopausal transition. Significant interaction between history of migraine and menopausal status for the prediction of VMS was also identified. Burden of VMS was found to be higher during late peri‐menopause stage in women with migraine. In contrast, the history of back pain did not predict the frequency of VMS.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the first study to delineate that a history of migraine predicts an increased frequency of VMS in women during menopausal transition. Hypothalamic abnormalities and thermoregulatory dysfunction against a milieu of decreasing estradiol concentrations during menopausal transition may explain the increased frequency of VMS in migraineurs during menopausal transition.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: Activation of NADPH oxidase is the primary trigger of epileptic seizures in rodent models</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25474?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite decades of epilepsy research, 30% of focal epilepsies remain resistant to anti‐seizure drugs, with effective drug development impeded by lack of understanding on how seizures are initiated. Here we report the mechanism of seizure onset relevant to most seizures characteristic for focal epilepsies.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Electric and metabolic network parameters were measured using several seizure models in mouse hippocampal slices and acutely‐induced seizures in rats &lt;i&gt;in‐vivo&lt;/i&gt; to determine metabolic events occuring at seizure onset.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We show that the seizure onset is associated with a rapid release of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; resulting from NMDA receptor‐mediated activation of NADPH oxidase (NOX). NOX blockade prevented the fast H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; release as well as the DC shift and seizure‐like event induction in slices. Similarly, intracerebroventricular injection of NOX antagonists prevented acutely induced seizures in rats.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our results show that seizures are initiated by NMDA receptor‐mediated NOX‐induced oxidative stress and can be arrested by NOX inhibition. We introduce a novel use for blood‐brain barrier‐permeable NOX inhibitor with a significant potential to become the first seizure‐specific medication. Thus, targeting NOX may provide a breakthrough treatment for focal epilepsies.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: A Center Manifold Reduction Technique for a System of Randomly Coupled Oscillators. (arXiv:1904.00892v1 [math.DS])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1904.00892</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In dynamical systems theory, a fixed point of the dynamics is called
nonhyperbolic if the linearization of the system around the fixed point has at
least one eigenvalue with zero real part. The center manifold existence theorem
guarantees the local existence of an invariant subspace of the dynamics, known
as a center manifold, around such nonhyperbolic fixed points. A growing number
of theoretical and experimental studies suggest that some neural systems
utilize nonhyperbolic fixed points and corresponding center manifolds to
display complex, nonlinear dynamics and to flexibly adapt to wide-ranging
sensory input parameters. In this paper, we present a technique to study the
statistical properties of high-dimensional, nonhyperbolic dynamical systems
with random connectivity and examine which statistical properties determine
both the shape of the center manifold and the corresponding reduced dynamics on
it. This technique also gives us constraints on the family of center manifold
models that could arise from a large-scale random network. We demonstrate this
approach on an example network of randomly coupled damped oscillators.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Do Deep Neural Networks Model Nonlinear Compositionality in the Neural Representation of Human-Object Interactions?. (arXiv:1904.00431v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1904.00431</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Visual scene understanding often requires the processing of human-object
interactions. Here we seek to explore if and how well Deep Neural Network (DNN)
models capture features similar to the brain's representation of humans,
objects, and their interactions. We investigate brain regions which process
human-, object-, or interaction-specific information, and establish
correspondences between them and DNN features. Our results suggest that we can
infer the selectivity of these regions to particular visual stimuli using DNN
representations. We also map features from the DNN to the regions, thus linking
the DNN representations to those found in specific parts of the visual cortex.
In particular, our results suggest that a typical DNN representation contains
encoding of compositional information for human-object interactions which goes
beyond a linear combination of the encodings for the two components, thus
suggesting that DNNs may be able to model this important property of biological
vision.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1904.00353</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The speech auditory brainstem response (sABR) is an objective clinical tool
to diagnose particular impairments along the auditory brainstem pathways. We
explore the scaling behavior of the brainstem in response to synthetic /da/
stimuli using a proposed pipeline including Multifractal Detrended Moving
Average Analysis (MFDMA) modified by Singular Value Decomposition. The scaling
exponent confirms that all normal sABR are classified into the non-stationary
process. The average Hurst exponent is $H=0.77\pm0.12$ at 68\% confidence
interval indicating long-range correlation which shows the first universality
behavior of sABR. Our findings exhibit that fluctuations in the sABR series are
dictated by a mechanism associated with long-term memory of the dynamic of the
auditory system in the brainstem level. The $q-$dependency of $h(q)$
demonstrates that underlying data sets have multifractal nature revealing the
second universality behavior of the normal sABR samples. Comparing Hurst
exponent of original sABR with the results of the corresponding shuffled and
surrogate series, we conclude that its multifractality is almost due to the
long-range temporal correlations which are devoted to the third universality.
Finally, the presence of long-range correlation which is related to the slow
timescales in the subcortical level and integration of information in the
brainstem network is confirmed.

Gilbert&lt;/p&gt;

The broadly neutralizing antibody (bnAb) VRC01 is being evaluated for its efficacy to prevent HIV-1 infection in the Antibody Mediated Prevention (AMP) trials. A secondary objective of AMP utilizes sieve analysis to investigate how VRC01 prevention efficacy (PE) varies with HIV-1 envelope (Env) amino acid (AA) sequence features. An exhaustive analysis that tests how PE depends on every AA feature with sufficient variation would have low statistical power. To design an adequately powered primary sieve analysis for AMP, we modeled VRC01 neutralization as a function of Env AA sequence features of 611 HIV-1 gp160 pseudoviruses from the CATNAP database, with objectives: (1) to develop models that best predict the neutralization readouts; and (2) to rank AA features by their predictive importance with classification and regression methods. The dataset was split in half, and machine learning algorithms were applied to each half, each analyzed separately using cross-validation and hold-out validation. We selected Super Learner, a nonparametric ensemble-based cross-validated learning method, for advancement to the primary sieve analysis. This method predicted the dichotomous resistance outcome of whether the IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; neutralization titer of VRC01 for a given Env pseudovirus is right-censored (indicating resistance) with an average validated AUC of 0.868 across the two hold-out datasets. Quantitative log IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; was predicted with an average validated R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; of 0.355. Features predicting neutralization sensitivity or resistance included 26 surface-accessible residues in the VRC01 and CD4 binding footprints, the length of gp120, the length of Env, the number of cysteines in gp120, the number of cysteines in Env, and 4 potential N-linked glycosylation sites; the top features will be advanced to the primary sieve analysis. This modeling framework may also inform the study of VRC01 in the treatment of HIV-infected persons.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/UYUX5AKtENk&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Evolutionary game dynamics in structured populations has been extensively explored in past decades. However, most previous studies assume that payoffs of individuals are fully determined by the strategic behaviors of interacting parties, and social ties between them only serve as the indicator of the existence of interactions. This assumption neglects important information carried by inter-personal social ties such as genetic similarity, geographic proximity, and social closeness, which may crucially affect the outcome of interactions. To model these situations, we present a framework of evolutionary multiplayer games on graphs with edge diversity, where different types of edges describe diverse social ties. Strategic behaviors together with social ties determine the resulting payoffs of interactants. Under weak selection, we provide a general formula to predict the success of one behavior over the other. We apply this formula to various examples which cannot be dealt with using previous models, including the division of labor and relationship- or edge-dependent games. We find that labor division can promote collective cooperation markedly. The evolutionary process based on relationship-dependent games can be approximated by interactions under a transformed and unified game. Our work stresses the importance of social ties and provides effective methods to reduce the calculating complexity in analyzing the evolution of realistic systems.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/kIcI2fMWze8&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Adaptive multi-view multi-label learning for identifying disease-associated candidate miRNAs</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/Ozz2pT29Pu4/article</link>

Increasing evidence has indicated that microRNAs(miRNAs) play vital roles in various pathological processes and thus are closely related with many complex human diseases. The identification of potential disease-related miRNAs offers new opportunities to understand disease etiology and pathogenesis. Although there have been numerous computational methods proposed to predict reliable miRNA-disease associations, they suffer from various limitations that affect the prediction accuracy and their applicability. In this study, we develop a novel method to discover disease-related candidate miRNAs based on Adaptive Multi-View Multi-Label learning(AMVML). Specifically, considering the inherent noise existed in the current dataset, we propose to learn a new affinity graph adaptively for both diseases and miRNAs from multiple similarity profiles. We then simultaneously update the miRNA-disease association predicted from both spaces based on multi-label learning. In particular, we prove the convergence of AMVML theoretically and the corresponding analysis indicates that it has a fast convergence rate. To comprehensively illustrate the prediction performance of our method, we compared AMVML with four state-of-the-art methods under different validation frameworks. As a result, our method achieves comparable performance under various evaluation metrics, which suggests that our method is capable of discovering greater number of true miRNA-disease associations. The case study conducted on thyroid neoplasms further identified a potential diagnostic biomarker. Together, the experimental results confirms the utility of our method and we anticipate that our method could serve as a reliable and efficient tool for uncovering novel disease-related miRNAs.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Ozz2pT29Pu4&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Philip Gerlee, Mia Johansson&lt;/p&gt;

The formation of metastases is driven by the ability of cancer cells to disseminate from the site of the primary tumour to target organs. The process of dissemination is constrained by anatomical features such as the flow of blood and lymph in the circulatory system. We exploit this fact in a stochastic network model of metastasis formation, in which only anatomically feasible routes of dissemination are considered. By fitting this model to two different clinical datasets (tongue &amp;amp; ovarian cancer) we show that incidence data can be modelled using a small number of biologically meaningful parameters. The fitted models reveal site specific relative rates of dissemination and also allow for patient-specific predictions of metastatic involvement based on primary tumour location and stage. Applied to other data sets this type of model could yield insight about seed-soil effects, and could also be used in a clinical setting to provide personalised predictions about the extent of metastatic spread.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/PnGpm9IQT7I&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Structure, stability and specificity of the binding of ssDNA and ssRNA with proteins</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/xirNQFyHaWQ/article</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Arumay Pal, Yaakov Levy&lt;/p&gt;

Recognition of single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) or single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) is important for many fundamental cellular functions. A variety of single-stranded DNA-binding proteins (ssDBPs) and single-stranded RNA-binding proteins (ssRBPs) have evolved that bind ssDNA and ssRNA, respectively, with varying degree of affinities and specificities to form complexes. Structural studies of these complexes provide key insights into their recognition mechanism. However, computational modeling of the specific recognition process and to predict the structure of the complex is challenging, primarily due to the heterogeneity of their binding energy landscape and the greater flexibility of ssDNA or ssRNA compared with double-stranded nucleic acids. Consequently, considerably fewer computational studies have explored interactions between proteins and single-stranded nucleic acids compared with protein interactions with double-stranded nucleic acids. Here, we report a newly developed energy-based coarse-grained model to predict the structure of ssDNA–ssDBP and ssRNA–ssRBP complexes and to assess their sequence-specific interactions and stabilities. We tuned two factors that can modulate specific recognition: base–aromatic stacking strength and the flexibility of the single-stranded nucleic acid. The model was successfully applied to predict the binding conformations of 12 distinct ssDBP and ssRBP structures with their cognate ssDNA and ssRNA partners having various sequences. Estimated binding energies agreed well with the corresponding experimental binding affinities. Bound conformations from the simulation showed a funnel-shaped binding energy distribution where the native-like conformations corresponded to the energy minima. The various ssDNA–protein and ssRNA–protein complexes differed in the balance of electrostatic and aromatic energies. The lower affinity of the ssRNA–ssRBP complexes compared with the ssDNA–ssDBP complexes stems from lower flexibility of ssRNA compared to ssDNA, which results in higher rate constants for the dissociation of the complex (&lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;off&lt;/sub&gt;) for complexes involving the former.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/xirNQFyHaWQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: Penumbra detection in acute stroke with perfusion MRI: Validation with 15O‐PET</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25479?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Accurate identification of the ischemic penumbra, the therapeutic target in acute clinical stroke, is of critical importance to identify patients who might benefit from reperfusion therapies (e.g. thrombectomy) beyond the established time windows. Therefore, we aimed to validate magnetic‐resonance‐imaging (MRI) mismatch based penumbra detection against full quantitative positron‐emission‐tomography (&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;O‐PET), the gold standard for penumbra detection in acute ischemic stroke.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ten patients (group A) with acute and subacute ischemic stroke underwent perfusion/diffusion weighted (PW/DW) MRI and consecutive full quantitative &lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;O‐PET within 48 hours of stroke onset (mean, 17.4 hours). Penumbra as defined by &lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;O‐PET cerebral‐blood‐flow (CBF), oxygen‐extraction‐fraction (OEF), and oxygen‐metabolism (CMRO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) was used to validate a wide range of established PWI measures (e.g. time‐to‐maximum [Tmax]) to optimize penumbral tissue detection. Validation was carried out using a voxel‐based receiver‐operating‐characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. The same validation based on penumbra as defined by quantitative &lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;O‐PET CBF was performed for comparative reasons in 23 patients measured within 48 hours of stroke onset (group B).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The PWI map Tmax (area under the curve [AUC] 0.88) performed best in detecting penumbral tissue up to 48 hours after stroke onset. The optimal threshold to discriminate penumbra from oligemia was Tmax &amp;gt;5.6 seconds with a sensitivity and specificity of above 80%. Other PW measures performed significantly less well (p &amp;lt;0.05).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The performance of the best PW‐measure Tmax to detect the upper penumbral flow threshold in ischemic stroke, as defined by full quantitative &lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;O‐PET, is excellent. Tmax &amp;gt;5.6 seconds based penumbra detection in ischemic stroke is reliable to guide treatment decisions up to 48 hours and might help to expand reperfusion treatment beyond the current time window.&lt;/p&gt;

	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;SLC1A2&lt;/i&gt; is a trimeric transporter essential for clearing glutamate from neuronal synapses. Recurrent &lt;i&gt;de novo SLC1A2&lt;/i&gt; missense variants cause a severe, early‐onset developmental and epileptic encephalopathy via an unclear mechanism. We demonstrate that all three variants implicated in this condition localize to the trimerization domain of SLC1A2, and that the Leu85Pro variant acts via a dominant negative mechanism to reduce, but not eliminate, wild‐type SLC1A2 protein localization and function. Finally, we demonstrate that treatment of a 20‐month‐old &lt;i&gt;SLC1A2&lt;/i&gt;‐related epilepsy patient with the SLC1A2 modulating agent ceftriaxone did not result in a significant change in daily spasm count.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: Deep brain stimulation: Connectivity profile for bradykinesia alleviation</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25475?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Subthalamic deep brain stimulation may alleviate bradykinesia in Parkinson patients. Research suggests that this stimulation effect may be mediated by brain networks like the cortico‐cerebellar loop. This study investigated the connectivity between stimulation sites and cortical and subcortical structures to identify connections for effective stimulation.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We retrospectively investigated 21 patients with Parkinson's disease with bilateral subthalamic deep brain stimulation. Stimulation effectiveness in reducing bradykinesia, tremor, and rigidity was evaluated for each electrode‐contact in brain hemispheres contralateral to the affected hemi‐body. Dysarthric side effects were also examined. Probabilistic tractography based on diffusion‐weighted imaging was performed in individual patient‐specific brains using electrode‐contacts as seeds. Connectivity profiles of contacts with effective and non‐effective stimulation were compared.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Connectivity profiles of effective and non‐effective contacts differed. Moreover, the connectivity profile for bradykinesia differed from that for rigidity, tremor or dysarthria. Regarding bradykinesia, effective contacts were significantly more often connected with the ipsilateral superior cerebellar peduncle and the ipsilateral dentate nucleus, which correspond to the ipsilateral portion of the cerebello‐thalamo‐cortical pathway. Rigidity was mitigated by stimulation of ascending brainstem and intralaminar thalamic connections. Tremor alleviation was related to connections with the internal capsule (anterior limb) and the pallidum. Dysarthric side effects were associated with connections to the supplementary motor area and the decussating cerebello‐thalamo‐cortical pathway.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whereas bradykinesia seems to be mitigated by stimulation of the ascending, ipsilateral cerebello‐thalamo‐cortical pathway, stimulation of the descending cortico‐ponto‐cerebellar pathway may be ineffective. Rigidity, tremor, and dysarthric side effects seem to be influenced by different neural networks.&lt;/p&gt;

	<title>RSS PAP: Chemogenetic suppression of medial prefrontal-dorsal hippocampal interactions prevents estrogenic enhancement of memory consolidation in female mice</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0451-18.2019v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;The importance of the dorsal hippocampus (DH) in mediating the memory-enhancing effects of the sex-steroid hormone 17β-estradiol (E&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) is well-established, however, estrogen receptors are highly expressed in other brain regions that support memory formation, including the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). The mPFC and DH interact to mediate the formation of several types of memory, and behavioral tasks that recruit the mPFC are enhanced by systemic E&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; administration, making this region a prime candidate for investigating circuit-level questions regarding the estrogenic regulation of memory. Further, infusion of E&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; directly into the DH increases dendritic spine density in both the DH and mPFC, and this effect depends upon rapid activation of cell-signaling pathways in the DH, demonstrating a previously unexplored interaction between the DH and mPFC that led us to question the role of the mPFC in object memory consolidation and the necessity of DH-mPFC interactions in the memory-enhancing effects of E&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Here, we found that infusion of E&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; directly into the mPFC of ovariectomized mice increased mPFC apical spine density and facilitated object recognition and spatial memory consolidation, demonstrating that E&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in the mPFC increases spinogenesis and enhances memory consolidation. Next, chemogenetic suppression of the mPFC blocked the memory-enhancing effects of DH-infused E&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, indicating that systems-level DH-mPFC interactions are necessary for the memory-enhancing effects of E&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Together, these studies provide evidence that E&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in the mPFC mediates memory formation, and reveal that the DH and mPFC act in concert to support the memory-enhancing effects of E&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in female mice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance statement&lt;/b&gt; Estrogens influence the prevalence and severity of certain psychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders, many of which are characterized by impaired mPFC and DH function. Myriad findings demonstrate that E&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; regulates hippocampal plasticity and memory, however, far less is known about estrogenic regulation of other interconnected brain regions, like the mPFC. Here, we report that mPFC E&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; infusion in ovariectomized mice increases mPFC spine density and facilitates memory consolidation, and that chemogenetic inactivation of the mPFC blocks the memory-enhancing effects of DH-infused E&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. These findings suggest an essential role for the mPFC, alone and in concert with the DH, in mediating the memory-enhancing effects of E&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Such circuit-level interactions may be critical to understanding how E&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; regulates memory.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>RSS PAP: A computational model of the escape response latency in the Giant Fiber System of Drosophila melanogaster</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0423-18.2019v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>ABSTRACT&lt;p&gt;The Giant Fiber System (GFS) is a multi-component neuronal pathway mediating rapid escape response in the adult fruit-fly &lt;i&gt;Drosophila melanogaster&lt;/i&gt;, usually in the face of a threatening visual stimulus. Two branches of the circuit promote the response by stimulating an escape jump followed by flight initiation. A recent work demonstrated an age-associated decline in the speed of signal propagation through the circuit, measured as the stimulus-to-muscle depolarization response latency. The decline is likely due to the diminishing number of inter-neuronal gap junctions in the GFS of ageing flies. In this work, we presented a realistic conductance-based, computational model of the GFS that recapitulates the experimental results and identifies some of the critical anatomical and physiological components governing the circuit’s response latency. According to our model, anatomical properties of the GFS neurons have a stronger impact on the transmission than neuronal membrane conductance densities. The model provides testable predictions for the effect of experimental interventions on the circuit’s performance in young and ageing flies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Finding potential targets for preventing functional decline of neuronal circuits is important from both biological and clinical perspective. In the nervous system of &lt;i&gt;Drosophila melanogaster&lt;/i&gt;, the escape response system mediates quick propagation of signals from the brain to the muscles, instructing flight initiation following a threatening visual stimulus. It was previously shown that this circuit shows a marked decline in the speed of signal propagation with age, likely due to loss of synaptic gap junctions. Here, we generated a computational model of the system and uncovered novel anatomical and physiological parameters that govern the circuit's function in young and old animals. These predictions can be tested experimentally and have significance for other fast circuits in flies and other species.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0301-18.2019v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC) neurons signal the allocation of voluntary attention; however, the neural computations underlying this function remain unknown. To investigate this, we recorded from neuronal ensembles in the LPFC of two &lt;i&gt;macaca fascicularis&lt;/i&gt; performing a visuospatial attention task. LPFC neural responses to a single stimulus were normalized when additional stimuli/distracters appeared across the visual field and were well-characterized by an averaging computation. Deploying attention toward an individual stimulus surrounded by distracters shifted neural activity from an averaging regime toward a regime similar to that when the attended stimulus was presented in isolation (winner-take-all). However, attentional modulation is both qualitatively and quantitatively dependent on a neuron’s visuospatial tuning. Our results show that during attentive vision, LPFC neuronal ensemble activity can be robustly read out by downstream areas to generate motor commands, and/or fed back into sensory areas to filter out distracter signals in favor of target signals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC) neurons signal the allocation of voluntary attention. The neural computations underlying this phenomenon remain unknown. Here we show that neurons in the primate LPFC perform two types of normalization computations, &lt;i&gt;response averaging&lt;/i&gt; that calibrates neural activity according to the number of stimuli in the visual field, and &lt;i&gt;winner-take-all&lt;/i&gt; that biases neural activity to represent attended stimuli. These computations are global, across the entire visual field, and their strength vary across neurons depending on their visuospatial tuning. We show evidence in favor of a circuit mechanism that flexibly uses normalization computations in order to generate a signal profile in ensembles of LPFC neurons that carries sufficient information to guide the allocation of visuospatial attention.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>RSS PAP: Chronic alcohol drinking slows brain development in adolescent and young adult non-human primates</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0044-19.2019v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;The transition from adolescence to adulthood is associated with brain remodeling in the final stages of developmental growth. It is also a period when a large proportion of this age group engages to binge (occasional consumption of 4-5 drinks leading to intoxication) and heavy (binge drinking on ≥5 days in a month) alcohol drinking. Here we report on magnetic resonance imaging of developmental changes in the brain occurring during late adolescence and early adulthood (3.5-7.5 years) in a rhesus macaque model of alcohol self-administration. Monkeys were imaged prior to alcohol exposure, and following ~6 and ~12 months of daily (22 hr/day) access to ethanol and water. The results revealed that the brain volume increases by 1 ml per 1.87 years throughout the late adolescence and early adulthood in controls. Heavy alcohol reduced the rate of brain growth by 0.25 ml/year per 1 g/kg of daily ethanol. Cortical volume increased throughout this period with no significant effect of alcohol drinking on the cortical growth rate. In subcortical regions, age-dependent increases in the volumes of globus pallidus, thalamus, brainstem and cerebellum were observed. Heavy drinking attenuated the growth rate of the thalamus. Thus, developmental brain volume changes in the span of late adolescence to young adulthood in macaques is altered by excessive alcohol, an insult that may be linked to the continuation of heavy drinking throughout later adult life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Alcohol abuse during late adolescence and early adulthood is a risk factor for development of alcohol dependence. This longitudinal study used a macaque model of alcohol self-administration and &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; MR-imaging to quantify the impact of chronic alcohol on developmental changes occurring within the brain during this period. Chronic alcohol self-intoxication reduced the growth rate of brain, cerebral white matter and subcortical thalamus. Thus, daily alcohol drinking during the critical transition to adulthood significantly impacts critical areas of sensory motor integration, concomitant with a decrease in cortical white matter, documenting in the primate brain neural circuitry implicating in the propagation of alcohol use disorder.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1903.12632</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The &quot;edge of chaos&quot; phase transition in artificial neural networks is of
renewed interest in the light of recent evidence for criticality in brain
dynamics. Statistical mechanics traditionally studied this transition with
connectivity $k$ as control parameter and an exactly balanced
excitation/inhibition ratio. While critical connectivity has been found to be
low in these model systems, typically around $k=2$, which is unrealistic for
natural systems, a recent study utilizing the excitation/inhibition ratio as
control parameter found a new, nearly degree-independent critical point when
connectivity is large. However, the new phase transition is accompanied by an
unnaturally high level of activity in the network.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here we study random neural networks with the additional properties of (i) a
high clustering coefficient and (ii) neurons that are solely either excitatory
or inhibitory, a prominent property of natural neurons. As a result we observe
an additional critical point for networks with large connectivity, regardless
of degree distribution, which exhibits low activity levels that compare well
with neuronal brain networks.

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/43818</link>
	<content:encoded>The circumventricular organs (CVOs) in the central nervous system (CNS) lack a vascular blood-brain barrier (BBB), creating communication sites for sensory or secretory neurons, involved in body homeostasis. Wnt/β-catenin signaling is essential for BBB development and maintenance in endothelial cells (ECs) in most CNS vessels. Here we show that in mouse development, as well as in adult mouse and zebrafish, CVO ECs rendered Wnt-reporter negative, suggesting low level pathway activity. Characterization of the subfornical organ (SFO) vasculature revealed heterogenous claudin-5 (Cldn5) and Plvap/Meca32 expression indicative for tight and leaky vessels, respectively. Dominant, EC-specific β-catenin transcription in mice, converted phenotypically leaky into BBB-like vessels, by augmenting Cldn5+ vessels, stabilizing junctions and by reducing Plvap/Meca32&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and fenestrated vessels, resulting in decreased tracer permeability. Endothelial tightening augmented neuronal activity in the SFO of water restricted mice. Hence, regulating the SFO vessel barrier may influence neuronal function in the context of water homeostasis.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/43473</link>
	<content:encoded>Sound analysis by the cochlea relies on frequency tuning of mechanosensory hair cells along a tonotopic axis. To clarify the underlying biophysical mechanism, we have investigated the micromechanical properties of the hair cell's mechanoreceptive hair bundle within the apical half of the rat cochlea. We studied both inner and outer hair cells, which send nervous signals to the brain and amplify cochlear vibrations, respectively. We find that tonotopy is associated with gradients of stiffness and resting mechanical tension, with steeper gradients for outer hair cells, emphasizing the division of labor between the two hair-cell types. We demonstrate that tension in the tip links that convey force to the mechano-electrical transduction channels increases at reduced Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;. Finally, we reveal gradients in stiffness and tension at the level of a single tip link. We conclude that mechanical gradients of the tip-link complex may help specify the characteristic frequency of the hair cell.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/43257</link>
	<content:encoded>The brain, spinal cord, and retina are supplied by capillaries that do not permit free diffusion of molecules between serum and parenchyma, a property that defines the blood-brain and blood-retina barriers. Exceptions to this pattern are found in circumventricular organs (CVOs), small midline brain structures that are supplied by high permeability capillaries. In the eye and brain, high permeability capillaries are also present in the choriocapillaris, which supplies the retinal pigment epithelium and photoreceptors, and the ciliary body and choroid plexus, the sources of aqueous humor and cerebrospinal fluid, respectively. We show here that (1) endothelial cells in these high permeability vascular systems have very low beta-catenin signaling compared to barrier-competent endothelial cells, and (2) elevating beta-catenin signaling leads to a partial conversion of permeable endothelial cells to a barrier-type state. In one CVO, the area postrema, high permeability is maintained, in part, by local production of Wnt inhibitory factor-1.</content:encoded>

Around 90% of complexes adsorbed to the air-water interface are partly denatured. We show that the unfolded regions face the air-water interface. Denaturation by contact with air may happen at any stage of specimen preparation. Denaturation at the air-water interface is completely avoided when the complex is plunge-frozen on a substrate of hydrophilized graphene.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Every-day decisions frequently require choosing among multiple alternatives. Yet, the optimal policy for such decisions is unknown. Here we derive the normative policy for general multi-alternative decisions. This strategy requires evidence accumulation to nonlinear, time-dependent bounds, that trigger choices. A geometric symmetry in those boundaries allows the optimal strategy to be implemented by a simple neural circuit involving a normalization with fixed decision bounds and an urgency signal. The model captures several key features of the response of decision-making neurons as well as the increase in reaction time as a function of the number of alternatives, known as Hick's law. In addition, we show that, in the presence of divisive normalization and internal variability, our model can account for several so called 'irrational' behaviors such as the similarity effect as well as the violation of both the independent irrelevant alternative principle and the regularity principle.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/595827v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Episodic memory function improves through childhood and adolescence, in part due to structural maturation of the medial temporal cortex. Although partly different processes support long-term memory over shorter vs. longer intervals, memory is usually assessed after less than an hour. The aim of the present study was to test whether there are unique developmental changes in extended memory, and whether these are related to structural maturation of sub-regions of the hippocampus. 650 children and adolescents from 4.1 to 24.8 years were assessed in total 962 times (mean interval {approx} 1.8 years). Memory was assessed by the California Verbal Learning Test (CVLT) and the Rey Complex Figure Test (CFT). In addition to 30 min recall, an extended delay recall condition was administered {approx} 10 days after encoding. We found unique developmental effects on extended delay memory independently of 30 min recall performance. For visuo-constructive memory, this could be accounted for by visuo-constructive ability levels. Performance was modestly related to anterior and posterior hippocampal volume and mean diffusion. The relationships did not show an anterior-posterior hippocampal axis difference. In conclusion, extended delay memory shows unique development, likely due to changes in encoding depth or efficacy, or improvements of long-term consolidation processes.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/595710v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>To be maximally useful for neuroscience research, neural simulators must make it possible to define original models. This is especially important because a computational experiment might not only need descriptions of neurons and synapses, but also models of interactions with the environment (e.g. muscles), or the environment itself. To preserve high performance when defining new models, current simulators offer two options: low-level programming, or mark-up languages (and other domain specific languages). The first option requires time and expertise, is prone to errors, and contributes to problems with reproducibility and replicability. The second option has limited scope, since it can only describe the range of neural models covered by the ontology. Other aspects of a computational experiment, such as the stimulation protocol, cannot be expressed within this framework. &quot;Brian&quot; 2 is a complete rewrite of Brian that addresses this issue by using runtime code generation with a procedural equation-oriented approach. Brian 2 enables scientists to write code that is particularly simple and concise, closely matching the way they conceptualise their models, while the technique of runtime code generation automatically transforms high level descriptions of models into efficient low level code tailored to different hardware (e.g. CPU or GPU). We illustrate it with several challenging examples: a plastic model of the pyloric network of crustaceans, a closed-loop sensorimotor model, programmatic exploration of a neuron model, and an auditory model with real-time input from a microphone.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/595603v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Despite the widespread use of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), its precise cortical location underlying the physiological and behavioral stimulation effects are still only coarsely known. So far, mapping strategies that systematically measure TMS effects rely on center of gravity approaches and therefore localize the stimulated cortical site only approximately and indirectly. Focusing on the motor cortex, we present a new method to reliably determine the stimulated cortical site at the individual subject level. The approach combines measurements of motor evoked potentials (MEPs) at different coil positions and orientations with numerical modeling of induced electric fields. We identify sharply bounded cortical areas around the gyral crowns and rims of the motor hand area as the origin of the MEPs and show that the tangential field component and the magnitude of the electric field is most relevant for the observed effect. The identification requires relatively few measurements at different coil positions and orientations. We use extensive uncertainty and sensitivity analyses to verify the robustness of the method and identify the most critical model parameters. Our approach improves the localization of the cortex area stimulated by TMS. It is generic and can potentially be applied to other modalities such as language mapping.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/595546v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Gamma-frequency oscillations (30-120 Hz) can be separated into fast (&amp;gt;60 Hz) and slow oscillations, with different roles in neuronal encoding and information transfer. While synaptic inhibition is important for synchronization across the gamma-frequency range, the role of distinct interneuronal subtypes in fast and slow gamma states remains unclear. Here, we used optogenetics to examine the involvement of parvalbumin (PV+) and somatostatin (SST+) expressing interneurons in gamma oscillations in the mouse hippocampal CA3 ex vivo. Disrupting either PV+ or STT+ interneuron activity, via either photo-inhibition or photo-excitation, led to a decrease in the power of cholinergically-induced slow gamma oscillations. Furthermore, photo-excitation of SST+ interneurons induced fast gamma oscillations, which depended on both synaptic excitation and inhibition. Our findings support a critical role for both PV+ and SST+ interneurons in slow hippocampal gamma oscillations, and further suggest that STT+ interneurons are capable of switching the network between slow and fast gamma states.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Spatial and temporal structure of choice representations in primate prefrontal cortex</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/595520v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Divergent accounts of how choices are represented by neural populations have led to conflicting explanations of the underlying mechanisms of decision-making, ranging from persistent, attractor-based dynamics to transient, sequence-based dynamics. To evaluate these mechanisms, we characterize the spatial and temporal structure of choice representations in large neural populations in prefrontal cortex. We find that the pronounced diversity of choice responses across neurons reflects only a few, mostly persistent population patterns recruited at progressively later times before and after a choice. Brief sequential activity occurs during a saccadic choice, but is entirely absent in a delay preceding it. The diversity of choice responses, which could result from almost-random connectivity in the underlying circuits, instead largely reflects the topographical arrangement of response-field properties across the cortical surface. This spatial organization appears to form a fixed scaffold upon which the context-dependent representations of task-specific variables often observed in prefrontal cortex can be learned.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Neighborhood-statistics reveal complex dynamics of song acquisition in the zebra finch</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/595512v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Motor behaviors are continually shaped by a variety of processes such as environmental influences, development, and learning. The resulting behavioral changes are commonly quantified based on hand-picked features (e.g. syllable pitch) and assuming discrete classes of behaviors (e.g. distinct syllables). Such methods may generalize poorly across behaviors and species and are necessarily biased. Here we present an account of behavioral change based on nearest-neighbor statistics that avoids such biases and apply it to song development in the juvenile zebra finch. First, we introduce the concept of repertoire dating, whereby each syllable rendition is dated with a &quot;pseudo&quot; production-day corresponding to the day when similar renditions were typical in the behavioral repertoire. Differences in pseudo production-day across renditions isolate the components of vocal variability congruent with the long-term changes due to vocal learning and development. This variability is large, as about 10% of renditions have pseudo production-days falling more than 10 days into the future (anticipations) or into the past (regressions) relative to their actual production time. Second, we obtain a holistic, yet low-dimensional, description of vocal change in terms of a behavioral trajectory, which reproduces the pairwise similarities between renditions grouped by production time and pseudo production-day. The behavioral trajectory reveals multiple, previously unrecognized components of behavioral change operating at distinct time-scales. These components interact differently across the behavioral repertoire: diurnal change in regressions undergoes only weak overnight consolidation, whereas anticipations and typical renditions consolidate fully. Our nearest-neighbor methods yield model-free descriptions of how behavior evolves relative to itself, rather than relative to a potentially arbitrary, experimenter-defined, goal. Because of their generality, our methods appear well-suited to comparing learning across behaviors and species, and between biological and artificial systems.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Chemogenetic activation of excitatory neurons alters hippocampal neurotransmission in a dose-dependent manner</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/595504v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Designer Receptors Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs (DREADD)-based chemogenetic tools are extensively used to manipulate neuronal activity in a cell-type specific manner. Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings indicate membrane depolarization, coupled with increased neuronal firing rate, following administration of the DREADD ligand, Clozapine-N-Oxide (CNO) to activate the Gq-coupled DREADD, hM3Dq. Although hM3Dq has been used to enhance neuronal firing in order to manipulate diverse behaviors, often within thirty minutes to an hour post-CNO administration, the physiological effects on excitatory neurotransmission remain poorly understood. We investigated the influence of CNO-mediated hM3Dq DREADD activation on distinct aspects of hippocampal excitatory neurotransmission at the Schaffer collateral-CA1 synapse in hippocampal slices derived from mice expressing hM3Dq in Ca2+/calmodulin dependent protein kinase a; (CamKIIa)-positive excitatory neurons. Our results indicate a clear dose-dependent effect on fEPSP slope, with no change noted at the lower dose of CNO (1 M) and a significant, long-term decline in fEPSP slope observed at higher doses (5-20 M). Further, we noted a robust theta burst stimulus (TBS) induced long-term potentiation (LTP) in the presence of the lower CNO (1 M) dose, which was significantly attenuated at the higher CNO (20 M) dose. Whole-cell patch clamp recording revealed both complex dose-dependent regulation of excitability, and spontaneous and evoked activity of CA1 pyramidal neurons in response to hM3Dq activation across CNO concentrations. Our data indicate that CNO-mediated activation of the hM3Dq DREADD results in dose-dependent regulation of excitatory hippocampal neurotransmission, and highlight the importance of careful interpretation of behavioral experiments involving chemogenetic manipulation.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/595470v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Chronic pain is a common and severely disabling disease whose treatment is often unsatisfactory. Insights into the brain mechanisms of chronic pain promise to advance the understanding of the underlying pathophysiology and might help to develop disease markers and novel treatments. Here, we systematically and comprehensively exploited the potential of electroencephalography (EEG) to determine abnormalities of brain function during the resting state in chronic pain. To this end, we performed state-of-the-art analyses of oscillatory brain activity, brain connectivity and brain networks in 101 patients of either sex suffering from chronic pain. The results show that global and local measures of brain activity did not differ between chronic pain patients and a healthy control group. However, we observed significantly increased connectivity at theta (4 to 8 Hz) and gamma (&amp;gt; 60 Hz) frequencies in frontal brain areas as well as global network reorganization at gamma frequencies in chronic pain patients. Furthermore, a machine learning algorithm could differentiate between patients and healthy controls with an above-chance accuracy of 57%, mostly based on frontal connectivity. These results implicate increased theta and gamma synchrony in frontal brain areas in the pathophysiology of chronic pain. While substantial challenges concerning accuracy, specificity and validity of potential EEG-based disease markers remain to be overcome, our study identifies abnormal frontal synchrony at theta and gamma frequencies as promising targets for non-invasive brain stimulation and/or neurofeedback approaches.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Neural dynamics of the attentional blink revealed by encoding orientation selectivity during rapid visual presentation</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/595355v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>The human brain is inherently limited in the information it can make consciously accessible. When people monitor a rapid stream of visual items for two targets, they can typically report the first, but not the second target, if these appear within 200-500 ms of each other, a phenomenon known as the attentional blink (AB). No extant theory has pinpointed the neural basis for the AB, partly because conventional neuroimaging approaches lack the temporal resolution to adequately characterise the neural activity elicited by each stimulus event in a rapid stream. Here we introduce a new approach that can identify the precise effect of the AB on behaviour and neural activity. Specifically, we employed multivariate pattern analysis to extract feature-selective information carried by randomly-oriented Gabors within a rapid serial stream. We show that orientation selectivity is enhanced for correctly reported targets, and suppressed when the same items are missed. By contrast, no such effects were apparent for irrelevant distractor items. Our findings point to a new theoretical account that involves both short-range and long-range temporal interactions between visual items competing for consciousness.</content:encoded>

	<title>bioRxiv Subject Collection: Neuroscience: Neural Correlates of Attitudes and Risk Perception for Food Technology Topics</title>
	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/595314v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Food technologies provide numerous benefits to society and are extensively vetted for safety. However, many technological innovations still face high levels of skepticism from consumers. To promote development and use of food technologies, it is critical to understand the underlying causes of consumer acceptability concerns. The current study uses a neuroscience-based approach to understand consumer attitudes and perceptions of risk associated with food technologies and investigate how such attitudes impact consumer's processing of information related to food technologies. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to measure brain activation while participants processed infographics related to food technology topics. For technology topics perceived as riskier (antibiotics and hormones), activation was higher in areas of the lateral prefrontal cortex (P &amp;lt; .001) that are associated with decisional uncertainty. In contrast, technology topics that were viewed more favorably (sustainability and animal welfare) tended to activate the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (P = .049), a region that processes positive affect and subjective value. Moreover, for information about hormones, the lateral PFC activation was associated with individual differences in resistance to change in risk perception (P = .01). These results reveal how attitudes and risk perception relate to how the brain processes information about food technologies and how people respond to information about such technologies.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>The nematodes C. elegans and P. pacificus populate diverse habitats and display distinct patterns of behavior. To understand how their nervous systems have diverged, we undertook a detailed examination of the neuroanatomy of the chemosensory system of P. pacificus. Using independent features such as cell body position, axon projections and lipophilic dye uptake, we have assigned homologies between the amphid neurons, their first-layer interneurons, and several internal receptor neurons of P. pacificus and C. elegans. We found that neuronal number and soma position are highly conserved. However, the morphological elaborations of several amphid cilia are different between them, most notably in the absence of  winged cilia morphology in P. pacificus. We established a synaptic wiring diagram of amphid sensory neurons and amphid interneurons in P. pacificus and found striking patterns of conservation and divergence in connectivity relative to C. elegans, but very little changes in relative neighborhood of neuronal processes.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/595009v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Desensitization is a canonical property of ligand-gated ion channels, causing progressive current decline in the continued presence of agonist. AMPA-type glutamate receptors, which mediate fast excitatory signaling throughout the brain, exhibit profound desensitization. Recent cryo-EM studies of AMPAR assemblies show their ion channels to be closed in the desensitized state. Here we report the surprising finding that homomeric Q/R edited AMPARs still allow ions to flow when the receptors are desensitized. GluA2(R) expressed alone, or with auxiliary subunits ({gamma}-2, {gamma}-8 or GSG1L), generates large steady-state currents and anomalous current-variance relationships. Using fluctuation analysis, single-channel recording, and kinetic modeling we demonstrate that the steady-state current is mediated predominantly by 'conducting desensitized' receptors. When combined with crystallography this unique functional readout of a hitherto silent state enabled us to examine cross-linked cysteine mutants to probe the conformation of the desensitized ligand binding domain of functioning AMPAR complexes within the plasma membrane.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/591487v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Therapies currently in preclinical development for prion disease seek to lower prion protein (PrP) expression in the brain. Trials of such therapies are likely to rely on quantification of PrP in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) as a pharmacodynamic biomarker and possibly as a trial endpoint. Studies using PrP ELISA kits have reproducibly shown that CSF PrP is lowered in the symptomatic phase of disease, a potential confounder for reading out the effect of PrP-lowering drugs in symptomatic patients. To date it has been unclear whether the reduced abundance of PrP in CSF results from its incorporation into plaques, retention in intracellular compartments, downregulation as a function of the disease process, or other factors. Because misfolding or proteolytic cleavage could potentially render PrP invisible to ELISA even if its concentration were constant or increasing in disease, we sought to establish an orthogonal method for CSF PrP quantification. We developed a targeted mass spectrometry method based on multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) of nine PrP tryptic peptides quantified relative to known concentrations of isotopically labeled standards. Analytical validation experiments showed process replicate coefficients of variation below 15%, good dilution linearity and recovery, and suitable performance for both CSF and brain homogenate and across humans as well as preclinical species of interest. In N=55 CSF samples from individuals referred to prion surveillance centers with rapidly progressive dementia, all six human PrP peptides, spanning the N- and C-terminal domains of PrP, were uniformly reduced in prion disease cases compared to individuals with non-prion diagnoses. This confirms the findings from ELISA studies, demonstrating that lowered CSF PrP concentration in prion disease is a genuine result of the disease process and not merely an artifact of ELISA-based measurement. We provide a targeted mass spectrometry-based method suitable for preclinical and clinical quantification of CSF PrP as a tool for drug development.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/594960v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Latent neural circuitry in the female brain encoding male-like mating behaviors has been revealed in both mice and flies. In Drosophila, a key component of this circuitry consists of the doublesex-expressing pC1 neurons, which were deemed to exist in both sexes and function based on the amount of cells being activated. Here, we identify pC1-alpha, a female-specific subtype of pC1, as responsible for inducing persistent male-like social behaviors in females. We demonstrate that activation of a single pC1-alpha neuron is sufficient for such induction in a position- and direction-selective manner, and activity of pC1-alpha neurons as a whole is indispensable for maintaining normal sexual receptivity. These dual functions of pC1-alpha may require different neurotransmission, with acetylcholine specifically required for the former but not the latter. Our findings suggest that pC1-alpha may be the female counterpart of male P1 due to their shared similarities in morphology, lineage, and social promoting function.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/594895v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>The ultimate function of a neuron is determined by both its physiology and connectivity, but the transcriptional regulatory mechanisms that coordinate these two features are not well understood1-4. The Drosophila olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) provide an excellent system to investigate this question. As in mammals5, each Drosophila ORN class is defined by the expression of a single olfactory receptor or a unique combination thereof, which determines their odor responses, and by the single glomerulus to which their axons target, which determines how sensory signals are represented in the brain6-10. In mammals, the coordination of olfactory receptor expression and wiring specificity is accomplished in part by olfactory receptors themselves regulating ORN wiring specificity11-13. However, Drosophila olfactory receptors do not instruct axon targeting6, 14, raising the question as to how receptor expression and wiring specificity are coordinated. Using single-cell RNA-sequencing and genetic analysis, we identified 33 transcriptomic clusters for fly ORNs. We unambiguously mapped 17 to glomerular classes, demonstrating that transcriptomic clusters correspond well with anatomically and physiologically defined ORN classes. We found that each ORN expresses ~150 transcription factors (TFs), and identified a master TF that regulates both olfactory receptor expression and wiring specificity. A second TF plays distinct roles, regulating only receptor expression in one class and only wiring in another. Thus, fly ORNs utilize diverse transcriptional strategies to coordinate physiology and connectivity.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/594887v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>The ventral pallidum (VP) is critical for invigorating reward seeking and is also involved in punishment avoidance, but how it contributes to such opposing behavioural actions remains unclear. Here we show that GABAergic and glutamatergic VP neurons selectively control behaviour in opposing motivational contexts. In vivo recording combined with optogenetics in mice revealed that these two populations oppositely encode positive and negative motivational value, are differentially modulated by animals internal state and determine the behavioural response during motivational conflict. Furthermore, GABAergic VP neurons are essential for movements towards reward in a positive motivational context, but suppress movements in an aversive context. In contrast, glutamatergic VP neurons are essential for movements to avoid a threat but suppress movements in an appetitive context. Our results indicate that GABAergic and glutamatergic VP neurons encode the drive for approach and avoidance, respectively, with the balance between their activities determining the type of motivational behaviour.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/594820v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Tau is a microtubule-binding protein that can receive various post-translational modifications (PTMs) including phosphorylation, methylation, acetylation, glycosylation, nitration, sumoylation and truncation. Hyperphosphorylation of tau is linked to its aggregation and the formation of neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), which are a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD). While more than 70 phosphorylation sites have been detected previously on NFT tau, studies of oligomeric and detergent-soluble tau in human brains during the early stages of AD are lacking. Here we apply a comprehensive electrochemiluminescence ELISA assay to analyze twenty-five different PTM sites as well as tau oligomerization in control and sporadic AD brain. The samples were classified as Braak stages 0-I, II or III-IV, respectively, corresponding to the progression of microscopically detectable tau pathology throughout different brain regions. We find that soluble tau oligomers are strongly increased at Braak stages III-IV in all brain regions under investigation, including the temporal cortex, which does not contain NFTs at this stage of pathology. We additionally identified five phosphorylation sites that are specifically and consistently increased across the entorhinal cortex, hippocampus and temporal cortex in the same donors. Three of these sites correlate with tau oligomerization in all three brain regions, but do not overlap with the epitopes of phospho-sensitive antibodies commonly used for the immunohistochemical detection of NFTs. Our results thus suggest that soluble oligomers are characterized by a small set of specific phosphorylation events that differ from those dominating in mature NFTs and shed light on early PTM changes of tau during AD pathogenesis in human brains.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/594747v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Memory retrieval is thought to involve the reactivation of encoding processes. Previous fMRI work has indicated that reactivation processes are modulated by the residual effects of the prior emotional encoding context; different spatial patterns emerge during retrieval of memories previously associated with negative compared to positive or neutral context. Other research suggests that ERP indicators of memory retrieval processes, like the left parietal old/new effect, can also be modulated by emotion, but the spatial distribution and temporal dynamics of these effects is unclear. In the current study, we examined when emotion affects memory reactivation and whether that timing reflects processes that come before and may guide successful retrieval or post-recollection recovery of emotional episodic detail. While recording EEG, participants (N = 25) viewed neutral words paired with negative, positive or neutral pictures during encoding, followed by a recognition test for the words. Analyses focused on ERPs during the recognition test. In line with prior ERP studies, we found an early positive-going parietally distributed effect starting around 200 ms post retrieval-cue onset. This effect emerged for words that had been encoded in an emotional compared to neutral context (no valence differences), before the general old/new effect. This emotion-dependent effect occurred in an early time window, suggesting emotion-related reactivation is a precursor to successful recognition.</content:encoded>

	<link>http://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/594721v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Microglia, the brain-resident macrophages, exhibit highly dynamic functions in neurodevelopment and neurodegeneration. Human microglia possess unique features as compared to mouse microglia, but our understanding of human microglial functions is largely limited by an inability to obtain human microglia under resting, homeostatic states. We developed a human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC)-based microglial chimeric mouse brain model by transplanting hPSC-derived primitive macrophage precursors into neonatal mouse brains. The engrafted human microglia widely disperse in the brain and replace mouse microglia in corpus callosum at 6 months post-transplantation. Single-cell RNA-sequencing of the hPSC microglial chimeric mouse brains reveals that xenografted hPSC-derived microglia largely retain human microglial identity, as they exhibit signature gene expression patterns consistent with physiological human microglia and recapitulate heterogeneity of adult human microglia. Importantly, the chimeric mouse brain also models species-specific transcriptomic differences in the expression of neurological disease-risk genes in microglia. This model will serve as a novel tool to study the role of human microglia in brain development and degeneration</content:encoded>

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: Plasminogen Activator Inhibitor‐1 Augments Damage by Impairing Fibrinolysis after Traumatic Brain Injury</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25458?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plasminogen activator inhibitor‐1 (PAI‐1) is the key endogenous inhibitor of fibrinolysis, and enhances clot formation after injury. In traumatic brain injury, dysregulation of fibrinolysis may lead to sustained microthrombosis and accelerated lesion expansion. In the present study, we hypothesized that PAI‐1 mediates post‐traumatic malfunction of coagulation, with inhibition or genetic depletion of PAI‐1 attenuating clot formation and lesion expansion after brain trauma.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We evaluated PAI‐1 as a possible new target in a mouse controlled cortical impact (CCI) model of traumatic brain injury. We performed the pharmacological inhibition of PAI‐1 with PAI‐039 and stimulation by tranexamic acid, and we confirmed our results in PAI‐1–deficient animals.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PAI‐1 mRNA was time‐dependently upregulated, with a 305‐fold peak 12 hours after CCI, which effectively counteracted the 2‐ to 3‐fold increase in cerebral tissue‐type/urokinase plasminogen activator expression. PAI‐039 reduced brain lesion volume by 26% at 24 hours and 43% at 5 days after insult. This treatment also attenuated neuronal apoptosis and improved neurofunctional outcome. Moreover, intravital microscopy demonstrated reduced post‐traumatic thrombus formation in the pericontusional cortical microvasculature. In PAI‐1–deficient mice, the therapeutic effect of PAI‐039 was absent. These mice also displayed 13% reduced brain damage compared with wild type. In contrast, inhibition of fibrinolysis with tranexamic acid increased lesion volume by 25% compared with vehicle.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study identifies impaired fibrinolysis as a critical process in post‐traumatic secondary brain damage and suggests that PAI‐1 may be a central endogenous inhibitor of the fibrinolytic pathway, promoting a procoagulatory state and clot formation in the cerebral microvasculature.

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: Silent Progression in Disease Activity–Free Relapsing Multiple Sclerosis</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25463?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rates of worsening and evolution to secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (MS) may be substantially lower in actively treated patients compared to natural history studies from the pretreatment era. Nonetheless, in our recently reported prospective cohort, more than half of patients with relapsing MS accumulated significant new disability by the 10th year of follow‐up. Notably, “no evidence of disease activity” at 2 years did not predict long‐term stability. Here, we determined to what extent clinical relapses and radiographic evidence of disease activity contribute to long‐term disability accumulation.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disability progression was defined as an increase in Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) of 1.5, 1.0, or 0.5 (or greater) from baseline EDSS = 0, 1.0–5.0, and 5.5 or higher, respectively, assessed from baseline to year 5 (±1 year) and sustained to year 10 (±1 year). Longitudinal analysis of relative brain volume loss used a linear mixed model with sex, age, disease duration, and &lt;i&gt;HLA‐DRB1*15:01&lt;/i&gt; as covariates.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Relapses were associated with a transient increase in disability over 1‐year intervals (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.012) but not with confirmed disability progression (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.551). Relative brain volume declined at a greater rate among individuals with disability progression compared to those who remained stable (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.05).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Long‐term worsening is common in relapsing MS patients, is largely independent of relapse activity, and is associated with accelerated brain atrophy. We propose the term &lt;i&gt;silent progression&lt;/i&gt; to describe the insidious disability that accrues in many patients who satisfy traditional criteria for relapsing–remitting MS.

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Children Use Regions in the Visual Processing and Executive Function Networks during a Subsequent Memory Reading Task</title>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhz057/5423759?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Memory encoding is a critical process for memory function, which is foundational for cognitive functioning including reading, and has been extensively studied using subsequent memory tasks. Research in adults using such tasks indicates the participation of visual and cognitive-control systems in remembered versus forgotten words. However, given the known developmental trajectories of these systems, the functional neuroanatomy of memory encoding in children may be different than in adults. We examined brain activation for silent word reading and checkerboard viewing during an event-related reading task in 8–12 year-old children. Results indicate greater activation for checkerboard viewing than lexical processing in early visual regions, as well as for lexical processing versus checkerboard viewing in regions in left sensorimotor mouth, cingulo-opercular and dorsal-attention networks. Greater activation for remembered than forgotten words was observed in bilateral visual system and left lateralized regions within the ventral- and dorsal-attention, cingulo-opercular and fronto-parietal networks. These findings suggest a relatively mature reliance on the cognitive-control system, but greater reliance on the visual system in children when viewing words subsequently remembered. The location of regions with greater activity for remembered words reinforces the involvement of the attention and cognitive-control systems in subsequent memory in reading.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Diffusion MR tractography permits investigating the 3D structure of cortical pathways as interwoven paths across the entire brain. We use high-resolution scans from diffusion spectrum imaging and high angular resolution diffusion imaging to investigate the evolution of cortical pathways within the euarchontoglire (i.e., primates, rodents) lineage. More specifically, we compare cortical fiber pathways between macaques (&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Macaca mulatta&lt;/span&gt;), marmosets (&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Callithrix jachus&lt;/span&gt;), and rodents (mice, &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Mus musculus&lt;/span&gt;). We integrate these observations with comparative analyses of Neurofilament heavy polypeptide (&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;NEFH&lt;/span&gt;) expression across the cortex of mice and primates. We chose these species because their phylogenetic position serves to trace the early evolutionary history of the human brain. Our comparative analysis from diffusion MR tractography, cortical white matter scaling, and &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;NEFH&lt;/span&gt; expression demonstrates that the examined primates deviate from mice in possessing increased long-range cross-cortical projections, many of which course across the anterior to posterior axis of the cortex. Our study shows that integrating gene expression data with diffusion MR data is an effective approach in identifying variation in connectivity patterns between species. The expansion of corticocortical pathways and increased anterior to posterior cortical integration can be traced back to an extension of neurogenetic schedules during development in primates.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Developmental neuroimaging studies report the emergence of increasingly diverse cognitive functions as closely entangled with a rise-fall modulation of cortical thickness (CTh), structural cortical and white-matter connectivity, and a time-course for the experience-dependent selective elimination of the overproduced synapses. We examine which of two visual processing networks, the dorsal (DVN; prefrontal, parietal nodes) or ventral (VVN; frontal-temporal, fusiform nodes) matures first, thus leading the neuro-cognitive developmental trajectory. Three age-dependent measures are reported: (i) the CTh at network nodes; (ii) the matrix of intra-network structural connectivity (&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;edges&lt;/span&gt;); and (iii) the proficiency in network-related neuropsychological tests. Typically developing children (age ~6 years), adolescents (~11 years), and adults (~21 years) were tested using multiple-acquisition structural T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and neuropsychology. MRI images reconstructed into a gray/white/pial matter boundary model were used for CTh evaluation. No significant group differences in CTh and in the matrix of edges were found for DVN (except for the left prefrontal), but a significantly thicker cortex in children for VVN with reduced prefrontal ventral-fusiform connectivity and with an abundance of connections in adolescents. The higher performance in children on tests related to DVN corroborates the age-dependent MRI structural connectivity findings. The current findings are consistent with an earlier maturational course of DVN.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Bayesian inference of transmission chains using timing of symptoms, pathogen genomes and contact data</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/cewgawFrZu4/article</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Finlay Campbell, Anne Cori, Neil Ferguson, Thibaut Jombart&lt;/p&gt;

There exists significant interest in developing statistical and computational tools for inferring ‘who infected whom’ in an infectious disease outbreak from densely sampled case data, with most recent studies focusing on the analysis of whole genome sequence data. However, genomic data can be poorly informative of transmission events if mutations accumulate too slowly to resolve individual transmission pairs or if there exist multiple pathogens lineages within-host, and there has been little focus on incorporating other types of outbreak data. We present here a methodology that uses contact data for the inference of transmission trees in a statistically rigorous manner, alongside genomic data and temporal data. Contact data is frequently collected in outbreaks of pathogens spread by close contact, including Ebola virus (EBOV), severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and &lt;i&gt;Mycobacterium tuberculosis&lt;/i&gt; (TB), and routinely used to reconstruct transmission chains. As an improvement over previous, ad-hoc approaches, we developed a probabilistic model that relates a set of contact data to an underlying transmission tree and integrated this in the &lt;i&gt;outbreaker2&lt;/i&gt; inference framework. By analyzing simulated outbreaks under various contact tracing scenarios, we demonstrate that contact data significantly improves our ability to reconstruct transmission trees, even under realistic limitations on the coverage of the contact tracing effort and the amount of non-infectious mixing between cases. Indeed, contact data is equally or more informative than fully sampled whole genome sequence data in certain scenarios. We then use our method to analyze the early stages of the 2003 SARS outbreak in Singapore and describe the range of transmission scenarios consistent with contact data and genetic sequence in a probabilistic manner for the first time. This simple yet flexible model can easily be incorporated into existing tools for outbreak reconstruction and should permit a better integration of genomic and epidemiological data for inferring transmission chains.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/cewgawFrZu4&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Bayes-optimal estimation of overlap between populations of fixed size</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/f5tbvTBDGlg/article</link>

Measuring the overlap between two populations is, in principle, straightforward. Upon fully sampling both populations, the number of shared objects—species, taxonomical units, or gene variants, depending on the context—can be directly counted. In practice, however, only a fraction of each population’s objects are likely to be sampled due to stochastic data collection or sequencing techniques. Although methods exists for quantifying population overlap under subsampled conditions, their bias is well documented and the uncertainty of their estimates cannot be quantified. Here we derive and validate a method to rigorously estimate the population overlap from incomplete samples when the total number of objects, species, or genes in each population is known, a special case of the more general &lt;i&gt;β&lt;/i&gt;-diversity problem that is particularly relevant in the ecology and genomic epidemiology of malaria. By solving a Bayesian inference problem, this method takes into account the rates of subsampling and produces unbiased and Bayes-optimal estimates of overlap. In addition, it provides a natural framework for computing the uncertainty of its estimates, and can be used prospectively in study planning by quantifying the tradeoff between sampling effort and uncertainty.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/f5tbvTBDGlg&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: The Rat Medial Prefrontal Cortex Exhibits Flexible Neural Activity States during the Performance of an Odor Span Task</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/6/2/ENEURO.0424-18.2019?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) activity is fundamental for working memory (WM), attention, and behavioral inhibition; however, a comprehensive understanding of the neural computations underlying these processes is still forthcoming. Toward this goal, neural recordings were obtained from the mPFC of awake, behaving rats performing an odor span task of WM capacity. Neural populations were observed to encode distinct task epochs and the transitions between epochs were accompanied by abrupt shifts in neural activity patterns. Putative pyramidal neuron activity increased earlier in the delay for sessions where rats achieved higher spans. Furthermore, increased putative interneuron activity was only observed at the termination of the delay thus indicating that local processing in inhibitory networks was a unique feature to initiate foraging. During foraging, changes in neural activity patterns associated with the approach to a novel odor, but not familiar odors, were robust. Collectively, these data suggest that distinct mPFC activity states underlie the delay, foraging, and reward epochs of the odor span task. Transitions between these states likely enables adaptive behavior in dynamic environments that place strong demands on the substrates of working memory.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1903.12155</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Cross-frequency coupling (CFC) is thought to play an important role in
communication across distant brain regions. However, neither the mechanism of
its generation nor the influence on the underlying spiking dynamics is well
understood. Here, we investigate the dynamics of two interacting distant
neuronal modules coupled by inter-regional long-range connections. Each
neuronal module comprises an excitatory and inhibitory population of quadratic
integrate-and-fire neurons connected locally with conductance-based synapses.
The two modules are coupled reciprocally with delays that represent the
long-range conduction time. We applied the Ott-Antonsen ansatz to reduce the
spiking dynamics to the corresponding mean field equations as a small set of
delay differential equations. Bifurcation analysis on these mean field
equations shows inter-regional conduction delay is sufficient to produce CFC
via a torus bifurcation. Spike correlation analysis during the CFC revealed
that several local clusters exhibit synchronized firing in gamma-band
frequencies. These clusters exhibit locally decorrelated firings between the
cluster pairs within the same population. In contrast, the clusters exhibit
long-range gamma-band cross-covariance between the distant clusters that have
similar firing frequency. The interactions of the different gamma frequencies
produce a beat leading to population-level CFC. We analyzed spike counts in
relation to the phases of the macroscopic fast and slow oscillations and found
population spike counts vary with respect to macroscopic phases. Such firing
phase preference accompanies a phase window with high spike count and low Fano
factor, which is suitable for a population rate code. Our work suggests the
inter-regional conduction delay plays a significant role in the emergence of
CFC and the underlying spiking dynamics may support long-range communication
and neural coding.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1903.12009</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The pharynx of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans is a neuromuscular pump
that exhibits two typical motions: pumping and peristalsis. While the dynamics
of these motions are well characterized, the underlying mechanisms generating
most of them are not known. In this paper, we propose comprehensive and
detailed mechanisms that can explain the various observed dynamics of the
different pharyngeal areas: the dynamics of the pumping muscles - corpus,
anterior isthmus, and terminal bulb - and the peristalsis dynamics of the
posterior isthmus muscles. While the suggested mechanisms are consistent with
all available relevant data, the assumptions on which they are based and the
open questions they raise could point at additional interesting research
directions on the C. elegans pharynx. We are hoping that appropriate
experiments on the nematode will eventually corroborate our results, and
improve our understanding of the functioning of the C. elegans pharynx, and
possibly of the mammalian digestive system.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1903.11972</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A central problem of neuroscience involves uncovering the principles
governing the organization of nervous systems which ensure robustness in brain
development. The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, where genetically identical
individuals possess the same complement of neurons located at invariant
positions, provides us with a model organism for studying this question. In
this paper, we focus on the connection structure and spatial arrangement of the
neurons comprising the somatic neuronal network of this organism to understand
the key developmental constraints underlying the design of a simple nervous
system. We observe that lineage distance between neurons, rather than the
physical distance between their cell bodies, strongly influences the
probability of a connection between them. In addition, the length of neuronal
processes, as well as, their birth times determine connectivity. Together,
these results help connect the physical location and morphology of neurons with
the topological organization of the network. Further, neurons coordinating
activity across distinct neuronal clusters are seen to appear early which
relates the temporal hierarchy imposed by development to the functional role of
neurons. By providing a framework for a mechanistic understanding of how
development shapes a nervous system, our results complement interpretive
analysis of how efficiency and optimality govern its design. Providing crucial
insights for understanding principles that may be common across many organisms,
our study shows how the trajectory in the developmental landscape constrains
the eventual spatial and network topological organization of a nervous system.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Early deafness leads to re-shaping of global functional connectivity beyond the auditory cortex. (arXiv:1903.11915v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1903.11915</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Early sensory deprivation such as blindness or deafness shapes brain
development in multiple ways. While it is established that deprived brain areas
start to be engaged in the processing of stimuli from the remaining modalities
and in high-level cognitive tasks, some reports have also suggested the
possibility of structural and functional changes in non-deprived brain areas.
We compared resting-state functional network organization of the brain in
early-deaf adults and hearing controls by examining global network segregation
and integration. Relative to hearing controls, deaf adults exhibited an altered
modular organization, with regions of the salience network coupled with the
fronto-parietal network. They showed weaker connections between auditory and
somatomotor regions, stronger coupling between the fronto-parietal network and
several other large-scale networks (visual, memory, cingulo-opercular and
somatomotor), and an enlargement of the default mode network. Their overall
functional segregation of brain networks was also lower. Our findings suggest
that brain plasticity in deaf adults is not limited to changes in auditory
cortex but additionally alters the coupling between other large-scale networks.
These widespread functional connectivity changes may provide a mechanism for
the superior behavioral performance of the deaf in visual and attentional
tasks.

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/44597</link>
	<content:encoded>Cell-cell communication in multicellular organisms depends on the dynamic and reversible phosphorylation of protein tyrosine residues. The receptor-linked protein tyrosine phosphatases (RPTPs) receive cues from the extracellular environment and are well placed to influence cell signaling. However, the direct events downstream of these receptors have been challenging to resolve. We report here that the homophilic receptor PTPRK is stabilized at cell-cell contacts in epithelial cells. By combining interaction studies, quantitative tyrosine phosphoproteomics, proximity labeling and dephosphorylation assays we identify high confidence PTPRK substrates. PTPRK directly and selectively dephosphorylates at least five substrates, including Afadin, PARD3 and δ-catenin family members, which are all important cell-cell adhesion regulators. In line with this, loss of PTPRK phosphatase activity leads to disrupted cell junctions and increased invasive characteristics. Thus, identifying PTPRK substrates provides insight into its downstream signaling and a potential molecular explanation for its proposed tumor suppressor function.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Research on somatosensory awareness has yielded highly diverse findings with putative neural correlates ranging from activity within somatosensory cortex to activation of widely distributed frontoparietal networks. Divergent results from previous studies may reside in cognitive processes that often coincide with stimulus awareness in experimental settings. To scrutinise the specific relevance of regions implied in the target detection network, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (n = 27) on a novel somatosensory detection task that explicitly controls for stimulus uncertainty, behavioural relevance, overt reports, and motor responses. Using Bayesian Model Selection, we show that responses reflecting target detection are restricted to secondary somatosensory cortex, whereas activity in insular, cingulate, and motor regions is best explained in terms of stimulus uncertainty and overt reports. Our results emphasise the role of sensory-specific cortex for the emergence of perceptual awareness and dissect the contribution of the frontoparietal network to classical detection tasks.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>While genomic sequencing routinely identifies oncogenic alterations for the majority of cancers, many tumors harbor no discernable driver lesion. Here, we describe the exceptional molecular phenotype of a genomically quiet kidney tumor, clear cell papillary renal cell carcinoma (CCPAP). In spite of a largely wild-type nuclear genome, CCPAP tumors exhibit severe depletion of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and RNA and high levels of oxidative stress, reflecting a shift away from respiratory metabolism. Moreover, CCPAP tumors exhibit a distinct metabolic phenotype uniquely characterized by accumulation of the sugar alcohol sorbitol. Immunohistochemical staining of primary CCPAP tumor specimens recapitulates both the depletion of mtDNA-encoded proteins and a lipid-depleted metabolic phenotype, suggesting that the cytoplasmic clarity in CCPAP is primarily related to the presence of glycogen. These results argue for non-genetic profiling as a tool for the study of cancers of unknown driver.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Tomasz Miksa, Stephanie Simms, Daniel Mietchen, Sarah Jones&lt;/p&gt;

Data management plans (DMPs) are documents accompanying research proposals and project outputs. DMPs are created as free-form text and describe the data and tools employed in scientific investigations. They are often seen as an administrative exercise and not as an integral part of research practice.
There is now widespread recognition that the DMP can have more thematic, machine-actionable richness with added value for all stakeholders: researchers, funders, repository managers, research administrators, data librarians, and others. The research community is moving toward a shared goal of making DMPs machine-actionable to improve the experience for all involved by exchanging information across research tools and systems and embedding DMPs in existing workflows. This will enable parts of the DMP to be automatically generated and shared, thus reducing administrative burdens and improving the quality of information within a DMP.
This paper presents 10 principles to put machine-actionable DMPs (maDMPs) into practice and realize their benefits. The principles contain specific actions that various stakeholders are already undertaking or should undertake in order to work together across research communities to achieve the larger aims of the principles themselves. We describe existing initiatives to highlight how much progress has already been made toward achieving the goals of maDMPs as well as a call to action for those who wish to get involved.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/SAC1K08XnXo&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Lawrence W. Sheppard, Emma J. Defriez, Philip C. Reid, Daniel C. Reuman&lt;/p&gt;

Large-scale spatial synchrony is ubiquitous in ecology. We examined 56 years of data representing chlorophyll density in 26 areas in British seas monitored by the Continuous Plankton Recorder survey. We used wavelet methods to disaggregate synchronous fluctuations by timescale and determine that drivers of synchrony include both biotic and abiotic variables. We tested these drivers for statistical significance by comparison with spatially synchronous surrogate data. Identification of causes of synchrony is distinct from, and goes beyond, determining drivers of local population dynamics. We generated timescale-specific models, accounting for 61% of long-timescale (&amp;gt; 4yrs) synchrony in a chlorophyll density index, but only 3% of observed short-timescale (&amp;lt; 4yrs) synchrony. Thus synchrony and its causes are timescale-specific. The dominant source of long-timescale chlorophyll synchrony was closely related to sea surface temperature, through a climatic Moran effect, though likely via complex oceanographic mechanisms. The top-down action of &lt;i&gt;Calanus finmarchicus&lt;/i&gt; predation enhances this environmental synchronising mechanism and interacts with it non-additively to produce more long-timescale synchrony than top-down and climatic drivers would produce independently. Our principal result is therefore a demonstration of interaction effects between Moran drivers of synchrony, a new mechanism for synchrony that may influence many ecosystems at large spatial scales.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/Yd2a_ZVza5U&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

At the root of the so-called precision medicine or precision oncology, which is our focus here, is the hypothesis that cancer treatment would be considerably better if therapies were guided by a tumor’s genomic alterations. This hypothesis has sparked major initiatives focusing on whole-genome and/or exome sequencing, creation of large databases, and developing tools for their statistical analyses—all aspiring to identify actionable alterations, and thus molecular targets, in a patient. At the center of the massive amount of collected sequence data is their interpretations that largely rest on statistical analysis and phenotypic observations. Statistics is vital, because it guides identification of cancer-driving alterations. However, statistics of mutations do not identify a change in protein conformation; therefore, it may not define sufficiently accurate actionable mutations, neglecting those that are rare. Among the many thematic overviews of precision oncology, this review innovates by further comprehensively including precision pharmacology, and within this framework, articulating its protein structural landscape and consequences to cellular signaling pathways. It provides the underlying physicochemical basis, thereby also opening the door to a broader community.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/mS1vyPanHNg&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

The complexity of morphogenesis poses a fundamental challenge to understanding the mechanisms governing the formation of biological patterns and structures. Over the past century, numerous processes have been identified as critically contributing to morphogenetic events, but the interplay between the various components and aspects of pattern formation have been much harder to grasp. The combination of traditional biology with mathematical and computational methods has had a profound effect on our current understanding of morphogenesis and led to significant insights and advancements in the field. In particular, the theoretical concepts of reaction–diffusion systems and positional information, proposed by Alan Turing and Lewis Wolpert, respectively, dramatically influenced our general view of morphogenesis, although typically in isolation from one another. In recent years, agent-based modeling has been emerging as a consolidation and implementation of the two theories within a single framework. Agent-based models (ABMs) are unique in their ability to integrate combinations of heterogeneous processes and investigate their respective dynamics, especially in the context of spatial phenomena. In this review, we highlight the benefits and technical challenges associated with ABMs as tools for examining morphogenetic events. These models display unparalleled flexibility for studying various morphogenetic phenomena at multiple levels and have the important advantage of informing future experimental work, including the targeted engineering of tissues and organs.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/K4dAt_Ajxt4&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: A computational framework To assess genome-wide distribution Of polymorphic human endogenous retrovirus-K In human populations</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/KvZEpjtiJuo/article</link>

Human Endogenous Retrovirus type K (HERV-K) is the only HERV known to be insertionally polymorphic; not all individuals have a retrovirus at a specific genomic location. It is possible that HERV-Ks contribute to human disease because people differ in both number and genomic location of these retroviruses. Indeed viral transcripts, proteins, and antibody against HERV-K are detected in cancers, auto-immune, and neurodegenerative diseases. However, attempts to link a polymorphic HERV-K with any disease have been frustrated in part because population prevalence of HERV-K provirus at each polymorphic site is lacking and it is challenging to identify closely related elements such as HERV-K from short read sequence data. We present an integrated and computationally robust approach that uses whole genome short read data to determine the occupation status at all sites reported to contain a HERV-K provirus. Our method estimates the proportion of fixed length genomic sequence (&lt;i&gt;k-mers&lt;/i&gt;) from whole genome sequence data matching a reference set of &lt;i&gt;k-mers&lt;/i&gt; unique to each HERV-K locus and applies mixture model-based clustering of these values to account for low depth sequence data. Our analysis of 1000 Genomes Project Data (KGP) reveals numerous differences among the five KGP super-populations in the prevalence of individual and co-occurring HERV-K proviruses; we provide a visualization tool to easily depict the proportion of the KGP populations with any combination of polymorphic HERV-K provirus. Further, because HERV-K is insertionally polymorphic, the genome burden of known polymorphic HERV-K is variable in humans; this burden is lowest in East Asian (EAS) individuals. Our study identifies population-specific sequence variation for HERV-K proviruses at several loci. We expect these resources will advance research on HERV-K contributions to human diseases.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/KvZEpjtiJuo&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>RSS PAP: Signature patterns for top-down and bottom-up information processing via cross-frequency coupling in macaque auditory cortex</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0467-18.2019v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Predictive coding is a theoretical framework that provides a functional interpretation of top-down and bottom up interactions in sensory processing. The theory suggests there are differences in message passing up vs. down the cortical hierarchy. These differences result from the linear feedforward of prediction errors, and the nonlinear feedback of predictions. This implies that cross-frequency interactions should predominate top-down. But it remains unknown whether these differences are expressed in cross-frequency interactions in the brain. Here we examined bi-directional cross-frequency coupling across four sectors of the auditory hierarchy in the macaque. We computed two measures of cross-frequency coupling, phase-amplitude coupling (PAC) and amplitude-amplitude coupling (AAC). Our findings revealed distinct patterns for bottom-up and top-down information processing among &lt;i&gt;cross&lt;/i&gt; -frequency interactions. Both top-down and bottom-up made prominent use of low frequencies: low-to-low frequency (&lt;i&gt;, α, β&lt;/i&gt;) and low frequency-to-&lt;i&gt;high &lt;/i&gt; couplings were predominant &lt;i&gt;top-down&lt;/i&gt;, while low frequency-to-&lt;i&gt;low &lt;/i&gt; couplings were predominant &lt;i&gt;bottom-up&lt;/i&gt;. These patterns were largely preserved across coupling types (PAC and AAC) and across stimulus types (natural and synthetic auditory stimuli), suggesting they are a general feature of information processing in auditory cortex. Our findings suggest the modulatory effect of low frequencies on &lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;-rhythms in distant regions is important for bi-directional information transfer. The finding of low frequency-to-&lt;i&gt;low &lt;/i&gt; interactions in the bottom-up direction suggest non-linearities may also play a role in feedforward message passing. Altogether, the patterns of cross-frequency interaction we observed across the auditory hierarchy are largely consistent with the predictive coding framework.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance&lt;/b&gt; The brain consists of highly interconnected cortical areas, yet the patterns in directional cortical communication are not fully understood, in particular with regards to interactions between different signal components across frequencies. We employed a novel, convenient and computationally advantageous Granger-causal framework to examine bi-directional cross-frequency interactions across four sectors of the auditory cortical hierarchy in macaques. Our findings reveal cross-frequency interactions are predominant in the top-down direction, with important implications for theories of information processing in the brain such as predictive coding. Our findings thereby extend the view of cross-frequency interactions in auditory cortex, suggesting they also play a prominent role in top-down processing.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>RSS PAP: Nonphosphorylatable Src Ser75 mutation increases ethanol preference and consumption in mice</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0418-18.2019v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Src is highly expressed in CNS neurons and contributes not only to developmental proliferation and differentiation but also to high-order brain functions, such as those contributing to alcohol consumption. Src knockout mice exhibit no CNS abnormalities, presumably due to compensation by other Src family kinases (SFKs), but have a shortened lifespan and osteopetrosis-associated defects, impeding investigations of the role of Src on behavior in adult mice. However, the Unique domain of Src differs from those in other SFKs and is phosphorylated by Cdk1 and Cdk5 at Ser75, which influences its postmitotic function in neurons. Therefore, ethanol consumption in mice harboring nonphosphorylatable (Ser75Ala) or phosphomimetic (Ser75Asp) Src mutants was investigated. Mice harboring the Ser75Ala Src mutant, but not the Ser75Asp mutant, had a higher preference for and consumption of solutions containing 5% and 10% ethanol than wild-type mice. However, plasma ethanol concentrations and sensitivities to the sedative effects of ethanol were not different among the groups. In mice harboring the Ser75Ala Src mutant, the activity of Rho-associated kinase in the striatum was significantly lower and Akt Ser473 phosphorylation was significantly higher than in wild-type mice. These results suggest that Src regulates voluntary ethanol drinking in a manner that depends on Ser75 phosphorylation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance statement&lt;/b&gt; Although Src family kinases (SFKs) contribute to behavioral responses to alcohol, only the role of Fyn has been investigated to date. As Src knockout mice do not exhibit CNS abnormalities, presumably because the knockout is compensated by other SFKs, but have shortened lifespans and osteopetrosis-associated defects, the influence of Src activity on ethanol preference and consumption was investigated in mice harboring nonphosphorylatable (Ser75Ala) or phosphomimetic (Ser75Asp) Src mutants. Mice harboring the Ser75Ala mutant, but not the Ser75Asp mutant, consumed more ethanol than wild-type counterparts and showed lower Rho-associated kinase activity but greater Akt phosphorylation in the striatum. These findings implicate Src activity in the regulation of ethanol consumption.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>RSS PAP: Predictive coding with neural transmission delays: a real-time temporal alignment hypothesis</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0412-18.2019v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;Hierarchical predictive coding is an influential model of cortical organization, in which sequential hierarchical levels are connected by backward connections carrying predictions, as well as forward connections carrying prediction errors. To date, however, predictive coding models have largely neglected to take into account that neural transmission itself takes time. For a time-varying stimulus, such as a moving object, this means that backward predictions become misaligned with new sensory input. We present an extended model implementing both forward and backward extrapolation mechanisms that realigns backward predictions to minimize prediction error. This realignment has the consequence that neural representations across all hierarchical levels become aligned in real-time. Using visual motion as an example, we show that the model is neurally plausible, that it is consistent with evidence of extrapolation mechanisms throughout the visual hierarchy, that it predicts several known motion-position illusions in human observers, and that it provides a solution to the temporal binding problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance Statement&lt;/b&gt; Despite the enormous scientific interest in predictive coding as model of cortical processing, most models of predictive coding do not take into account that neural processing itself takes time. We show that when the framework is extended to allow for neural delays, a model emerges that provides a natural, parsimonious explanation for a wide range of experimental findings. It is consistent with neurophysiological data from animals, predicts a range of well-known visual illusions in humans, and provides a principled solution to the temporal binding problem. Altogether, it explains how predictive coding mechanisms cause different brain areas to align in time despite their different delays, and in so doing explains how cortical hierarchies functions in real-time.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>RSS PAP: An ATF3-CreERT2 knock-in mouse for axotomy-induced genetic editing: proof of principle.</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0025-19.2019v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>ABSTRACT&lt;p&gt;Genome editing techniques have facilitated significant advances in our understanding of fundamental biological processes, and the Cre-Lox system has been instrumental in these achievements. Driving Cre expression specifically in injured neurons has not been previously possible: we sought to address this limitation in mice using a Cre-ERT2 construct driven by a reliable indicator of axotomy, Activating Transcription Factor 3 (ATF3). When crossed with reporter mice, a significant amount of recombination was achieved (without tamoxifen treatment) in peripherally-projecting sensory, sympathetic, and motoneurons after peripheral nerve crush in hemizygotes (65-80% by 16 days) and was absent in uninjured neurons. Importantly, injury-induced recombination did not occur in Schwann cells distal to the injury, and with a knockout-validated antibody we verified an absence of ATF3 expression. Functional recovery following sciatic nerve crush in ATF3-deficient mice (both hemi- and homozygotes) was delayed, indicating previously unreported haploinsufficiency. In a proof-of-principle experiment, we crossed the ATF3-CreERT2 line with a floxed PTEN line and show significantly improved axonal regeneration, as well as more complete recovery of neuromuscular function. We also demonstrate the utility of the ATF3-CreERT2 hemizygous line by characterizing recombination after lateral spinal hemisection (C8/T1), which identified specific populations of ascending spinal cord neurons (including putative spinothalamic and spinocerebellar) and descending supraspinal neurons (rubrospinal, vestibulospinal, reticulospinal and hypothalamic). We anticipate these mice will be valuable in distinguishing axotomized from uninjured neurons of several different classes (e.g. &lt;i&gt;via&lt;/i&gt; reporter expression), and in probing the function of any number of genes as they relate to neuronal injury and regeneration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Understanding reactions to neurotrauma and overcoming obstacles to neural regeneration should benefit from the ability to genetically label or otherwise edit the genome of injured neurons. We sought to achieve this in mice by driving Cre recombinase expression under the control of Activating Transcription Factor (ATF3), which is robustly induced by axotomy in several populations of peripheral and central neurons. When crossed with reporter mice, recombination occurred only in injured neurons following sciatic nerve injury or spinal hemisection. Peripheral nerve injury-induced neuronal PTEN excision also resulted in improved regeneration and more complete functional recovery. These results demonstrate the feasibility and utility of axotomy-induced recombination and represent a new tool for investigating genetic control of injury responses and regeneration.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Development of Local Circuit Connections to Hilar Mossy Cells in the Mouse Dentate Gyrus</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/6/2/ENEURO.0370-18.2019?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Hilar mossy cells in the dentate gyrus (DG) shape the firing and function of the hippocampal circuit. However, the neural circuitry providing afferent input to mossy cells is incompletely understood, and little is known about the development of these inputs. Thus, we used whole-cell recording and laser scanning photostimulation (LSPS) to characterize the developmental trajectory of local excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs to mossy cells in the mouse hippocampus. Hilar mossy cells were targeted by visualizing non-red fluorescent cells in the dentate hilus of GAD2-Cre; Ai9 mice that expressed tdTomato in GAD+ neurons, and were confirmed by post hoc morphological characterization. Our results show that at postnatal day (P)6–P7, mossy cells received more excitatory input from neurons in the proximal CA3 versus those in the DG. In contrast, at P13–P14 and P21–P28, the largest source of excitatory input originated in DG cells, while the strength of CA3 and hilar inputs declined. A developmental trend was also evident for inhibitory inputs. Overall inhibitory input at P6–P7 was weak, while inhibitory inputs from the DG cell layer and the hilus predominated at P13–P14 and P21–P28. The strength of local DG excitation and inhibition to mossy cells peaked at P13–P14 and decreased slightly in older P21–P28 mice. Together, these data provide new detailed information on the development of local synaptic connectivity of mossy cells, and suggests mechanisms through which developmental changes in local circuit inputs to hilar mossy cells shape their physiology and vulnerability to injury during postnatal periods.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: Divergent patterns of TDP‐43 and tau pathologies in primary progressive aphasia</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25465?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To measure postmortem burden of frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) with TDP‐43 (FTLD‐TDP) or tau (FTLD‐Tau) proteinopathy across hemispheres in primary progressive aphasia (PPA) using digital histopathology and to identify clinicopathological correlates of these distinct proteinopathies.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an autopsy cohort of PPA (FTLD‐TDP = 13, FTLD‐Tau = 14), we analyzed laterality and regional distribution of postmortem pathology, quantified using a validated digital histopathological approach, in available brain tissue from up to 8 cortical regions bilaterally. We related digital pathology to antemortem structural neuroimaging and specific clinical language features.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Postmortem cortical pathology was left‐lateralized in both FTLD‐TDP (beta = −0.15, standard error [SE] = 0.05, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.007) and FTLD‐Tau (beta = −0.09, SE = 0.04, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.015), but the degree of lateralization decreased with greater overall dementia severity before death (beta = −8.18, SE = 3.22, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.015). Among 5 core pathology regions sampled, we found greatest pathology in left orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) in FTLD‐TDP, which was greater than in FTLD‐Tau (&lt;i&gt;F&lt;/i&gt; = 47.07, &lt;i&gt;df&lt;/i&gt; = 1,17, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001), and in left midfrontal cortex (MFC) in FTLD‐Tau, which was greater than in FTLD‐TDP (&lt;i&gt;F&lt;/i&gt; = 19.34, &lt;i&gt;df&lt;/i&gt; = 1,16, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001). Postmortem pathology was inversely associated with antemortem magnetic resonance imaging cortical thickness (beta = −0.04, SE = 0.01, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.007) in regions matching autopsy sampling. Irrespective of PPA syndromic variant, single‐word comprehension impairment was associated with greater left OFC pathology (&lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt; = −3.72, &lt;i&gt;df&lt;/i&gt; = 10.72, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.004) and nonfluent speech with greater left MFC pathology (&lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt; = −3.62, &lt;i&gt;df&lt;/i&gt; = 12.00, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.004) among the 5 core pathology regions.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In PPA, FTLD‐TDP and FTLD‐Tau have divergent anatomic distributions of left‐lateralized postmortem pathology that relate to antemortem structural imaging and distinct language deficits. Although other brain regions may be implicated in neural networks supporting these complex language measures, our observations may eventually help to improve antemortem diagnosis of neuropathology in PPA.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Machine learning approaches in Detecting the Depression from Resting-state Electroencephalogram (EEG): A Review Study. (arXiv:1903.11454v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1903.11454</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In this paper, we aimed at reviewing several different approaches present
today in the search for more accurate diagnostic and treatment management in
mental healthcare. Our focus is on mood disorders, and in particular on the
major depressive disorder (MDD). We are reviewing and discussing findings based
on neuroimaging studies (MRI and fMRI) first to get the impression of the body
of knowledge about the anatomical and functional differences in depression.
Then, we are focusing on less expensive data-driven approach, applicable for
everyday clinical practice, in particular, those based on
electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings. Among those studies utilizing EEG, we
are discussing a group of applications used for detecting of depression based
on the resting state EEG (detection studies) and interventional studies (using
stimulus in their protocols or aiming to predict the outcome of therapy). We
conclude with a discussion and review of guidelines to improve the reliability
of developed models that could serve improvement of diagnostic of depression in
psychiatry.

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/44903</link>
	<content:encoded>Interplay between dopaminergic and cholinergic neuromodulation in the striatum is crucial for movement control, with prominent models proposing pro-kinetic and anti-kinetic effects of dopamine and acetylcholine release, respectively. However, the natural, movement-related signals of striatum cholinergic neurons and their relationship to simultaneous variations in dopamine signaling are unknown. Here, functional optical recordings in mice were used to establish rapid cholinergic signals in dorsal striatum during spontaneous movements. Bursts across the cholinergic population occurred at transitions between movement states and were marked by widespread network synchronization which diminished during sustained locomotion. Simultaneous cholinergic and dopaminergic recordings revealed distinct but coordinated sub-second signals, suggesting a new model where cholinergic population synchrony signals rapid changes in movement states while dopamine signals the drive to enact or sustain those states.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: latest articles: Patronin governs minus-end-out orientation of dendritic microtubules to promote dendrite pruning in Drosophila</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/39964</link>
	<content:encoded>Class IV ddaC neurons specifically prune larval dendrites without affecting axons during &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; metamorphosis. ddaCs distribute the minus ends of microtubules (MTs) to dendrites but the plus ends to axons. However, a requirement of MT minus-end-binding proteins in dendrite-specific pruning remains completely unknown. Here, we identified Patronin, a minus-end-binding protein, for its crucial and dose-sensitive role in ddaC dendrite pruning. The CKK domain is important for Patronin’s function in dendrite pruning. Moreover, we show that both &lt;i&gt;patronin&lt;/i&gt; knockdown and overexpression resulted in a drastic decrease of MT minus ends and a concomitant increase of plus-end-out MTs in ddaC dendrites, suggesting that Patronin stabilizes dendritic minus-end-out MTs. Consistently, attenuation of Klp10A MT depolymerase in &lt;i&gt;patronin&lt;/i&gt; mutant neurons significantly restored minus-end-out MTs in dendrites and thereby rescued dendrite-pruning defects. Thus, our study demonstrates that Patronin orients minus-end-out MT arrays in dendrites to promote dendrite-specific pruning mainly through antagonizing Klp10A activity.</content:encoded>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Neural Correlates of Enhanced Memory for Meaningful Associations with Age</title>

	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Evidence suggests that age differences in associative memory are attenuated for associations that are consistent with prior knowledge. Such knowledge structures have traditionally been associated with the default network (DN), which also shows reduced modulation with age. In the present study, we investigated whether DN activity and connectivity patterns could account for this age-related effect. Younger and older adults underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging as they learned realistic and unrealistic prices of common grocery items. Both groups showed greater activity in the DN during the encoding of realistic, relative to unrealistic, prices. Moreover, DN activity at encoding and retrieval and its connectivity with an attention control network at encoding were associated with enhanced memory for realistic prices. Finally, older adults showed overactivation of control regions during retrieval of realistic prices relative to younger adults. Our findings suggest that DN activity and connectivity patterns (traditionally viewed as indicators of cognitive failure with age), and additional recruitment of control regions, might underlie older adults’ enhanced memory for meaningful associations.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

Emerging evidence has shown microRNAs (miRNAs) play an important role in human disease research. Identifying potential association among them is significant for the development of pathology, diagnose and therapy. However, only a tiny portion of all miRNA-disease pairs in the current datasets are experimentally validated. This prompts the development of high-precision computational methods to predict real interaction pairs. In this paper, we propose a new model of Logistic Model Tree for predicting miRNA-Disease Association (LMTRDA) by fusing multi-source information including miRNA sequences, miRNA functional similarity, disease semantic similarity, and known miRNA-disease associations. In particular, we introduce miRNA sequence information and extract its features using natural language processing technique for the first time in the miRNA-disease prediction model. In the cross-validation experiment, LMTRDA obtained 90.51% prediction accuracy with 92.55% sensitivity at the AUC of 90.54% on the HMDD V3.0 dataset. To further evaluate the performance of LMTRDA, we compared it with different classifier and feature descriptor models. In addition, we also validate the predictive ability of LMTRDA in human diseases including Breast Neoplasms, Breast Neoplasms and Lymphoma. As a result, 28, 27 and 26 out of the top 30 miRNAs associated with these diseases were verified by experiments in different kinds of case studies. These experimental results demonstrate that LMTRDA is a reliable model for predicting the association among miRNAs and diseases.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/uk6W5kII4WE&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Combining structural proteomics experimental data with computational methods is a powerful tool for protein structure prediction. Here, we apply a recently-developed approach for &lt;i&gt;de novo&lt;/i&gt; protein structure determination based on the incorporation of short-distance crosslinking data as constraints in discrete molecular dynamics simulations (CL-DMD) for the determination of conformational ensemble of the intrinsically disordered protein α-synuclein in the solution. The predicted structures were in agreement with hydrogen-deuterium exchange, circular dichroism, surface modification, and long-distance crosslinking data. We found that α-synuclein is present in solution as an ensemble of rather compact globular conformations with distinct topology and inter-residue contacts, which is well-represented by movements of the large loops and formation of few transient secondary structure elements. Non-amyloid component and C-terminal regions were consistently found to contain β-structure elements and hairpins.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/jeUZw_xosck&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

Artificial Intelligence is exponentially increasing its impact on healthcare. As deep learning is mastering computer vision tasks, its application to digital pathology is natural, with the promise of aiding in routine reporting and standardizing results across trials. Deep learning features inferred from digital pathology scans can improve validity and robustness of current clinico-pathological features, up to identifying novel histological patterns, &lt;i&gt;e.g&lt;/i&gt;., from tumor infiltrating lymphocytes. In this study, we examine the issue of evaluating accuracy of predictive models from deep learning features in digital pathology, as an hallmark of reproducibility. We introduce the DAPPER framework for validation based on a rigorous Data Analysis Plan derived from the FDA’s MAQC project, designed to analyze causes of variability in predictive biomarkers. We apply the framework on models that identify tissue of origin on 787 Whole Slide Images from the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project. We test three different deep learning architectures (VGG, ResNet, Inception) as feature extractors and three classifiers (a fully connected multilayer, Support Vector Machine and Random Forests) and work with four datasets (5, 10, 20 or 30 classes), for a total of 53, 000 tiles at 512 × 512 resolution. We analyze accuracy and feature stability of the machine learning classifiers, also demonstrating the need for diagnostic tests (&lt;i&gt;e.g&lt;/i&gt;., random labels) to identify selection bias and risks for reproducibility. Further, we use the deep features from the VGG model from GTEx on the KIMIA24 dataset for identification of slide of origin (24 classes) to train a classifier on 1, 060 annotated tiles and validated on 265 unseen ones. The DAPPER software, including its deep learning pipeline and the Histological Imaging—Newsy Tiles (HINT) benchmark dataset derived from GTEx, is released as a basis for standardization and validation initiatives in AI for digital pathology.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/cFNBmsecX-4&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>RSS PAP: Restrained Dendritic Growth of Adult-born Granule Cells Innervated by Transplanted Fetal GABAergic Interneurons in Mice with Temporal Lobe Epilepsy</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/ENEURO.0110-18.2019v1?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract&lt;p&gt;The dentate gyrus (DG) is a region of the adult rodent brain that undergoes continuous neurogenesis. Seizures and loss or dysfunction of GABAergic synapses onto adult-born dentate granule cells (GCs) alter their dendritic growth and migration, resulting in dysmorphic and hyperexcitable GCs. Additionally, transplants of fetal GABAergic interneurons in the DG of mice with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) result in seizure suppression, but it is unknown whether increasing interneurons with these transplants restores GABAergic innervation to adult-born GCs. Here we address this question by retroviral birth-dating GCs at different times up to 12 weeks after pilocarpine-induced TLE in adult mice. ChR2-EYFP-expressing MGE-derived GABAergic interneurons from E13.5 mouse embryos were transplanted into the DG of the TLE mice and GCs with transplant-derived inhibitory post-synaptic currents were identified by patch-clamp electrophysiology and optogenetic interrogation. Putative synaptic sites between GCs and GABAergic transplants were also confirmed by intracellular biocytin staining, immunohistochemistry, and confocal imaging. 3D reconstructions of dendritic arbors and quantitative morphometric analyses were carried out in &amp;gt;150 adult-born GCs. GABAergic inputs from transplanted interneurons correlated with markedly shorter GC dendrites, compared to GCs that were not innervated by the transplants. Moreover, these effects were confined to distal dendritic branches and a short time window of 6-8 weeks. The effects were independent of seizures as they were also observed in naïve mice with MGE transplants. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that increased inhibitory currents over a smaller dendritic arbor in adult-born GCs may reduce their excitability and lead to seizure suppression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Significance statement&lt;/b&gt; Transplants of medial-ganglionic eminence (MGE) GABAergic progenitors into the hippocampus of adult mice with pilocarpine-induced TLE have been shown to increase inhibitory synaptic currents in granule cells (GCs) in the dentate gyrus (DG) and suppress seizures. Here we investigated whether the increased transplant-derived inhibition resulted in structural changes to the dendritic arbors of adult-born GCs that might be responsible for reduced excitability. Our results show that transplant-innervated adult-born GCs form significantly shorter dendrites compared to non-innervated GCs. These changes were restricted to distal dendrites in GCs generated within two-months after transplantation. These findings suggest a structural mechanism for seizure suppression whereby increased GABAergic innervation from transplanted MGE progenitors may restrict the growth of dendritic arbors in adult-born hippocampal granule cells.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Genome-Wide Association Studies of Impulsive Personality Traits (BIS-11 and UPPS-P) and Drug Experimentation in up to 22,861 Adult Research Participants Identify Loci in the CACNA1I and CADM2 genes</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/13/2562?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Impulsive personality traits are complex heritable traits that are governed by frontal-subcortical circuits and are associated with numerous neuropsychiatric disorders, particularly drug abuse and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). In collaboration with the genetics company 23andMe, we performed 10 genome-wide association studies on measures of impulsive personality traits [the short version of the UPPS-P Impulsive Behavior Scale, and the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale (BIS-11)] and drug experimentation (the number of drug classes an individual had tried in their lifetime) in up to 22,861 male and female adult human research participants of European ancestry. Impulsive personality traits and drug experimentation showed single nucleotide polymorphism heritabilities that ranged from 5 to 11%. Genetic variants in the &lt;i&gt;CADM2&lt;/i&gt; locus were significantly associated with UPPS-P Sensation Seeking (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 8.3 &lt;font face=&quot;arial,helvetica&quot;&gt;x&lt;/font&gt; 10&lt;sup&gt;–9&lt;/sup&gt;, rs139528938) and showed a suggestive association with Drug Experimentation (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 3.0 &lt;font face=&quot;arial,helvetica&quot;&gt;x&lt;/font&gt; 10&lt;sup&gt;–7&lt;/sup&gt;, rs2163971; &lt;i&gt;r&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.68 with rs139528938). Furthermore, genetic variants in the &lt;i&gt;CACNA1I&lt;/i&gt; locus were significantly associated with UPPS-P Negative Urgency (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 3.8 &lt;font face=&quot;arial,helvetica&quot;&gt;x&lt;/font&gt; 10&lt;sup&gt;–8&lt;/sup&gt;; rs199694726). The role of these genes was supported by single variant, gene- and transcriptome-based analyses. Multiple subscales from both UPPS-P and BIS showed strong genetic correlations (&amp;gt;0.5) with Drug Experimentation and other substance use traits measured in independent cohorts, including smoking initiation, and lifetime cannabis use. Several UPPS-P and BIS subscales were genetically correlated with ADHD (&lt;i&gt;r&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.30–0.51), supporting their validity as endophenotypes. Our findings demonstrate a role for common genetic contributions to individual differences in impulsivity. Furthermore, our study is the first to provide a genetic dissection of the relationship between different types of impulsive personality traits and various psychiatric disorders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Impulsive personality traits (IPTs) are heritable traits that are governed by frontal-subcortical circuits and are associated with neuropsychiatric disorders, particularly substance use disorders. We have performed genome-wide association studies of IPTs to identify regions and genes that account for this heritable variation. IPTs and drug experimentation were modestly heritable (5–11%). We identified an association between single nucleotide polymorphisms in &lt;i&gt;CADM2&lt;/i&gt; and both sensation seeking and drug experimentation; and between variants in &lt;i&gt;CACNA1I&lt;/i&gt; and negative urgency. The role of these genes was supported by single variant, gene- and transcriptome-based analyses. This study provides evidence that impulsivity can be genetically separated into distinct components. We showed that IPT are genetically associated with substance use and ADHD, suggesting impulsivity is an endophenotype contributing to these psychiatric conditions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: P2X7 Receptors Drive Poly(I:C) Induced Autism-like Behavior in Mice</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/13/2542?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Maternal immune activation (MIA) is a principal environmental risk factor contributing to autism spectrum disorder (ASD), which compromises fetal brain development at critical periods of pregnancy and might be causally linked to ASD symptoms. We report that endogenous activation of the purinergic ion channel P2X7 (P2rx7) is necessary and sufficient to transduce MIA to autistic phenotype in male offspring. MIA induced by poly(I:C) injections to P2rx7 WT mouse dams elicited an autism-like phenotype in their offspring, and these alterations were not observed in P2rx7-deficient mice, or following maternal treatment with a specific P2rx7 antagonist, JNJ47965567. Genetic deletion and pharmacological inhibition of maternal P2rx7s also counteracted the induction of IL-6 in the maternal plasma and fetal brain, and disrupted brain development, whereas postnatal P2rx7 inhibition alleviated behavioral and morphological alterations in the offspring. Administration of ATP to P2rx7 WT dams also evoked autistic phenotype, but not in KO dams, implying that P2rx7 activation by ATP is sufficient to induce autism-like features in offspring. Our results point to maternal and offspring P2rx7s as potential therapeutic targets for the early prevention and treatment of ASD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental psychiatric disorder caused by genetic and environmental factors. Recent studies highlighted the importance of perinatal risks, in particular, maternal immune activation (MIA), showing strong association with the later emergence of ASD in the affected children. MIA could be mimicked in animal models via injection of a nonpathogenic agent poly(I:C) during pregnancy. This is the first report showing the key role of a ligand gated ion channel, the purinergic P2X7 receptor in MIA-induced autism-like behavioral and biochemical features. We show that genetic or pharmacological inhibition of both maternal and offspring P2X7 receptors could reverse the compromised brain development and autistic phenotype pointing to new possibilities for prevention and treatment of ASD.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Insensitivity of Place Cells to the Value of Spatial Goals in a Two-Choice Flexible Navigation Task</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/13/2522?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Hippocampal place cells show position-specific activity thought to reflect a self-localization signal. Several reports also point to some form of goal encoding by place cells. We investigated this by asking whether they also encode the value of spatial goals, which is crucial information for optimizing goal-directed navigation. We used a continuous place navigation task in which male rats navigate to one of two (freely chosen) unmarked locations and wait, triggering the release of reward, which is then located and consumed elsewhere. This allows sampling of place fields and dissociates spatial goal from reward consumption. The two goals varied in the amount of reward provided, allowing assessment of whether the rats factored goal value into their navigational choice and of possible neural correlates of this value. Rats successfully learned the task, indicating goal localization, and they preferred higher-value goals, indicating processing of goal value. Replicating previous findings, there was goal-related activity in the out-of-field firing of CA1 place cells, with a ramping-up of firing rate during the waiting period, but no general overrepresentation of goals by place fields, an observation that we extended to CA3 place cells. Importantly, place cells were not modulated by goal value. This suggests that dorsal hippocampal place cells encode space independently of its associated value despite the effect of that value on spatial behavior. Our findings are consistent with a model of place cells in which they provide a spontaneously constructed value-free spatial representation rather than encoding other navigationally relevant but nonspatial information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; We investigated whether hippocampal place cells, which compute a self-localization signal, also encode the relative value of places, which is essential information for optimal navigation. When choosing between two spatial goals of different value, rats preferred the higher-value goal. We saw out-of-field goal firing in place cells, replicating previous observations that the cells are influenced by the goal, but their activity was not modulated by the value of these goals. Our results suggest that place cells do not encode all of the navigationally relevant aspects of a place, but instead form a value-free &quot;map&quot; that links to such aspects in other parts of the brain.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: An Essential Role of the Intraparietal Sulcus in Response Inhibition Predicted by Parcellation-Based Network</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/13/2509?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The posterior parietal cortex (PPC) features close anatomical and functional relationships with the prefrontal cortex. However, the necessity of the PPC in executive functions has been questioned. The present study used the stop-signal task to examine response inhibition, an executive function that inhibits prepotent response tendency. The brain activity and resting-state functional connectivity were measured to analyze a parcellation-based network that was aimed at identifying a candidate PPC region essential for response inhibition in humans. The intraparietal sulcus (IPS) was activated during response inhibition and connected with the inferior frontal cortex and the presupplementary motor area, the two frontal regions known to be necessary for response inhibition. Next, transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) was used to test the essential role of the IPS region for response inhibition. TMS over the IPS region prolonged the stop-signal reaction time (SSRT), the standard behavioral index used to evaluate stopping performance, when stimulation was applied 30–0 ms before stopping. On the contrary, stimulation over the temporoparietal junction region, an area activated during response inhibition but lacking connectivity with the two frontal regions, did not show changes in SSRT. These results indicate that the IPS identified using the parcellation-based network plays an essential role in executive functions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Based on the previous neuropsychological studies reporting no impairment in executive functions after lesions in the posterior parietal cortex (PPC), the necessity of PPC in executive functions has been questioned. Here, contrary to the long-lasting view, by using recently developed analysis in functional MRI (&quot;parcellation-based network analysis&quot;), we identified the intraparietal sulcus (IPS) region in the PPC as essential for response inhibition: one executive function to stop actions that are inaccurate in a given context. The necessity of IPS for response inhibition was further tested by an interventional technique of transcranial magnetic stimulation. Stimulation to the IPS disrupted the performance of stopping. Our findings suggest that the IPS plays essential roles in executive functions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Cognitive Control of Saccadic Selection and Inhibition from within the Core Cortical Saccadic Network</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/13/2497?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The ability to select the task-relevant stimulus for a saccadic eye movement, while inhibiting saccades to task-irrelevant stimuli, is crucial for active vision. Here, we present a novel saccade-contingent behavioral paradigm and investigate the neural basis of the central cognitive functions underpinning such behavior, saccade selection, saccade inhibition, and saccadic choice, in female and male human participants. The paradigm allows for exceptionally well-matched contrasts, with task demands formalized with stochastic accumulation-to-threshold models. Using fMRI, we replicated the core cortical eye-movement network for saccade generation (frontal eye fields, posterior parietal cortex, and higher-level visual areas). However, in contrast to previously published tasks, saccadic selection and inhibition recruited only this core network. Brain–behavior analyses further showed that inhibition efficiency may be underpinned by white-matter integrity of tracts between key saccade-generating regions, and that inhibition efficiency is associated with right inferior frontal gyrus engagement, potentially implementing general-purpose inhibition. The core network, however, was insufficient for saccadic choice, which recruited anterior regions commonly attributed to saccadic action selection, including dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and anterior cingulate cortex. Jointly, the results indicate that extra-saccadic activity observed for free choice, and in previously published tasks probing saccadic control, is likely due to increased load on higher-level cognitive processes, and not saccadic selection per se, which is achieved within the canonical cortical eye movement network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The ability to selectively attend to, and to not attend to, parts of the world is crucial for successful action. Mapping the neural substrate of the key cognitive functions underlying such behavior, saccade selection and inhibition, is a challenge. Canonical tasks, often preceding the cognitive neuroscience revolution by decennia, were not designed to isolate single cognitive functions, and result in extremely widespread brain activity. We developed a novel behavioral paradigm, which demonstrates the following: (1) the cognitive control of saccades is achieved within key cortical saccadic brain regions; (2) individual variability in control efficiency is related to white-matter connectivity between the same regions; and (3) widespread activity in canonical tasks is likely related to higher-level cognitive demands and not saccadic control.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Nucleus Accumbens Drd1-Expressing Neurons Control Aggression Self-Administration and Aggression Seeking in Mice</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/13/2482?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;We recently developed a mouse model of appetitive operant aggression and reported that adult male outbred CD-1 mice lever-press for the opportunity to attack subordinate male mice and relapse to aggression seeking during abstinence. Here we studied the role of nucleus accumbens (NAc) dopamine receptor (Drd)1- and Drd2-expressing neurons in aggression self-administration and aggression seeking. We trained CD-1 mice to self-administer intruders (9 d, 12 trials/d) and tested them for aggression self-administration and aggression seeking on abstinence Day 1. We used immunohistochemistry and &lt;i&gt;in situ&lt;/i&gt; hybridization to measure the neuronal activity marker Fos in the NAc, and cell-type-specific colocalization of Fos with Drd1- and Drd2-expressing neurons. To test the causal role of Drd1- and Drd2-expressing neurons, we validated a transgenic hybrid breeding strategy crossing inbred Drd1-Cre and Drd2-Cre transgenic mice with outbred CD-1 mice and used cell-type-specific Cre-DREADD (hM4Di) to inhibit NAc Drd1- and Drd2-expressing neuron activity. We found that aggression self-administration and aggression seeking induced higher Fos expression in NAc shell than in core, that &lt;i&gt;Fos&lt;/i&gt; colocalized with &lt;i&gt;Drd1&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Drd2&lt;/i&gt; in both subregions, and that chemogenetic inhibition of Drd1-, but not Drd2-, expressing neurons decreased aggression self-administration and aggression seeking. Results indicate a cell-type-specific role of Drd1-expressing neurons that is critical for both aggression self-administration and aggression seeking. Our study also validates a simple breeding strategy between outbred CD-1 mice and inbred C57-based Cre lines that can be used to study cell-type and circuit mechanisms of aggression reward and relapse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Aggression is often comorbid with neuropsychiatric diseases, including drug addiction. One form, appetitive aggression, exhibits symptomatology that mimics that of drug addiction and is hypothesized to be due to dysregulation of addiction-related reward circuits. However, our mechanistic understanding of the circuitry modulating appetitive operant aggression is limited. Here we used a novel mouse model of aggression self-administration and relapse, in combination with immunohistochemistry, &lt;i&gt;in situ&lt;/i&gt; hybridization, and chemogenetic manipulations to examine how cell types in the nucleus accumbens are recruited for, and control, operant aggression self-administration and aggression seeking on abstinence Day 1. We found that one population, dopamine receptor 1-expressing neurons, act as a critical modulator of operant aggression reward and aggression seeking.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Connectivity and Dynamics Underlying Synaptic Control of the Subthalamic Nucleus</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/13/2470?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Adaptive motor control critically depends on the interconnected nuclei of the basal ganglia in the CNS. A pivotal element of the basal ganglia is the subthalamic nucleus (STN), which serves as a therapeutic target for deep brain stimulation (DBS) in movement disorders, such as Parkinson's disease. The functional connectivity of the STN at the microcircuit level, however, still requires rigorous investigation. Here we combine multiple simultaneous whole-cell recordings with extracellular stimulation and &lt;i&gt;post hoc&lt;/i&gt; neuroanatomical analysis to investigate intrinsic and afferent connectivity and synaptic properties of the STN in acute brain slices obtained from rats of both sexes. Our data reveal an absence of intrinsic connectivity and an afferent innervation with low divergence, suggesting that STN neurons operate as independent processing elements driven by upstream structures. Hence, synchrony in the STN, a hallmark of motor processing, exclusively depends on the interactions and dynamics of GABAergic and glutamatergic afferents. Importantly, these inputs are subject to differential short-term depression when stimulated at high, DBS-like frequencies, shifting the balance of excitation and inhibition toward inhibition. Thus, we present a mechanism for fast yet transient decoupling of the STN from synchronizing afferent control. Together, our study provides new insights into the microcircuit organization of the STN by identifying its neurons as parallel processing units and thus sets new constraints for future computational models of the basal ganglia. The observed differential short-term plasticity of afferent inputs further offers a basis to better understand and optimize DBS algorithms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The subthalamic nucleus (STN) is a pivotal element of the basal ganglia and serves as target for deep brain stimulation, but information on the functional connectivity of its neurons is limited. To investigate the STN microcircuitry, we combined multiple simultaneous patch-clamp recordings and neuroanatomical analysis. Our results provide new insights into the synaptic organization of the STN identifying its neurons as parallel processing units and thus set new constraints for future computational models of the basal ganglia. We further find that synaptic dynamics of afferent inputs result in a rapid yet transient decoupling of the STN when stimulated at high frequencies. These results offer a better understanding of deep brain stimulation mechanisms, promoting the development of optimized algorithms.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Ethanol Experience Enhances Glutamatergic Ventral Hippocampal Inputs to D1 Receptor-Expressing Medium Spiny Neurons in the Nucleus Accumbens Shell</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/13/2459?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A growing number of studies implicate alterations in glutamatergic signaling within the reward circuitry of the brain during alcohol abuse and dependence. A key integrator of glutamatergic signaling in the reward circuit is the nucleus accumbens, more specifically, the dopamine D1 receptor-expressing medium spiny neurons (D1-MSNs) within this region, which have been implicated in the formation of dependence to many drugs of abuse including alcohol. D1-MSNs receive glutamatergic input from several brain regions; however, it is not currently known how individual inputs onto D1-MSNs are altered by alcohol experience. Here, we investigate input-specific adaptations in glutamatergic transmission in response to varying levels of alcohol experience. Virally mediated expression of Channelrhodopsin in ventral hippocampal (vHipp) glutamate neurons of male mice allowed for selective activation of vHipp to D1-MSN synapses. Therefore, we were able to compare synaptic adaptations in response to low and high alcohol experience &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;. Alcohol experience enhanced glutamatergic activity and abolished LTD at vHipp to D1-MSN synapses. Following chronic alcohol experience, GluA2-lacking AMPARs, which are Ca permeable, were inserted into vHipp to D1-MSN synapses. These findings support the reversal of alcohol-induced insertion of Ca-permeable AMPARs and the enhancement of glutamatergic activity at vHipp to D1-MSNs as potential targets for intervention during early exposure to alcohol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Given the roles of the nucleus accumbens (NAc) in integrating cortical and allocortical information and in reward learning, it is vital to understand how inputs to this region are altered by drugs of abuse such as alcohol. The strength of excitatory inputs from the ventral hippocampus (vHipp) to the NAc has been positively associated with reward-related behaviors, but it is unclear whether or how ethanol affects these inputs. Here we show that vHipp–NAc synapses indeed are altered by ethanol exposure, with vHipp glutamatergic input to the NAc being enhanced following chronic ethanol experience. This work provides insight into ethanol-induced alterations of vHipp–NAc synapses and suggests that, similarly to drugs such as cocaine, the strengthening of these synapses promotes reward behavior.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Conditional BDNF Delivery from Astrocytes Rescues Memory Deficits, Spine Density, and Synaptic Properties in the 5xFAD Mouse Model of Alzheimer Disease</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/13/2441?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;It has been well documented that neurotrophins, including brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), are severely affected in Alzheimer's disease (AD), but their administration faces a myriad of technical challenges. Here we took advantage of the early astrogliosis observed in an amyloid mouse model of AD (5xFAD) and used it as an internal sensor to administer BDNF conditionally and locally. We first demonstrate the relevance of BDNF release from astrocytes by evaluating the effects of coculturing WT neurons and BDNF-deficient astrocytes. Next, we crossed 5xFAD mice with pGFAP:BDNF mice (only males were used) to create 5xFAD mice that overexpress BDNF when and where astrogliosis is initiated (5xF:pGB mice). We evaluated the behavioral phenotype of these mice. We first found that BDNF from astrocytes is crucial for dendrite outgrowth and spine number in cultured WT neurons. Double-mutant 5xF:pGB mice displayed improvements in cognitive tasks compared with 5xFAD littermates. In these mice, there was a rescue of BDNF/TrkB downstream signaling activity associated with an improvement of dendritic spine density and morphology. Clusters of synaptic markers, PSD-95 and synaptophysin, were also recovered in 5xF:pGB compared with 5xFAD mice as well as the number of presynaptic vesicles at excitatory synapses. Additionally, experimentally evoked LTP &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; was increased in 5xF:pGB mice. The beneficial effects of conditional BDNF production and local delivery at the location of active neuropathology highlight the potential to use endogenous biomarkers with early onset, such as astrogliosis, as regulators of neurotrophic therapy in AD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Recent evidence places astrocytes as pivotal players during synaptic plasticity and memory processes. In the present work, we first provide evidence that astrocytes are essential for neuronal morphology via BDNF release. We then crossed transgenic mice (5xFAD mice) with the transgenic pGFAP-BDNF mice, which express BDNF under the GFAP promoter. The resultant double-mutant mice 5xF:pGB mice displayed a full rescue of hippocampal BDNF loss and related signaling compared with 5xFAD mice and a significant and specific improvement in all the evaluated cognitive tasks. These improvements did not correlate with amelioration of β amyloid load or hippocampal adult neurogenesis rate but were accompanied by a dramatic recovery of structural and functional synaptic plasticity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Deep Brain Stimulation Rescues Memory and Synaptic Activity in a Rat Model of Global Ischemia</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/13/2430?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Ischemic stroke is responsible for a large number of neurological deficits including memory impairment. Deep brain stimulation (DBS), a well established therapeutic modality for the treatment of movement disorders, has recently shown potential beneficial effects on memory in animals and patients with Alzheimer's disease. Here, we test DBS for its ability to improve memory impairments by stimulating the entorhinal cortex (EC) in a rat model of global ischemia (GI). Two weeks after GI, adult male rats received high-frequency EC DBS for 1 h, and animals were assessed for changes in locomotor activity, learning, and memory 6 weeks later. GI produced spatial memory impairment that was ameliorated by DBS, with no difference between the group that received DBS for GI (GI-DBS ON group) and nonstroke control groups. Although GI led to a dramatic CA1 neuronal loss that could not be rescued with DBS, stimulation attenuated the reduction of CA1 synaptophysin expression after GI. Further, &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; slice recordings showed a restoration of typical evoked synaptic dendritic fields in GI-DBS ON animals, indicating that the DBS-induced memory rescue is associated with increased synaptophysin expression and enhanced synaptic function. These results suggest that DBS may ameliorate the functional consequences of cerebral ischemia and point to be a potential new therapeutic approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is remarkably effective in treating Parkinson's disease and is currently under investigation for the treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders including Alzheimer's disease. Until now, DBS has not been examined for its cognitive benefits in the context of hypoxic-ischemic injuries. Here, we investigated the effect of DBS in a rat model of global ischemia (GI) that mimics the neurological consequences occurring after a cardiac arrest. We show that DBS rescues memory deficits induced by GI and produces changes in synaptic activity in the hippocampus. Novel approaches to improve neurological outcomes after stroke are urgently needed; therefore, the present study highlights a possible role for DBS in the treatment of cognitive impairment associated with ischemia.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Endogenous Tagging Reveals Differential Regulation of Ca2+ Channels at Single Active Zones during Presynaptic Homeostatic Potentiation and Depression</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/13/2416?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Neurons communicate through Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-dependent neurotransmitter release at presynaptic active zones (AZs). Neurotransmitter release properties play a key role in defining information flow in circuits and are tuned during multiple forms of plasticity. Despite their central role in determining neurotransmitter release properties, little is known about how Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; channel levels are modulated to calibrate synaptic function. We used CRISPR to tag the &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; Ca&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;2 Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; channel Cacophony (Cac) and, in males in which all Cac channels are tagged, investigated the regulation of endogenous Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; channels during homeostatic plasticity. We found that heterogeneously distributed Cac is highly predictive of neurotransmitter release probability at individual AZs and differentially regulated during opposing forms of presynaptic homeostatic plasticity. Specifically, AZ Cac levels are increased during chronic and acute presynaptic homeostatic potentiation (PHP), and live imaging during acute expression of PHP reveals proportional Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; channel accumulation across heterogeneous AZs. In contrast, endogenous Cac levels do not change during presynaptic homeostatic depression (PHD), implying that the reported reduction in Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; influx during PHD is achieved through functional adaptions to pre-existing Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; channels. Thus, distinct mechanisms bidirectionally modulate presynaptic Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; levels to maintain stable synaptic strength in response to diverse challenges, with Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; channel abundance providing a rapidly tunable substrate for potentiating neurotransmitter release over both acute and chronic timescales.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Presynaptic Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; dynamics play an important role in establishing neurotransmitter release properties. Presynaptic Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; influx is modulated during multiple forms of homeostatic plasticity at &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; neuromuscular junctions to stabilize synaptic communication. However, it remains unclear how this dynamic regulation is achieved. We used CRISPR gene editing to endogenously tag the sole &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; channel responsible for synchronized neurotransmitter release, and found that channel abundance is regulated during homeostatic potentiation, but not homeostatic depression. Through live imaging experiments during the adaptation to acute homeostatic challenge, we visualize the accumulation of endogenous Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; channels at individual active zones within 10 min. We propose that differential regulation of Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; channels confers broad capacity for tuning neurotransmitter release properties to maintain neural communication.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: The Ciliopathy Gene Ftm/Rpgrip1l Controls Mouse Forebrain Patterning via Region-Specific Modulation of Hedgehog/Gli Signaling</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/13/2398?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Primary cilia are essential for CNS development. In the mouse, they play a critical role in patterning the spinal cord and telencephalon via the regulation of Hedgehog/Gli signaling. However, despite the frequent disruption of this signaling pathway in human forebrain malformations, the role of primary cilia in forebrain morphogenesis has been little investigated outside the telencephalon. Here we studied development of the diencephalon, hypothalamus and eyes in mutant mice in which the &lt;i&gt;Ftm/Rpgrip1l&lt;/i&gt; ciliopathy gene is disrupted. At the end of gestation, &lt;i&gt;Ftm&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt; fetuses displayed anophthalmia, a reduction of the ventral hypothalamus and a disorganization of diencephalic nuclei and axonal tracts. In &lt;i&gt;Ftm&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt; embryos, we found that the ventral forebrain structures and the rostral thalamus were missing. Optic vesicles formed but lacked the optic cups. In &lt;i&gt;Ftm&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt; embryos, &lt;i&gt;Sonic hedgehog&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;Shh&lt;/i&gt;) expression was virtually lost in the ventral forebrain but maintained in the zona limitans intrathalamica (ZLI), the mid-diencephalic organizer. Gli activity was severely downregulated but not lost in the ventral forebrain and in regions adjacent to the &lt;i&gt;Shh&lt;/i&gt;-expressing ZLI. Reintroduction of the repressor form of Gli3 into the &lt;i&gt;Ftm&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;–/–&lt;/sup&gt; background restored optic cup formation. Our data thus uncover a complex role of cilia in development of the diencephalon, hypothalamus and eyes via the region-specific control of the ratio of activator and repressor forms of the Gli transcription factors. They call for a closer examination of forebrain defects in severe ciliopathies and for a search for ciliopathy genes as modifiers in other human conditions with forebrain defects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; The Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway is essential for proper forebrain development as illustrated by a human condition called holoprosencephaly. The Hh pathway relies on primary cilia, cellular organelles that receive and transduce extracellular signals and whose dysfunctions lead to rare inherited diseases called ciliopathies. To date, the role of cilia in the forebrain has been poorly studied outside the telencephalon. In this paper we study the role of the &lt;i&gt;Ftm/Rpgrip1l&lt;/i&gt; ciliopathy gene in mouse forebrain development. We uncover complex functions of primary cilia in forebrain morphogenesis through region-specific modulation of the Hh pathway. Our data call for further examination of forebrain defects in ciliopathies and for a search for ciliopathy genes as modifiers in human conditions affecting forebrain development.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Hyperexcitability and Hyperplasticity Disrupt Cerebellar Signal Transfer in the IB2 KO Mouse Model of Autism</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/13/2383?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are pervasive neurodevelopmental conditions that often involve mutations affecting synaptic mechanisms. Recently, the involvement of cerebellum in ASDs has been suggested, but the underlying functional alterations remained obscure. We investigated single-neuron and microcircuit properties in IB2 (Islet Brain-2) KO mice of either sex. The IB2 gene (chr22q13.3 terminal region) deletion occurs in virtually all cases of Phelan–McDermid syndrome, causing autistic symptoms and a severe delay in motor skill acquisition. IB2 KO granule cells showed a larger NMDA receptor-mediated current and enhanced intrinsic excitability, raising the excitatory/inhibitory balance. Furthermore, the spatial organization of granular layer responses to mossy fibers shifted from a &quot;Mexican hat&quot; to a &quot;stovepipe hat&quot; profile, with stronger excitation in the core and weaker inhibition in the surround. Finally, the size and extension of long-term synaptic plasticity were remarkably increased. These results show for the first time that hyperexcitability and hyperplasticity disrupt signal transfer in the granular layer of IB2 KO mice, supporting cerebellar involvement in the pathogenesis of ASD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; This article shows for the first time a complex set of alterations in the cerebellum granular layer of a mouse model [IB2 (Islet Brain-2) KO] of autism spectrum disorders. The IB2 KO in mice mimics the deletion of the corresponding gene in the Phelan–McDermid syndrome in humans. The changes reported here are centered on NMDA receptor hyperactivity, hyperplasticity, and hyperexcitability. These, in turn, increase the excitatory/inhibitory balance and alter the shape of center/surround structures that emerge in the granular layer in response to mossy fiber activity. These results support recent theories suggesting the involvement of cerebellum in autism spectrum disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Lactate Mediates the Effects of Exercise on Learning and Memory through SIRT1-Dependent Activation of Hippocampal Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF)</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/13/2369?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Exercise promotes learning and memory formation. These effects depend on increases in hippocampal BDNF, a growth factor associated with cognitive improvement and the alleviation of depression symptoms. Identifying molecules that are produced during exercise and that mediate hippocampal &lt;i&gt;Bdnf&lt;/i&gt; expression will allow us to harness the therapeutic potential of exercise. Here, we report that an endogenous molecule produced during exercise in male mice induces the &lt;i&gt;Mus musculus Bdnf&lt;/i&gt; gene and promotes learning and memory formation. The metabolite lactate, which is released during exercise by the muscles, crosses the blood–brain barrier and induces &lt;i&gt;Bdnf&lt;/i&gt; expression and TRKB signaling in the hippocampus. Indeed, we find that lactate-dependent increases in BDNF are associated with improved spatial learning and memory retention. The action of lactate is dependent on the activation of the Sirtuin1 deacetylase. SIRT1 increases the levels of the transcriptional coactivator PGC1a and the secreted molecule FNDC5, known to mediate &lt;i&gt;Bdnf&lt;/i&gt; expression. These results reveal an endogenous mechanism to explain how physical exercise leads to the induction of BDNF, and identify lactate as a potential endogenous molecule that may have therapeutic value for CNS diseases in which BDNF signaling is disrupted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; It is established that exercise promotes learning and memory formation and alleviates the symptoms of depression. These effects are mediated through inducing &lt;i&gt;Bdnf&lt;/i&gt; expression and signaling in the hippocampus. Understanding how exercise induces &lt;i&gt;Bdnf&lt;/i&gt; and identifying the molecules that mediate this induction will allow us to design therapeutic strategies that can mimic the effects of exercise on the brain, especially for patients with CNS disorders characterized by a decrease in &lt;i&gt;Bdnf&lt;/i&gt; expression and who cannot exercise because of their conditions. We identify lactate as an endogenous metabolite that is produced during exercise, crosses the blood–brain barrier and promotes hippocampal dependent learning and memory in a BDNF-dependent manner. Our work identifies lactate as a component of the &quot;exercise pill.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Selectively Inhibiting the Median Preoptic Nucleus Attenuates Angiotensin II and Hyperosmotic-Induced Drinking Behavior and Vasopressin Release in Adult Male Rats</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/6/2/ENEURO.0473-18.2019?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The median preoptic nucleus (MnPO) is a putative integrative region that contributes to body fluid balance. Activation of the MnPO can influence thirst, but it is not clear how these responses are linked to body fluid homeostasis. We used designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs (DREADDs) to determine the role of the MnPO in drinking behavior and vasopressin release in response to peripheral angiotensin II (ANG II) or 3% hypertonic saline (3% HTN) in adult male Sprague Dawley rats (250–300 g). Rats were anesthetized with isoflurane and stereotaxically injected with an inhibitory DREADD (rAAV5-CaMKIIa-hM4D(G&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;)-mCherry) or control (rAAV5-CaMKIIa-mCherry) virus in the MnPO. After two weeks’ recovery, a subset of rats was used for extracellular recordings to verify functional effects of ANG II or hyperosmotic challenges in MnPO slice preparations. Remaining rats were used in drinking behavior studies. Each rat was administered either 10 mg/kg of exogenous clozapine-N-oxide (CNO) to inhibit DREADD-expressing cells or vehicle intraperitoneal followed by a test treatment with either 2-mg/kg ANG II or 3% HTN (1 ml/100-g bw, s.c.), twice per week for two separate treatment weeks. CNO-induced inhibition during either test treatment significantly attenuated drinking responses compared to vehicle treatments and controls. Brain tissue processed for cFos immunohistochemistry showed decreased expression with CNO-induced inhibition during either test treatment in the MnPO and downstream nuclei compared to controls. CNO-mediated inhibition significantly attenuated treatment-induced increases in plasma vasopressin compared to controls. The results indicate inhibition of CaMKIIa-expressing MnPO neurons significantly reduces drinking and vasopressin release in response to ANG II or hyperosmotic challenge.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Phase Coherent Currents Underlying Neocortical Seizure-Like State Transitions</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/6/2/ENEURO.0426-18.2019?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;In the epileptic brain, phase amplitude cross-frequency coupling (CFC) features have been used to objectively classify seizure-related states, and the inter-seizure state has been demonstrated as being random, in contrast to the seizure state being predictable; however, the excitatory and inhibitory networks underlying their dynamics remain unclear. Therefore, the objectives of this study are to classify the dynamics of seizure sub-states labeling seizure-like event (SLE) onset and termination intervals using CFC features and to obtain their underlying excitatory/inhibitory cellular correlates. SLEs were induced in mouse neocortical brain slices using a low-magnesium perfusate, and were recorded in Layer II/III using simultaneous local field potential (LFP) and whole-cell voltage clamp electrodes. Classification of onset and termination of SLE transitions was investigated using CFC features in conjunction with an unsupervised two-state hidden Markov model (HMM). -Distributions of their durations indicated that both are predictable. Furthermore, omitting 4 Hz from the HMM classifier switched both SLE sub-states from statistically deterministic to random without changing the dynamics of the SLE state. These results were generalized to 4-aminopyridine (4-AP)-induced SLEs and human seizure traces. Only during these sub-states, both excitatory and inhibitory currents coupled with the field. Where excitatory currents phase locked to a broad range of frequencies between 1 and 12 Hz, inhibitory currents dominantly phase locked at 4 Hz. We conclude that inhibition underlies the predictability of neocortical CFC-defined SLE transition sub-states.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Extrafield Activity Shifts the Place Field Center of Mass to Encode Aversive Experience</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/6/2/ENEURO.0423-17.2019?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Hippocampal place cells are known to have a key role in encoding spatial information. Aversive stimuli, such as predator odor, evoke place field remapping and a change in preferred firing locations. However, it remains unclear how place cells use positive or negative experiences to remap. We investigated whether CA1 place cells, recorded from behaving rats, remap randomly or whether their reconfiguration depends on the perceived location of the aversive stimulus. Exposure to trimethylthiazoline (TMT; an innately aversive odor), increased the amplitude of hippocampal β oscillations in the two arms of the maze in which TMT exposure occurred. We found that a population of place cells with fields located outside the TMT arms increased their activity (extrafield spiking) in the TMT arms during the aversive episodes. Moreover, in the subsequent post-TMT recording, these cells exhibited a significant shift in their center of mass (COM) towards the TMT arms. The induction of extrafield plasticity was mediated by the basolateral amygdala complex (BLA). Photostimulation of the BLA triggered aversive behavior, synchronized hippocampal local field oscillations, and increased the extrafield spiking of the hippocampal place cells for the first 100 ms after light delivery. Optogenetic BLA activation triggered an increase in extrafield spiking activity that was correlated with the degree of place field plasticity. Furthermore, BLA-mediated increase of the extrafield activity predicts the degree of subsequent field plasticity. Our findings demonstrate that that the remapping of hippocampal place cells during aversive episodes is not random but it depends on the location of the aversive stimulus.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Echoes of Emotions Past: How Neuromodulators Determine What We Recollect</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/6/2/ENEURO.0108-18.2019?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;We tend to re-live emotional experiences more richly in memory than more mundane experiences. According to one recent neurocognitive model of emotional memory, negative events may be encoded with a larger amount of sensory information than neutral and positive events. As a result, there may be more perceptual information available to reconstruct these events at retrieval, leading to memory reinstatement patterns that correspond with greater memory vividness and sense of recollection for negative events. In this commentary, we offer an alternative perspective on how emotion may influence such sensory cortex reinstatement that focuses on engagement of the noradrenergic (NE) and dopaminergic (DA) systems rather than valence. Specifically, we propose that arousal-related locus coeruleus-norepinephrine (LC-NE) system activation promotes the prioritization of the most salient features of an emotional experience in memory. Thus, a select few details may drive lower-level sensory cortical activity and a stronger sense of recollection for arousing events. By contrast, states of high behavioral activation, including novelty-seeking and exploration, may recruit the DA system to broaden the scope of cognitive processing and integrate multiple event aspects in memory. These more integrated memory representations may be reflected in higher-order cortical reinstatement at retrieval. Thus, the balance between activation in these neuromodulatory systems at encoding, rather than the valence of the event, may ultimately determine the quality of emotional memory recollection and neural reinstatement.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Growing evidence from Alzheimer disease supports a potentially beneficial role of slow‐wave sleep in neurodegeneration. However, the importance of slow‐wave sleep in Parkinson disease is unknown. In 129 patients with Parkinson disease, we retrospectively tested whether sleep slow waves, objectively quantified with polysomnography, relate to longitudinal changes in Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale motor scores. We found that higher accumulated power of sleep slow waves was associated with slower motor progression, particularly of axial motor symptoms, over a mean time of 4.6 ± 2.3 years. This preliminary finding suggests that deeper sleep relates to slower motor progression in Parkinson disease. Ann Neurol 2019&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: Neuronal apolipoprotein E4 increases cell death and phosphorylated tau release in alzheimer disease</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25455?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The apolipoprotein E (&lt;i&gt;APOE&lt;/i&gt;) E4 isoform is the strongest genetic risk factor for sporadic Alzheimer disease (AD). Although &lt;i&gt;APOE&lt;/i&gt; is predominantly expressed by astrocytes in the central nervous system, neuronal expression of &lt;i&gt;APOE&lt;/i&gt; is of increasing interest in age‐related cognitive impairment, neurological injury, and neurodegeneration. Here, we show that endogenous expression of E4 in stem‐cell–derived neurons predisposes them to injury and promotes the release of phosphorylated tau.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Induced pluripotent stem cells from 2 unrelated AD patients carrying the E4 allele were corrected to the E3/E3 genotype with the CRISPR/Cas9 system and differentiated into pure cultures of forebrain excitatory neurons without contamination from other cells types.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compared to unedited E4 neurons, E3 neurons were less susceptible to ionomycin‐induced cytotoxicity. Biochemically, E4 cells exhibited increased tau phosphorylation and ERK1/2 phosphoactivation. Moreover, E4 neurons released increased amounts of phosphorylated tau extracellularly in an isoform‐dependent manner by a heparin sulfate proteoglycan–dependent mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our results demonstrate that endogenous expression of E4 by stem‐cell–derived forebrain excitatory neurons predisposes neurons to calcium dysregulation and ultimately cell death. This change is associated with increased cellular tau phosphorylation and markedly enhanced release of phosphorylated tau. Importantly, these effects are independent of glial APOE. These findings suggest that E4 accelerates spreading of tau pathology and neuron death in part by neuron‐specific, glia‐independent mechanisms. ANN NEUROL 2019&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: Seeding Variability of Different Alpha Synuclein Strains in Synucleinopathies</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25446?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Objectives&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently, the exact reasons why different α‐synucleinopathies exhibit variable pathologies and phenotypes are still unknown. A potential explanation may be the existence of distinctive α‐synuclein conformers or strains. Here, we intend to analyze the seeding activity of dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and Parkinson's disease (PD) brain‐derived α‐synuclein seeds by real‐time quaking‐induced conversion (RT‐QuIC) and to investigate the structure and morphology of the α‐synuclein aggregates generated by RT‐QuIC.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A misfolded α‐synuclein–enriched brain fraction from frontal cortex and substantia nigra pars compacta tissue, isolated by several filtration and centrifugation steps, was subjected to α‐synuclein/RT‐QuIC analysis. Our study included neuropathologically well‐characterized cases with DLB, PD, and controls (Ctrl). Biochemical and morphological analyses of RT‐QuIC products were conducted by western blot, dot blot analysis, Raman spectroscopy, atomic force microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Independently from the brain region, we observed different seeding kinetics of α‐synuclein in the RT‐QuIC in patients with DLB compared to PD and Ctrl. Biochemical characterization of the RT‐QuIC product indicated the generation of a proteinase K–resistant and fibrillary α‐synuclein species in DLB‐seeded reactions, whereas PD and control seeds failed in the conversion of wild‐type α‐synuclein substrate.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Structural variances of α‐synuclein seeding kinetics and products in DLB and PD indicated, for the first time, the existence of different α‐synuclein strains in these groups. Therefore, our study contributes to a better understanding of the clinical heterogeneity among α‐synucleinopathies, offers an opportunity for a specific diagnosis, and opens new avenues for the future development of strain‐specific therapies.

specific effects (neuromodulatory effects), and rTMS is inducing an electric
field in the tissue circumstantially via Faraday's law. Both nonlinear
modalities of electromagnetic stimulation may affect the levels of
physiological complexity in the brain. We also compare the changes of
complexity in electroencephalogram (EEG) and electrocardiogram (ECG), as
potential future predictors of therapy outcome.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;I provide numerical evidence for the robustness of the Griffiths phase (GP)
reported previously in dynamical threshold model simulations on a large human
brain network with N=836733 connected nodes. The model, with equalized network
sensitivity, is extended in two ways: introduction of refractory states or by
randomized time dependent thresholds. The non-universal power-law dynamics in
an extended control parameter region survives these modifications for a short
refractory state and weak disorder. In case of temporal disorder the GP shrinks
and for stronger heterogeneity disappears, leaving behind a mean-field type of
critical transition. Activity avalanche size distributions below the critical
point decay faster than in the original model, but the addition of inhibitory
interactions sets it back to the range of experimental values.

We propose that such an approach has value, both in communicating the dynamic nature of biological processes and in generating new insights and hypotheses that can be tested by artists and scientists.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Immune activated T lymphocytes modulate the activity of key metabolic pathways to support the transcriptional reprograming and reshaping of cell proteomes that permits effector T cell differentiation. The present study uses high resolution mass spectrometry and metabolic labelling to explore how murine T cells control the methionine cycle to produce methyl donors for protein and nucleotide methylations. We show that antigen receptor engagement controls flux through the methionine cycle and RNA and histone methylations. We establish that the main rate limiting step for protein synthesis and the methionine cycle is control of methionine transporter expression. Only T cells that respond to antigen to upregulate and sustain methionine transport are supplied with methyl donors that permit the dynamic nucleotide methylations and epigenetic reprogramming that drives T cell differentiation. These data highlight how the regulation of methionine transport licenses use of methionine for multiple fundamental processes that drive T lymphocyte proliferation and differentiation.</content:encoded>

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/43994</link>
	<content:encoded>The contribution of sensory and decisional processes to perceptual decision making is still unclear, even in simple perceptual tasks. When decision makers need to select an action from a set of balanced alternatives, any tendency to choose one alternative more often—choice bias—is consistent with a bias in the sensory evidence, but also with a preference to select that alternative independently of the sensory evidence. To decouple sensory from decisional biases, here we asked humans to perform a simple perceptual discrimination task with two symmetric alternatives under two different task instructions. The instructions varied the response mapping between perception and the category of the alternatives. We found that from 32 participants, 30 exhibited sensory biases and 15 decisional biases. The decisional biases were consistent with a criterion change in a simple signal detection theory model. Perceptual decision making, thus, even in simple scenarios, is affected by sensory and decisional choice biases.</content:encoded>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Inverted Encoding Models Reconstruct an Arbitrary Model Response, Not the Stimulus</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/6/2/ENEURO.0363-18.2019?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Probing how large populations of neurons represent stimuli is key to understanding sensory representations as many stimulus characteristics can only be discerned from population activity and not from individual single-units. Recently, inverted encoding models have been used to produce channel response functions from large spatial-scale measurements of human brain activity that are reminiscent of single-unit tuning functions and have been proposed to assay &quot;population-level stimulus representations&quot; (Sprague et al., 2018a). However, these channel response functions do not assay population tuning. We show by derivation that the channel response function is only determined up to an invertible linear transform. Thus, these channel response functions are arbitrary, one of an infinite family and therefore not a unique description of population representation. Indeed, simulations demonstrate that bimodal, even random, channel basis functions can account perfectly well for population responses without any underlying neural response units that are so tuned. However, the approach can be salvaged by extending it to reconstruct the stimulus, not the assumed model. We show that when this is done, even using bimodal and random channel basis functions, a unimodal function peaking at the appropriate value of the stimulus is recovered which can be interpreted as a measure of population selectivity. More precisely, the recovered function signifies how likely any value of the stimulus is, given the observed population response. Whether an analysis is recovering the hypothetical responses of an arbitrary model rather than assessing the selectivity of population representations is not an issue unique to the inverted encoding model and human neuroscience, but a general problem that must be confronted as more complex analyses intervene between measurement of population activity and presentation of data.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Plasticity of NMDA Receptors at Ventral Hippocampal Synapses in the Infralimbic Cortex Regulates Cued Fear</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/6/2/ENEURO.0354-18.2019?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) processes contextual information from the hippocampus to generate appropriate fear responses. In rodents, one path for sending contextual information to the mPFC is via the direct projections from the ventral hippocampus (vHC) to the infralimbic cortex (IL). Plasticity in the synaptic communication from the vHC to the IL could contribute to the behavioral changes produced by the acquisition and extinction of conditioned fear. To examine this possibility, we used optogenetic stimulation of vHC synapses in brain slices from trained rats. We found that fear acquisition reduced NMDA receptor (NMDAR) currents at vHC synapses onto IL pyramidal neurons. The depression of NMDAR currents reversed more efficiently after extinction in the conditioning context than extinction in a novel context. Moreover, a cohort of animals that exhibited poor extinction retrieval failed to reverse the plasticity induced by fear conditioning. In addition, ex vivo application of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), which is known to simulate extinction in IL, reversed this conditioning-induced plasticity mimicking extinction. Therefore, we have identified a novel mechanism that modulates conditioned fear via changes in NMDAR current at vHC synapses onto IL pyramidal neurons. Disruption of this mechanism could contribute to the abnormal contextual modulation of fear seen in posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/6/2/ENEURO.0341-18.2019?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Multisensory effects are found when the input from single senses combines, and this has been well researched in the brain. Presently, we examined in humans the potential impact of visuo-proprioceptive interactions at the peripheral level, using microneurography, and compared it with a similar behavioral task. We used a paradigm where participants had either proprioceptive information only (no vision) or combined visual and proprioceptive signals (vision). We moved the foot to measure changes in the sensitivity of single muscle afferents, which can be altered by the descending fusimotor drive. Visual information interacted with proprioceptive information, where we found that for the same passive movement, the response of muscle afferents increased when the proprioceptive channel was the only source of information, as compared with when visual cues were added, regardless of the attentional level. Behaviorally, when participants looked at their foot moving, they more accurately judged differences between movement amplitudes, than in the absence of visual cues. These results impact our understanding of multisensory interactions throughout the nervous system, where the information from different senses can modify the sensitivity of peripheral receptors. This has clinical implications, where future strategies may modulate such visual signals during sensorimotor rehabilitation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>eNeuro current issue: Choice-Related Activity during Visual Slant Discrimination in Macaque CIP But Not V3A</title>
	<link>http://eneuro.org//cgi/content/short/6/2/ENEURO.0248-18.2019?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>Abstract
&lt;p&gt;Creating three-dimensional (3D) representations of the world from two-dimensional retinal images is fundamental to visually guided behaviors including reaching and grasping. A critical component of this process is determining the 3D orientation of objects. Previous studies have shown that neurons in the caudal intraparietal area (CIP) of the macaque monkey represent 3D planar surface orientation (i.e., slant and tilt). Here we compare the responses of neurons in areas V3A (which is implicated in 3D visual processing and precedes CIP in the visual hierarchy) and CIP to 3D-oriented planar surfaces. We then examine whether activity in these areas correlates with perception during a fine slant discrimination task in which the monkeys report if the top of a surface is slanted toward or away from them. Although we find that V3A and CIP neurons show similar sensitivity to planar surface orientation, significant choice-related activity during the slant discrimination task is rare in V3A but prominent in CIP. These results implicate both V3A and CIP in the representation of 3D surface orientation, and suggest a functional dissociation between the areas based on slant-related choice signals.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>Marine Synechococcus, a globally important group of cyanobacteria, thrives in various light niches in part due to its varied photosynthetic light-harvesting pigments. Many Synechococcus strains use a process known as chromatic acclimation to optimize the ratio of two chromophores, green-light–absorbing phycoerythrobilin (PEB) and blue-light–absorbing phycourobilin (PUB), within their light-harvesting complexes....&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/pnas/UJrK/~4/znKJG1CsXf4&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To understand the safety, putaminal coverage, and enzyme expression of adeno‐associated viral vector serotype‐2 encoding the complementary DNA for the enzyme, aromatic L‐amino acid decarboxylase (VY‐AADC01), delivered using novel intraoperative monitoring to optimize delivery.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fifteen subjects (three cohorts of 5) with moderately advanced Parkinson's disease and medically refractory motor fluctuations received VY‐AADC01 bilaterally coadministered with gadoteridol to the putamen using intraoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) guidance to visualize the anatomic spread of the infusate and calculate coverage. Cohort 1 received 8.3 × 10&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;vg/ml and ≤450 μl per putamen (total dose, ≤7.5 × 10&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;vg); cohort 2 received the same concentration (8.3 × 10&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;vg/ml) and ≤900 μl per putamen (total dose, ≤1.5 × 10&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;vg); and cohort 3 received 2.6 × 10&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;vg/ml and ≤900 μl per putamen (total dose, ≤4.7 × 10&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;vg). (18)F‐fluoro‐L‐dihydroxyphenylalanine positron emission tomography (PET) at baseline and 6 months postprocedure assessed enzyme activity; standard assessments measured clinical outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MRI‐guided administration of ascending VY‐AADC01 doses resulted in putaminal coverage of 21% (cohort 1), 34% (cohort 2), and 42% (cohort 3). Cohorts 1, 2, and 3 showed corresponding increases in enzyme activity assessed by PET of 13%, 56%, and 79%, and reductions in antiparkinsonian medication of –15%, –33%, and –42%, respectively, at 6 months. At 12 months, there were dose‐related improvements in clinical outcomes, including increases in patient‐reported ON‐time without troublesome dyskinesia (1.6, 3.3, and 1.5 hours, respectively) and quality of life.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Novel intraoperative monitoring of administration facilitated targeted delivery of VY‐AADC01 in this phase 1 study, which was well tolerated. Increases in enzyme expression and clinical improvements were dose dependent.&lt;/p&gt;

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1903.10446</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Visual object recognition is not a trivial task, especially when the objects
are degraded or surrounded by clutter or presented briefly. External cues (such
as verbal cues or visual context) can boost recognition performance in such
conditions. In this work, we build an artificial neural network to model the
interaction between the object processing stream (OPS) and the cue. We study
the effects of varying neural and representational capacities of the OPS on the
performance boost provided by cue-driven feature-based feedback in the OPS. We
observe that the feedback provides performance boosts only if the
category-specific features about the objects cannot be fully represented in the
OPS. This representational limit is more dependent on task demands than neural
capacity. We also observe that the feedback scheme trained to maximise
recognition performance boost is not the same as tuning-based feedback, and
actually performs better than tuning-based feedback.

	<title>q-bio.NC updates on arXiv.org: Comparative study of training intensity in neurofeedback. (arXiv:1903.10425v1 [q-bio.NC])</title>
	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1903.10425</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Neurofeedback has proved to be useful in many instances. This technique is
often used to address both medical issues and performance improvement. Despite
the wide range of applications, no consensus has been reached about the optimal
training schedule.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this work, a practical experiment was conducted aiming to compare the
effects of intensive and sparse training modalities of enhancement of the
individual upper alpha band at Fz, for working memory improvement, in 19
healthy subjects. The INTENSIVE group was submitted to 4 sessions of 37.5
minutes each, during consecutive days, while the SPARSE group performed 15
sessions of 25 minutes along approximately 2 months.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The intensive modality proved to be significantly more effective in
increasing the target frequency at Fz within session. However, no significant
differences were found across sessions neither regarding cognitive
improvements. The distinction between learners and non-learners led to
significant results for the two groups across sessions, but only the learners
of the INTENSIVE group show significant changes within session. Besides, for
this subsample the effects in the INTENSIVE group are significantly stronger
both within and across sessions.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results suggest that longer sessions with shorter trials and more breaks
could be advantageous when training healthy subjects. Although further
investigation is needed to establish if one modality outperforms the other,
better outcomes might be obtained if each session consists in many short trials
(in this case 30 seconds) and is performed on consecutive days.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Human brains are arguably the most complex entities known. Composed of
billions of neurons, connected via a highly detailed structure where the
underlying method by which functionality occurs is still debated. Here we
consider one theory for neural coding, synchronization coding, which gives rise
to the highest possible number of discrete states that a brain could exist in.
A strict upper bound on the number of these states is determined. We conclude
that the theoretical upper limit on the capacity of one human brain is almost
inconceivably large and massively larger than the corresponding theoretical
limit that could be obtained using every transistor ever built.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1903.10327</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The output signal is examined for the Jacobi neuronal model which is
characterized by input-dependent multiplicative noise. The dependence of the
noise on the rate of inhibition turns out to be of primary importance to
observe maxima both in the output firing rate and in the diffusion coefficient
of the spike count and, simultaneously, a minimum in the coefficient of
variation (Fano factor). Moreover, we observe that an increment of the rate of
inhibition can increase the degree of coherence computed from the power
spectrum. This means that inhibition can enhance the coherence and thus the
information transmission between the input and the output in this neuronal
model. Finally, we stress that the firing rate, the coefficient of variation
and the diffusion coefficient of the spike count cannot be used as the only
indicator of coherence resonance without considering the power spectrum.

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The last decades saw dramatic progress in brain research. These advances were
often buttressed by probing single variables to make circumscribed discoveries,
typically through null hypothesis significance testing. New ways for generating
massive data fueled tension between the traditional methodology, used to infer
statistically relevant effects in carefully-chosen variables, and
pattern-learning algorithms, used to identify predictive signatures by
searching through abundant information. In this article, we detail the
antagonistic philosophies behind two quantitative approaches: certifying robust
effects in understandable variables, and evaluating how accurately a built
model can forecast future outcomes. We discourage choosing analysis tools via
categories like 'statistics' or 'machine learning'. Rather, to establish
reproducible knowledge about the brain, we advocate prioritizing tools in view
of the core motivation of each quantitative analysis: aiming towards
mechanistic insight, or optimizing predictive accuracy.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1903.10131</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Decision-making in dynamic environments typically requires adaptive evidence
accumulation that weights new evidence more heavily than old observations.
Recent experimental studies of dynamic decision tasks require subjects to make
decisions for which the correct choice switches stochastically throughout a
single trial. In such cases, an ideal observer's belief is described by an
evolution equation that is doubly stochastic, reflecting stochasticity in the
both observations and environmental changes. In these contexts, we show that
the probability density of the belief can be represented using differential
Chapman-Kolmogorov equations, allowing efficient computation of ensemble
statistics. This allows us to reliably compare normative models to
near-normative approximations using, as model performance metrics, decision
response accuracy and Kullback-Leibler divergence of the belief distributions.
Such belief distributions could be obtained empirically from subjects by asking
them to report their decision confidence. We also study how response accuracy
is affected by additional internal noise, showing optimality requires longer
integration timescales as more noise is added. Lastly, we demonstrate that our
method can be applied to tasks in which evidence arrives in a discrete,
pulsatile fashion, rather than continuously.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1903.10120</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A model simulating transport of dense core vesicles (DCVs) in type II axonal
terminals of Drosophila motoneurons has been developed. An interesting feature
of the morphology of type II terminals is the large number of en passant
boutons. The lack of both scaled up DCV transport and scaled down DCV capture
in boutons results in a less efficient supply of DCVs to distal boutons.
Furthermore, the large number of boutons that DCVs pass as they move
anterogradely, until they reach the most distal bouton, may lead to the capture
of a majority of DCVs before they turn around in the most distal bouton to move
in the retrograde direction. This may lead to a reduced retrograde flux of DCVs
and a lack of DCV circulation in type II terminals. The developed model
simulates DCV concentrations in boutons, DCV fluxes between the boutons, age
density distributions of DCVs, and the mean age of DCVs in various boutons.

	<link>http://arxiv.org/abs/1903.09710</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Found in varied contexts from neurons to ants to fish, binary decision-making
is one of the simplest forms of collective computation. In this process,
information collected by individuals about an uncertain environment is
accumulated to guide behavior at the aggregate scale. We study binary
decision-making dynamics in networks responding to inputs with small
signal-to-noise ratios, looking for quantitative measures of collectivity that
control decision-making performance. We find that decision accuracy is
controlled largely by three factors: the leading eigenvalue of the network
adjacency matrix, the corresponding eigenvector's participation ratio, and
distance from the corresponding symmetry-breaking bifurcation. This allows us
to predict how decision-making performance scales in large networks based on
their spectral properties. Specifically, we explore the effects of localization
caused by the hierarchical assortative structure of a &quot;rich club&quot; topology.
This gives insight into the tradeoffs involved in the higher-order structure
found in living networks performing collective computations.

conduction velocity is a highly adaptive parameter in the adult central nervous

Changes of 1-2 (ms) in network mean signal transmission time resulted in
substantial network oscillation frequency changes ranging in 0-120 (Hz). Our

	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/43996</link>
	<content:encoded>SOX2 positive pituitary stem cells (PSCs) are specified embryonically and persist throughout life, giving rise to all pituitary endocrine lineages. We have previously shown the activation of the STK/LATS/YAP/TAZ signalling cascade in the developing and postnatal mammalian pituitary. Here, we investigate the function of this pathway during pituitary development and in the regulation of the SOX2 cell compartment. Through loss- and gain-of-function genetic approaches, we reveal that restricting YAP/TAZ activation during development is essential for normal organ size and specification from SOX2+ PSCs. Postnatal deletion of LATS kinases and subsequent upregulation of YAP/TAZ leads to uncontrolled clonal expansion of the SOX2+ PSCs and disruption of their differentiation, causing the formation of non-secreting, aggressive pituitary tumours. In contrast, sustained expression of YAP alone results in expansion of SOX2+ PSCs capable of differentiation and devoid of tumourigenic potential. Our findings identify the LATS/YAP/TAZ signalling cascade as an essential component of PSC regulation in normal pituitary physiology and tumourigenesis.</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>ATP synthase produces the majority of cellular energy in most cells. We have previously reported cryo-EM maps of autoinhibited &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; ATP synthase imaged without addition of nucleotide (Sobti et al. 2016), indicating that the subunit ε engages the α, β and γ subunits to lock the enzyme and prevent functional rotation. Here we present multiple cryo-EM reconstructions of the enzyme frozen after the addition of MgATP to identify the changes that occur when this ε inhibition is removed. The maps generated show that, after exposure to MgATP, &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; ATP synthase adopts a different conformation with a catalytic subunit changing conformation substantially and the ε C-terminal domain transitioning via an intermediate 'half-up' state to a condensed 'down' state. This work provides direct evidence for unique conformational states that occur in &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; ATP synthase when ATP binding prevents the ε C-terminal domain from entering the inhibitory 'up' state.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: latest articles: Neurotransmitter identity is acquired in a lineage-restricted manner in the Drosophila CNS</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/43701</link>
	<content:encoded>The vast majority of the adult fly ventral nerve cord is composed of 34 hemilineages, which are clusters of lineally related neurons. Neurons in these hemilineages use one of the three fast-acting neurotransmitters (acetylcholine, GABA, or glutamate) for communication. We generated a comprehensive neurotransmitter usage map for the entire ventral nerve cord. We did not find any cases of neurons using more than one neurotransmitter, but found that the acetylcholine specific gene ChAT is transcribed in many glutamatergic and GABAergic neurons, but these transcripts typically do not leave the nucleus and are not translated. Importantly, our work uncovered a simple rule: All neurons within a hemilineage use the same neurotransmitter. Thus, neurotransmitter identity is acquired at the stem cell level. Our detailed transmitter- usage/lineage identity map will be a great resource for studying the developmental basis of behavior and deciphering how neuronal circuits function to regulate behavior.</content:encoded>

	<title>eLife: latest articles: Flura-seq identifies organ-specific metabolic adaptations during early metastatic colonization</title>
	<link>https://elifesciences.org/articles/43627</link>
	<content:encoded>Metastasis-initiating cells dynamically adapt to the distinct microenvironments of different organs, but these early adaptations are poorly understood due to the limited sensitivity of in situ transcriptomics. We developed fluorouracil-labeled RNA sequencing (Flura-seq) for in situ analysis with high sensitivity. Flura-seq utilizes cytosine deaminase (CD) to convert fluorocytosine to fluorouracil, metabolically labeling nascent RNA in rare cell populations in situ for purification and sequencing. Flura-seq revealed hundreds of unique, dynamic organ-specific gene signatures depending on the microenvironment in mouse xenograft breast cancer micrometastases. Specifically, the mitochondrial electron transport Complex I, oxidative stress and counteracting antioxidant programs were induced in pulmonary micrometastases, compared to mammary tumors or brain micrometastases. We confirmed lung metastasis-specific increase in oxidative stress and upregulation of antioxidants in clinical samples, thus validating Flura-seq’s utility in identifying clinically actionable microenvironmental adaptations in early metastasis. The sensitivity, robustness and economy of Flura-seq are broadly applicable beyond cancer research.</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Searching algorithm for Type IV effector proteins (S4TE) 2.0: Improved tools for Type IV effector prediction, analysis and comparison in proteobacteria</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/7Yst9Q81psQ/article</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Christophe Noroy, Thierry Lefrançois, Damien F. Meyer&lt;/p&gt;

Bacterial pathogens have evolved numerous strategies to corrupt, hijack or mimic cellular processes in order to survive and proliferate. Among those strategies, Type IV effectors (T4Es) are proteins secreted by pathogenic bacteria to manipulate host cell processes during infection. They are delivered into eukaryotic cells in an ATP-dependent manner via the type IV secretion system, a specialized multiprotein complex. T4Es contain a wide spectrum of features including eukaryotic-like domains, localization signals or a C-terminal translocation signal. A combination of these features enables prediction of T4Es in a given bacterial genome. In this study, we developed a web-based comprehensive suite of tools with a user-friendly graphical interface. This version 2.0 of S4TE (Searching Algorithm for Type IV Effector Proteins; http://sate.cirad.fr) enables accurate prediction and comparison of T4Es. Search parameters and threshold can be customized by the user to work with any genome sequence, whether publicly available or not. Applications range from characterizing effector features and identifying potential T4Es to analyzing the effectors based on the genome G+C composition and local gene density. S4TE 2.0 allows the comparison of putative T4E repertoires of up to four bacterial strains at the same time. The software identifies T4E orthologs among strains and provides a Venn diagram and lists of genes for each intersection. New interactive features offer the best visualization of the location of candidate T4Es and hyperlinks to NCBI and Pfam databases. S4TE 2.0 is designed to evolve rapidly with the publication of new experimentally validated T4Es, which will reinforce the predictive power of the algorithm. The computational methodology can be used to identify a wide spectrum of candidate bacterial effectors that lack sequence conservation but have similar amino acid characteristics. This approach will provide very valuable information about bacterial host-specificity and virulence factors and help identify host targets for the development of new anti-bacterial molecules.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/7Yst9Q81psQ&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Scalable nonlinear programming framework for parameter estimation in dynamic biological system models</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/2RRPK3RGZV4/article</link>

We present a nonlinear programming (NLP) framework for the scalable solution of parameter estimation problems that arise in dynamic modeling of biological systems. Such problems are computationally challenging because they often involve highly nonlinear and stiff differential equations as well as many experimental data sets and parameters. The proposed framework uses cutting-edge modeling and solution tools which are computationally efficient, robust, and easy-to-use. Specifically, our framework uses a time discretization approach that: i) avoids repetitive simulations of the dynamic model, ii) enables fully algebraic model implementations and computation of derivatives, and iii) enables the use of computationally efficient nonlinear interior point solvers that exploit sparse and structured linear algebra techniques. We demonstrate these capabilities by solving estimation problems for synthetic human gut microbiome community models. We show that an instance with 156 parameters, 144 differential equations, and 1,704 experimental data points can be solved in less than 3 minutes using our proposed framework (while an off-the-shelf simulation-based solution framework requires over 7 hours). We also create large instances to show that the proposed framework is scalable and can solve problems with up to 2,352 parameters, 2,304 differential equations, and 20,352 data points in less than 15 minutes. The proposed framework is flexible and easy-to-use, can be broadly applied to dynamic models of biological systems, and enables the implementation of sophisticated estimation techniques to quantify parameter uncertainty, to diagnose observability/uniqueness issues, to perform model selection, and to handle outliers.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/2RRPK3RGZV4&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A reliable biomarker is needed for accurate and early differentiation between Parkinson disease and the various forms of atypical parkinsonism. We used a novel real‐time quaking‐induced conversion (RT‐QuIC) assay to detect α‐synuclein (α‐syn) aggregates in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of 118 patients with parkinsonism of uncertain clinical etiology and 52 controls. Diagnostic accuracy to distinguish α‐synucleinopathies from non–α‐synucleinopathies and controls was 84% (sensitivity = 75%, specificity = 94%, area under the curve = 0.84, 95% confidence interval = 0.78–0.91, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.0001, positive predictive value = 93%). CSF α‐syn RT‐QuIC could be a useful diagnostic tool to help clinicians differentiate α‐synucleinopathies from other forms of parkinsonism when the clinical picture is uncertain.

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: Rapid interpretation of small-angle X-ray scattering data</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/169K0P5rCZY/article</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Marie Weiel, Ines Reinartz, Alexander Schug&lt;/p&gt;

The fundamental aim of structural analyses in biophysics is to reveal a mutual relation between a molecule’s dynamic structure and its physiological function. Small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) is an experimental technique for structural characterization of macromolecules in solution and enables time-resolved analysis of conformational changes under physiological conditions. As such experiments measure spatially averaged low-resolution scattering intensities only, the sparse information obtained is not sufficient to uniquely reconstruct a three-dimensional atomistic model. Here, we integrate the information from SAXS into molecular dynamics simulations using computationally efficient native structure-based models. Dynamically fitting an initial structure towards a scattering intensity, such simulations produce atomistic models in agreement with the target data. In this way, SAXS data can be rapidly interpreted while retaining physico-chemical knowledge and sampling power of the underlying force field. We demonstrate our method’s performance using the example of three protein systems. Simulations are faster than full molecular dynamics approaches by more than two orders of magnitude and consistently achieve comparable accuracy. Computational demands are reduced sufficiently to run the simulations on commodity desktop computers instead of high-performance computing systems. These results underline that scattering-guided structure-based simulations provide a suitable framework for rapid early-stage refinement of structures towards SAXS data with particular focus on minimal computational resources and time.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/169K0P5rCZY&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Phosphomannomutase deficiency (PMM2 congenital disorder of glycosylation [PMM2‐CDG]) causes cerebellar syndrome and strokelike episodes (SLEs). SLEs are also described in patients with gain‐of‐function mutations in the CaV2.1 channel, for which acetazolamide therapy is suggested. Impairment in N‐glycosylation of CaV2.1 promotes gain‐of‐function effects and may participate in cerebellar syndrome in PMM2‐CDG. AZATAX was designed to establish whether acetazolamide is safe and improves cerebellar syndrome in PMM2‐CDG.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A clinical trial included PMM2‐CDG patients, with a 6‐month first‐phase single acetazolamide therapy group, followed by a randomized 5‐week withdrawal phase. Safety was assessed. The primary outcome measure was improvement in the International Cooperative Ataxia Rating Scale (ICARS). Other measures were the Nijmegen Pediatric CDG Rating Scale (NPCRS), a syllable repetition test (PATA test), and cognitive scores.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Twenty‐four patients (mean age = 12.3 ± 4.5 years) were included, showing no serious adverse events. Thirteen patients required dose adjustment due to low bicarbonate or asthenia. There were improvements on ICARS (34.9 ± 23.2 vs 40.7 ± 24.8, effect size = 1.48, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 4.0–7.6, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001), detected at 6 weeks in 18 patients among the 20 responders, on NPCRS (95% CI = 0.3–1.6, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.013) and on the PATA test (95% CI = 0.5–3.0, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.006). Acetazolamide improved prothrombin time, factor X, and antithrombin. Clinical severity, epilepsy, and lipodystrophy predicted greater response. The randomized withdrawal phase showed ICARS worsening in the withdrawal group (effect size = 1.46, 95% CI = 2.65–7.52, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.001).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AZATAX is the first clinical trial of PMM2‐CDG. Acetazolamide is well tolerated and effective for motor cerebellar syndrome. Its ability to prevent SLEs and its long‐term effects on kidney function should be addressed in future studies. ANN NEUROL 2019&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: Metabolic patterns across core features in dementia with lewy bodies</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25453?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To identify brain regions whose metabolic impairment contributes to dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) clinical core features expression and to assess the influence of severity of global cognitive impairment on the DLB hypometabolic pattern.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brain fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography and information on core features were available in 171 patients belonging to the imaging repository of the European DLB Consortium. Principal component analysis was applied to identify brain regions relevant to the local data variance. A linear regression model was applied to generate core‐feature–specific patterns controlling for the main confounding variables (Mini‐Mental State Examination [MMSE], age, education, gender, and center). Regression analysis to the locally normalized intensities was performed to generate an MMSE‐sensitive map.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parkinsonism negatively covaried with bilateral parietal, precuneus, and anterior cingulate metabolism; visual hallucinations (VH) with bilateral dorsolateral–frontal cortex, posterior cingulate, and parietal metabolism; and rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (RBD) with bilateral parieto‐occipital cortex, precuneus, and ventrolateral–frontal metabolism. VH and RBD shared a positive covariance with metabolism in the medial temporal lobe, cerebellum, brainstem, basal ganglia, thalami, and orbitofrontal and sensorimotor cortex. Cognitive fluctuations negatively covaried with occipital metabolism and positively with parietal lobe metabolism. MMSE positively covaried with metabolism in the left superior frontal gyrus, bilateral–parietal cortex, and left precuneus, and negatively with metabolism in the insula, medial frontal gyrus, hippocampus in the left hemisphere, and right cerebellum.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regions of more preserved metabolism are relatively consistent across the variegate DLB spectrum. By contrast, core features were associated with more prominent hypometabolism in specific regions, thus suggesting a close clinical–imaging correlation, reflecting the interplay between topography of neurodegeneration and clinical presentation in DLB patients.

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: Actininopathy – a new muscular dystrophy caused by ACTN2 dominant mutations</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25470?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To clinically and pathologically characterize a cohort of patients presenting with a novel form of distal myopathy and to identify the genetic cause of this new muscular dystrophy.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We studied four families (three from Spain and one from Sweden) suffering from an autosomal dominant distal myopathy. Affected members showed adult‐onset asymmetric distal muscle weakness with initial involvement of ankle dorsiflexion later progressing also to proximal limb muscles.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In all three Spanish families, we identified a unique missense variant in the &lt;i&gt;ACTN2&lt;/i&gt; gene co‐segregating with the disease. The affected members of the Swedish family carry a different &lt;i&gt;ACTN2&lt;/i&gt; missense variant.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;ACTN2&lt;/i&gt; encodes for alpha actinin2 that is highly expressed in the sarcomeric Z‐disk with a major structural and functional role. Actininopathy is thus a new genetically determined distal myopathy.&lt;/p&gt;

	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhz044/5420731?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Recent research indicates the hippocampus may code the distance to the goal during navigation of newly learned environments. It is unclear however, whether this also pertains to highly familiar environments where extensive systems-level consolidation is thought to have transformed mnemonic representations. Here we recorded fMRI while University College London and Imperial College London students navigated virtual simulations of their own familiar campus (&amp;gt;2 years of exposure) and the other campus learned days before scanning. Posterior hippocampal activity tracked the distance to the goal in the newly learned campus, as well as in familiar environments when the future route contained many turns. By contrast retrosplenial cortex only tracked the distance to the goal in the familiar campus. All of these responses were abolished when participants were guided to their goal by external cues. These results open new avenues of research on navigation and consolidation of spatial information and underscore the notion that the hippocampus continues to play a role in navigation when detailed processing of the environment is needed for navigation.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>PLOS Computational Biology: New Articles: ChIPulate: A comprehensive ChIP-seq simulation pipeline</title>
	<link>http://feeds.plos.org/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~3/lVS1HwZ6VPM/article</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;by Vishaka Datta, Sridhar Hannenhalli, Rahul Siddharthan&lt;/p&gt;

ChIP-seq (Chromatin Immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing) is a high-throughput technique to identify genomic regions that are bound &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; by a particular protein, e.g., a transcription factor (TF). Biological factors, such as chromatin state, indirect and cooperative binding, as well as experimental factors, such as antibody quality, cross-linking, and PCR biases, are known to affect the outcome of ChIP-seq experiments. However, the relative impact of these factors on inferences made from ChIP-seq data is not entirely clear. Here, via a detailed ChIP-seq simulation pipeline, ChIPulate, we assess the impact of various biological and experimental sources of variation on several outcomes of a ChIP-seq experiment, viz., the recoverability of the TF binding motif, accuracy of TF-DNA binding detection, the sensitivity of inferred TF-DNA binding strength, and number of replicates needed to confidently infer binding strength. We find that the TF motif can be recovered despite poor and non-uniform extraction and PCR amplification efficiencies. The recovery of the motif is, however, affected to a larger extent by the fraction of sites that are either cooperatively or indirectly bound. Importantly, our simulations reveal that the number of ChIP-seq replicates needed to accurately measure &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt; occupancy at high-affinity sites is larger than the recommended community standards. Our results establish statistical limits on the accuracy of inferences of protein-DNA binding from ChIP-seq and suggest that increasing the mean extraction efficiency, rather than amplification efficiency, would better improve sensitivity. The source code and instructions for running ChIPulate can be found at https://github.com/vishakad/chipulate.&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; src=&quot;http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ploscompbiol/NewArticles/~4/lVS1HwZ6VPM&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; /&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Circuit Dysfunction in SOD1-ALS Model First Detected in Sensory Feedback Prior to Motor Neuron Degeneration Is Alleviated by BMP Signaling</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/12/2347?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a devastating neurodegenerative disease for which the origin and underlying cellular defects are not fully understood. Although motor neuron degeneration is the signature feature of ALS, it is not clear whether motor neurons or other cells of the motor circuit are the site of disease initiation. To better understand the contribution of multiple cell types in ALS, we made use of a &lt;i&gt;Drosophila Sod1&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;G85R&lt;/sup&gt; knock-in model, in which all cells harbor the disease allele. End-stage &lt;i&gt;dSod1&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;G85R&lt;/sup&gt; animals of both sexes exhibit severe motor deficits with clear degeneration of motor neurons. Interestingly, earlier in &lt;i&gt;dSod1&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;G85R&lt;/sup&gt; larvae, motor function is also compromised, but their motor neurons exhibit only subtle morphological and electrophysiological changes that are unlikely to cause the observed decrease in locomotion. We analyzed the intact motor circuit and identified a defect in sensory feedback that likely accounts for the altered motor activity of &lt;i&gt;dSod1&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;G85R&lt;/sup&gt;. We found cell-autonomous activation of bone morphogenetic protein signaling in proprioceptor sensory neurons which are critical for the relay of the contractile status of muscles back to the central nerve cord, completely rescues early-stage motor defects and partially rescue late-stage motor function to extend lifespan. Identification of a defect in sensory feedback as a potential initiating event in ALS motor dysfunction, coupled with the ability of modified proprioceptors to alleviate such motor deficits, underscores the critical role that nonmotor neurons play in disease progression and highlights their potential as a site to identify early-stage ALS biomarkers and for therapeutic intervention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; At diagnosis, many cellular processes are already disrupted in the amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) patient. Identifying the initiating cellular events is critical for achieving an earlier diagnosis to slow or prevent disease progression. Our findings indicate that neurons relaying sensory information underlie early stage motor deficits in a &lt;i&gt;Drosophila&lt;/i&gt; knock-in model of ALS that best replicates gene dosage in familial ALS (fALS). Importantly, studies on intact motor circuits revealed defects in sensory feedback before evidence of motor neuron degeneration. These findings strengthen our understanding of how neural circuit dysfunctions lead to neurodegeneration and, coupled with our demonstration that the activation of bone morphogenetic protein signaling in proprioceptors alleviates both early and late motor dysfunction, underscores the importance of considering nonmotor neurons as therapeutic targets.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Regulatory T Cells and Their Derived Cytokine, Interleukin-35, Reduce Pain in Experimental Autoimmune Encephalomyelitis</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/12/2326?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Sensory problems such as neuropathic pain are common and debilitating symptoms in multiple sclerosis (MS), an autoimmune inflammatory disorder of the CNS. Regulatory T (Treg) cells are critical for maintaining immune homeostasis, but their role in MS-associated pain remains unknown. Here, we demonstrate that Treg cell ablation is sufficient to trigger experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) and facial allodynia in immunized female mice. In EAE-induced female mice, adoptive transfer of Treg cells and spinal delivery of the Treg cell cytokine interleukin-35 (IL-35) significantly reduced facial stimulus-evoked pain and spontaneous pain independent of disease severity and increased myelination of the facial nociceptive pathway. The effects of intrathecal IL-35 therapy were Treg-cell dependent and associated with upregulated IL-10 expression in CNS-infiltrating lymphocytes and reduced monocyte infiltration in the trigeminal afferent pathway. We present evidence for a beneficial role of Treg cells and IL-35 in attenuating pain associated with EAE independently of motor symptoms by decreasing neuroinflammation and increasing myelination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Pain is a highly prevalent symptom affecting the majority of multiple sclerosis (MS) patients and dramatically affects overall health-related quality of life; however, this is a research area that has been largely ignored. Here, we identify for the first time a role for regulatory T (Treg) cells and interleukin-35 (IL-35) in suppressing facial allodynia and facial grimacing in animals with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). We demonstrate that spinal delivery of Treg cells and IL-35 reduces pain associated with EAE by decreasing neuroinflammation and increasing myelination independently of motor symptoms. These findings increase our understanding of the mechanisms underlying pain in EAE and suggest potential treatment strategies for pain relief in MS.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Optogenetic Stimulation of the Superior Colliculus Confers Retinal Neuroprotection in a Mouse Glaucoma Model</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/12/2313?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Glaucoma is characterized by a progressive loss of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) in the eye, which ultimately results in visual impairment or even blindness. Because current therapies often fail to halt disease progression, there is an unmet need for novel neuroprotective therapies to support RGC survival. Various research lines suggest that visual target centers in the brain support RGC functioning and survival. Here, we explored whether increasing neuronal activity in one of these projection areas could improve survival of RGCs in a mouse glaucoma model. Prolonged activation of an important murine RGC target area, the superior colliculus (SC), was established via a novel optogenetic stimulation paradigm. By leveraging the unique channel kinetics of the stabilized step function opsin (SSFO), protracted stimulation of the SC was achieved with only a brief light pulse. SSFO-mediated collicular stimulation was confirmed by immunohistochemistry for the immediate-early gene c-Fos and behavioral tracking, which both demonstrated consistent neuronal activity upon repeated stimulation. Finally, the neuroprotective potential of optogenetic collicular stimulation was investigated in mice of either sex subjected to a glaucoma model and a 63% reduction in RGC loss was found. This work describes a new paradigm for optogenetic collicular stimulation and a first demonstration that increasing target neuron activity can increase survival of the projecting neurons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; Despite glaucoma being a leading cause of blindness and visual impairment worldwide, no curative therapies exist. This study describes a novel paradigm to reduce retinal ganglion cell (RGC) degeneration underlying glaucoma. Building on previous observations that RGC survival is supported by the target neurons to which they project and using an innovative optogenetic approach, we increased neuronal activity in the mouse superior colliculus, a main projection target of rodent RGCs. This proved to be efficient in reducing RGC loss in a glaucoma model. Our findings establish a new optogenetic paradigm for target stimulation and encourage further exploration of the molecular signaling pathways mediating retrograde neuroprotective communication.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Journal of Neuroscience current issue: Distinct Neural Mechanisms of Spatial Attention and Expectation Guide Perceptual Inference in a Multisensory World</title>
	<link>http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/short/39/12/2301?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Spatial attention (i.e., task-relevance) and expectation (i.e., signal probability) are two critical top-down mechanisms guiding perceptual inference. Spatial attention prioritizes processing of information at task-relevant locations. Spatial expectations encode the statistical structure of the environment. An unresolved question is how the brain allocates attention and forms expectations in a multisensory environment, where task-relevance and signal probability over space can differ across sensory modalities. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging in human participants (female and male) to investigate whether the brain encodes task-relevance and signal probability over space separately or interactively across sensory modalities. In a novel multisensory paradigm, we manipulated spatial attention and expectation selectively in audition and assessed their effects on behavioral and neural responses to auditory and visual stimuli. Our results show that both auditory and visual stimuli increased activations in a right-lateralized frontoparietal system, when they were presented at locations that were task-irrelevant in audition. Yet, only auditory stimuli increased activations in the medial prefrontal cortex when presented at expected locations and in audiovisual and frontoparietal cortices signaling a prediction error when presented at unexpected locations. This dissociation in multisensory generalization for attention and expectation effects shows that the brain controls attentional resources interactively across the senses but encodes the statistical structure of the environment as spatial expectations independently for each sensory system. Our results demonstrate that spatial attention and expectation engage partly overlapping neural systems via distinct mechanisms to guide perceptual inference in a multisensory world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT&lt;/b&gt; In our natural environment the brain is exposed to a constant influx of signals through all our senses. How does the brain allocate attention and form spatial expectations in this multisensory environment? Because observers need to respond to stimuli regardless of their sensory modality, they may allocate attentional resources and encode the probability of events jointly across the senses. This psychophysics and neuroimaging study shows that the brain controls attentional resources interactively across the senses via a frontoparietal system but encodes the statistical structure of the environment independently for each sense in sensory and frontoparietal areas. Thus, spatial attention and expectation engage partly overlapping neural systems via distinct mechanisms to guide perceptual inference in a multisensory world.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

	<link>https://www.cell.com/neuron/fulltext/S0896-6273(19)30215-6?rss=yes</link>
	<content:encoded>With this issue of Neuron, we continue our series of special issues on neurological disease. This series highlights the efforts to understand the pathophysiology of disease, improve diagnosis, and ultimately alter clinical course. In the first installment of our series, we discussed various translational approaches to develop treatments for disorders of the nervous system. Understanding the mechanisms mediating disease is a crucial step toward finding cures, and in this issue, we present articles that evaluate the neural mechanisms underlying epilepsy, pain, neurodegeneration, and neurodevelopmental disorders.</content:encoded>

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: Rethinking interhemispheric imbalance as a target for stroke neurorehabilitation</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25452?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patients with chronic stroke have been shown to have failure to release interhemispheric inhibition (IHI) from the intact to the damaged hemisphere before movement execution (premovement IHI). This inhibitory imbalance was found to correlate with poor motor performance in the chronic stage after stroke and has since become a target for therapeutic interventions. The logic of this approach, however, implies that abnormal premovement IHI is causal to poor behavioral outcome and should therefore be present early after stroke when motor impairment is at its worst. To test this idea, in a longitudinal study, we investigated interhemispheric interactions by tracking patients’ premovement IHI for one year following stroke.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We assessed premovement IHI and motor behavior five times over a 1‐year period after ischemic stroke in 22 patients and 11 healthy participants.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We found that premovement IHI was normal during the acute/subacute period and only became abnormal at the chronic stage; specifically, release of IHI in movement preparation worsened as motor behavior improved. In addition, premovement IHI did not correlate with behavioral measures cross‐sectionally, whereas the longitudinal emergence of abnormal premovement IHI from the acute to the chronic stage was inversely correlated with recovery of finger individuation.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These results suggest that interhemispheric imbalance is not a cause of poor motor recovery, but instead might be the consequence of underlying recovery processes. These findings call into question the rehabilitation strategy of attempting to rebalance interhemispheric interactions in order to improve motor recovery after stroke.

	<title>Wiley: Annals of Neurology: Table of Contents: A case–control–family study of idiopathic rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder</title>
	<link>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ana.25435?af=R</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Objective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To determine the familial aggregation of idiopathic rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (iRBD), neurodegenerative diseases, and related biomarkers.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Methods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A total of 404 and 387 first‐degree relatives of 102 patients with iRBD and of 89 controls were recruited, respectively. Among them, 204 and 208 relatives of patients and controls underwent face‐to‐face clinical assessment, whereas 97 and 75 relatives underwent further video‐polysomnographic assessment, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compared with relatives of controls, relatives of patients demonstrated higher levels of RBD features, including chin tonic electromyography activity (mean = 1.5 ± 7.5 vs 0.3 ± 1.0, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.04) and behavioral events (n [weighted %] = 12 [11.3] vs 2 [1.9], adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] = 7.69, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.54–33.33, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.009) during rapid eye movement sleep, probable diagnosis (n [%] = 57 [14.9] vs 20 [4.9], aHR = 3.45, 95% CI = 1.96–6.25, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; 0.001), and definite diagnosis (n [weighted %] = 10 [8.4] vs 2 [1.4], aHR = 5.56, 95% CI = 1.16–25.00, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.03). They also had higher risks of Parkinson disease (3.1% vs 0.5%, aHR = 5.88, 95% CI = 1.37–25.00, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.02), dementia (6.9% vs 2.6%, aHR = 2.44, 95% CI = 1.15–5.26, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.02), constipation (8.3% vs 2.4%, adjusted odds ratio = 4.21, 95% CI = 1.34–13.17, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.01), and motor dysfunction (Movement Disorders Society Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale part III motor score, mean = 1.9 ± 3.2 vs 0.9 ± 2.3, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.002). The unaffected relatives of patients demonstrated a higher likelihood ratio of prodromal Parkinson disease (median [interquartile range] = 0.27 [1.19] vs 0.22 [0.51], &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.03).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;iRBD is familially aggregated from isolated features to full‐blown sleep disorder. Relatives of patients carry a higher risk of alpha‐synucleinopathy in terms of neurodegenerative diseases and prodromal markers, suggesting a familial aggregation and staging pathology of alpha‐synucleinopathy.

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Thalamic Inputs to Posterior Parietal Cortical Areas Involved in Skilled Forelimb Movement and Tool Use in the Capuchin Monkey</title>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhz051/5393226?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;The posterior parietal cortex (PPC) is a central hub for the primate forebrain networks that control skilled manual behavior, including tool use. Here, we quantified and compared the sources of thalamic input to electrophysiologically-identified hand/forearm-related regions of several PPC areas, namely areas 5v, AIP, PFG, and PF, of the capuchin monkey (&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Sapajus&lt;/span&gt; sp). We found that these areas receive most of their thalamic connections from the Anterior Pulvinar (PuA), Lateral Posterior (LP) and Medial Pulvinar (PuM) nuclei. Each PPC area receives a specific combination of projections from these nuclei, and fewer additional projections from other nuclei. Moreover, retrograde labeling of the cells innervating different PPC areas revealed substantial intermingling of these cells within the thalamus. Differences in thalamic input may contribute to the different functional properties displayed by the PPC areas. Furthermore, the observed innervation of functionally-related PPC domains from partly intermingled thalamic cell populations accords with the notion that higher-order thalamic inputs may dynamically regulate functional connectivity between cortical areas.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Switching From Fear to No Fear by Different Neural Ensembles in Mouse Retrosplenial Cortex</title>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhz050/5389575?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Fear extinction is generally considered a form of new learning that inhibits previously acquired fear memories. Here, by tracking immediate early gene expression in vivo, we found that contextual fear extinction training evoked distinct neural ensembles in mouse retrosplenial cortex (RSC). The optogenetic reactivation of these extinction-activated neurons in the RSC was sufficient to suppress a fear response, while the reactivation of conditioning-activated neurons in the same area promoted a fear response. The generation of such an extinction-memory-related neural ensemble was associated with adult neurogenesis, as abolishing newborn neurons in the adult hippocampus via X-ray irradiation eliminated both the extinction-activated neurons in the RSC and the optogenetic-reactivation-induced suppression of contextual fear memory. Therefore, switching from fear to no fear in response to the same context is modulated by the RSC through an extinction-activated neural ensemble, the generation of which might require adult neurogenesis in the hippocampus.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: Neurostimulation Reveals Context-Dependent Arbitration Between Model-Based and Model-Free Reinforcement Learning</title>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhz019/5389729?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;While it is established that humans use model-based (MB) and model-free (MF) reinforcement learning in a complementary fashion, much less is known about how the brain determines which of these systems should control behavior at any given moment. Here we provide causal evidence for a neural mechanism that acts as a context-dependent arbitrator between both systems. We applied excitatory and inhibitory transcranial direct current stimulation over a region of the left ventrolateral prefrontal cortex previously found to encode the reliability of both learning systems. The opposing neural interventions resulted in a bidirectional shift of control between MB and MF learning. Stimulation also affected the sensitivity of the arbitration mechanism itself, as it changed how often subjects switched between the dominant system over time. Both of these effects depended on varying task contexts that either favored MB or MF control, indicating that this arbitration mechanism is not context-invariant but flexibly incorporates information about current environmental demands.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: The Role of Redox Dysregulation in the Effects of Prenatal Stress on Embryonic Interneuron Migration</title>

	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Maternal stress during pregnancy is associated with increased risk of psychiatric disorders in offspring, but embryonic brain mechanisms disrupted by prenatal stress are not fully understood. Our lab has shown that prenatal stress delays inhibitory neural progenitor migration. Here, we investigated redox dysregulation as a mechanism for embryonic cortical interneuron migration delay, utilizing direct manipulation of pro- and antioxidants and a mouse model of maternal repetitive restraint stress starting on embryonic day 12. Time-lapse, live-imaging of migrating GAD67GFP+ interneurons showed that normal tangential migration of inhibitory progenitor cells was disrupted by the pro-oxidant, hydrogen peroxide. Interneuron migration was also delayed by in utero intracerebroventricular rotenone. Prenatal stress altered glutathione levels and induced changes in activity of antioxidant enzymes and expression of redox-related genes in the embryonic forebrain. Assessment of dihydroethidium (DHE) fluorescence after prenatal stress in ganglionic eminence (GE), the source of migrating interneurons, showed increased levels of DHE oxidation. Maternal antioxidants (&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;N&lt;/span&gt;-acetylcysteine and astaxanthin) normalized DHE oxidation levels in GE and ameliorated the migration delay caused by prenatal stress. Through convergent redox manipula-tions, delayed interneuron migration after prenatal stress was found to critically involve redox dysregulation. Redox biology during prenatal periods may be a target for protecting brain development.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Hyperpolarization-activated cation channels are involved, among other functions, in learning and memory, control of synaptic transmission and epileptogenesis. The importance of the HCN1 and HCN2 isoforms for brain function has been demonstrated, while the role of HCN4, the third major neuronal HCN subunit, is not known. Here we show that HCN4 is essential for oscillatory activity in the thalamocortical (TC) network. HCN4 is selectively expressed in various thalamic nuclei, excluding the thalamic reticular nucleus. HCN4-deficient TC neurons revealed a massive reduction of &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Ih&lt;/span&gt; and strongly reduced intrinsic burst firing, whereas the current was normal in cortical pyramidal neurons. In addition, evoked bursting in a thalamic slice preparation was strongly reduced in the mutant mice probes. HCN4-deficiency also significantly slowed down thalamic and cortical oscillations during active wakefulness. Taken together, these results establish that thalamic HCN4 channels are essential for the production of rhythmic intrathalamic oscillations and determine regular TC oscillatory activity during alert states.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;We previously observed an association between mode of delivery and brain mitochondrial mechanisms in pups. We also showed that mitochondrial processes impact adult behavior. However, no experimental data is available to causally connect mode of delivery with cellular processes of neurons in the cerebral cortex and adult behavior. Here we show that surgical delivery of pups alters mitochondrial dynamics and spine synapses of layer 3 pyramidal neurons of the prefrontal cortex compared to the values of mice delivered vaginally. These alterations in ultrastructure seen in adult mice delivered surgically were associated with the development of behavioral phenotypes resembling those characteristic of animal models of psychiatric illness. This included impaired performance in prepulse inhibition as well as hyperlocomotion in the open field and elevated plus maze tests. Knocking out a mitochondria-related gene, UCP-2, blocked cellular and behavioral adaptations induced by surgical delivery. These results highlight a crucial role for brain mitochondrial adaptations in the process of birth to affect neuronal circuitry in support of normal and altered adult behaviors. Further, these findings were supported with neuroimaging data from human neonates delivered vaginally and surgically, suggesting that the murine findings have human clinical relevance.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;The ability to perceive and exercise control over an outcome is both desirable and beneficial to our well-being. It has been shown that animals and humans alike exhibit behavioral bias towards seeking control and that such bias recruits the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) and striatum. Yet, this bias remains to be quantitatively captured and studied neurally. Here, we employed a behavioral task to measure the preference for control and characterize its neural underpinnings. Participants made a series of binary choices between having control and no-control over a game for monetary reward. The mere presence of the control option evoked activity in the ventral striatum. Importantly, we manipulated the expected value (EV) of each choice pair to extract the pairing where participants were equally likely to choose either option. The difference in EV between the options at this point of equivalence was inferred as the subjective value of control. Strikingly, perceiving control inflated the reward value of the associated option by 30% and this value inflation was tracked by the vmPFC. Altogether, these results capture the subjective value of perceived control inherent in decision making and highlight the role of corticostriatal circuitry in the perception of control.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Individuals with Down syndrome (DS) show high inter-subject variability in cognitive ability and have an ultra-high risk of developing dementia (90% lifetime prevalence). Elucidating factors underlying variability in cognitive function can inform us about intellectual disability (ID) and may improve our understanding of factors associated with later cognitive decline. Increased neuronal inhibition has been posited to contribute to ID in DS. Combining electroencephalography (EEG) with dynamic causal modeling (DCM) provides a non-invasive method for investigating excitatory/inhibitory mechanisms. Resting-state EEG recordings were obtained from 36 adults with DS with no evidence of cognitive decline. Theta–alpha activity (4–13 Hz) was characterized in relation to general cognitive ability (raw Kaufmann’s Brief Intelligence Test second Edition (KBIT-2) score). Higher KBIT-2 was associated with higher frontal alpha peak amplitude and higher theta–alpha band power across distributed regions. Modeling this association with DCM revealed intrinsic self-inhibition was the key network parameter underlying observed differences in 4–13 Hz power in relation to KBIT-2 and age. In particular, intrinsic self-inhibition in right V1 was negatively correlated with KBIT-2. Results suggest intrinsic self-inhibition within the alpha network is associated with individual differences in cognitive ability in adults with DS, and may provide a potential therapeutic target for cognitive enhancement.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Advance Access: When Conflict Cannot be Avoided: Relative Contributions of Early Selection and Frontal Executive Control in Mitigating Stroop Conflict</title>
	<link>https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhz042/5382203?rss=1</link>
	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;When viewing familiar stimuli (e.g., common words), processing is highly automatized such that it can interfere with the processing of incompatible sensory information. At least two mechanisms may help mitigate this interference. Early selection accounts posit that attentional processes filter out distracting sensory information to avoid conflict. Alternatively, late selection accounts hold that all sensory inputs receive full semantic analysis and that frontal executive mechanisms are recruited to resolve conflict. To test how these mechanisms operate to overcome conflict induced by highly automatized processing, we developed a novel version of the color-word Stroop task, where targets and distractors were simultaneously flickered at different frequencies. We measured the quality of early sensory processing by assessing the amplitude of steady-state visually evoked potentials (SSVEPs) elicited by targets and distractors. We also indexed frontal executive processes by assessing changes in frontal theta oscillations induced by color-word incongruency. We found that target- and distractor-related SSVEPs were not modulated by changes in the level of conflict whereas frontal theta activity increased on high compared to low conflict trials. These results suggest that frontal executive processes play a more dominant role in mitigating cognitive interference driven by the automatic tendency to process highly familiar stimuli.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;The calcium-regulated phosphodiesterase 1 (PDE1) family is highly expressed in the brain, but its functional role in neurones is poorly understood. Using the selective PDE1 inhibitor Lu AF64196 and biosensors for cyclic nucleotides including a novel biosensor for cGMP, we analyzed the effect of PDE1 on cAMP and cGMP in individual neurones in brain slices from male newborn mice. Release of caged NMDA triggered a transient increase of intracellular calcium, which was associated with a decrease in cAMP and cGMP in medium spiny neurones in the striatum. Lu AF64196 alone did not increase neuronal cyclic nucleotide levels, but blocked the NMDA-induced reduction in cyclic nucleotides indicating that this was mediated by calcium-activated PDE1. Similar effects were observed in the prefrontal cortex and the hippocampus. Upon corelease of dopamine and NMDA, PDE1 was shown to down-regulate the D&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-receptor mediated increase in cAMP. PDE1 inhibition increased long-term potentiation in rat ventral striatum, showing that PDE1 is implicated in the regulation of synaptic plasticity. Overall, our results show that PDE1 reduces cyclic nucleotide signaling in the context of glutamate and dopamine coincidence. This effect could have a therapeutic value for treating brain disorders related to dysfunctions in dopamine neuromodulation.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

We analyzed single unit activity from 136 cells localized within layer V of cytoarchitectonic areas 6iffu and that part of 4δ within the ventral bank of the cruciate sulcus while cats walked on a treadmill and stepped over an obstacle that advanced toward them. We found a rich variety of discharge patterns, ranging from limb-independent cells that discharged several steps in front of the obstacle to step-related cells that discharged either during steps over the obstacle or in the steps leading up to that step. We propose that this population of task-related cells within this region of the PMC contributes to the temporal evolution of a planning process that transforms global information of the presence of an obstacle into the precise spatio-temporal limb adjustment required to negotiate that obstacle.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Cerebral Cortex Open Access: No Evidence that Predictions and Attention Modulate the First Feedforward Sweep of Cortical Information Processing</title>

	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Predictive coding models propose that predictions (stimulus likelihood) reduce sensory signals as early as primary visual cortex (V1), and that attention (stimulus relevance) can modulate these effects. Indeed, both prediction and attention have been shown to modulate V1 activity, albeit with fMRI, which has low temporal resolution. This leaves it unclear whether these effects reflect a modulation of the first feedforward sweep of visual information processing and/or later, feedback-related activity. In two experiments, we used electroencephalography and orthogonally manipulated spatial predictions and attention to address this issue. Although clear top-down biases were found, as reflected in pre-stimulus alpha-band activity, we found no evidence for top-down effects on the earliest visual cortical processing stage (&amp;lt;80 ms post-stimulus), as indexed by the amplitude of the C1 event-related potential component and multivariate pattern analyses. These findings indicate that initial visual afferent activity may be impenetrable to top-down influences by spatial prediction and attention.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Brain energy metabolism actively regulates synaptic transmission and activity. We have previously shown that acute footshock (FS)-stress induces fast and long-lasting functional and morphological changes at excitatory synapses in prefrontal cortex (PFC). Here, we asked whether FS-stress increased energy metabolism in PFC, and modified related cognitive functions. Using positron emission tomography (PET), we found that FS-stress induced a redistribution of glucose metabolism in the brain, with relative decrease of [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]FDG uptake in ventro-caudal regions and increase in dorso-rostral ones. Absolute [&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;F]FDG uptake was inversely correlated with serum corticosterone. Increased specific hexokinase activity was also measured in purified PFC synaptosomes (but not in total extract) of FS-stressed rats, which positively correlated with 2-Deoxy [&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;H] glucose uptake by synaptosomes. In line with increased synaptic energy demand, using an electron microscopy-based stereological approach, we found that acute stress induced a redistribution of mitochondria at excitatory synapses, together with an increase in their volume. The fast functional and metabolic activation of PFC induced by acute stress, was accompanied by rapid and sustained alterations of working memory performance in delayed response to T-maze test. Taken together, the present data suggest that acute stress increases energy consumption at PFC synaptic terminals and alters working memory.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

Herein, we hypothesized that premature birth and non-maternal care of preterm newborns might disrupt neurobehavioral function, hippocampal dendritic arborization, and dendritic spine density. Additionally, we assessed whether 17β-estradiol (E2) replacement or the TrkB receptor agonist, 7,8-dihydroxyflavone (DHF), would reverse compromised dendritic development and cognitive function in preterm newborns. These hypotheses were tested by comparing preterm (E28.5) rabbit kits cared and gavage-fed by laboratory personnel and term-kits reared and breast-fed by their mother doe at an equivalent postconceptional age. Neurobehavioral tests showed that both premature-birth and formula-feeding with non-maternal care led to increased anxiety behavior, poor social interaction, and lack of novelty preference compared with term-kits. Dendritic branching and number of total or mushroom dendritic spines were reduced in the CA1 field of preterm-kits compared with term controls. While CDC42 and Rac1/2/3 expression levels were lower, RhoA-activity was higher in preterm-kits compared with term controls. Both E2 and DHF treatment reversed prematurity-induced reduction in spine density, reduced total RhoA-GTPase levels, and enhanced cognitive function. Hence, prematurity and non-maternal care result in cognitive deficits, and reduced dendritic arbors and spines in CA1. E2 replacement or DHF treatment might reverse changes in dendritic spines and improve neurodevelopment in premature infants.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<content:encoded>&lt;span class=&quot;paragraphSection&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;boxTitle&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/div&gt;Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is a neurodevelopmental disorder caused by mutations in the &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;FMR1&lt;/span&gt; gene. It is a leading monogenic cause of autism spectrum disorder and inherited intellectual disability and is often comorbid with attention deficits. Most FXS cases are due to an expansion of CGG repeats leading to suppressed expression of fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP), an RNA-binding protein involved in mRNA metabolism. We found that the previously published &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Fmr1&lt;/span&gt; knockout rat model of FXS expresses an &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Fmr1&lt;/span&gt; transcript with an in-frame deletion of exon 8, which encodes for the K-homology (KH) RNA-binding domain, KH1. Notably, 3 pathogenic missense mutations associated with FXS lie in the KH domains. We observed that the deletion of exon 8 in rats leads to attention deficits and to alterations in transcriptional profiles within the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), which map to 2 weighted gene coexpression network modules. These modules are conserved in human frontal cortex and enriched for known FMRP targets. Hub genes in these modules represent potential therapeutic targets for FXS. Taken together, these findings indicate that attentional testing might be a reliable cross-species tool for investigating FXS and identify dysregulated conserved gene networks in a relevant brain region.&lt;/span&gt;</content:encoded>

	<title>Trends in Neurosciences: Time for What? Breaking Down Temporal Anticipation</title>
	<link>https://www.cell.com/trends/neurosciences/fulltext/S0166-2236(19)30026-8?rss=yes</link>
	<content:encoded>A variety of environmental regularities enable us to anticipate the timing of upcoming sensations and actions. A recent article (Breska and Ivry, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2018;115:12283–12288) reports a striking neural double dissociation between two distinct varieties of temporal anticipation. Looking forward, we consider further dissociations according to the goals for which temporal anticipation is used.</content:encoded>
